1971.70-161,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,53.788,"We will hear arguments next in 70-161, Richardson against Wright and 5211, Wright against Richardson."
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,56.817,62.604,Good afternoon Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-161,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,269.397,284.529,"Well, excuse me Mr. Gray, may I ask, do I understand that the Secretary has now adopted the procedures and required States to adopt procedures which rather provide most of the requirements of Goldberg?"
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,284.529,287.539,"No sir, Mr. Justice Brennan, that is not quite the case."
1971.70-161,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,298.553,301.118,I am not going as far as were they applicable to Goldberg?
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,301.118,310.695,Not going as far as the holding of the District Court nor as far as the cross appellants would like the Secretary to go.
1971.70-161,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,310.695,317.764,"No, but how do I compare with the requirements in Goldberg on termination of welfare?"
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,317.764,320.299,They would not go as far I do Your Honor.
1971.70-161,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,320.299,322.466,Where would it -- in what respect would they go for?
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,322.466,328.095,They would go -- let me tell you perhaps Your Honor right at this point in time what they would do.
1971.70-161,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,365.939,370.342,"Meanwhile, continuing the payment of benefits?"
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,370.342,370.861,Yes.
1971.70-161,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,393.962,396.079,"I did not mean to interrupt you, would you complete?"
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,396.079,396.849,Yes sir.
1971.70-161,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,396.849,400.569,"Mr. Gray, let me follow through at this point if I may."
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,410.597,413.763,"Yes sir, I was about to tell you that right now Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1971.70-161,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,474.485,475.822,"Now, that is a notice --"
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,475.822,477.345,"Yes sir, timely notice --"
1971.70-161,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,477.345,480.34,And an opportunity to protest?
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,480.34,481.191,That is right.
1971.70-161,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,481.191,482.428,In what form?
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,482.428,486.008,In the form of written submissions.
1971.70-161,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,486.008,487.713,And -- but no hearing?
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,487.713,489.182,No hearing Mr. Justice Brennan.
1971.70-161,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,489.182,493.841,And the written submissions of course are considered by whom?
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,493.841,495.317,They are considered right up the line.
1971.70-161,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,508.1,526.465,"Therefore, I gather, unlike what is required before termination of welfare, an opportunity for a hearing before is not an impartial at least more or less independent --"
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,526.465,527.339,We do not --
1971.70-161,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,527.339,533.976,"-- under the operation here. Here I guess he gets a notice and a chance to protest in writing and that is the end of it, is it?"
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,533.976,540.815,"Well, he gets a -- in our regulations too he also gets a second chance at that same State Agency level."
1971.70-161,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,550.107,550.968,To do what?
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,550.968,555.517,"To do the same thing, file a written submission, but the extent of his relief there, Your Honor in fact is a --"
1971.70-161,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,555.517,560.955,"But in any effect his case is decided on the basis of what he submits in writing without a hearing, would that be your --"
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,560.955,561.596,That is correct.
1971.70-161,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,561.596,562.055,Yeah.
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,562.055,562.389,That is correct.
1971.70-161,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,570.931,572.35,"Yes, but he does not get (Voice Overlap)."
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,579.833,586.397,"Let me say that he gets no opportunity but I think Your Honor, he gets no opportunity in a legal sense as we lawyers understand it."
1971.70-161,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,638.97,644.099,(Voice Overlap) should be.
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,657.388,660.447,Not the times that we mentioned Your Honor in our supplemental brief.
1971.70-161,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,660.447,661.106,Yes.
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,661.106,667.237,But other things were done with which of course are -- they are in my statement of facts that --
1971.70-161,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,667.237,673.731,"I want to be sure that I have it clear, they would get more now than they did not get at the time they were processed?"
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,673.731,674.4,That is correct.
1971.70-161,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,674.4,676.349,Under the Secretary’s regulation?
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,676.349,677.366,That is correct too.
1971.70-161,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,677.366,680.087,Independent of the District Court?
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,680.087,699.592,"But the Secretary -- I think it must be the -- it must be stated Mr. Chief Justice if the new regulation of the Secretary, appearing in our supplemental brief, was developed and published as a result of a portion of the opinion of the Three-Judge Court below sir."
1971.70-161,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,699.592,706.959,"Mr. Gray, you said that when they submit their written statement, it goes right up to the line?"
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,706.959,707.659,Yes sir because of the part --
1971.70-161,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,707.659,710.237,Is that the same line it went up the (Inaudible)?
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,710.237,712.649,It comes a part of the claimant’s folder and it goes --
1971.70-161,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,712.649,719.383,"Well, I mean if there is no difference to what happened before except you got this one statement from the claimant."
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,719.383,721.033,That is correct Mr. Justice Marshall.
1971.70-161,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,721.101,726.264,And the claimant does not know what happens to any one of those steps?
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,726.264,746.042,"I do not think that the -- that statement can be made Mr. Justice Marshall because in these types of cases, unlike other cases the claimant either goes to work, his work activity, he holds in his hands a control, his work activity, generates activity --"
1971.70-161,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,746.042,747.23,If he is able.
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,747.23,752.802,"Or his improved -- yes sir, or in the improvement in his physical condition."
1971.70-161,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,759.57,765.863,But does he know what this person said about him?
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,765.863,768.277,I do not think that he would know what this person said about him.
1971.70-161,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,768.277,769.575,Or any other person?
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,769.575,769.973,No sir.
1971.70-161,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,773.194,781.131,"Well, he had never finds out within that documentary that goes up the line?"
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,781.131,796.72,"I would say that you are correct, Mr. Justice Marshall, in that he does not look at it, but what I said before in the response to a question of Mr. Justice Brennan and I think if Secretary Richardson were here, he would say it, that if that claimant walked into that State Agency with his attorney, he would get it."
1971.70-161,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,796.72,803.639,"I agree with you fully, but really you know Secretary Richardson (Voice Overlap) in all his offices. (Voice Overlap)"
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,803.639,806.7,I know but that does not mean (Voice Overlap).
1971.70-161,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,810.453,819.008,I assume that too and I also assume that a fair judge and a fair jury will do well but we still have a hearing?
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,819.008,823.745,"Oh, I know in some cases you do for certain reasons which do not exist in these cases Your Honor."
1971.70-161,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,823.745,826.318,Why cannot you give a hearing (Inaudible)?
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,826.318,847.943,We feel that there is no over palling individual private reason to hold a hearing here that is so great that it necessarily must override in our system of jurisprudence of governmental function representing the interest of so many people that are at stake in the administration of this program.
1971.70-161,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,847.943,856.038,"Mr. Gray, are you finding comfort in the Java case of last term and the other one, was it Perales?"
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,856.038,861.009,"Perales, -- I find that, I find comfort in both cases."
1971.70-161,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,900.712,906.832,"Well, actually, the Secretary’s position is not very different than it was in Perales."
1971.70-161,0,24856,gray,,913.79,916.656,"Well, I think that is certainly is true."
1971.70-161,1,40463,robert_n_sayler,,1669.448,1671.593,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-161,2,24856,gray,,1994.246,1995.87,"Not at all, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1971.70-161,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2087.428,2105.821,"I suppose the balancing factor that would fit under what you just referred to in relation to Cafeteria Workers case, would be the amounts that are paid out in disability payments to people for periods after they have become ineligible."
1971.70-161,3,40463,robert_n_sayler,,2114.503,2114.751,Yes.
1971.70-161,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2204.751,2211.267,"Is your estimate a million dollars for the whole United States, for the personnel necessary, the expense necessary that --"
1971.70-161,3,40463,robert_n_sayler,,2211.267,2220.978,We have computed this on the basis Your Honor as the government had computed it on the basis of payments that would be made to recipients in the interim as distinguished from undertaking any computation --
1971.70-161,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2220.978,2226.181,"But I was thinking that geographical areas, is that for the District of Columbia or the whole United States?"
1971.70-161,3,40463,robert_n_sayler,,2226.181,2226.932,No.
1971.70-161,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2242.105,2249.655,"Your suggestion is that you could have the machinery for the 4,000 cases could be handled for a million dollars?"
1971.70-161,3,40463,robert_n_sayler,,2249.655,2251.957,It would be considerably less than million dollars.
1971.70-161,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2263.836,2265.343,You are not talking about administrative?
1971.70-161,3,40463,robert_n_sayler,,2265.343,2265.775,That is right.
1971.70-161,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2265.775,2266.176,So I was --
1971.70-161,3,40463,robert_n_sayler,,2266.176,2267.456,The government did not undertake that show it needed.
1971.70-161,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2267.456,2268.294,"Oh, I see."
1971.70-161,3,40463,robert_n_sayler,,2288.854,2289.465,That is right.
1971.70-161,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2289.845,2291.847,(Inaudible) would it?
1971.70-161,3,40463,robert_n_sayler,,2291.847,2293.153,"I am sorry, Mr. Chief Justice."
1971.70-161,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2304.048,2325.227,"While I have you interrupted Mr. Sayler, I suppose you would agree that in some respect, this program is analogous to a private insurance contract for disability insurance, the standards I suspect are very much the same, total and permanent disability."
1971.70-161,3,40463,robert_n_sayler,,2328.836,2331.406,"To some extent, Your Honor."
1971.70-161,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2359.876,2386.215,"What happens to a policy holder in a life insurance or accident insurance is receiving total and permanent disability from let us say the Aetna or one of the other large companies and they discover that he is working full time and making 5, 6, $8,000.00 a year, what do they do to his payments ordinarily?"
1971.70-161,3,40463,robert_n_sayler,,2386.215,2388.457,In the event they determined what?
1971.70-161,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2388.457,2390.03,That he is earning a lot of money.
1971.70-161,3,40463,robert_n_sayler,,2394.399,2399.462,I would take it that would be a factor that the insurance company would take into account (Voice Overlap) take an inquiry.
1971.70-161,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2399.462,2403.517,"You will write him a letter and tell him his payments are being stopped, do they not?"
1971.70-161,3,40463,robert_n_sayler,,2403.517,2405.969,One would hope that an insurance company would do more than that.
1971.70-161,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2407.679,2426.587,"Well, I am assuming that they have found these circumstances of his earnings prior to an inquiry and perhaps sent investigators out who watch him leave in the morning and in a very large case, you probably known of them, take moving pictures of him, the man playing golf or whatever it may be."
1971.70-161,3,40463,robert_n_sayler,,2438.78,2441.075,"Your Honor, I am trying to make two points in response to that."
1971.70-161,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2474.819,2485.965,"Well, that sounds to me Mr. Sayler like a really a question of law you have here whether than the fact in question requiring a hearing?"
1971.70-161,3,40463,robert_n_sayler,,2485.965,2487.576,I am not sure I understand the -- the question of whether disability continues --
1971.70-161,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2487.576,2496.409,(Voice Overlap) would automatically terminates -- was it automatically terminates when it verifies earnings of a certain amount?
1971.70-161,3,40463,robert_n_sayler,,2496.409,2497.568,"Some of the cases, Your Honor."
1971.70-161,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2501.192,2503.122,Were and -- Mr. Wright’s case that was an earnings case.
1971.70-161,3,40463,robert_n_sayler,,2503.122,2504.032,That was an earnings case.
1971.70-161,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2504.032,2509.742,And you are saying that the government may not terminate just upon verification of earnings?
1971.70-161,3,40463,robert_n_sayler,,2509.742,2510.767,"That is right, Your Honor."
1971.70-161,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2510.767,2514.098,And is that a question of law or is it a factual matter for a hearing?
1971.70-161,3,40463,robert_n_sayler,,2514.098,2514.304,No.
1971.70-161,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2544.137,2551.915,"Well, I take that there was a personal interview with Mr. Wright and he verifies his earnings that he had?"
1971.70-161,3,40463,robert_n_sayler,,2551.915,2552.913,That is right.
1971.70-161,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2552.913,2556.624,And -- but nevertheless he claims he was still disabled?
1971.70-161,3,40463,robert_n_sayler,,2556.624,2560.961,"That is right and he undertook the hearing, he asked for a hearing at that point."
1971.70-161,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2560.961,2561.482,Yes.
1971.70-161,3,40463,robert_n_sayler,,2564.728,2566.061,Well.
1971.70-161,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2566.061,2570.511,Either personally in the interview or in writing afterwards.
1971.70-161,3,40463,robert_n_sayler,,2570.511,2571.133,That is right.
1971.70-161,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2571.133,2579.024,He could have give -- he could have revealed any of the circumstances which would indicate that despite his earnings he was still disabled.
1971.70-161,3,40463,robert_n_sayler,,2579.024,2579.329,Yes.
1971.70-161,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2588.325,2590.644,(Voice Overlap). He had an interview?
1971.70-161,3,40463,robert_n_sayler,,2590.644,2597.516,Had an interview with the claims representative and the government says in its brief is not qualified to make the judgments of medical disability.
1971.70-161,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2597.516,2599.229,Or he could have told him anything he wanted to?
1971.70-161,3,40463,robert_n_sayler,,2599.229,2600.308,That is right.
