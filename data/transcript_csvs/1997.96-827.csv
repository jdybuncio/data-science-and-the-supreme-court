1997.96-827,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.856,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-827, Leonard Rollon Crawford-El v. Patricia Britton."
1997.96-827,0,21566,daniel_m_schember,,10.538,14.001,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1997.96-827,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,69.138,86.92,"Well, I suppose you're right that the rules and the procedures are fully sufficient if we wish to devote a huge amount of resources to complaints of this type and to subject officials who have a claim of immunity to prolonged discovery."
1997.96-827,0,21566,daniel_m_schember,,86.92,88.65,"--That's what I'm saying, Your Honor."
1997.96-827,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,88.65,93.314,"If those two factors are eliminated, then I suppose you're quite right, the rules are quite adequate."
1997.96-827,0,21566,daniel_m_schember,,93.314,94.426,Yes.
1997.96-827,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,94.426,105.963,But the question is whether or not the cost of these proceedings to the Government official who wishes to assert the immunity are so high that the purpose of the immunity is substantially lost.
1997.96-827,0,21566,daniel_m_schember,,105.963,106.481,Yes.
1997.96-827,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,106.481,108.103,Or am I wrong that that's the question?
1997.96-827,0,21566,daniel_m_schember,,108.103,143.527,"No, that's the question, but the two burdens identified in Harlow are, first, the burdens of trial and the burdens of broad-ranging discovery, and what I'm suggesting is that at the outset of the case the district court through firm application of the rules, as the Court said should be done in Harlow, can protect defendants against broad-ranging discovery and, indeed, impose the burden on the plaintiff to come forward immediately with all evidence to support the claim, all elements of the claim, and if the plaintiff is unable to do so immediately, the defendant is entitled to summary judgment unless, of course, the plaintiff can show specific facts giving rise to a reasonable likelihood that discovery will uncover necessary evidence."
1997.96-827,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,143.527,164.862,"Mr. Schember, speaking more generally there's talk of discovery abuses not just in this case but throughout the country, and the answer often is, well, the district judges have it within their power to prevent that, and I think a lot of people agree that's true, but you have 700 district judges in the country and they just react differently to this sort of problem."
1997.96-827,0,21566,daniel_m_schember,,164.862,199.336,"Yes, and I think guidance from this Court could tell them how to firmly apply the civil rules, and the purpose of my argument is to suggest precisely what should be said in that regard, and that by holding the plaintiff's discovery in abeyance at the outset of the case until the defendant has been entitled to discover all the plaintiff's evidence, thereby placing the defendant in the position of promptly seeking summary judgment unless the plaintiff has sufficient evidence or has a basis for seeking discovery, that is firm control that prohibits excessive burden on the defendant at the outset."
1997.96-827,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,248.758,263.838,"When you're talking about intent, though, that's a very difficult issue to get summary judgment on, because it's the subjective state of someone's mind, and it's just something that ordinarily it goes to a trier of fact, I think."
1997.96-827,0,21566,daniel_m_schember,,263.838,271.644,"--Well, certainly the Harlow court commented on that with respect to the subject of general bad faith and malice."
1997.96-827,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,291.767,298.853,"It still gets you into subjective investigations, which is really what we tried to put behind us in Harlow."
1997.96-827,0,21566,daniel_m_schember,,298.853,300.333,Well--
1997.96-827,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,300.333,303.325,"I mean, we really tried to make this an objective inquiry."
1997.96-827,0,21566,daniel_m_schember,,303.325,322.667,"--Well, the Court certainly said that qualified immunity is to be based upon a showing... on the fact that a... no violation of clearly established law exists, but, of course, retaliation for exercise of First Amendment rights, or discrimination on the basis of race or sex was clearly... is clearly established constitutional law."
1997.96-827,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,322.667,331.432,That clearly established law principle was simply the device which would enable an objective determination to be made in Harlow.
1997.96-827,0,21566,daniel_m_schember,,354.238,355.728,"Well, but Justice--"
1997.96-827,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,355.728,359.05,"Given these facts, could a reasonable person have taken this action."
1997.96-827,0,21566,daniel_m_schember,,360.602,375.372,"--Yes, that certainly would do that, but that would be effectively the end of claims that are based upon the subjective intent and, if we are to eliminate entirely claims that are based upon proving the unconstitutional animus--"
1997.96-827,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,375.372,378.396,Just as in Harlow we eliminated claims that were based upon subjective intent.
1997.96-827,0,21566,daniel_m_schember,,378.396,384.508,"--General malice, but Harlow cannot be read for the proposition that First Amendment retaliation cases cannot go forward, period."
1997.96-827,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,407.903,416.4,It can surely be read as an attempt by this Court to make the section 1983 inquiry an objective inquiry rather than a subjective one.
1997.96-827,0,21566,daniel_m_schember,,419.444,420.304,"Well, that was a Bivens inquiry."
1997.96-827,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,435.273,445.32,Why... you can always make this claim that what was done was done with a... with an intent to deprive me of a constitutional right.
1997.96-827,0,21566,daniel_m_schember,,445.32,446.039,"Well, it can't always be--"
1997.96-827,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,446.039,447.451,It can't always be proven.
1997.96-827,0,21566,daniel_m_schember,,447.451,454.447,"--Well, I suppose it can always be asserted, but the firm application of the rules will ferret out baseless assertions if the assertion is baseless."
1997.96-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,454.447,473.388,"May I ask, in this case, what would happen if the trial judge let the plaintiff take the deposition of the defendant and she testified that she merely gave the materials to the brother-in-law, or whatever he was, as a matter of convenience, she knew all about his First Amendment activities, but she didn't hold a grudge against him, and that's all she said."
1997.96-827,0,21566,daniel_m_schember,,482.724,486.477,"Well, but there would be... the motion should be denied for the following reason."
1997.96-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,512.124,513.174,"Yes, but--"
1997.96-827,0,21566,daniel_m_schember,,513.174,513.796,--is not a reasonable--
1997.96-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,513.796,522.811,"--That may be her belief, but she may say with respect to the transactions at issue in this case, I did it as... purely as a matter of convenience, and even though that's my belief, I wasn't trying to discipline him."
1997.96-827,0,21566,daniel_m_schember,,524.393,529.977,"--If that were a reasonable belief, then in theory it would be a defense."
1997.96-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,550.434,550.774,This was no mistake.
1997.96-827,0,21566,daniel_m_schember,,558.489,559.139,"No, it's not."
1997.96-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,559.139,561.7,The only dispute is what her reason for doing it was.
1997.96-827,0,21566,daniel_m_schember,,561.7,570.035,"Yes, and implicit in her reason, certainly the facts indicate that she intended to deprive him totally of these papers and all of his property."
1997.96-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,580.623,583.986,You say the facts are that she intended totally to deprive him of his papers?
1997.96-827,0,21566,daniel_m_schember,,583.986,584.344,Yes.
1997.96-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,584.344,589.089,I though she merely adopted a more convenient way of getting them delivered to their destination.
1997.96-827,0,21566,daniel_m_schember,,589.089,590.111,"No, not at all."
1997.96-827,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,590.111,590.798,"Namely, sending them through the brother-in-law."
1997.96-827,0,21566,daniel_m_schember,,590.798,591.95,It was her belief... no.
1997.96-827,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,597.114,598.155,Well--
1997.96-827,0,21566,daniel_m_schember,,598.155,599.034,That was unreasonable belief.
1997.96-827,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,611.173,621.802,"--Then credibility determinations basically are going to swallow up the immunity rule, I suppose, if the summary judgment stays."
1997.96-827,0,21566,daniel_m_schember,,621.802,638.902,"Well, the plaintiff has to have admissible evidence that proves the elements of the case and yes, if it does come down to a question of whether or not the plaintiff is credible in assertings, for example, a defendant's admission that's involved here--"
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1770.231,1775.194,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-827,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1833.772,1844.019,"But isn't it true that Harlow dealt with the special problem of qualified immunity, and your position in this case, even if there's no qualified immunity defense interposed, you'd still make the same arguments."
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1844.019,1851.703,"Well, on the merits we would, but since we did interpose qualified immunity, Your Honor, there are two parts to the qualified immunity."
1997.96-827,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1851.703,1859.28,"But it seems to me the case really is about the merits, because if the defendant here did what was alleged, there really isn't a basis for qualified immunity."
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1863.791,1866.203,"I guess I disagree with that, Your Honor."
1997.96-827,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1877.981,1879.553,But if she's in good faith there's no cause of action.
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1879.553,1883.524,"--Well, but the Court said there are two parts to the good faith immunity."
1997.96-827,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1888.198,1896.774,"I understand that, but do you not agree that if she acted in good faith and did not have the motive that the plaintiff describes, there's no cause of action at all."
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1898.223,1898.734,--That is true.
1997.96-827,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1914.636,1915.097,"No, I don't think that's right."
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1928.374,1935.219,"--I think that's right, Your Honor, but there was a second part to the good faith immunity, and that is the intent."
1997.96-827,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1947.667,1948.707,Mr.--
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1948.707,1949.258,Once again--
1997.96-827,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1949.258,1954.28,"--Mr. Smith, the court of appeals certainly regarded this as a qualified immunity case, didn't it?"
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1954.28,1954.891,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1997.96-827,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1954.891,1960.835,"Justice... Judge Williams' opening sentence says, we're here to decide this issue about qualified immunity."
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1960.835,1966.448,"That's correct, and there's no doubt that, in fact, the qualified immunity defense was raised in the trial court."
1997.96-827,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1996.689,1999.33,But it isn't an intent part and a knowledge part.
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2053.466,2072.831,"They are two different things, Your Honor, but I would try to argue to you they're both part of the good faith immunity, and before Harlow the Court said there were two parts to the inquiry, one that the Court called subjective, and one that the Court called objective, but they both had to do with the state of the mind of the official."
1997.96-827,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2078.404,2082.177,"Well, let's just say... let's just say, when it's a question of what the law is, that we want to make intent irrelevant."
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2085.029,2085.469,Right.
1997.96-827,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2085.469,2089.51,"But in the kind of tort we're talking about here, the intent is everything."
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2090.851,2092.681,"Oh, I wasn't trying to make it irrelevant, Your Honor."
1997.96-827,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2145.327,2145.707,Why?
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2150.472,2152.555,"Me, too."
1997.96-827,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2153.454,2157.087,It seems to me that we're interpreting a statute here.
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2163.503,2165.165,"No, I'm not suggesting you're writing it."
1997.96-827,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2180.565,2185.608,"Could we... I mean, I just don't know where we plucked this notion of clear and convincing evidence from."
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2196.334,2214.386,"Well, I think you are authorized to make that determination, Your Honor, for the same reason you're authorized to determine the burden of proof in a statute where Congress hasn't provided what the burden of proof will be, and for the same reason you're authorized to define and refine the contours of the qualified immunity."
1997.96-827,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2214.386,2217.438,Is Harlow your best authority for that proposition?
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2217.438,2219.338,About defining and refining?
1997.96-827,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2219.338,2230.326,"Yes, about our general authority to formulate rules that will give meaning and substance and force to the sovereign immunity defense from a procedural standpoint."
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2230.326,2248.409,"Well, Harlow, Wyatt, I would cite Woodby v. INS, where the Court adopted a clear and convincing standard, and said it was doing so in part because Congress had not established the standard, and it was a particularly, peculiarly judiciary function to determine what the burden of proof--"
1997.96-827,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2248.409,2254.471,"We make it up based on our assessment of the needs of the judicial system quite apart from common law analogues, et cetera?"
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2254.471,2255.753,"--No, not quite apart, Your Honor."
1997.96-827,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2271.203,2294.769,"Mr. Smith, you have said a couple of times, I think, that in the case of these intent causes of action like this one, if we don't have some such mechanism as clear and convincing, as a threshold standard, that for practical purposes summary judgment will not be granted and qualified immunity will be a dead letter."
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2305.937,2333.164,"--I think the best support we have in the record, the statistics that are before the Court, the best ones are cited in Judge Silberman's opinion at page 38a and 56a, and in the amicus brief for the States at page 12, and in the amicus brief for the United States at pages 1 and 2, and I think if you read all of those data together, they do say one important thing."
1997.96-827,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2358.489,2372.639,"But how many... do we have any basis for saying how many of those cases are cases in which improper intent is alleged with a substantial basis in the evidence, even though ultimately it turns out that the jury finds otherwise?"
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2374.581,2375.052,That's correct.
1997.96-827,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2375.052,2381.216,Do we have any basis for apportioning those cases as against the--
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2381.216,2387.898,"I don't think the data will tell you which are improper intent cases and which are not, but this much we know."
1997.96-827,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2393.882,2399.266,"--May I ask, is the rule you're advocating limited to prison cases, or would it apply to employee discharge cases?"
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2399.266,2404.12,"--It would apply, I think, Your Honor, across the board, as the Court said in Harlow."
1997.96-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2415.829,2417.398,"If it... so, please, finish."
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2417.398,2417.989,--Go ahead.
1997.96-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2417.989,2418.48,If you're--
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2418.48,2420.4,"No, I'd rather hear your question."
1997.96-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2420.4,2421.492,--If it would apply across the board--
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2421.492,2422.724,Across the board to all cases.
1997.96-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2422.724,2426.415,"--Then you have to be careful, because, you know, a lot of these claims might be very, very good."
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2491.948,2492.639,Because you're still--
1997.96-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2492.639,2493.039,--the rules.
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2493.039,2497.201,"--I think, Your Honor, in the mind run of the cases, you're still going to go to trial."
1997.96-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2497.201,2497.722,Why?
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2497.722,2505.708,"Because we're going to have credibility determinations, or we're going to have, as the Chief Justice said, a situation where all of the evidence has to be--"
1997.96-827,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2505.708,2507.048,Is that in fact what's happening now?
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2519.316,2523.199,--I don't think we have the data that have actually counted--
1997.96-827,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2523.199,2524.98,Well... because you said there were a lot.
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2526.071,2531.094,"--What I said there were a lot of, Your Honor, are claims of this kind, and what I--"
1997.96-827,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2531.094,2538.498,"--Yes, but do they get... the question is, do they get weeded out efficiently without any heightened pleading rules, any additional proof burden rules?"
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2538.498,2553.788,"--And my answer is... the answer has to be no, because under the governing standards you have to let credibility determinations or any case in which any permissible inference can be drawn in favor of the plaintiff, you have to let them go forward."
1997.96-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2553.788,2554.469,But the numbers I saw--
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2554.469,2556.071,That's the nub of the problem the Court discussed in Harlow.
1997.96-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2556.071,2560.433,--The number I saw on this very point in the record was something like 500-some-odd cases.
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2562.794,2566.517,"Well, the 500 number is in the U.S.'s brief, but that's only for Bivens."
1997.96-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2566.517,2578.024,"That's true, but that's 500-and-some-odd cases out of, let's say, 80,000 prisoners, and if... that doesn't seem like an enormous... I mean, on its face, that didn't seem overwhelming as a problem."
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2581.137,2581.948,"Well, the--"
1997.96-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2581.948,2585.551,"The Federal system probably has 80,000, does it, something--"
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2585.551,2586.032,--Yes.
1997.96-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2592.573,2605.923,"--But there are close to a million prisoners in the State systems, and so... perhaps more than a million, and so is the... it seemed like a... I mean, I don't know what to make of this."
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2606.635,2608.915,"My view... my view, Your Honor, would be two things."
1997.96-827,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2756.134,2759.126,--Are you proposing this rule just for criminal... for prisoner cases?
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2759.126,2760.154,"No, Your Honor."
1997.96-827,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2761.286,2766.009,Then this asymmetry that you're talking about may not necessarily apply.
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2766.5,2767.561,"--Oh, I... I would--"
1997.96-827,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2767.561,2773.505,"A fairly high percentage of frivolous in the prison context, but I'm not sure outside of the prison context."
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2773.505,2780.839,"--Well, again, we don't have the exact numbers, but I would suggest that in other contexts you still have the problem--"
1997.96-827,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2780.839,2784.282,Can we adopt the clear and convincing rule for the prison context and not elsewhere?
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2787.474,2788.085,--Well--
1997.96-827,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2788.085,2790.996,"--proof rules willy nilly, can we just do it for the prison context?"
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2790.996,2798.089,"--I would suggest an across-the-board approach is the best approach but, Your Honor, as I'm sure you would put it, I'll take what I can get here--"
1997.96-827,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2829.602,2835.075,"In the civil fraud context we did it in the context of the Federal rules, is that not correct, or is that incorrect?"
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2835.075,2836.137,"--Well, I think--"
1997.96-827,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2836.137,2838.057,You said we've done this in the civil fraud context.
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2842.348,2851.945,"--No, the Court in Woodby, Your Honor, referred to various different situations where courts have, in a civil fraud context, adopted a clear and convincing test."
1997.96-827,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2897.366,2905.191,"Better than the heightened pleading rule which this Court hasn't held is out the window with respect to individuals, as distinguished from municipalities?"
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2905.191,2918.52,"I do think it's better than the heightened pleading rule, for the reasons I've been saying, but it's not as rigid, say, as the direct evidence rule, which I think frankly made it too tough on some plaintiffs, because most of these cases are circumstantial evidence cases."
1997.96-827,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2926.064,2929.346,"So you're not supporting Judge Silberman's approach, then."
1997.96-827,1,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,2933.39,2935.561,Ginsburg.
1997.96-827,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2941.665,2950.991,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-827,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2978.748,2990.917,"Well, we know he's subject to suit, but I mean, how do we... do you have an empirical basis for telling us how much deserves to be weeded out but is not being weeded out under the law as it now stands?"
1997.96-827,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,2990.917,3002.764,"--I think the statistics provide a partial answer here, and the statistics I'll cite from are the Bureau of Justice statistics that are prepared in a monograph that they have made publicly available called Prisoner Petitions in the Federal Courts."
1997.96-827,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3003.515,3006.426,Are those in your brief or an appendix--
1997.96-827,2,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3006.426,3006.857,"--No, it's not."
1997.96-827,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3017.324,3018.345,--State and Federal?
