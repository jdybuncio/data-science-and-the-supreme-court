1974.73-5993,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.962,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in 73-5993, Test against the United States."
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,15.366,19.859,Mr. Chief Justice and associate justices.
1974.73-5993,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,184.709,189.562,"Mr. Gerash, let me ask for a little help."
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,208.263,214.874,"Well, relying on human nature, it's self-corrective because the opposite sex does the same thing."
1974.73-5993,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,223.96,239.818,"Question number two, you motion it seems to me is directed to persons with Spanish surnames and students and blacks using your phrase, and then later, persons under the age of 35."
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,257.281,266.654,"Well, what happened is of course this Court certified the issue to be Spanish surnames and did not certify a age grouping or in this case blacks."
1974.73-5993,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,297.45,310.694,Well I take it then you're saying the inconsistency which I believe is present between your supporting affidavit and the motion is irrelevant because we're only speaking of Spanish surnames here?
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,310.694,312.036,"That's right, Your Honor."
1974.73-5993,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,312.036,316.992,And you feel that in response to my first question that the thing balances out?
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,316.992,318.525,"Yes, it does."
1974.73-5993,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,318.525,322.288,You lost me there a little bit Mr. Gerash.
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,329.312,329.443,Well --
1974.73-5993,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,329.443,343.343,Though you're saying that there are as many Spanish people -- people of Spanish origins or Mexican origins who marry non-Spanish names like Jones or Peterson --
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,343.343,343.654,Right.
1974.73-5993,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,343.654,344.408,-- and vice versa.
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,344.408,344.53,Right.
1974.73-5993,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,344.53,345.446,"Now, how do we know that?"
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,345.446,357.17,"Well, there'd been some studies made and however the statisticians and mathematicians do have a error of correction and they take that into consideration."
1974.73-5993,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,357.17,361.959,I don't see how you could do that except by an absolute headcount.
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,361.959,371.065,"Well therefore, it would've been impossible in Hernandez versus Texas, I suppose, to come to the systematic exclusion of constitutional argument."
1974.73-5993,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,380.653,387.566,"Mathematics does not have much of play in marriage problems, does it?"
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,387.566,387.912,No.
1974.73-5993,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,387.912,389.305,You don't marry on a mathematical basis.
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,389.305,390.442,That's correct.
1974.73-5993,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,392.738,396.674,It's mathematical of this extent that is as many men marry women as women marry men.
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,396.674,398.816,That's right.
1974.73-5993,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,398.816,407.806,But what does that have to do with antecedents -- ethnic antecedents?
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,407.806,417.846,The U.S. census met with that problem also and I quote a U.S. census finding of the voting characteristics of persons in the 1968 elections.
1974.73-5993,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,434.931,436.757,"But it is a sampling only, is it not?"
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,436.757,446.67,"Yes, but it projected over statistically hundreds and thousands of persons, it's a pretty good figure."
1974.73-5993,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,455.466,457.065,Many of them were missed.
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,457.065,459.692,That's correct.
1974.73-5993,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,459.952,466.846,"The same was true with Negroes and other ethnics groups, was that not true?"
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,466.846,467.933,That's correct.
1974.73-5993,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,589.694,590.674,What page are you reading from?
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,590.674,591.777,Page 24.
1974.73-5993,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,591.777,591.918,Of the?
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,591.918,592.89,Of the appendix.
1974.73-5993,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,592.89,595.201,Of the appendix.
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,595.201,607.558,And the court never ruled on the sufficiency of the affidavit and there was no record on review and we had no hearing.
1974.73-5993,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,633.016,634.044,What page now?
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,634.044,646.288,Page 1 (a) which would be page 50 of petitioner's brief.
1974.73-5993,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,779.535,783.62,"You're speaking now to the jury wheel, not to a specific jury?"
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,783.62,786.28,"I'm speaking about our Act, the federal Act."
1974.73-5993,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,786.28,796.134,"Well, you're addressing your remarks to what must be done with the total names going into the jury wheel, not the colored people --"
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,796.134,796.247,Exactly.
1974.73-5993,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,796.247,797.791,-- or who simply who'll go into the box?
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,797.791,798.473,Exactly.
1974.73-5993,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,938.891,941.875,"The Government seems in large part to agree with you, do they?"
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,941.875,944.206,That's correct.
1974.73-5993,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,944.206,952.562,So this is hardly -- the controversy has been considerably reduced since the petition for certiorari was granted?
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,952.562,954.768,"That's correct, that's correct."
1974.73-5993,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,984.972,988.593,"The Government agrees with you in that reading of the Act as I -- well, we'll wait for them."
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,988.593,989.199,That's right.
1974.73-5993,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,989.199,990.908,"But, certainly from the brief --"
1974.73-5993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,990.908,997.785,"You don't contend that you're entitled to a new trial if we agree with you, do we?"
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,997.785,997.892,No.
1974.73-5993,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,997.892,1000.809,Or you're just entitled to an examination of the jury lists?
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,1000.809,1001.166,Exactly.
1974.73-5993,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1058.199,1058.865,This isn't voting.
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,1060.664,1067.584,"Well, the Act says you could use voter registration list or at people voted in the last election."
1974.73-5993,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1074.331,1075.717,Does that to miss one election to be purged?
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,1075.717,1079.458,That's right.
1974.73-5993,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1191.375,1191.694,Very well.
1974.73-5993,0,44795,walter_l_gerash,,1191.694,1195.467,Thank you.
1974.73-5993,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1195.467,1199.381,Mr. Patton.
1974.73-5993,1,45815,william_l_patton,,1199.381,1202.51,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-5993,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1550.578,1555.919,"And that's what had to be done after the voting age was changed, was it not?"
1974.73-5993,1,45815,william_l_patton,,1555.919,1556.944,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.73-5993,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1593.188,1597.266,"Well is that before -- the only thing before us is to whether they have the right to see the list, is that right?"
1974.73-5993,1,45815,william_l_patton,,1597.266,1598.796,That's right Mr. Justice Marshall.
1974.73-5993,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1598.796,1600.484,And you agreed that he does have a right to see the list?
1974.73-5993,1,45815,william_l_patton,,1600.484,1601.478,"Yes sir, we do."
1974.73-5993,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1601.478,1603.42,So what are we going through now?
1974.73-5993,1,45815,william_l_patton,,1603.42,1607.667,"Well, we believe the case ought to be remanded to the Court of Appeals with instructions --"
1974.73-5993,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1607.667,1614.189,You want us to write an essay on this where both sides agree?
1974.73-5993,1,45815,william_l_patton,,1614.189,1616.158,"No sir, I don't think it’s necessary."
1974.73-5993,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1619.274,1630.472,But you suggested that sometime ago when we took this case that we shouldn't take it that it should be remanded?
1974.73-5993,1,45815,william_l_patton,,1630.472,1631.378,That's right.
1974.73-5993,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1631.378,1635.1,So you perhaps should be putting the questions.
1974.73-5993,1,45815,william_l_patton,,1635.1,1645.094,"Well, I was somewhat puzzled and uncertainness to what the Court was interested in, I -- let me bring up one thing --"
1974.73-5993,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1645.094,1669.856,"Well, I take it you say that the Act is to be construed to mean that anyone can inspect the jury list and what's on the wheel by saying “I may want to file a motion, and in order to find out if I do or not, I can go on this fishing expedition in the jury records.”"
1974.73-5993,1,45815,william_l_patton,,1672.623,1673.965,That's right.
1974.73-5993,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1684.439,1689.952,So does that include all the records of individual exemptions?
1974.73-5993,1,45815,william_l_patton,,1689.952,1697.599,"The -- well, under the Federal Act, the process works basically this way."
1974.73-5993,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1735.306,1745.259,"Do you say the error in this case was that although the affidavit was insufficient, he should have had an opportunity to present a better one if he could after inspecting the list?"
1974.73-5993,1,45815,william_l_patton,,1745.259,1746.634,That's right.
1974.73-5993,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1760.217,1766.135,"But there's no need for any sort of prima facie showing before you have a right to inspect, in your view?"
1974.73-5993,1,45815,william_l_patton,,1766.135,1768.773,In our view there is not.
1974.73-5993,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1771.263,1773.714,An unrestricted right in other words to --
1974.73-5993,1,45815,william_l_patton,,1773.714,1775.001,"That's right Mr. Justice Stewart, we believe --"
1974.73-5993,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1775.001,1776.631,(Voice Overlap) statute?
1974.73-5993,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1776.631,1782.035,I suppose it has got to be a (Inaudible)?
1974.73-5993,1,45815,william_l_patton,,1782.035,1788.139,No he has to be a defendant or the Attorney General or either party in civil case.
1974.73-5993,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1800.5,1801.821,"Well, they existed before the Act."
1974.73-5993,1,45815,william_l_patton,,1801.821,1807.135,"They existed before the Act, that's right."
1974.73-5993,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1810.606,1817.037,"I take it that you have nothing in the legislative history on account of your argument, do you?"
1974.73-5993,1,45815,william_l_patton,,1817.037,1825.933,"Nothing Mr. Justice White, except in 1966 in House debates on a previous Bill that was never enacted."
1974.73-5993,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1836.395,1837.734,"There's a time limit now, isn't there?"
1974.73-5993,1,45815,william_l_patton,,1837.734,1838.938,"There is a time limit, and it's --"
1974.73-5993,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1838.938,1840.579,"Seven days, isn't it?"
1974.73-5993,1,45815,william_l_patton,,1840.579,1851.81,"Seven days in any event before the voir dire begins, and the lists are so large that it's best and inefficient way of tampering, so we're not concerned about that."
1974.73-5993,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1874.697,1879.007,And if he doesn't make out his case to reenter the judgment.
1974.73-5993,1,45815,william_l_patton,,1879.007,1882.82,That's right.
1974.73-5993,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1912.048,1913.455,Is that new you're suggesting?
1974.73-5993,1,45815,william_l_patton,,1913.455,1922.418,"It is -- no, they have done it, we don't know whether the Supreme Court of Colorado has ordered the voter list be supplemented for jury selection in state courts."
1974.73-5993,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1922.418,1923.061,Since --
1974.73-5993,1,45815,william_l_patton,,1923.061,1923.687,Since this case has come.
1974.73-5993,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1923.687,1925.555,-- this case and certiorari was granted in this case?
1974.73-5993,1,45815,william_l_patton,,1925.555,1926.752,That's right.
1974.73-5993,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1976.08,1991.046,"An example of this time occurred when the voting age was changed it took, as I recall it, substantially more than a year to bring that voter wheel up to date."
1974.73-5993,1,45815,william_l_patton,,1997.309,1998.313,There is bound to be a lag.
1974.73-5993,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2053.601,2054.869,Thank you Mr. Patton.
1974.73-5993,2,44795,walter_l_gerash,,2056.998,2063.295,Just a comment on Justice White's mention of fishing expedition.
1974.73-5993,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2075.371,2078.088,"Mr. Gerash, do you have to file an affidavit?"
1974.73-5993,2,44795,walter_l_gerash,,2078.088,2080.101,"Yes, you have to --"
1974.73-5993,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2080.101,2089.437,And you say you must make out in your sworn statement you must have allegations in there that would entitle your relief?
1974.73-5993,2,44795,walter_l_gerash,,2089.437,2094.096,You have to -- I would liken it a probable cause affidavit because --
1974.73-5993,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2094.096,2098.177,"Justice Rehnquist asked your colleague if that was so, it is so."
1974.73-5993,2,44795,walter_l_gerash,,2098.177,2101.789,"Well, I suppose I should be on this side and he should be on my side."
1974.73-5993,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2101.789,2106.12,"But then, your affidavit was insufficient?"
1974.73-5993,2,44795,walter_l_gerash,,2106.12,2109.806,"Well, I don't think it was, because my affidavit --"
1974.73-5993,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2109.806,2111.23,Your opponent says it was.
1974.73-5993,2,44795,walter_l_gerash,,2111.23,2112.193,"It wasn't, that's --"
1974.73-5993,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2112.193,2114.644,That's what he turned on then we do have an issue here.
1974.73-5993,2,44795,walter_l_gerash,,2121.49,2123.38,I'm just stating that --
1974.73-5993,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2123.38,2124.82,Is that right?
1974.73-5993,2,44795,walter_l_gerash,,2124.82,2126.147,"Not really, no."
1974.73-5993,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2126.147,2126.85,Well why isn't then?
1974.73-5993,2,44795,walter_l_gerash,,2126.85,2127.17,Well he --
1974.73-5993,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2127.17,2129.227,"You said your affidavit is sufficient, he said it wasn't."
1974.73-5993,2,44795,walter_l_gerash,,2129.227,2136.385,"He stated that it was more sufficient than most affidavits he's ever seen, not the best."
1974.73-5993,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2139.367,2146.762,"Well you say there’s an issue here before the Court, before we can remand, we must pass on the sufficiency of the affidavit."
1974.73-5993,2,44795,walter_l_gerash,,2150.108,2150.97,"Well, --"
1974.73-5993,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2150.97,2154.694,"That's the conclusions of what you've just said, aren't they?"
1974.73-5993,2,44795,walter_l_gerash,,2154.694,2155.964,I'll stand on the affidavit.
1974.73-5993,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2159.266,2170.195,I understood Mr. Patton to say that it was -- your affidavit was as good as sufficient as it could be without an examination of the list?
1974.73-5993,2,44795,walter_l_gerash,,2170.195,2170.457,Right.
1974.73-5993,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2170.457,2170.704,But --
1974.73-5993,2,44795,walter_l_gerash,,2170.704,2172.025,And I had to go to another --
1974.73-5993,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2172.025,2173.387,That isn't the point.
1974.73-5993,2,44795,walter_l_gerash,,2178.981,2181.545,"Yes, and I think that prevents the fishing expedition."
1974.73-5993,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2181.545,2189.367,So how many counties does the Denver District of the -- District of Colorado drawn for its jury selection?
1974.73-5993,2,44795,walter_l_gerash,,2189.367,2191.087,About 20 counties.
1974.73-5993,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2191.087,2196.747,"Well, I would think if you have to make a prima facie showing making it just in Boulder County, might not be sufficient?"
1974.73-5993,2,44795,walter_l_gerash,,2196.747,2199.052,It would be economically impossible.
1974.73-5993,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2202.011,2210.581,"Well, I think that may be militates against the prima facie showing argument, rather than saying that you can make a prima facie showing by 1 out of 20?"
1974.73-5993,2,44795,walter_l_gerash,,2210.581,2213.668,"Well, then I'll have to move and change my position --"
1974.73-5993,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2213.668,2214.813,(Inaudible)
1974.73-5993,2,44795,walter_l_gerash,,2214.813,2215.799,"Well, I'll have to agree --"
1974.73-5993,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2215.799,2216.723,(Inaudible)
1974.73-5993,2,44795,walter_l_gerash,,2216.723,2240.217,"I'll have to agree with him, but the point is if a lawyer swears under oath, facts that if true would be a substantial noncompliance and he has no way of really approving that other than an experience with the vote of registration list in a county that comprises one of the federal counties."
1974.73-5993,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2240.217,2256.479,"Well, I have to completely agree to that, and I have felt the nerve, his was and yours was that all you needed when you wanted to inspect was to tell the court officials that I'm going to file a motion."
1974.73-5993,2,44795,walter_l_gerash,,2256.479,2258.442,The statute doesn't say that.
1974.73-5993,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2260.866,2270.733,"Well, the Government's position is I thought yours was that 1867 (f) said that you can inspect to the purpose of preparing the motion?"
1974.73-5993,2,44795,walter_l_gerash,,2270.733,2279.059,"Well, as I read (d), 1867 (d) the motion must accompany -- an affidavit must accompany the motion."
1974.73-5993,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2279.059,2283.568,I agree certainly much.
1974.73-5993,2,44795,walter_l_gerash,,2287.738,2289.696,That's correct.
1974.73-5993,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2289.696,2289.989,Oh!
