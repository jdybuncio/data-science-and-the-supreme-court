1988.87-1855,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.658,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-1855, Thomas K. Gilhool versus Russell A. Muth."
1988.87-1855,0,36479,maria_parisivickers,,17.51,23.08,This case is here on petition for certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
1988.87-1855,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,252.83,271.91,"Well, now, the attorney on the other side says that the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986 make clear that this Act is covered at least after 1986."
1988.87-1855,0,36479,maria_parisivickers,,274.027,279.647,"Not at all, Justice O'Connor, for two reasons."
1988.87-1855,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,286.42,286.97,Yes.
1988.87-1855,0,36479,maria_parisivickers,,288.737,295.693,"--After October 21, 1986 and, therefore, it has nothing to do with this particular case where the violations occurred long before that."
1988.87-1855,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,302.93,304.799,"Well, it could be viewed as that, couldn't it?"
1988.87-1855,0,36479,maria_parisivickers,,304.799,305.499,Certainly.
1988.87-1855,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,331.966,338.603,"Well, this was designed to eliminate discrimination against handicapped children in schools perhaps."
1988.87-1855,0,36479,maria_parisivickers,,338.603,353.629,"Well, this is actually... you could view this as a discrimination statute because it focuses particularly on one group and gives them benefits which other children may not be entitled to, or other groups may not be entitled to."
1988.87-1855,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,369.674,384.501,"Now, suppose we were to agree with you, that at least as to the claims that arose before 1986 that there is an Eleventh Amendment bar here."
1988.87-1855,0,36479,maria_parisivickers,,389.654,391.337,That is correct.
1988.87-1855,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,391.337,403.462,"But you did not challenge the lower court's ruling that lack of finality and delay caused by the remand violated federal regulations, did you?"
1988.87-1855,0,36479,maria_parisivickers,,404.312,405.064,That is not.
1988.87-1855,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,418.305,418.788,"Well, what--"
1988.87-1855,0,36479,maria_parisivickers,,418.788,419.405,--for the attorney's fees.
1988.87-1855,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,419.405,434.064,"--Well, what that means is that the Third Circuit's judgment with respect to the Tuition Reimbursement Board award would stand regardless of what we do on the Eleventh Amendment question."
1988.87-1855,0,36479,maria_parisivickers,,434.064,442.487,That is not so because there is an attorney's fee award which depends on the number of claims which Mr. Muth would be successful on.
1988.87-1855,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,442.82,449.593,"Well, it would stand at least insofar as the tuition reimbursement is concerned."
1988.87-1855,0,36479,maria_parisivickers,,449.593,454.378,--As to the amount... assuming that the Eleventh Amendment to be--
1988.87-1855,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,454.378,458.097,It certainly stands as against the school district.
1988.87-1855,0,36479,maria_parisivickers,,465.436,476.243,"--Well, Justice O'Connor, we do have an order of the Third... of the district court which was appealed to the Third Circuit on the issue of attorney's fees."
1988.87-1855,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,672.403,688.013,"Counsel, could I... maybe I'm coming back to the same question that Justice O'Connor asked, but I hadn't understood, or, it wasn't clear from your brief, whether if we find for you on Point 1 in your brief, you also expect us to go on to Point 2?"
1988.87-1855,0,36479,maria_parisivickers,,688.013,690.115,"That is correct, Justice Scalla."
1988.87-1855,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,690.532,694.603,Although... was there any relief granted below other than money damages?
1988.87-1855,0,36479,maria_parisivickers,,694.603,695.069,--No.
1988.87-1855,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,697.805,698.738,And attorney's fees?
1988.87-1855,0,36479,maria_parisivickers,,698.738,699.838,That's correct.
1988.87-1855,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,699.838,703.208,The validity of which would depend upon the validity of the money damages?
1988.87-1855,0,36479,maria_parisivickers,,703.208,705.658,The validity of which would depend in--
1988.87-1855,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,705.658,707.01,"Well, if you had no... right?"
1988.87-1855,0,36479,maria_parisivickers,,713.897,724.955,--Conceivably there could be attorney's fees for the violations... the procedural violations and the claim which plaintiff did prevail.
1988.87-1855,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,724.955,726.088,"No, but plaintiff would lose."
1988.87-1855,0,36479,maria_parisivickers,,740.848,747.82,If the court found that the money damages... money damage award is barred because of the Eleventh Amendment bar--
1988.87-1855,1,35830,martha_a_field,,1567.937,1571.973,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1855,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1720.402,1728.191,"Well, I guess our decision in Burlington addressed whether tuition reimbursement could be allowed, and indicated that it could."
1988.87-1855,1,35830,martha_a_field,,1737.447,1737.864,--That's right.
1988.87-1855,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1737.864,1740.666,So that the state itself could be held liable for it.
1988.87-1855,1,35830,martha_a_field,,1740.666,1741.685,That's right.
1988.87-1855,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1792.95,1800.537,"Well, it certainly didn't meet the kinds of requirements that Atascadero would have imposed, did it?"
1988.87-1855,1,35830,martha_a_field,,1800.537,1803.406,"Well, we think it did."
1988.87-1855,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1993.345,1998.149,"Ms. Field, it isn't certainly phrased in terms of money damages either, is it?"
1988.87-1855,1,35830,martha_a_field,,2009.438,2009.874,--Yes.
1988.87-1855,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2076.316,2084.688,"Well, you agree, do you not, that reimbursement would be barred by the Eleventh Amendment if Congress had not sought to abrogate the immunity?"
1988.87-1855,1,35830,martha_a_field,,2084.688,2086.455,That's... that's correct.
1988.87-1855,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2172.396,2181.501,I guess Congress enacted the means whereby it could enforce its requirement on states that they spend money.
1988.87-1855,1,35830,martha_a_field,,2187.489,2190.524,"Well, they can withhold financial aid."
1988.87-1855,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2190.524,2196.761,"I mean, there are enforcement procedures available against the states themselves by federal action."
1988.87-1855,1,35830,martha_a_field,,2196.761,2202.479,"Well, that enforcement procedure is available and prospective relief would be available."
1988.87-1855,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2202.479,2204.398,And presumably prospective relief.
1988.87-1855,1,35830,martha_a_field,,2204.398,2205.248,Yes.
1988.87-1855,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2271.142,2271.592,But these--
1988.87-1855,1,35830,martha_a_field,,2271.592,2272.042,--in each case.
1988.87-1855,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2272.042,2275.944,--parents... this parent will get reimbursement regardless of our holding?
1988.87-1855,1,35830,martha_a_field,,2275.944,2276.546,That's right.
1988.87-1855,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2438.633,2445.12,"Well, it's possible that the Rehab Act Amendments of '86 have changed the rules--"
1988.87-1855,1,35830,martha_a_field,,2445.12,2445.203,For--
1988.87-1855,2,36479,maria_parisivickers,,3321.971,3323.488,I have nothing on rebuttal.
1988.87-1855,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3323.488,3324.154,Very well.
