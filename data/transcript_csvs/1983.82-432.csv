1983.82-432,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,108.097,"Mr. Witlen, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,108.097,108.409,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-432,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,303.253,308.109,Who ends up paying for the arbitrator or whoever it is the court appoints?
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,308.109,321.198,"The union paid for the entire cost of the election including the arbitrator with the understanding, which was discussed at the time, that the union could seek reimbursement from the Plaintiffs if the District Court's injunction was ultimately overturned."
1983.82-432,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,321.198,326.275,Would there have been that sort of expense to either party if the Secretary had brought the injunction?
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,326.275,344.627,"Certainly some of the expenses of conducting an election would have been incurred, but the major expense, that in excess of $7,000 to pay the arbitrator's expenses would not have been incurred because the Secretary of Labor does not charge the union for its expenses and personnel in conducting the election."
1983.82-432,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,346.813,358.511,Were the procedures for the election under the court order like the procedures that the Secretary would follow under IV?
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,358.511,365.994,There were major discrepancies between what the Secretary would do and what the union would do and what the court ordered.
1983.82-432,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,365.994,367.742,Can you say briefly what the difference would be?
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,367.742,382.471,Primarily the arbitrators that were appointed did not have the expertise of the Secretary to make evaluations as to the application of the Secretary's own administrative regulations or the union's constitutional regulations and requirements.
1983.82-432,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,382.471,391.732,The question I wanted to ask in my mind is the violations here concern the nomination meeting as I remember.
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,391.732,392.482,That is correct.
1983.82-432,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,392.482,401.119,Would you make basically the same argument that you make today if the action had been brought promptly after the nomination meeting after the alleged violations occurred?
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,401.119,409.21,We would not be making the same argument if the suit was brought prior to the time the ballots were mailed out.
1983.82-432,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,409.21,415.77,Would not some of your policy arguments be equally strong about having the wrong people running the election and so forth?
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,415.77,430.81,If we were to address that question prior to Calhoon and ignoring the prior cases of this Court we would say that the public policy issues and the legislative history arguments clearly discern a congressional intent that there be no pro-election Title I relief.
1983.82-432,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,455.097,459.393,But the whole question really is at what point in time has an election been conducted.
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,459.393,462.595,"No, it is not the whole point because that--"
1983.82-432,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,462.595,466.047,It is just a little different theory than Judge Campbell had as I understand it.
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,466.047,469.28,--It is only marginally different from Judge Campbell.
1983.82-432,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,479.744,482.82,"Well, that could have happened if they had brought the suit right after the nomination meeting."
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,486.069,492.973,I think at that point the court could have merely nullified the nomination meeting and gone back to the union and say do it again.
1983.82-432,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,516.526,523.366,Surely if ballots had been cast you think the election has in effect been had?
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,523.366,525.662,"Certainly, which is the case in this case."
1983.82-432,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,525.662,531.659,There was not any legislative history about Title I except in the floor.
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,531.659,533.175,That is correct.
1983.82-432,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,533.175,535.158,It did not go through a committee?
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,535.158,536.595,"No, it did not, Your Honor."
1983.82-432,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,537.017,539.533,No hearings on that aspect of it?
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,539.533,542.359,"--No, there is no discussion in the legislative history."
1983.82-432,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,542.359,542.938,It was written on the floor?
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,542.938,543.749,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-432,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,543.749,549.62,"You say you had quarrel with some language in Calhoon, or what was the other?"
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,549.62,550.823,Bachowski.
1983.82-432,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,648.737,651.205,Was an election conducted this January?
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,651.205,654.735,There was an election conducted in December of 1983.
1983.82-432,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,654.735,656.515,December.
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,656.515,656.968,Yes.
1983.82-432,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,656.968,659.515,So why is it not moot?
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,659.515,666.637,There are a number of arguments made on behalf of why it is not moot.
1983.82-432,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,973.434,976.652,Can it enjoin one?
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,984.149,986.601,It would depend at what--
1983.82-432,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,986.601,990.006,I thought you agreed they could set aside nominations under Title I.
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,990.006,997.846,--It would depend at what point the election was sought to be enjoined and what relief was being requested.
1983.82-432,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,997.846,1003.86,The only request is to hold a new nominating meeting.
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,1003.86,1008.998,And that the election be enjoined until such time that that could take place.
1983.82-432,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1008.998,1011.793,There cannot be an election without some nominations.
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,1011.793,1032.022,If that type of suit was brought prior to the mechanics of the balloting taking place and it relied upon a legitimate Title I basis for its complaint then we think that the prior decisions of this Court suggest that the District Court does have jurisdiction to entertain such a suit.
1983.82-432,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1032.022,1037.893,So appropriate injunctive relief is acceptable.
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,1037.893,1040.126,"It might be appropriate under the correct circumstances, yes."
1983.82-432,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1040.126,1050.278,"Now if you go that far, supposing they do decide we'll have to have the election two weeks late because of the nomination and we've enjoined the old elections."
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,1059.041,1060.65,"No, I do not believe that he does, Your Honor."
1983.82-432,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1060.65,1066.46,Any relief that pertains to the conduct of an election itself is beyond his statutory power?
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,1066.46,1073.036,"Anything which inserts the court in the actual conduct of the election, I believe, is beyond the statutory power."
1983.82-432,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1073.036,1079.156,You would not go so far as to say he could not delay the election two weeks and then say go ahead and conduct it pursuant to your normal rules.
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,1079.156,1091.121,"Not in the appropriate circumstances, and that is when the suit is in fact based upon a legitimate Title I issue and when it has been brought at a time before the balloting has taken place."
1983.82-432,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1091.121,1097.837,He could change the date of the election but could otherwise exercise no supervision whatsoever over it.
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,1098.681,1099.494,That is correct.
1983.82-432,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1099.494,1107.475,Is the Secretary's action under Title IV subject to review?
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,1107.475,1108.225,Certainly.
1983.82-432,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1118.0,1124.591,So it is merely a question of exhaustion rather than judicial power?
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,1124.591,1125.341,Certainly.
1983.82-432,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1140.82,1143.803,"Mr. Witlen, who would invoke the Secretary's authority?"
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,1143.803,1146.381,Any complaining member has a right to go to--
1983.82-432,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1146.381,1147.926,"Well, take your situation."
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,1161.438,1168.779,--Any of the Respondents could have filed a complaint with the union and 30 days thereafter gone to the Secretary of Labor.
1983.82-432,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1168.779,1171.167,But there has to be that waiting period of 30 days then.
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,1171.167,1183.553,There has to be a time for the union's procedures to work and then either 30 days after not getting a decision from the union or 30 days after the union decision then they go to the Secretary.
1983.82-432,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1183.553,1191.597,"Well, assuming you have a nomination meeting and the election is two weeks later."
1983.82-432,0,26236,gary_s_witlen,,1200.765,1201.78,That is correct.
1983.82-432,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1215.884,1216.757,Very well.
1983.82-432,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1233.579,1237.124,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-432,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1417.832,1427.329,"Mr. Garvey, in this case was there objection to the order before it was entered by counsel?"
1983.82-432,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1427.329,1431.936,By the Secretary or by the parties?
1983.82-432,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1431.936,1432.343,By anybody.
1983.82-432,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1432.343,1440.137,There was considerable negotiation in the District Court once it had been decided that the court was going to enjoin the election.
1983.82-432,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1440.137,1446.149,Was it ever pointed out to the court it would be improper for the court to run the election?
1983.82-432,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1446.149,1447.024,"Yes, indeed."
1983.82-432,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1450.414,1454.505,This was before the court entered the judgment or afterwards?
1983.82-432,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1454.505,1457.411,That was before the District Court entered the injunction.
1983.82-432,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1459.753,1466.517,"Mr. Garvey, I assume you have no trouble with mootness either?"
1983.82-432,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1466.517,1485.774,"No, we do not, Your Honor, both for the reasons mentioned by Petitioners and because we believe that the District Court by grabbing the ballots in this case has prevented the Secretary from performing his role in the Title IV statutory scheme up until today up until these ballots are released."
1983.82-432,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1485.774,1489.069,You do not complain about this last election.
1983.82-432,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1492.131,1493.801,There have not been any complaints.
1983.82-432,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1498.003,1503.86,Where does the Secretary draw the line between Title I and Title IV?
1983.82-432,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1503.86,1506.156,That is the other thing I would like to address in the time I have remaining.
1983.82-432,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1510.03,1513.388,Unless he gives Title I no room at all.
1983.82-432,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1513.388,1516.09,"--No, that is not so."
1983.82-432,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1666.123,1667.42,What about this case?
1983.82-432,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1675.494,1682.053,I do not know that Title IV is the exclusive remedy for anything that happened--
1983.82-432,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1682.053,1683.428,"No, in this case."
1983.82-432,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1683.428,1686.553,"--In this case, but the election could only be--"
1983.82-432,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1686.553,1687.083,I understand that.
1983.82-432,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1695.298,1696.313,--Might have sought damages.
1983.82-432,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1696.313,1698.672,"After the election, that's all."
1983.82-432,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1702.217,1703.186,They might have sought damages.
1983.82-432,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1703.186,1714.51,Do you agree that they might have run into court and got an injunction setting aside the nomination meeting as your colleague here?
1983.82-432,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1714.51,1714.807,No.
1983.82-432,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1718.211,1720.897,So the Secretary says that that kind of injunctive relief would be barred?
1983.82-432,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1720.897,1721.927,--That is right.
1983.82-432,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1721.927,1724.584,But the union does not agree with you.
1983.82-432,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1724.584,1744.31,"Mr. Witlen represented that they were not going to be that strict about it, but we would draw the line short of rerunning the nominations meeting because that kind of relief unlike... Well, let me give you another example in the course of this election about what might have been done."
1983.82-432,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1765.379,1772.391,Could the court order that they be considered nominated and be put on the ballot?
1983.82-432,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1772.391,1796.742,"I am reluctant to say no because Professor Cox suggested in the course of the Senate hearings on this that that might be an appropriate remedy to order in this case that Mr. Lynch's name be put on the ballot for Secretary/Treasurer, but again that unlike rerunning the nominations meeting does not involve any delay, does not get the court involved in the details of how the meeting should be run."
1983.82-432,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1796.742,1800.381,Most courts do not get these things heard in two or three days.
1983.82-432,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1807.222,1812.266,That gives me trouble.
1983.82-432,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1815.343,1822.668,"Well, if you say no you are in effect saying there is no Title I relief for anything in this case."
1983.82-432,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1822.668,1834.945,--I am perfectly willing to say that there is no equitable Title I relief for the problem in this case because the Title IV relief is perfectly adequate to resolve this problem.
1983.82-432,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1872.977,1875.678,"Mr. Garvey, I have one little question."
1983.82-432,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1885.752,1896.138,It is only after the ballots have been counted that a claimant is entitled to come to the secretary with a complaint.
1983.82-432,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1896.138,1898.778,That is what you ask us to do at this stage.
1983.82-432,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1898.778,1899.324,That is right.
1983.82-432,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1899.324,1902.23,So we just ignore the new election?
1983.82-432,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1902.23,1904.355,"No, not necessarily."
1983.82-432,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1905.619,1907.789,What do we do with the new election?
1983.82-432,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1907.789,1912.476,"--Perhaps nothing, but that is the decision that has to be made by the Secretary."
1983.82-432,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1914.475,1920.239,"Can we have something to do with deciding it, or do we have to just leave it all--"
1983.82-432,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1920.239,1921.88,--Perhaps eventually after the Secretary brings a suit.
1983.82-432,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1921.88,1923.753,--You did not bring this case to the Secretary.
1983.82-432,1,30459,john_h_garvey,,1924.738,1929.814,We did indeed to complain that the District Court had prevented has prevented the Secretary from acting.
1983.82-432,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1977.607,1984.229,Mr. Stern.
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,1984.229,1987.775,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2012.983,2017.856,They did not stipulate to the fact that there should be a new election.
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,2017.856,2018.872,"Yes, they did, Your Honor."
1983.82-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2058.278,2061.526,They never agreed that a court should run it.
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,2067.852,2077.175,"They did not feel it was all right for the court to run the election, and in fact that is why the factors mentioned by the government existed."
1983.82-432,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2190.848,2194.129,How often do district courts get into that posture?
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,2194.129,2199.222,--Every time there is a recalcitrant union that does not settle the matter.
1983.82-432,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2207.639,2211.918,"Once ordered, why can't the district judge let the Secretary take over?"
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,2211.918,2228.537,"He can, but I believe the practice is that the Secretary submits a proposed order to the court and the court acts on the proposed order, and therefore it is the court's order that is in fact what determines the terms."
1983.82-432,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2339.96,2343.115,"Well, the Secretary of Labor could order that."
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,2343.115,2356.703,"--Yes, but if you have a recalcitrant union the Secretary of Labor in practice cannot order that until the term has virtually run out for the people elected unlawfully."
1983.82-432,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2394.75,2398.046,Why can't the Secretary act without the court action?
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,2398.046,2413.384,"Only if the union agrees and if you have a person who has engaged in flagrant violations of Title I, Justice O'Connor, I suggest that is not the person who will agree, who will make the conciliation or correct it internally."
1983.82-432,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2529.274,2543.613,"May I ask, Mr. Stern, did I understand you to say that the Secretary's procedures including judicial review mean that there is a two year delay in conducting a local--"
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,2543.613,2548.876,"--An average of two and a half years, Justice Brennan, which is more than 75 percent of the term."
1983.82-432,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2550.735,2553.016,--Are there any statistics to support that?
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,2553.016,2553.499,Yes.
1983.82-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2690.427,2702.798,"What if the elections had been completed and the ballots been taken out and counted, then would there be a Title I remedy based on the allegedly illegal nominations?"
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,2702.798,2703.189,No.
1983.82-432,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2719.401,2723.588,After the election is actually conducted.
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,2723.588,2725.867,That would be the conducting of an election.
1983.82-432,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2725.867,2727.646,"The ballots cast and counted, is that it?"
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,2727.646,2733.583,Other than injunctive relief... Injunctive relief would be barred.
1983.82-432,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2733.583,2735.894,"No, but triggering the Secretary's authority."
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,2740.079,2746.64,The conduct of the election... The election would be conducted at the point that the ballots are counted.
1983.82-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2755.496,2759.292,Suppose you decided that the courts are just too slow.
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,2764.82,2765.992,No.
1983.82-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2780.907,2791.856,So you do not think the Secretary would have any jurisdiction or authority whatsoever if somebody complained to go into court and enjoin the election that has not been held yet?
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,2791.856,2792.653,He does not.
1983.82-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2792.653,2793.777,Do you have law to that effect?
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,2793.777,2798.931,The Cucho amendment took that power away from the Secretary and gave it to members.
1983.82-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2802.132,2809.833,"I know it gave it to members, but did it also take it away from the Secretary completely?"
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,2809.833,2810.628,Yes.
1983.82-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2823.296,2832.699,"After the election... Let's assume before the election the only complaint is that nominations, the very nominations here."
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,2845.912,2853.815,"Yes, and if it was intentionally done you can expect that it will be two and a half years later that it is remedied if you wait till after."
1983.82-432,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2913.01,2922.1,"Mr. Stern, don't all these arguments go to whether this particular judge handled this particular matter in a proper way rather than the power of the court to handle it at all?"
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,2922.1,2930.831,"I do not think there is any question that the court has the power to handle Title I violations, and I do not think there is any question in this case--"
1983.82-432,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2930.831,2944.512,As I understand your opponents even though they may not phrase it in terms of power they say there is virtually no power in a district court until after the election has been conducted in trying to figure out when the election has been conducted.
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,2961.037,2963.412,--Yes.
1983.82-432,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2979.888,2984.605,"Mr. Stern, may we come back a minute to the discussion you had previously?"
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,2996.507,2996.929,No.
1983.82-432,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2998.554,3005.66,It entered the injunction that the ballots not be counted the day before they were to be counted.
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,3005.66,3007.957,"--A temporary restraining order, yes, Your Honor."
1983.82-432,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3007.957,3008.206,Right.
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,3019.888,3026.979,"Your Honor, I think the number of cases that this could occur in are minimal, and that is--"
1983.82-432,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3026.979,3027.917,Why is that?
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,3028.728,3037.429,--Because it could only occur in an overlap case in the first place where there is a clear violation of Title I.
1983.82-432,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3043.177,3051.001,"I do understand that, but if a violation of Title I is claimed could the court always enjoin the counting of the ballots?"
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,3051.001,3055.607,"Yes, it could if it deemed it appropriate."
1983.82-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3175.95,3195.254,"Let me ask, say the election had taken place in this case and you went to the Secretary and complained and he investigated and thought that the nominating process was defective and a new election should be running."
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,3196.567,3198.223,--He has to sue unless they agree to it.
1983.82-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3198.223,3205.189,"Suppose he goes to court, what does he have to prove?"
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,3205.189,3210.405,He has to prove not only the violations occurred but that they may have--
1983.82-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3210.405,3211.186,What it is a violation of?
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,3212.576,3213.608,--Title IV.
1983.82-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3216.59,3223.929,So the two sections overlap in the sense that he would prove there was a violation in the nominating process.
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,3223.929,3226.023,A violation of Title IV.
1983.82-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3229.599,3234.051,"I know, but it just happens to be a violation... It was a violation of Title I also."
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,3234.051,3234.614,Fine.
1983.82-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3234.614,3237.284,He goes to court.
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,3239.564,3246.281,"First he has to prove, Justice White, that the outcome may have been affected."
1983.82-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3246.281,3247.686,Assume he does.
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,3247.686,3255.09,Then he gets a decree that provides for the election to be run under certain terms and conditions--
1983.82-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3255.09,3256.12,By the Secretary.
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,3256.12,3259.29,--For the Secretary to observe the election.
1983.82-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3259.29,3263.336,But is it not pursuant to regulations that the Secretary has?
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,3263.336,3263.632,Yes.
1983.82-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3263.632,3266.538,It is not terms that the court dreams up.
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,3266.538,3270.989,You are allowed to intervene--
1983.82-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3270.989,3272.474,I will put it to you this way.
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,3292.262,3294.527,--Exactly the way he did in this case?
1983.82-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3296.558,3302.929,I thought the Secretary had a set of rules as to how new elections were to be run.
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,3302.929,3305.569,"Yes, but there is no... I do not believe under the--"
1983.82-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3305.569,3307.599,You mean the court can displace them?
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,3307.599,3313.066,--I do not believe the rules set down in this case are any different from the rules--
1983.82-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3313.066,3325.265,Is the court constrained by the regulations the Secretary has issued as to how new elections are to be run?
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,3325.265,3326.374,--Under Title IV?
1983.82-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3326.374,3326.734,Yes.
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,3326.734,3330.09,"I do not believe the court is, Justice White."
1983.82-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3333.605,3336.214,The exclusivity means hardly anything there.
1983.82-432,2,36602,mark_d_stern,,3336.214,3350.176,"It hardly means anything because it is the same court that sets the same terms, and if the union refused to run its own meeting under Title IV the court would have done the same thing that it did here under Title IV."
1983.82-432,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3356.361,3359.359,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Wilken?"
1983.82-432,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3359.359,3363.78,What about my last question?
1983.82-432,3,26236,gary_s_witlen,,3363.78,3366.185,"I would be happy to start with it, Justice White."
1983.82-432,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3376.103,3378.321,In published regulations?
1983.82-432,4,36602,mark_d_stern,,3378.321,3382.865,In published regulations and after analyzing the union's rules and regulations.
1983.82-432,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3605.807,3607.307,"Thank you, gentlemen."
