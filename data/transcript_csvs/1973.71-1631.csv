1973.71-1631,0,16575,aldus_s_mitchell,,704.926,708.81,I think that -- well they allude to the First and Fourteenth amendment though --
1973.71-1631,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,708.81,711.491,That’s all.

1973.71-1631,0,16575,aldus_s_mitchell,,737.418,748.959,"Well, I think that we have raised this in the section of the brief where we suggest that the --"
1973.71-1631,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,748.959,754.346,What about your question presented on page 3 of the jurisdictional statement.

1973.71-1631,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,763.573,767.326,You keep saying questions but one.
1973.71-1631,0,16575,aldus_s_mitchell,,767.326,779.389,But I think that the jurisdictional questions are questions that were necessarily included in any question that is presented in this Court if there was no jurisdiction.
