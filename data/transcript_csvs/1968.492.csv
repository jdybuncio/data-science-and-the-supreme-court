1968.492,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1605.026,1607.189,And of all that would you see that is done.
1968.492,1,34711,leonard_kirschner,,1607.189,1612.634,I will never to follow through on the Court's request.
1968.492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1823.804,1826.482,What was the size of this group of people?
1968.492,1,34711,leonard_kirschner,,1826.482,1835.26,"With the Court's permission at the time of the marching around the cross, the size was approximately 10 to 20 as counsel for appellant has stated."
1968.492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1835.26,1835.542,What is --
1968.492,1,34711,leonard_kirschner,,1835.542,1835.922,Prior to that --
1968.492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1835.922,1840.594,Is there anything in the record that shows that more people were involved?
1968.492,1,34711,leonard_kirschner,,1840.594,1841.49,"Yes, sir."
1968.492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1861.541,1867.427,"Was that before or after he says, he's going to bring 400,000 people to the district?"
1968.492,1,34711,leonard_kirschner,,1867.427,1867.887,I'm sorry sir?
1968.492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1867.887,1872.585,"Was that before or after he says, he's going to bring all these thousand down to the District of --"
1968.492,1,34711,leonard_kirschner,,1872.585,1874.794,That was just before that.
1968.492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1878.092,1884.416,Anything else from the record to show that there was any possibility of -- in carrying out any of these?
1968.492,1,34711,leonard_kirschner,,1884.416,1886.337,"Well, if Your Honor please."
1968.492,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1979.303,1982.872,With out country -- out in the country?
1968.492,1,34711,leonard_kirschner,,1982.872,1987.464,"Well, but the broadcast was not in the country."
1968.492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1990.298,2009.116,Except Mr. Kirschner the theory of the indictment as I read on page 2 of appendix is that these people were charged with violating the statute by what they did at that farm on two-mile road on that evening not with anything to do with the television broadcast.
1968.492,1,34711,leonard_kirschner,,2009.116,2009.898,"Well, as a part --"
1968.492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2009.898,2011.072,Have you tried the indictment?
1968.492,1,34711,leonard_kirschner,,2011.072,2011.435,No.
1968.492,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2052.743,2059.992,Part of his acts at the scene you say were saying things knowing that they would be filmed and broadcast --
1968.492,1,34711,leonard_kirschner,,2059.992,2061.255,That is correct Your Honor.
1968.492,2,15598,allen_brown,,2879.036,2890.328,In view of the fact Your Honor of the amazing circumstance in my opinion that I did not get allowance into the Supreme Court of Ohio.
1968.492,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2896.289,2897.041,So they're probably here?
1968.492,2,15598,allen_brown,,2897.041,2899.005,"So, they are within the possession of the clerk here."
1968.492,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2899.005,2908.009,Have you any recollection whether the state raised the question of failure to object to the instructions as one reason that the issue should not be --
1968.492,2,15598,allen_brown,,2908.009,2915.431,"The state has, not until we appeared here, I think if I'm correct, never raise the question of failing to object."
1968.492,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2915.431,2919.078,"Now, how do you interpret that judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio?"
1968.492,2,15598,allen_brown,,2919.078,2920.184,May it please the Court.
1968.492,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2952.278,2953.39,I see.
1968.492,2,15598,allen_brown,,2953.39,2953.545,The --
1968.492,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2953.545,2958.953,"So, that that's to say then in your view that judgment should be --"
1968.492,2,15598,allen_brown,,2958.953,2959.423,Considered to (Voice Overlap).
1968.492,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2959.423,2963.921,-- read as a determination on the merits of the constitutional questions.
1968.492,2,15598,allen_brown,,2963.921,2964.565,Now --
1968.492,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2964.565,2968.149,"Its just boilerplate in the Supreme Court of Ohio, isn't it?"
1968.492,2,15598,allen_brown,,2970.085,2975.446,That's boilerplate form when you're just turning it away on the merits of the substantive constitutional question.
1968.492,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2975.446,2985.484,You mentioned in your brief I think Mr. Brown that the reason there was no opinion in the Court of Appeals of Ohio was that the judge assigned to write the opinion died.
1968.492,2,15598,allen_brown,,2985.484,2987.039,Judge Holman and you know him.
1968.492,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2987.039,2987.435,Yes.
1968.492,2,15598,allen_brown,,2989.416,2990.243,No.
1968.492,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2992.118,2993.671,I see.
1968.492,2,15598,allen_brown,,2993.671,2997.449,Either it would not appear in official record in it.
1968.492,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2997.449,3009.061,"Was this a Kassay case back in 1932 the one that Judge Florence Allen wrote quite a eloquent dissenting, do you happen to remember?"
1968.492,2,15598,allen_brown,,3009.061,3011.661,I don't -- I don't remember a dissent at all.
1968.492,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3017.58,3019.712,"I don't -- perhaps, I'm thinking about different case."
1968.492,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3019.712,3024.373,"In Ohio, does everybody know who's been assigned to the opinion to write?"
1968.492,2,15598,allen_brown,,3024.373,3024.567,No.
1968.492,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3044.241,3046.968,What was the sentence in this case?
1968.492,2,15598,allen_brown,,3046.968,3048.892,The sentence was 1 to 10 years --
1968.492,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3048.892,3050.388,On each count?
1968.492,2,15598,allen_brown,,3050.388,3052.875,"On each count for $1,000.00 fine."
1968.492,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3052.875,3054.627,And concurrent?
1968.492,2,15598,allen_brown,,3054.627,3056.581,"Concurrent, yes."
1968.492,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3056.581,3059.278,So that the --
1968.492,2,15598,allen_brown,,3059.278,3072.038,"So, this man could potentially for this act of stupidity served under the laws of Ohio up to 20 -- oh, no 10 years maximum."
1968.492,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3072.038,3077.384,"Well, on your case you don't have to demonstrate that it says stupidity, do you?"
1968.492,2,15598,allen_brown,,3077.384,3077.65,No.
1968.492,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3216.028,3228.687,"Mr. Brown, before we conclude I just like to say to you that the Court appreciates your acceptance of our assignment to represent this indigent defendant."
1968.492,2,15598,allen_brown,,3233.448,3240.904,I should perhaps state for sake of the record that counsel for the appellant in no way agrees with any of the appellant's positions.
1968.492,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3244.815,3246.099,Thank you.
1968.492,3,34711,leonard_kirschner,,3252.878,3253.911,"Thank you, sir."
1968.492,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3253.911,3256.072,We'll adjourn.
