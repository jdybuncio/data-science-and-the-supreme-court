2012.12-547,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.904,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 12-547, Metrish v. Lancaster."
2012.12-547,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,8.12,10.889,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-547,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,93.593,95.212,200 years -- 200 years?
2012.12-547,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,96.012,96.428,Yes.
2012.12-547,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,107.468,115.89,There was some law in effect in Michigan on this subject from the year 1973 till the year 2001.
2012.12-547,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,131.099,133.285,It -- it changed one time.
2012.12-547,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,155.448,161.086,How -- how was the Michigan Court of Appeals construing the defense?
2012.12-547,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,166.656,179.897,"--Well, what the Michigan Court of Appeals did beginning in 1978 in the Mangiapane case was to ask, is diminished capacity part of the statutory code, and it never held expressly that it was."
2012.12-547,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,203.596,217.105,Was the 1973 case that you mentioned based on a statute or was it based on allegedly a vacuum that the statutory structure allowed the court to fill?
2012.12-547,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,226.278,239.538,"The 1973 case was a common law vacuum, Justice Kennedy, where the Michigan legislature had not yet spoken about mental incapacity defenses, and so it stood alone, as the court was able to do, as a common law decision."
2012.12-547,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,276.144,307.598,"Well, we don't -- well, we don't really have to reach this issue in this case, according to your submission, but what would happen if a State -- an intermediate State appellate court said the law is such-and-such, and then a -- a person is tried in the interim, is tried and subsequently, the State supreme court says that intermediate State court decision was incorrect, that never was the law of this State; the law was exactly the opposite."
2012.12-547,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,307.598,312.134,I think you would apply the same principles to that hypothetical as you did in Rogers.
2012.12-547,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,364.435,375.326,"Well, what I'm wondering is how we even get beyond the statement, the holding by a State supreme court regarding the -- the law of the State."
2012.12-547,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,387.634,390.669,"Justice Alito, I would think about it in -- in two pieces."
2012.12-547,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,435.031,441.119,"You -- you suggested, General, that the -- the fact that this is statutory makes your position easier."
2012.12-547,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,441.119,441.735,Yes.
2012.12-547,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,441.735,443.387,And I wonder if that's true.
2012.12-547,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,479.827,489.783,"Justice Kagan, I think this is the easiest case, because it's not just statutory interpretation; it's statutory interpretation of a statute that is just plain on its face."
2012.12-547,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,518.302,521.654,"Counsel, what about the Michigan Court of Appeals?"
2012.12-547,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,523.589,524.756,"--Correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.12-547,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,524.756,533.462,And so that court several times recognized diminished capacity as a defense.
2012.12-547,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,533.462,539.699,"Well, it -- it didn't recognize it as a defense in the sense that it analyzed the statute and said yes, the defense is available."
2012.12-547,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,565.333,566.333,The--
2012.12-547,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,566.333,566.833,So--
2012.12-547,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,566.833,579.891,--Your colleague said that there were 130 appellate decisions -- I take it that's the court of appeals decisions -- recognizing diminished capacity as a defense.
2012.12-547,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,579.891,582.259,--Recognizing it as a possible defense.
2012.12-547,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,625.186,632.691,"This -- that seems a little strange for the following reason, just as I think this case presents an example."
2012.12-547,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,695.649,698.234,"Well, two responses to that, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.12-547,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,727.653,728.403,"Well, I--"
2012.12-547,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,728.403,729.772,--because you would have to give statutory notice.
2012.12-547,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,730.389,744.549,"--I -- I would have thought your -- you can get to your second one, but I would have thought your first response to -- to the question would have been to deny that you say it's clear because the Supreme Court of Michigan has said so."
2012.12-547,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,748.667,750.102,"--Justice Scalia, that was my second point."
2012.12-547,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,750.102,751.152,"Ah, okay."
2012.12-547,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,757.439,758.458,It was clear.
2012.12-547,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,778.436,791.095,Are there any States with a statute identical or -- or close to the Michigan statute that have interpreted the statute to say it does include diminished capacity?
2012.12-547,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,791.095,792.595,"Justice Kennedy, I'm not aware of--"
2012.12-547,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,792.595,800.368,"This statute is -- fairly well tracks the common law tradition, which indicates that diminished capacity is not a defense."
2012.12-547,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,800.368,801.118,--Right.
2012.12-547,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,801.118,805.439,I'm just curious to know if any State courts have reached an opposite conclusion under a statute like that.
2012.12-547,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,805.439,811.343,I'm not aware of any other States that have the same statute and have addressed the question one way or the other.
2012.12-547,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,855.019,862.692,"Well, General, I guess I wonder whether it's relevant what the statute really says as opposed to what courts said it says."
2012.12-547,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,903.017,907.137,"Well, the expectation certainly is that people would rely on Michigan statutory law."
2012.12-547,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1026.048,1027.75,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1035.069,1038.021,Mr. Chief Justice -- excuse me -- and may it please the Court:
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1112.67,1113.736,He would have been able to raise it.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1124.81,1126.027,--That's correct.
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1126.027,1130.714,"He could have raised it, but if it went up to the Michigan Supreme Court, it would have had the same result as here."
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1130.714,1131.764,With all due respect--
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1131.764,1134.749,"And your only -- your only defense would have been, oh, it's a great surprise."
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1155.33,1162.518,"--With all due respect to opposing counsel, I -- the view -- our view of the law is -- is entirely different."
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1173.524,1188.134,Why do you say it was firmly -- do you -- do you contest the -- the assertion by the solicitor general that there is no case which -- which acknowledged and held the defense of diminished capacity?
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1188.134,1188.751,--I disagree.
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1188.751,1189.301,Is that wrong?
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1189.301,1189.736,Yes.
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1189.736,1190.653,What -- what case--
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1190.653,1192.77,"Well, first of all -- I'm sorry, Justice Scalia."
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1192.77,1194.82,--lets the defendant off on the basis of diminished capacity?
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1194.82,1197.822,The -- let somebody off?
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1199.008,1207.364,"What case has a holding, a holding that diminished capacity excuses the crime or mitigates the crime."
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1207.364,1208.13,--Mitigates.
2012.12-547,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1331.473,1336.96,"I think the question that was asked was, as a bottom line at the end of the day--"
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1336.96,1337.527,--Yes.
2012.12-547,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1337.527,1341.929,--did anybody get sentenced less?
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1357.958,1360.159,"Justice Ginsburg, I think that's a very important question."
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1397.999,1399.467,Or -- is that correct?
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1406.204,1410.592,"--I -- I respectfully submit that under Strickland analysis, no."
2012.12-547,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1427.535,1433.506,"Well, I'm -- I'm a little surprised at your answer and Justice Scalia's question indicates the same."
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1453.585,1476.285,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I believe that the basis for a remand in a case like this, and this is not an unusual kind of a situation in practice, is where the law is clear, then the remand is to determine the factual basis for the defendant's claim, were the facts such that a reasonably competent attorney should have been expected to investigate and -- and raise it."
2012.12-547,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1476.285,1480.253,"You said your view of the law was, you know, so well-established--"
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1480.253,1480.887,Yes.
2012.12-547,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1480.887,1481.438,--as to be beyond question.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1483.171,1484.14,Well -- I'm sorry.
2012.12-547,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1484.14,1487.425,"You have to be -- you have to be -- you have to be that right to prevail, right?"
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1487.425,1492.56,What I have to establish is that the decision of the Michigan Court of Appeals here was objectively unreasonable.
2012.12-547,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1551.866,1556.57,In Griffin -- you describe Griffin in your brief as follows:
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1569.144,1569.746,--Yes.
2012.12-547,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1569.746,1570.396,“ And insanity ”.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1574.364,1575.198,And that's why in my--
2012.12-547,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1575.198,1576.4,It was insanity in general.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1576.4,1578.516,"--No, it was both."
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1611.323,1627.499,"Mr. Mogill, as -- as I understand your burden here, it's -- it's not enough to show that Michigan law seemed to be what you -- what you say it was; but it has to have been--"
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1627.499,1628.083,Yes.
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1628.083,1629.285,--what you say it was.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1629.285,1629.918,Yes.
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1629.918,1633.253,And it -- there was an evulsive change by the supreme court.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1633.253,1635.522,"I agree with that, Justice Scalia."
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1638.224,1643.276,"It's -- it's hard to believe that, given -- given the clear text of the statute."
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1643.276,1655.685,"--The problem, I -- I respectfully submit, is that nobody in Michigan until Carpenter -- and -- and I -- it -- that sounds like an extreme statement, but again the record is clear."
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1684.036,1696.143,"Now, if -- if a prosecutor raised that objection knowing that the court of appeals would -- would reverse the exclusion, right -- I mean, it's clear what the court of appeals would have done, right?"
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1696.143,1697.179,Yes.
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1697.179,1705.033,"And once the court of appeals reversed it and said the trial was infected with that error, could -- could the defendant be retried?"
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1705.033,1707.051,The -- what would happen--
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1707.051,1714.205,Because he's -- he's convicted and the -- I'm sorry -- he's -- he's--
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1714.205,1718.093,"--Convicted, convicted of second instead of first; could he be tried on first?"
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1718.093,1718.909,--That's right.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1718.909,1719.376,No.
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1720.159,1720.911,Could he be retried?
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1720.911,1722.045,"On first, no."
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1722.695,1725.597,"Well, then -- then you would be crazy to raise it as a prosecutor."
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1725.597,1726.047,--No.
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1756.634,1758.753,He could get an -- an interlocutory appeal on that?
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1758.753,1759.336,Absolutely.
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1759.336,1760.02,Okay.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1760.02,1764.99,And -- and I will tell you the prosecutors in Michigan are aggressive in -- in seeking interlocutory appeals.
2012.12-547,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1777.714,1778.831,How many holdings are there?
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1778.831,1781.683,There are many mentions with the -- the holdings--
2012.12-547,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1781.683,1783.635,"I take it the answer is zero, right?"
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1784.235,1784.735,--No.
2012.12-547,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1784.735,1787.82,--I looked at your brief and then I looked at their brief and they say the answer is zero.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1787.82,1789.122,Lynch is a holding.
2012.12-547,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1789.122,1797.295,"And the -- the holding is that -- the pure holding would be if the trial court judge says no, you cannot raise it."
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1801.663,1802.197,Yes.
2012.12-547,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1802.197,1806.15,And then he says to the appellate court: They wouldn't let me raise it.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1809.935,1811.887,"And that's exactly Lynch, Justice Breyer."
2012.12-547,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1811.887,1812.787,That is Lynch.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1813.854,1815.106,1973.
2012.12-547,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1815.106,1816.572,In 1973.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1817.958,1819.841,And -- I'm sorry.
2012.12-547,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1819.841,1822.843,And -- and was there any other case in 1973 -- this is 10 years before.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1830.682,1832.801,I -- I'm not aware--
2012.12-547,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1832.801,1834.201,"No, but we -- we have Lynch on one side."
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1855.047,1858.516,"--The answer to your question, Justice Breyer, is there is no such case."
2012.12-547,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1859.301,1859.768,Okay.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1865.522,1866.905,--'93 was the offense.
2012.12-547,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1866.905,1867.905,--Carpenter.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1867.905,1869.071,"No, 2001 was Carpenter--"
2012.12-547,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1869.071,1869.638,2001.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1870.023,1870.807,--The offense was '93.
2012.12-547,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1870.807,1879.979,"There is exactly one case on point which does favor you, and there are zero cases that favor them; is that right?"
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1879.979,1884.331,If you talk holding only and if you discount Mangiapane.
2012.12-547,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1884.331,1889.668,"Well, Mangiapane was a -- a lot of words, but the holding was not notice; isn't that right?"
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1889.668,1893.988,The holding was he didn't -- but there was no reason for the court--
2012.12-547,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1893.988,1894.555,Okay.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1894.555,1897.274,--to reach that question unless diminished capacity exists.
2012.12-547,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1897.274,1897.69,So we've got one.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1898.99,1899.29,Thank you.
2012.12-547,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1899.29,1902.492,"The state of the art is one for you, zero for them."
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1902.492,1904.178,"If I can supplement that, Justice Breyer."
2012.12-547,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1904.178,1905.844,Yes.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1905.844,1917.937,"One of the things -- one of the points this Court looked to in Rogers was how many times the year-and-a-day rule had been “ mentioned ”, and that -- this is -- that's this Court's word -- in Tennessee decisions."
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1930.161,1935.732,Was that -- how often was it mentioned in intermediate court opinions?
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1935.732,1947.088,"--We have 4 mentions in the Michigan Supreme Court and 33 in the Michigan Court of Appeals between 1975 and 1993, and we have over 100 -- about 100--"
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1947.088,1949.573,Four mentions in the supreme court that say what?
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1949.573,1950.908,"--Well, Griffin is one of them."
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1951.758,1952.158,Yes.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1952.158,1952.592,--Yes.
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1952.592,1968.453,Have we ever held that a State law has been determined to be X simply because intermediate State courts have uniformly held it to be X?
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1971.421,1973.571,I don't know of a particular case.
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1988.867,1989.817,It doesn't mean it's right.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1989.817,1990.55,--No.
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1991.35,1992.685,You have to show it's right.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1992.685,1994.135,"--No, I have to show that it is the law of the--"
2012.12-547,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1994.135,1994.854,That it's the law.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,1994.854,1996.603,--I have to show that it is the law of the State.
2012.12-547,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2002.607,2003.157,Could you -- I'm sorry.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2003.626,2011.196,"When -- when Lynch was decided, it wasn't acting on something new."
2012.12-547,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2028.675,2035.079,"Well, but the Lynch -- the Lynch case was 2 years before the Michigan legislature adopted--"
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2035.079,2035.779,Yes.
2012.12-547,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2035.779,2036.847,"--the statute that we are dealing with here, right?"
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2036.847,2037.23,Yes.
2012.12-547,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2037.23,2041.399,"And that's where you are putting, if not all of your eggs, most of your eggs, right?"
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2041.399,2045.434,"No, I'm -- that -- that is -- that's an egg, and I think I've got a pretty full basket."
2012.12-547,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2045.434,2045.967,"Well, that's the -- that's the whole case."
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2055.29,2058.925,I disagree with that statement by brother counsel.
2012.12-547,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2063.479,2065.264,"Well, but you'll at least -- well, maybe not."
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2077.988,2084.576,I would if the facts of the subsequent litigation supported that interpretation of the statute.
2012.12-547,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2089.13,2090.246,I'm talking about Lynch.
2012.12-547,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2090.246,2105.989,"There were no others, and now I've reduced your one to nothing to like.01 to nothing, because it favors you, Lynch, yes, as the Chief Justice just pointed out, and now you've already said there were no other cases."
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2105.989,2107.007,--No other holdings.
2012.12-547,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2115.28,2117.08,"That's -- that's your whole point, isn't it?"
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2117.08,2117.897,Yes.
2012.12-547,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2117.897,2130.873,"You can't prove a negative, because if everybody accepts after Mangiapane that the defense exists then trial courts are not going to be excluding it on the basis that the statute excludes it."
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2130.873,2132.223,Absolutely.
2012.12-547,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2132.223,2133.992,That's the whole point you are making.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2133.992,2140.729,"And which gets me to -- to Rogers, and -- and we turn to the questions of fundamental fairness."
2012.12-547,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2140.729,2146.049,Do you have any -- is there any evidence of a trial court holding an exclusion?
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2146.049,2147.032,There is nothing.
2012.12-547,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2147.032,2149.168,Or even suggesting one?
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2149.168,2160.809,"It -- it is so extreme, Justice Sotomayor, that even in Carpenter itself, the prosecution did not contest the admissibility of diminished capacity evidence as a trial court--"
2012.12-547,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2160.809,2164.678,"But that's because -- everybody agrees with you, I think -- I agree with you on this anyway."
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2202.219,2219.181,"--Well, with all due respect, the standard that this Court set in Rogers is whether the -- the decision of Carpenter, in this case, would have been unforeseeable and indefensible by reference to the law as previously expressed so that it could be applied retroactively."
2012.12-547,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2219.181,2223.966,Can you think of a Federal case where -- I see what we have.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2238.575,2241.075,"No, the Michigan Supreme Court did mention it favorably as well."
2012.12-547,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2241.075,2241.71,Okay.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2247.431,2248.864,Rogers?
2012.12-547,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2248.864,2249.381,"Yeah, Rogers."
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2251.233,2254.018,I think the principle that the Court established there was very much--
2012.12-547,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2254.018,2254.468,All right.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2262.606,2275.414,"--I think the closest point, and it's important, and it goes, Justice Scalia, to respond to your point about lower court -- reliance on lower court opinions, is in Lanier, when the question concerned what's the scope of the statute that's at issue here."
2012.12-547,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2289.024,2295.578,"If you -- if you prevail here, it may well change the dynamic for State supreme courts."
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2339.94,2343.308,"--Justice Kennedy, thank you for that question, but I respectfully disagree."
2012.12-547,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2387.504,2388.304,"Well, what is the unfairness--"
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2388.304,2388.837,--I'm sorry?
2012.12-547,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2388.837,2390.289,--What is the unfairness here?
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2391.639,2394.375,"There's not a reliance, nor is that an element--"
2012.12-547,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2394.375,2395.693,What is the -- so what is the unfairness here?
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2395.693,2400.579,"--In both -- in both Bouie and Rogers, this Court made it clear that reliance is not an issue."
2012.12-547,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2426.812,2436.77,But this -- the case is -- is very different from Bouie which you -- which you rely on.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2478.947,2494.107,"Yeah, I agree with that, Justice Ginsburg, except that at footnote 5 in Bouie, this Court explicitly rejected the notion that subjective reliance by the accused is -- is even an aspect of the test for determining--"
2012.12-547,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2494.107,2497.743,"--It -- it isn't subjective reliance, it's -- it's what was the law."
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2497.743,2498.345,--And--
2012.12-547,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2498.345,2506.331,The Court said that the State supreme court interpretation of the statute was quite a surprise.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2506.331,2507.064,--Yes.
2012.12-547,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2554.029,2562.835,"I -- I don't see how the question can be whether there was a change in Michigan law, because we can't second-guess the Michigan Supreme Court about what Michigan law was."
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2587.568,2603.495,"--I would be happy to, Justice Alito, but first I want to address your point about having to rely on Michigan Supreme Court's determination of Michigan law, because this Court has made it very clear that you can't let a State court relabel something in a way that avoids Federal constitutional review."
2012.12-547,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2623.226,2624.992,So two -- two dissents is what you're relying on?
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2624.992,2625.693,--I'm sorry?
2012.12-547,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2652.928,2665.169,"Well, I think you're -- what you're arguing is that under certain -- in evaluating certain constitutional claims, the -- the question of what State law is is not dispositive."
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2670.056,2679.078,--This Court certainly does not have a right to tell the Michigan Supreme Court going forward what State law is with respect to diminished capacity.
2012.12-547,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2679.362,2680.878,"Well, I mean, suppose this were a diversity case."
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2694.855,2695.238,--No.
2012.12-547,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2699.159,2702.694,"It's not -- it's not this case, because there, you're trying to figure out what State law is."
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2704.594,2706.496,--We're trying -- we're applying a constitutional principle--
2012.12-547,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2706.496,2708.681,So what is that -- that gets me to the second part of my question.
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2708.681,2709.331,"--Yes, exactly."
2012.12-547,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2709.331,2714.852,What is the -- the constitutional principle that doesn't depend on what State law was?
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2714.852,2736.248,"The constitutional principle is that Respondent had a right to present a defense that existed at the time of his offense, unless it was clearly unforeseeable -- excuse me -- unless it was unforeseeable and -- and indefensible by reference to law that had been expressed prior to the time of the conduct, that that law might change, which we don't have here."
2012.12-547,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2775.673,2777.309,"This is -- this is the due process issue, right?"
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2777.309,2778.275,--It's -- that's exactly--
2012.12-547,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2778.275,2779.711,So why is it unfair?
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2802.241,2810.963,"--The unfairness is because it was sufficiently well-established, it was thoroughly well-established as a matter of Michigan law, so Respondent and everybody else in Michigan had a right to rely on it."
2012.12-547,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2827.008,2842.018,"The alternative is you are going to allow the bar associations, helpful as they are, by writing instructions to determine issues that courts themselves have never determined, or at least not authoritative supreme courts."
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2850.04,2858.979,"If I can briefly -- quickly respond, Justice Breyer, the -- I disagree that we're -- that I'm in any way suggesting turning anything over to the Bar Association."
2012.12-547,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2870.954,2872.021,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-547,1,33916,kenneth_m_mogill,,2872.021,2875.356,Thank you very much.
2012.12-547,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2875.356,2877.191,"Mr. Bursch, you have 13 minutes remaining."
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,2877.191,2879.227,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-547,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2911.781,2912.848,I think he contested that.
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,2925.021,2927.207,I did not hear him say that.
2012.12-547,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2933.527,2934.194,I hate just to interrupt you.
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,2934.194,2934.811,--Sure.
2012.12-547,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2934.811,2938.431,He did challenge my premise when I presented that to him.
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,2938.431,2938.815,Okay.
2012.12-547,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2938.815,2940.265,So I do think he disagrees with it.
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,2940.265,2941.717,"Well, then I disagree with that."
2012.12-547,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2963.981,2971.152,"Is this -- is this a one of a kind, in that, whatever the law was, it's clear from 2001 on?"
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,2982.877,2992.666,"I'm -- I'm not aware of any, Justice Ginsburg, and -- and the reason for that -- that quirk is because his habeas process by coincidence happened to take such a long time."
2012.12-547,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3013.746,3026.571,"But was there anyone prior to 2001 who couldn't raise a defense like this, who was precluded from doing so because a court thought, oh, you know, the -- the statute really clears the field, and -- and this defense is not available?"
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3028.239,3030.941,"We can't point to anything, just like they can't point to anything."
2012.12-547,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3033.643,3035.929,I guess they can point to just a lot of people who were raising this defense.
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3035.929,3036.412,--Right.
2012.12-547,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3061.041,3061.608,Why -- why was it--
2012.12-547,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3061.608,3062.31,This is -- I'm sorry.
2012.12-547,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3062.31,3064.177,--why was it the right case?
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3065.929,3074.718,"Well, you know, it could be because the Michigan Supreme Court thought, you know, there's enough confusion, because of the mentions in the lower court, that it's time that -- that we address this."
2012.12-547,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3150.951,3159.807,"Do you have any idea, a rough estimate, how many cases there were between, say, '75 and '93 where this defense was raised?"
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3159.807,3162.343,"--Well, all we have are the mentions in the appellate courts."
2012.12-547,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3162.343,3163.176,You do know about how many?
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3165.378,3168.33,"About 37, I believe."
2012.12-547,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3213.442,3224.749,"You -- you rely on Reese as establishing the principle that you cannot supplement the defenses in a criminal statute, but Reese was a 2012 case."
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3224.749,3225.433,Right.
2012.12-547,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3239.093,3240.476,Do you have something like in the middle?
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3243.478,3244.711,--There are many cases in the middle.
2012.12-547,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3256.369,3256.986,I'm sorry.
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3267.508,3268.025,Right.
2012.12-547,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3270.644,3274.246,"No, no, but you're saying to me it was wrongly decided under this general Michigan--"
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3274.246,3274.829,"Oh, no, no, no."
2012.12-547,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3298.527,3306.181,"If you were representing a defendant in this position, you certainly would have raised the diminished capacity defense prior to Carpenter, wouldn't you?"
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3306.181,3306.764,Undoubtedly.
2012.12-547,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3316.839,3320.957,"And if you were a prosecutor, you would not have objected to that defense, would you have?"
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3320.957,3322.059,"Well, I don't know."
2012.12-547,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3324.928,3325.594,Do you have any--
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3325.594,3326.078,--and I probably would have--
2012.12-547,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3326.078,3328.88,--have any reason to think that any prosecutor ever objected to such a defense?
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3328.88,3330.346,--I don't know one way or the other.
2012.12-547,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3335.8,3345.323,"I assume you'd need a case in which the prosecutor was pretty, pretty clear that a diminished capacity defense would prevail."
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3348.441,3349.376,--That's exactly right.
2012.12-547,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3349.376,3351.495,--But what's in the 37 cases then?
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3359.815,3366.652,"No, I don't believe that there was a single case in those 37 where someone tried to raise the defense and the court said no."
2012.12-547,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3375.408,3375.958,Yeah.
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3375.958,3377.527,"But the question was, did they give notice?"
2012.12-547,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3387.299,3389.584,Just to go back to Justice Breyer's question.
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3399.506,3403.258,"You know, all we've got are the appellate decisions referencing it."
2012.12-547,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3403.258,3403.758,Right.
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3403.758,3405.094,So if we've got 37 cases--
2012.12-547,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3405.094,3407.629,You can't really tell because nobody was objecting to anything--
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3407.629,3407.912,--Correct.
2012.12-547,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3407.912,3408.629,--right?
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3408.629,3413.199,"So you've got 37 cases over a course of 18 years, '75 to -- to '93."
2012.12-547,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3501.321,3504.357,You want us to say “ yet again ” when we write our opinion?
2012.12-547,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3504.357,3505.292,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2012.12-547,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3511.363,3512.279,"Thank you, counsel."
