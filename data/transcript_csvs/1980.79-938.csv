1980.79-938,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.337,We'll hear arguments next in Allstate Insurance Company against Lavinia Hague.
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,70.577,73.529,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-938,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,98.83,99.714,A Minnesota representative?
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,99.714,100.699,--Pardon?
1980.79-938,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,100.699,102.366,A Minnesota representative?
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,102.366,103.317,A Minnesota representative.
1980.79-938,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,103.317,104.833,Was there ever a probate in Wisconsin?
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,104.833,115.875,"The record is unclear but I think we can presume that there was, because at the time of the incident they resided there and they owned a home there."
1980.79-938,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,115.875,117.958,What was the purpose of the Minnesota probate?
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,117.958,120.843,I think... perhaps I could answer this--
1980.79-938,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,120.843,122.629,Perhaps we could ask your opponent on this one.
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,122.629,124.481,--I think it's best to ask my opponent.
1980.79-938,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,149.179,154.75,That's why I asked whether there was a Wisconsin probate.
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,154.75,155.4,Yes.
1980.79-938,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,262.036,265.238,"Well, before you get into that let me ask a question or two."
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,275.694,278.896,"I don't know, and the record doesn't reflect."
1980.79-938,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,278.896,289.269,"What happens when a policy is issued, for instance, in the District of Columbia, where automobiles almost daily cross over into Virginia and Maryland?"
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,294.923,305.113,"I don't know the answer to that, but Minnesota courts seem to indicate that they are and they seem to make the admission that they are."
1980.79-938,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,315.152,321.491,"Suppose this accident had taken place in Red Wing, on the Minnesota side of the Eisenhower Bridge."
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,325.527,336.25,"I think that Watson might preclude us from being here: this Court's case, Watson v. Employer's."
1980.79-938,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,336.25,339.536,"And the accident took place on the, just barely on the Wisconsin side?"
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,341.136,342.904,"It was a bordering... yes, it was a bordering state."
1980.79-938,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,349.992,352.594,"Well, it's like any other line-drawing, isn't it?"
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,354.629,354.962,That's right.
1980.79-938,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,589.914,597.62,"Mr. Nolan, you referred to Savchuk and I think Volkswagen is probably along the same lines."
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,601.638,602.488,Yes.
1980.79-938,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,602.488,603.357,--over a party.
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,629.908,630.574,That's correct.
1980.79-938,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,667.431,672.151,Did the policy have any provision as to which law would apply?
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,672.151,676.12,No it had no... no clause in it.
1980.79-938,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,676.12,677.322,"That would have been an easy way out for Allstate, wouldn't it?"
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,677.322,677.955,"Yes, it would."
1980.79-938,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,677.955,684.543,"As to both states and both parties, they were equally accessible; right?"
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,689.78,690.713,No.
1980.79-938,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,690.713,693.648,So there was no problem there.
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,693.648,694.281,No.
1980.79-938,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,694.281,699.802,In what county of Wisconsin were--
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,699.802,702.337,"Pierce County, I believe we're talking about."
1980.79-938,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,706.705,707.205,--That's a border county?
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,707.205,707.855,--Pardon?
1980.79-938,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,707.855,709.157,That's a border county?
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,709.157,710.307,That is a border county; yes.
1980.79-938,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,710.307,714.145,"This wouldn't go as far as Alaska, would it?"
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,714.145,715.178,Pardon?
1980.79-938,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,715.178,717.18,"Wouldn't go as far as Alaska, would it?"
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,717.18,720.132,"You mean, this case?"
1980.79-938,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1039.337,1047.343,"Minnesota is free to adopt Professor Leflar's test whether we think it is a wise one or not, unless it somehow offends the Constitution."
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,1047.343,1048.009,--Exactly.
1980.79-938,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1070.708,1073.243,This brings me back to my rate question.
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,1085.651,1087.836,"Would the wording of the policy be any different, you mean?"
1980.79-938,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1087.836,1089.47,Or the rate be any different?
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,1089.47,1100.493,"I personally do not know, but, again, the Minnesota court indicated in their opinion, they seem to concede that it would."
1980.79-938,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1111.285,1119.855,"Well, sometimes policies do vary from state to state, and I... but I wondered whether this record showed anything on that."
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,1121.891,1136.733,"No, the record was submitted on stipulated facts and it did not include that and the Minnesota Supreme Court did not ask for that, but they... I think the law of the case would presume that they felt it would make a difference."
1980.79-938,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1136.733,1141.97,"If it did, if Minnesota rates were higher, that would have been a factor in your favor had it been in the record."
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,1141.97,1142.62,Yes.
1980.79-938,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1142.62,1161.199,"Would the, would such an element as the age in which one state sold intoxicating liquors to persons have some bearing on rates?"
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,1170.657,1173.441,I frankly do not know.
1980.79-938,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1190.368,1203.128,"On the basis of massive information on the subject, couldn't any court take judicial notice that intoxicating liquors have a very serious effect on automobile accidents?"
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,1203.128,1203.628,"Yes, I think... yes."
1980.79-938,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1224.291,1235.247,"Mr. Nolan, if you would help me with the other... I was thinking about the contractual aspect of this for a moment."
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,1254.477,1254.694,Right.
1980.79-938,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1254.694,1256.263,--And there was... or are there three policies here?
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,1256.263,1257.213,Three policies here.
1980.79-938,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1257.213,1271.688,"And you're saying that in Wisconsin he could only recover on one because Wisconsin in effect as a matter of law imposes a condition in the contract that says, even if you take out three or four more policies with uninsured motorist clauses in them, they don't mean what they appear to say?"
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,1271.688,1274.974,"But... well, it's--"
1980.79-938,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1274.974,1276.124,Is that what it is?
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,1276.124,1278.259,--They don't quite phrase it that way.
1980.79-938,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1278.259,1284.246,"I know, but I'm just... that's, I'm just trying to see what kind of obligation is being changed here by Minnesota."
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,1284.246,1302.458,"Minnesota... take the... in both contracts, I think it's safe to say, whether it was written in Minnesota, it would merely say that under this coverage you have uninsured motorist coverage of X amount, $15,000 in this case, on one vehicle."
1980.79-938,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1307.028,1307.361,I see.
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,1307.361,1308.528,--on three separate vehicles.
1980.79-938,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1328.025,1336.881,"It's a question of whether the policy should be construed as limited to the vehicle described in that policy or without saying anything pick up other vehicles and additional coverage, then?"
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,1336.881,1337.265,--That's right.
1980.79-938,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1337.265,1337.915,I see.
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,1337.915,1338.498,That's right.
1980.79-938,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1338.498,1339.514,I think that you said the other way around.
1980.79-938,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1339.514,1346.252,"Mr. Nolan, a good many states, I think, require uninsured motorist insurance--"
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,1346.252,1347.52,That's correct.
1980.79-938,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1347.52,1352.822,--Do either of these states require it as a matter of law for policies written in them?
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,1352.822,1355.608,I believe they do.
1980.79-938,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1381.741,1382.774,Do you know whether they were different?
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,1385.026,1398.684,"--I don't know with regard to that, to the part of whether in Wisconsin and Minnesota at the same time the law was that you had to reject uninsured motorist or you got it as opposed to just having to make it available."
1980.79-938,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1398.684,1406.289,Wouldn't that appear from the statutes of the two states or from the regulations of the insurance commissioners?
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,1406.289,1407.039,"Yes, it would."
1980.79-938,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1407.039,1408.408,It'd be a matter of record somewhere?
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,1408.408,1409.341,It would be a matter of record.
1980.79-938,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1409.341,1418.53,"In this case, of course, the uninsured person, or the person who had the policy, wasn't in any of the three vehicles on which he had the insurance?"
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,1418.53,1422.749,"No, he was not, and both the vehicles involved were uninsured."
1980.79-938,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1440.46,1441.51,Right.
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,1441.51,1453.268,"The last area... or excuse me, I guess I wandered from Professor Leflar."
1980.79-938,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1600.847,1602.299,"Mr. Nolan, is there a shortage of... in Minnesota?"
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,1602.299,1604.251,"No, I think there's an abundance of them."
1980.79-938,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1604.251,1605.418,"I mean, I was just wondering."
1980.79-938,0,36402,mark_m_nolan,,1607.12,1610.822,"I'd like to save the rest of my time, if there are no questions, for rebuttal."
1980.79-938,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1610.822,1611.938,Very well Mr. Nolan.
1980.79-938,1,16477,andreas_f_lowenfeld,,1615.024,1619.928,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-938,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1711.037,1722.828,"Do these distances make a difference in applying choice of law concepts or do lines, boundaries on maps?"
1980.79-938,1,16477,andreas_f_lowenfeld,,1722.828,1734.136,"Well, I'm suggesting, Your Honor, that in a constitutional sense what you have to look at is the interest of the two states."
1980.79-938,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1734.136,1745.675,"Well, what if the accident had happened at, up at Superior, Wisconsin, instead of where it did, 150 miles north?"
1980.79-938,1,16477,andreas_f_lowenfeld,,1747.211,1752.68,"I think not necessarily, if it turns out that--"
1980.79-938,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1752.68,1753.397,Or make it on the other end.
1980.79-938,1,16477,andreas_f_lowenfeld,,1756.316,1760.703,--I'm sorry to say I'm not as prepared on the geography of Wisconsin as Mr. Chief Justice.
1980.79-938,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1760.703,1761.42,One is on the east and one is on the west.
1980.79-938,1,16477,andreas_f_lowenfeld,,1761.42,1768.79,"But I think what we're focusing on what the Supreme Court of Minnesota focused on, was its own interests."
1980.79-938,2,36402,mark_m_nolan,,3447.273,3456.379,"If I might respond and rebut quickly and briefly, I would like to answer Justice White's question by pointing out the ludicrousness of it."
1980.79-938,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3477.309,3481.796,"When you say, ludicrousness, you mean the ludicrousness of the result, not the ludicrousness of the question?"
1980.79-938,2,36402,mark_m_nolan,,3481.796,3484.229,That is so.
1980.79-938,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3484.229,3489.883,"But where do you find the word ""ludicrous"" in the Constitution?"
1980.79-938,2,36402,mark_m_nolan,,3489.883,3493.252,Where I find--
1980.79-938,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3493.252,3502.108,What's a... what would Allstate be deprived of if sued in Hawaii on this cause of action by a resident of Minnesota?
1980.79-938,2,36402,mark_m_nolan,,3502.108,3509.012,--Allstate would be deprived of due process and in this particular instance Wisconsin would--
1980.79-938,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3509.012,3509.245,How?
1980.79-938,2,36402,mark_m_nolan,,3509.862,3510.612,--be deprived of full faith and credit.
1980.79-938,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3510.612,3511.912,Why would it be deprived of due process?
1980.79-938,2,36402,mark_m_nolan,,3511.912,3513.814,Because there are no contacts--
1980.79-938,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3513.814,3516.932,"Please tell me if Dick does... why, what deprivation is that?"
1980.79-938,2,36402,mark_m_nolan,,3516.932,3530.775,"--There are no contacts with The State of Hawaii that gives them any interest over the State of, over Allstate's interest in writing this contract in conformity with Wisconsin's law."
1980.79-938,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3530.775,3536.31,"Well, would it be all right to be sued there in Hawaii as long as it applied Wisconsin's laws?"
1980.79-938,2,36402,mark_m_nolan,,3536.31,3538.029,I think they could.
1980.79-938,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3541.88,3542.447,"Well, suppose it was denied?"
1980.79-938,2,36402,mark_m_nolan,,3543.547,3548.618,--Then I think the result should be that they could hear the case but they should apply Wisconsin's law.
1980.79-938,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3548.618,3552.486,"--Well, what interest has Hawaii got in hearing that case?"
1980.79-938,2,36402,mark_m_nolan,,3552.486,3555.788,I don't think they have any interest and I would wonder why they would do it.
1980.79-938,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3564.208,3564.508,I am.
1980.79-938,2,36402,mark_m_nolan,,3564.508,3565.508,What should be the choice of law?

1980.79-938,2,36402,mark_m_nolan,,3566.308,3566.808,Okay.
1980.79-938,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3571.693,3573.812,Rather than just dismiss the case?
1980.79-938,2,36402,mark_m_nolan,,3573.812,3580.799,"Well, the... what they really... you've told me... I said that I would bring the motion for forum non conveniens."
1980.79-938,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3719.171,3723.325,"Well, if this accident had happened in Wisconsin--"
1980.79-938,2,36402,mark_m_nolan,,3723.325,3725.059,It did.
1980.79-938,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3725.059,3727.694,--had happened in Minnesota and--
1980.79-938,2,36402,mark_m_nolan,,3727.694,3727.86,Yes?
1980.79-938,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3727.86,3743.12,"--suit was in Wisconsin and the widow had not moved to Minnesota, she sued... probate in Wisconsin and sued in Wisconsin, would you say that the Wisconsin courts could apply either the Minnesota law or Wisconsin law?"
1980.79-938,2,36402,mark_m_nolan,,3743.12,3745.17,I would say that would be a closer case.
1980.79-938,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3746.572,3748.357,Is there always one answer to these questions?
1980.79-938,2,36402,mark_m_nolan,,3748.357,3749.84,"--No, there isn't; that's--"
1980.79-938,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3749.84,3758.646,"I mean, could it... aren't there some cases in which either... the law of either state could be applied without violating the Constitution?"
1980.79-938,2,36402,mark_m_nolan,,3758.646,3759.229,--Yes.
1980.79-938,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3777.691,3783.781,"Well, in Justice White's hypothetical, would the Full Faith and Credit... in Justice White's hypothetical, would the Full Faith and Credit Clause be involved?"

1980.79-938,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3795.069,3798.723,As I understand your argument in this case you do rely on the Full Faith and Credit Clause?
1980.79-938,2,36402,mark_m_nolan,,3798.723,3799.206,--Yes.
1980.79-938,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3799.206,3802.742,And you cited that what the Minnesota Supreme Court did violated that clause--
1980.79-938,2,36402,mark_m_nolan,,3802.742,3803.225,Yes.
1980.79-938,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3803.225,3808.062,--not giving... in giving weight to... with Nelson.

1980.79-938,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3821.102,3822.204,In the Federal Constitution?
1980.79-938,2,36402,mark_m_nolan,,3822.204,3827.691,"--I guess you would turn to Due Process; the contacts, whether the contacts were such."
1980.79-938,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3827.691,3829.074,But these cases do differ.
1980.79-938,2,36402,mark_m_nolan,,3829.074,3830.31,Yes.
1980.79-938,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3833.678,3835.812,"Thank you, gentlemen."
