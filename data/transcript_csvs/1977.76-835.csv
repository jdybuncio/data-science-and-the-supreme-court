1977.76-835,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,51.417,"We will hear arguments next in 76-835, United States against New York Telephone Company."
1977.76-835,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,55.014,58.642,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1977.76-835,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,389.255,397.551,"Then there just are no records, however, of a -- of a non-toll local calls made from an ordinary telephone?"
1977.76-835,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,397.551,400.587,There is no indication that there are such records here.
1977.76-835,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,412.035,414.983,"That may show the number of calls, but does not show the numbers called?"
1977.76-835,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,414.983,418.046,"In some telephone companies it does, that is my understanding."
1977.76-835,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,419.167,424.191,My experience was it was not possible to get those in response to a subpoena?
1977.76-835,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,424.191,430.617,"To the extent that they are available, they can be secured that way."
1977.76-835,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,433.275,446.946,"And your argument is, that this as I thought, the inference to be derived from your argument was this would provide a known -- more information and could have been secured by a subpoena and if (Voice Overlap)"
1977.76-835,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,446.946,447.457,That is right.
1977.76-835,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,451.346,453.306,"Well, to the extent they are and that is the whole --"
1977.76-835,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,453.306,453.749,That is correct.
1977.76-835,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,453.749,455.801,Critical if in -- in your argument?
1977.76-835,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,455.801,476.012,"Now, that is correct and that if the Pen Registered Devices often used by the telephone company to ascertain this kind of thing for billing purposes and to make its own records when it has or concerns relating to toll billing, but --"
1977.76-835,1,24890,george_e_ashley,,1771.289,1775.62,Mr. Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1963.436,1967.117,Did the Court of Appeals agree with you?
1977.76-835,1,24890,george_e_ashley,,1967.117,1973.428,"It agrees, I think that Title III is a very sweeping and very comprehensive in the scope."
1977.76-835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1978.465,1981.305,Is covered by Title III and you disagree with that?
1977.76-835,1,24890,george_e_ashley,,1981.305,1984.202,And we think that is certainly a serious question.
1977.76-835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1984.202,1987.103,"Well, are you entitled to urge that here?"
1977.76-835,1,24890,george_e_ashley,,1987.103,2003.287,We believe that it is implicit in the issue that is here because there would be no authority to order the telephone company to provide the lease line facilities unless the court also decides that the basic underlying order was properly granted.
1977.76-835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2003.287,2006.573,But the Court of Appeals' opinion is much narrower than that.
1977.76-835,1,24890,george_e_ashley,,2009.949,2010.623,"You are correct, Your Honor."
1977.76-835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2010.623,2015.093,"And if you wanted to challenge that, you really should have cross-petitioned I suppose?"
1977.76-835,1,24890,george_e_ashley,,2015.093,2022.363,"Well, it is my understanding that the -- that the government also believes that this is subsumed in the issue that it is before the Court --"
1977.76-835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2022.363,2024.178,The government does not mind this either?
1977.76-835,1,24890,george_e_ashley,,2024.178,2051.225,"No, I think that is true, but I think if the Court goes -- handles this case and passes upon the requirement that the telephone company provide lease line facilities under these circumstances, then it will for the first time really have come to grips with the issue as to whether Pen Register can be issued outside the scope of Title III and this Court up to that -- this time has not specifically addressed that."
1977.76-835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2051.225,2061.049,"Well, the Court of Appeals also thought that Rule 41 authorized issued some warrants for Pen Register, did not they?"
1977.76-835,1,24890,george_e_ashley,,2061.049,2061.917,Yes.
1977.76-835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2061.917,2063.137,And you disagree with that?
1977.76-835,1,24890,george_e_ashley,,2063.137,2063.893,"Yes, we do."
1977.76-835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2063.893,2068.652,And you are urging us to overturn the Court of Appeals in that regard?
1977.76-835,1,24890,george_e_ashley,,2068.652,2081.025,"We are saying that this case being properly before the Court, that that issue ought also be addressed head on by the Court because of the wide disagreement, not by Circuits, but there had been other --"
1977.76-835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2081.025,2083.315,But no one has challenged that rule here?
1977.76-835,1,24890,george_e_ashley,,2083.315,2085.869,"Well, Judge Oliver in the Western District of Missouri felt so."
1977.76-835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2085.869,2091.26,"I know, but nobody has presented that issue to us in any of the papers here?"
1977.76-835,1,24890,george_e_ashley,,2091.26,2095.187,I think the matter is fully briefed Your Honor and both the governmentâ€™s brief --
1977.76-835,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2095.187,2107.187,But if we agreed with you -- you would -- you would be enlarging the relief of that the Court of Appeals -- the Court of Appeals gave you?
1977.76-835,1,24890,george_e_ashley,,2110.149,2119.824,It would be finding that the basic underlying order is not warranted and that is not a finding that has been made by the Court below.
1977.76-835,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3905.848,3909.426,"I have three brief points, Mr. Chief Justice."
1977.76-835,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4056.817,4062.642,"The search warrant analogy, though you do not compel the person whose place is being searched to help you?"
1977.76-835,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4062.642,4071.312,"Well, this is -- it is not the individual whose telephone is being used, who is compelled to help in these circumstances, it is the telephone company who facilitates are being used."
1977.76-835,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4071.312,4076.881,"Well, if you are searching a hotel room, you do not commit or you do not order the proprietor of the hotel to help so?"
1977.76-835,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4076.881,4085.93,There maybe circumstances in which he can be asked to cooperate in executing the search if his help is needed to gain access.
1977.76-835,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4102.357,4104.645,You can require them to furnish a key to get in the room?
1977.76-835,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4104.645,4105.477,That is correct.
