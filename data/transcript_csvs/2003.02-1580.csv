2003.02-1580,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.538,"We'll hear argument next in No. 02-1580, Richard Vieth, et al. v. Robert Jubelirer."
2003.02-1580,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,66.38,69.103,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1580,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,90.158,93.873,"Well, do you... do you... do you think the lower courts then didn't follow Bandemer?"
2003.02-1580,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,96.474,111.129,"--Well, the standard that I think was... the proper reading of Bandemer does not require that you show that your members of your party have been completely disenfranchised, to the extent that African-Americans once were in the South, or that... that your party has effectively been banned."
2003.02-1580,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,138.827,142.17,Three of us in Bandemer thought the claim was not justiciable.
2003.02-1580,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,142.17,148.857,"Yes, Your Honor, and I would submit to you that... that... that history suggests that... that it... the Court should not go that direction, because--"
2003.02-1580,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,148.857,152.08,I was thinking history showed that was the way to go.
2003.02-1580,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,152.08,158.311,"--Well, what... what we've seen, Your Honor, because of the... the fact that the lower courts have effectively read... rendered--"
2003.02-1580,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,158.311,162.854,They couldn't... they can't reach a decision under that Bandemer standard.
2003.02-1580,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,169.662,177.714,"--Well, we've never had a... an opportunity for the lower courts to actually apply a standard that says when does the map become so unfair that it's anti-democratic?"
2003.02-1580,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,184.152,187.002,Let... let me tell you my concern with... with fairness.
2003.02-1580,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,251.108,265.225,"Well, Your Honor, what we... what we try to do is articulate a standard which is tied to the basic democratic values that are at stake and to the... and to the article I standard that says the people should ultimately be deciding who's going to be representing them in Congress, not the states."
2003.02-1580,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,267.166,282.702,"Well, since we're talking about article I, it also says that the times, place, and manners of holding elections for Senators and Representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature, but the Congress may, at any time, by law, make or alter such regulations."
2003.02-1580,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,284.438,307.86,"--Well, Your Honor, this Court held in Wesberry v. Sanders, and has since twice done... applied that again, both in Cook v. Gralike and the... and in the Term Limits case, that there are judicially enforceable limits on the extent to which a state, in exercising the procedural power to establish the times, places, and manners of congressional elections, can create an uneven playing field and attempt to try to dictate the outcome of an election."
2003.02-1580,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,307.86,312.401,"All right. But then the problem is that I think I have and others is, what are these standards?"
2003.02-1580,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,352.814,359.873,"Your Honor, that's... with... with all respect, I... I... first of all, we don't suggest that you should somehow look at the departure from historical lines."
2003.02-1580,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,360.699,366.56,You said look to see whether the traditional criteria are predominantly ignored.
2003.02-1580,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,366.56,367.015,--That's--
2003.02-1580,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,367.015,368.418,That's what I'm referring to.
2003.02-1580,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,368.418,368.501,--Okay.
2003.02-1580,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,370.32,370.492,I've read it.
2003.02-1580,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,370.896,376.181,Our... our standard on effects is that... does not suggest that politics should be taken out of this process.
2003.02-1580,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,377.75,378.122,"No, no."
2003.02-1580,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,382.291,392.488,"--The standard would be, under our... under our submission, can you demonstrate that it is absolute... that it is very clear that you could get more than half the votes and have no chance."
2003.02-1580,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,392.488,392.944,Always can.
2003.02-1580,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,392.944,393.11,No.
2003.02-1580,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,393.11,399.631,You can't draw a set of lines such that I couldn't imagine a voting pattern such that that wouldn't happen.
2003.02-1580,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,399.631,401.367,"But, you see, our standard is precisely the opposite."
2003.02-1580,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,409.047,411.935,"You're... you're just pulling this... you're just pulling this thing out of a hat, so to speak."
2003.02-1580,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,429.314,435.508,"Well, Your Honor, we... we focus on this 50/50 point, this majoritarian standard for two main reasons."
2003.02-1580,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,435.508,435.68,What... what--
2003.02-1580,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,435.68,441.369,"One is a... is a matter of principle, which is to say, when does consideration of politics go too far?"
2003.02-1580,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,443.848,444.591,--Well... well--
2003.02-1580,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,444.591,446.632,--we're having a minority party control the majority of seats.
2003.02-1580,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,446.632,451.278,"--Well, when you say, you know, the... the Constitution doesn't ever use the word democracy."
2003.02-1580,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,451.278,453.857,"Yes, but we... but we have a... we have a--"
2003.02-1580,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,453.857,454.622,Not to mention party.
2003.02-1580,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,454.622,455.177,Yeah.
2003.02-1580,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,455.177,461.642,--We have a commitment though to the... to the fact that the House of Representatives is supposed to mirror the people and is supposed to be--
2003.02-1580,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,461.642,462.18,Well--
2003.02-1580,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,462.18,463.173,--representative of the people.
2003.02-1580,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,463.173,463.378,"--Well, you... but--"
2003.02-1580,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,463.378,463.916,And we--
2003.02-1580,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,463.916,473.697,--The... the... the Constitution originally provided that the... the standard for the state vote would be the standard for the Representatives in Congress.
2003.02-1580,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,482.492,499.415,"--The reason we are focusing on the majority standard, the 50/50 standard, is in part because, as this Court has recognized in Wesberry and it's recognized in... in... in Cook and it's recognized in Thornton, the states are not supposed to be deciding for themselves who's going to be representing the people."
2003.02-1580,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,519.849,524.101,"It happens under a system of presidential electors too, as we recently saw."
2003.02-1580,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,525.959,526.514,"No, Your Honor."
2003.02-1580,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,562.989,567.819,"Yeah, but it's not... let... let me... you've got me up to the point of this 50/50 business."
2003.02-1580,1,31272,john_p_krill_jr,,1731.132,1739.289,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1580,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1777.684,1779.004,May I ask you kind of a preliminary question?
2003.02-1580,1,31272,john_p_krill_jr,,1811.863,1813.721,"--No, Your Honor."
2003.02-1580,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1823.092,1842.123,"Well, what if... what if they narrowed the allegation, said just district 6 or district 16 was clearly drawn for this purpose and no other, no neutral, no effort to be compact or contiguous or follow boundary lines or rivers or anything, we just want to get the maximum vote for one particular party here."
2003.02-1580,1,31272,john_p_krill_jr,,1843.897,1847.612,"--It... yes, I would, Your Honor."
2003.02-1580,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1867.47,1868.585,"No, it would just--"
2003.02-1580,1,31272,john_p_krill_jr,,1868.585,1869.949,Legislators are pulled in a million directions.
2003.02-1580,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1869.949,1891.042,"--It would just say to the... when you have a... a really strangely distorted district, the burden is on you to point out one neutral justification for it, and we'll assume that if you... you won't have to go into the minds of the legislature, just assume there is something we can point to, such as a boundary line or if it's fairly compact or it's... but you can't point to anything."
2003.02-1580,1,31272,john_p_krill_jr,,1902.104,1906.851,If... if the entire legislature en masse came forward and admitted that--
2003.02-1580,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1906.851,1907.306,Yes.
2003.02-1580,1,31272,john_p_krill_jr,,1907.306,1913.045,"--every legislator said, that's why I voted for it, Justice Stevens, I would still say it's a permissible legislative choice."
2003.02-1580,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1926.874,1930.301,Is there any duty at all to... any duty at all in drawing districts to try to do it impartially?
2003.02-1580,1,31272,john_p_krill_jr,,1931.044,1934.016,"Not constitutionally, Your Honor, but there are--"
2003.02-1580,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1934.016,1934.388,Yeah.
2003.02-1580,1,31272,john_p_krill_jr,,1934.388,1936.224,--political forces that pull them in--
2003.02-1580,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1936.224,1936.296,I understand that.
2003.02-1580,1,31272,john_p_krill_jr,,1936.296,1937.782,--in a multitude of directions.
2003.02-1580,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1937.782,1945.584,"But then on the Constitution, what about if the legislature decided that the salaries of the majority legislature should be 10 percent higher than the minority legislators?"
2003.02-1580,1,31272,john_p_krill_jr,,1945.584,1947.07,I--
2003.02-1580,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1947.07,1949.299,"There'd be a good reason for it, because they have more work to do."
2003.02-1580,1,31272,john_p_krill_jr,,1959.142,1965.896,"--I'm not sure that would prevent a... present a Federal question, Your Honor, but I'm... I'm certain that our supreme court in Pennsylvania would address it."
2003.02-1580,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1972.333,1975.184,But that the... all the members of the majority party?
2003.02-1580,1,31272,john_p_krill_jr,,1975.184,1975.76,No.
2003.02-1580,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1978.899,1981.007,Suppose I have in my--
2003.02-1580,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1981.007,1981.178,--Why not?
2003.02-1580,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1981.178,1981.75,"Oh, sorry."
2003.02-1580,1,31272,john_p_krill_jr,,2059.601,2059.974,All right.
2003.02-1580,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2077.025,2077.435,"Oh, I've rejected their test."
2003.02-1580,1,31272,john_p_krill_jr,,2077.435,2077.973,--Right.
2003.02-1580,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2077.973,2078.882,I've rejected their test.
2003.02-1580,1,31272,john_p_krill_jr,,2081.15,2081.772,But because--
2003.02-1580,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2081.772,2082.431,All right.
2003.02-1580,1,31272,john_p_krill_jr,,2093.947,2094.857,--All right.
2003.02-1580,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2228.733,2230.385,"Unkind of you to say it, sir, unkind of you."
2003.02-1580,2,29862,j_bart_delone,,2653.21,2654.962,"That's all right, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-1580,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2713.358,2718.521,"But Mr. DeLone, I... I think our rules say we frown on people simply reading their arguments."
2003.02-1580,2,29862,j_bart_delone,,2718.521,2719.097,"--Yes, Your Honor, I'm sorry."
2003.02-1580,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2742.437,2748.364,"Well, the... the... tell... answer... I'll ask you a question and then you will get away from your prepared argument."
2003.02-1580,2,29862,j_bart_delone,,2748.364,2748.902,--Thank you.
2003.02-1580,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2748.902,2759.555,"But the... the... the... in... in my own view, not... not the Court's... in... in my own view in the positive discrimination race cases, I believed--"
2003.02-1580,2,29862,j_bart_delone,,2759.555,2761.374,The... the Whitcomb v. Chavis--
2003.02-1580,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2761.374,2769.009,"--The positive discrimination cases, the cases that say you cannot draw a racial district, racial, minority district--"
2003.02-1580,2,29862,j_bart_delone,,2769.009,2770.002,--The Shaw Line... the Shaw Line cases?
2003.02-1580,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2770.002,2770.124,"--Yes, correct."
2003.02-1580,2,29862,j_bart_delone,,2770.124,2770.496,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1580,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2770.496,2786.842,"I said you could, I thought that the legislature could do that, primarily because if they could do that in political party cases, why couldn't they do it in race cases where it's meant to help the minority?"
2003.02-1580,2,29862,j_bart_delone,,2817.307,2825.48,"Because, Your Honor, in the Shaw Line of cases, what they were doing is they were trying to isolate race from all other factors, including politics."
2003.02-1580,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2825.48,2830.31,"And in here, we're trying to... to isolate being a Democrat or being a Republican--"
2003.02-1580,2,29862,j_bart_delone,,2830.31,2831.053,"Yes, Your--"
2003.02-1580,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2831.053,2841.993,"--from all other factors, because after all, as Justice Stevens pointed out, they've been able to come up with no explanation other than we did it because they're Democrats."
2003.02-1580,2,29862,j_bart_delone,,2841.993,2842.736,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2003.02-1580,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2842.736,2844.677,That's what the word predominate means--
2003.02-1580,2,29862,j_bart_delone,,2844.677,2844.86,--Right.
2003.02-1580,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2844.86,2846.33,--and you'd insist on that showing--
2003.02-1580,2,29862,j_bart_delone,,2846.33,2847.156,"But, but Your--"
2003.02-1580,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2847.156,2850.499,--just as you do insist on the predominant showing in the race case.
2003.02-1580,2,29862,j_bart_delone,,2850.499,2856.815,"--But, Your Honor, assuming that to be correct, there's nothing wrong with them saying, we did it just because they're Democrats."
2003.02-1580,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2856.815,2867.711,"Ah, yes, there is, because what's wrong with it is if you carry it to an extreme with computers, you prevent the majority of voters from securing the majority of seats."
2003.02-1580,2,29862,j_bart_delone,,2878.296,2882.079,"Well, I think you have to... you have to look at what majority you're talking about, Your Honor."
2003.02-1580,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2887.818,2888.023,Correct.
2003.02-1580,2,29862,j_bart_delone,,2912.998,2916.425,"But, Your Honor, if you're doing that, you're... you're... you're going into proportionality."
2003.02-1580,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2918.942,2920.307,"No, no proportionality."
2003.02-1580,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2931.203,2937.807,Do... do people always vote for a particular candidate because he's a Republican or... or... or she's a Democrat?
2003.02-1580,2,29862,j_bart_delone,,2937.807,2939.293,"--Absolutely not, Your Honor, and that--"
2003.02-1580,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2939.293,2939.559,Of course not.
2003.02-1580,2,29862,j_bart_delone,,2945.116,2955.89,"--Exactly right, Your Honor, and that's why the idea of comparing any sort of statewide vote with the districting votes that you actually have is inconsistent with--"
2003.02-1580,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2955.89,2965.633,"--Even if that's true, is it not obvious from the configuration of some of the districts, that those who drafted the districts thought they could predict what they were going to do?"
2003.02-1580,2,29862,j_bart_delone,,2965.633,2969.059,"--Again, Your Honor, assuming that that's correct, there's nothing wrong with it."
2003.02-1580,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2969.059,2969.968,"Oh, okay."
2003.02-1580,2,29862,j_bart_delone,,2969.968,2994.201,"And as far as the... the... what level you come to in a... in a majority/minority consignment, Justice Breyer, I think the way that the Bandemer plurality did it, again, applying what this Court has consistently applied in vote... in the vote dilution cases, by which I mean the Whitcomb v. Chavis line of cases, is to say, all right, let's look at this and see if it's like a diagnostic test, like a threshold."
2003.02-1580,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3029.002,3035.689,Do you agree with your colleague that there is no need for any neutral justification when you're drawing districts?
2003.02-1580,2,29862,j_bart_delone,,3058.269,3059.012,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1580,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3078.414,3086.466,"But if you take that position, then you must be taking the position, I guess you are, that the... the holding in Bandemer that this was a just... justiciable issue is just erroneous?"
2003.02-1580,2,29862,j_bart_delone,,3086.466,3088.574,"--Your Honor, we think that--"
2003.02-1580,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3088.574,3089.317,That's your basic position?
2003.02-1580,2,29862,j_bart_delone,,3089.317,3096.542,--We certainly think that the Court should take this opportunity to find that... that... that political gerrymandering is non-justiciable.
2003.02-1580,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3118.257,3119.372,May I ask you this?
2003.02-1580,2,29862,j_bart_delone,,3125.028,3129.031,"I heard you ask that before, Your Honor."
2003.02-1580,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3129.031,3131.51,That's why I thought I'd ask you.
2003.02-1580,3,38319,paul_m_smith,,3452.249,3455.51,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2003.02-1580,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3486.679,3496.305,"I take it the results you're urging on us would require us to supervise local entities, city councils, boards of supervisors--"
2003.02-1580,3,38319,paul_m_smith,,3496.305,3497.957,They--
2003.02-1580,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3497.957,3498.989,--water districts.
2003.02-1580,3,38319,paul_m_smith,,3498.989,3503.364,"--They... they... they as well can violate the constitutional rights of the people who live in those jurisdictions, Your Honor."
2003.02-1580,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3539.195,3546.654,"I guess if it were the constitutional rule, the party could adjust and try to run strong candidates, even in overwhelmingly Republican districts."
2003.02-1580,3,38319,paul_m_smith,,3546.654,3553.479,"--Well, I suppose that that is in fact the case, but you can't assume that the... the vote totals under a gerrymander are independent of the effects of that."
2003.02-1580,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3598.478,3600.169,"Thank you, Mr. Smith The case is submitted."
