1966.334,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,9.619,"Number 334, United States petitioner, versus Billy Joe Wade."
1966.334,0,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,27.337,53.059,"May it please the court, this case comes here on petition for -- government petition for a writ of certiorari to the Fifth Circuit, which refers respondents conviction for bank robbery because it held that Sixth Amendment right to counsel had been violated in the lineup."
1966.334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,192.971,195.037,"Well by both aspects, I want to be sure."
1966.334,0,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,195.037,199.872,Well one in holding that there was a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.
1966.334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,199.872,201.488,And secondly in the sanctions.
1966.334,0,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,201.488,203.327,Secondly in the sanctions that it imposed.
1966.334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,203.327,207.491,Right.
1966.334,0,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,207.491,232.224,"On the Sixth Amendment question, in our view the key to the problem is that by a line up, that what the government is really seeking, is to find out what the witness knows, the witness, the victims of the robbery not what the defendant knows."
1966.334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,391.789,403.833,"I know you suddenly said before you – the respondent for that statement, who asked the question, what was the question and what was the answer?"
1966.334,0,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,403.833,410.298,"Well, as I understand it, no there is no record of it at all."
1966.334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,422.274,424.525,Told by who?
1966.334,0,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,424.525,426.074,The police.
1966.334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,438.317,442.575,"And I understand about the record, this was not kept side from the trial."
1966.334,0,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,442.575,472.75,"No this was not kept aside from the trial, all that happened at the trial was the first witness got up, she was the cashier of the bank, she was the one whom the defendant first approached and she testified to the circumstances of the robbery that a man came in, she and -- she was at the cashier’s desk, about 10 feet away from the entrance, she was alone, that a man came in and said I have to check to cash and she said okay, come here."
1966.334,1,45034,weldon_holcomb,,1465.893,1466.311,"Thank you, your honor."
1966.334,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1838.713,1846.19,May I ask what you’re hoping to say that the identifying witnesses had seen photographs of the respondent?
1966.334,1,45034,weldon_holcomb,,1846.19,1856.834,According to the record Your Honor one witness Miss -- the lady testified that she had identified a photograph of the defendant.
1966.334,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1856.834,1858.502,And when was that identification?
1966.334,1,45034,weldon_holcomb,,1858.502,1874.247,"There is no date in the record Your Honor as to when it occurred, in my examination of her, I was trying to show whether or not she had seen a picture or anything of that nature during the investigation and as I understand the record Mr. Albert had shown every picture he does not state he --"
1966.334,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1874.247,1884.027,"Well, did I understand you to say earlier that the record was supportive inference of the photographs she saw or the photograph taken of the respondent after he was arrested."
1966.334,1,45034,weldon_holcomb,,1884.027,1912.556,"I believe that it would be a fair inference from it Mr. Justice Brennan based upon the surrounding facts of the case, that had FBI agent Albert been told by the witness that this is the man and I identify him, I think it’s reasonable to assume that a competent Federal Agent would have issued a warrant and attempted to arrest the man and such was not done."
1966.334,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1912.556,1924.756,"Mr. Holcomb, suppose you were then invited to the line up, (Inaudible)"
1966.334,1,45034,weldon_holcomb,,1924.756,1939.275,"First of all Your Honor if I had the opportunity I would have done my utmost as counsel to prevent my client from being seen alone or under any circumstances which might tend to point the finger of guilt toward him, such has being observed alone."
1966.334,3,45034,weldon_holcomb,,2792.845,2813.216,"No sir I was sitting there, if I recall correctly trying to keep my business straight Your Honor and my client leaned across the table behind me and mentioned something about the lineup and I proceeded from there, I think and my questioning reflected that I was not appraised of it Justice Harlan."
1966.334,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2821.157,2824.175,This is not routine practice then?
1966.334,3,45034,weldon_holcomb,,2824.175,2831.75,"No sir, especially after an indictment Justice Fortas, it’s been common as a state prosecutor we utilize it all the time."
1966.334,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2831.75,2832.275,Before --
1966.334,3,45034,weldon_holcomb,,2832.275,2839.8,Before indictment if we were trying to find out who robbed the bank or who burglarized the place or any type involving a person.
1966.334,5,45034,weldon_holcomb,,2842.137,2842.739,Sir?
1966.334,7,45034,weldon_holcomb,,2846.816,2854.153,"No sir, not unless it called for by improper examination of one of our witnesses by the undecided."
1966.334,9,45034,weldon_holcomb,,2859.384,2868.83,"No sir, to my knowledge I do not recall having participated in one or authorized in one as district attorney after indictment."
1966.334,9,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2868.83,2887.364,"Why should not the government use the view of that witness to ask him the same question then, do you see the defendant here, why should they not be allowed to do that so long as they not rely at all upon what had occurred in the lineup?"
1966.334,9,45034,weldon_holcomb,,2887.364,2894.715,"Justice Black, I don’t see how we can separate it, who can say -- I believe that all of us are part of everything we have been exposed to."
1966.334,11,45034,weldon_holcomb,,2954.193,2957.141,Your Honor it could Justice Harlan.
1966.334,13,45034,weldon_holcomb,,2974.994,2987.83,"If the lineup is held without any adornments and without any viewing of the body so to speak, I would say that would be merely to the weight of it Justice Harlan."
1966.334,15,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3003.75,3023.124,"I hate to concede that Justice Harlan but I believe that it in all fairness that I should, that if the man is asked his name, that it’s hard to draw the line, Justice Harlan, I will say that if you ask him about the crime or reenact a portion of it and so forth in my opinion without a doubt is a violation."
1966.334,17,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3043.161,3043.441,Yes Your Honor.
1966.334,19,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3046.407,3047.765,Yes Your Honor.
1966.334,21,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3049.733,3055.996,My basic position is the Sixth Amendment claim of deprivation of counsel and the Fifth Amendment is just in conjunction with it.
1966.334,21,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3055.996,3073.584,"Well Mr. Holcomb that being so, I suppose the exclusionary rule which you argued for, the exclusionary rule you argued for, would be more in the nature of a prophylactic rule to prevent denial by officers of rights to counsel, is that it?"
1966.334,21,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3073.584,3074.208,Yes sir.
1966.334,21,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3074.208,3079.33,Without regard to change or anything else or the reliability of the identification evidence.
1966.334,21,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3079.33,3091.229,"Yes sir, but in the event, you do have this type of activity that if the government is not prohibited from using this tainted evidence, then there is no punishment for the government or any other authority."
1966.334,21,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3091.229,3108.106,"But you surely have to rest it on the need for some kind of prophylactic rule in order to protect the right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment, not on any argument which you can make, can you necessarily that the identification evidence is unreliable."
1966.334,21,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3108.106,3109.438,"No sir, no sir."
1966.334,21,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3113.329,3123.997,"Well, but your Sixth Amendment claim as I gather it is really a mechanism to prevent violation under the Fifth, the way you have been presenting it."
1966.334,21,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3123.997,3127.801,As an attorney anything that I am charged by the law to prevent from them occurring Your Honor.
1966.334,21,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3127.801,3141.189,"Well yes, but if it were just the counsel, the right to counsel you are talking about unrelated to the Fifth Amendment, I would think you would claim that viewing the body in the absence of counsel is also a violation."
1966.334,21,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3155.5,3156.497,Yes sir and I find it very --
1966.334,21,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3156.497,3159.072,Is that your argument?
1966.334,21,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3159.072,3179.759,"Yes and no Your Honor and may I say this, it’s like I said a while ago on the Court opinion on Justice Holmes that’s what the Court have ruled not that I necessarily agree with, but that’s what the Court has held, but I feel like it, if you deprive the man of his attorney, then everything else is unreal."
1966.334,21,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3187.695,3213.636,"Now do you say, if there were a case where, it was perfectly clear that both the defendant admitted it and the state said it that all that happened at the lineup was a viewing, no movements, no speaking, nothing except a viewing and counsel was not present, would you say then that the courtroom identification should be excluded?"
1966.334,21,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3213.636,3216.057,On that alone I’d say no sir.
1966.334,21,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3216.057,3222.645,So you really aren’t relying just on say Sixth Amendment right to counsel I gather.
1966.334,21,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3232.412,3235.137,"No sir, you put post indictment when you put the indictment --"
1966.334,21,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3235.137,3236.319,What’s this case?
1966.334,21,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3236.319,3247.024,"Yes, post indictment I say yes, that if he is entitled to have his lawyer, have him there, but now as I replied to Justice Fortas, when we were investigating cases that’s one thing."
1966.334,21,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3247.024,3251.772,"I understand that, so you would say even though that’s perfectly clear that nothing happened at the line up."
1966.334,21,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3251.772,3262.261,Then I suppose that everyone would agree that it was a violation of the defendant’s rights.
1966.334,21,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3282.021,3282.317,Yes Your Honor.
1966.334,21,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3282.317,3298.532,"Suppose the government had, had five witnesses to look into it, that’s the only eye witnesses to the crime, you would say that they couldn’t use a single one of those witnesses why do you have to go that far?"
1966.334,21,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3298.532,3302.905,If they violate the man’s constitutional rights Justice Black I think that they --
1966.334,21,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3302.905,3313.607,They violated it in connection with identifying him on the -- by reason of some motion with and what he said.
1966.334,21,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3347.126,3359.942,"I believe my statement Justice Stewart I believe it was sir that these witnesses could testify to that but not to the identification, that the only thing that would be barred was their eye witness identification based upon the lineup --"
1966.334,21,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3359.942,3369.904,In other words they couldn’t buttress their statement of identification by proving that they had picked him out in this lineup.
1966.334,21,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3369.904,3373.895,Not -- as I understand not in our position Your Honor.
1966.334,21,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3373.895,3374.462,That’s what?
1966.334,21,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3374.462,3393.26,"It’s not my position my position is, my position Your Honor is that the witness can testify to anything except the identification that he made there, in other words, he testified at the robbery, he testified all the facts that occurred and so forth but he cannot testify that this is a man that did it, if the rights of the man were violated at the lineup."
1966.334,21,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3393.26,3395.752,"Alright in other words and that’s what the Court of Appeals held, isn’t it?"
1966.334,21,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3395.752,3396.379,Yes sir.
1966.334,21,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3396.379,3402.273,"That the witnesses could say that there was a hold up that day, but they couldn’t say who did it?"
1966.334,21,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3402.273,3404.367,That’s correct sir.
1966.334,21,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3405.798,3407.46,That’s exactly what the Court of Appeals held.
1966.334,21,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3407.46,3410.528,Let me put another hypothetical to you.
1966.334,21,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3450.434,3453.874,It could be sir.
1966.334,21,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3458.889,3483.274,"I am talking about the waiver, I am talking about the fact that whenever technique you possibly use, is not known by the counsel, and his client when he walked in to the courtroom in the morning prior (Inaudible)"
1966.334,21,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3483.274,3484.668,No sir.
1966.334,21,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3484.668,3486.34,Why not?
1966.334,21,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3486.34,3491.216,It’s open court Your Honor and everyone is there --
1966.334,21,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3491.216,3494.21,(Inaudible)
1966.334,21,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3494.21,3495.693,"Yes, his counsel --"
1966.334,21,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3495.693,3499.913,(Inaudible)
1966.334,21,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3499.913,3508.718,"If counsel is with his client there in open court and so forth Your Honor and nothing else was known, I would say that there would be no violation."
1966.334,21,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3508.718,3516.43,"Suppose the prosecutor says to the witness there is the fellow who did it, do you recognize him, would that violate something?"
1966.334,21,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3516.43,3518.936,"Certainly that has been done, I think that would be a violation Justice."
1966.334,21,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3518.936,3520.637,There is something --
1966.334,21,45034,weldon_holcomb,,3520.637,3527.382,"Yes sir, as I say we all sustain position, I feel that would be improper thank you."
1966.334,21,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3527.382,3531.643,Ms. Rosenberg.
1966.334,22,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3531.643,3535.429,I just wanted to take up this matter of indictment.
1966.334,22,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3723.779,3736.379,"Do you think the government could have brought in that fact, without violating this man’s constitutional rights in the trial?"
1966.334,22,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3736.379,3739.878,(Inaudible) so hold Your Honor.
1966.334,22,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3815.279,3835.881,"Just before we believe that, I think you said it, but I want to be sure, if I understand what you have said and what did happen here as a matter of fact, am I correct in understanding that the government in its case in the Court, trial of this man, made no use indeed, no mention whatsoever of any lineup, is that right?"
1966.334,22,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3835.881,3838.501,Well let me put it -- exactly what happened.
1966.334,22,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3846.082,3847.424,I mean she made no mention.
1966.334,22,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3847.424,3849.844,No she was not questioned about -- nothing would said about it.
1966.334,22,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3849.844,3851.507,Right.
1966.334,22,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3851.507,3871.707,"On Cross examination counsel asked her whether she had seen the defendant between the time of the offense, of the time of the trial, and she first said she had picked that photograph."
1966.334,22,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3873.84,3876.308,The question that she doesn’t --
1966.334,22,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3876.308,3885.768,"No she said she had seen him at the lineup and then there was some question, had she seen anything before and she said, she had seen photographs before the lineup."
1966.334,22,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3895.583,3898.413,And asked then to identify the defendant.
1966.334,22,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3898.413,3902.485,And it said did you see this defendant in this courtroom on the tenth?
1966.334,22,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3905.45,3906.629,Of the other witness?
1966.334,22,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3906.629,3907.709,That’s right.
1966.334,22,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3910.607,3914.222,"And just did you see him here at this courtroom on the tenth and the answer was what, yes?"
1966.334,22,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3914.222,3915.254,Yes.
1966.334,22,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3915.254,3917.45,"Then, was there any description of what happened?"
1966.334,22,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3917.45,3937.321,No then the defense cross-examined and the defense cross-examined him with reference to this info tro that where we got this pleading glance through the -- when the door opened.
1966.334,22,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3944.342,3971.38,"So assuming that it is a violation of the Fifth Amendment or perhaps the Sixth Amendment to ask somebody to say, how do you do, if his lawyer isn’t there, no evidence of any such violation or any such facts were introduced by the government except for the response and this came in response to cross examination by the defendant."
1966.334,22,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,3971.38,3985.588,"Except what -- on the second witness there was this one line, the government did ask one question at the end of the second witness, after the defense had brought it out for the first time."
1966.334,22,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3985.588,4010.58,"Ms. Rosenberg let us assume for the moment that the Court of Appeals was right in saying that the rights of this defendant had been violated, but let us say also for the sake of argument that it was wrong as you contend in applying the remedy that it proposes."
1966.334,22,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,4025.643,4041.477,"Well, there have been two suggestions by defending opinion in the federal Gilbert case about which it held and that in the next case and so forth, by courts that have held that there was violation of rights."
1966.334,22,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4084.179,4084.929,There would be what?
1966.334,22,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,4084.929,4105.598,"A hearing outside the presence of the jury to determine as near as one can, all law requires some weighing, some evidence, how much opportunity did the witness have to see the defendant at that time of the crime."
1966.334,22,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4209.63,4210.553,Basically what?
1966.334,22,18001,beatrice_rosenberg,,4210.553,4249.749,"Designed to be there because a line up as conducted is done so that witness sees several people rather than one, it doesn’t have any of the potentialities of the evil, which this Court was dealing with in Miranda and that it was trying to avoid, to what it found to be -- and I suppose in same cases actually have it found to be potentialities is nothing that a line up is secret, the witnesses are there, people are there, it’s a short duration, it can’t be long, its basically designed to be a fair procedure, maybe in this case --"
