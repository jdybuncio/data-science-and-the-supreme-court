1992.91-7749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.1,"We'll hear argument next in No. 91-7749, Jose Antonio Ortega-Rodriguez v. United States."
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,32.302,34.283,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-7749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,65.633,71.146,Well... Mr. Gailey... let me find out about what you and the Government... you say... agree to here.
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,79.544,89.049,"--Yes, Your Honor, we do agree that undertaking a case-by-case analysis, in the proper case, may result in a dismissal of an appeal."
1992.91-7749,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,113.656,134.7,"While you are there, what if that automatic rule would be bad; but a lesser automatic rule would have been okay, an automatic rule involving fewer situations would have been okay... and this situation comes within that lesser category?"
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,136.24,144.297,"--I do... I do not believe, Justice Scalia, that the court, in exercising its supervisory powers can have any automatic rule."
1992.91-7749,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,167.02,175.996,"Cannot have any precedent... precedential decisions, then, can't say, you know, whenever fact A, B, and C is present, you lose."
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,180.919,182.381,"--Your Honor, that is ordinary precedent."
1992.91-7749,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,200.854,210.899,"They have to reinvent the wheel every time a case comes... I mean, the judge can't say, gee, we had a case just like this 2 weeks ago, and there we held factors A, B, and C being present, you're out."
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,215.031,219.283,"Yes, and the reason why is that Congress conferred the jurisdiction."
1992.91-7749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,284.169,294.494,Is it a flat rule that someone who absconds while his appeal is pending has... deserves to have his appeal dismissed?
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,294.494,300.928,"--If someone absconds while his appeal is pending, as this Court reasoned in a line of cases beginning with Smith--"
1992.91-7749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,300.928,301.75,"Well, that's a pretty flat rule, isn't it?"
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,301.75,303.609,"--Yes, Your Honor, but the--"
1992.91-7749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,303.609,305.82,"Well, that isn't... that is nothing case to case about that."
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,305.82,314.626,"--Well, except that the court always... when they made the determination, they did not exercise it in an automatic fashion."
1992.91-7749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,322.831,332.278,"We thought there was... apparently we thought there was a class of cases where the... where you could dispense with case-by-case analysis, because you would always come out the same way."
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,332.278,338.151,"--This Court never... well... this Court, nevertheless, undertook such analysis."
1992.91-7749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,339.844,341.073,"Well, for a class of cases."
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,341.073,342.125,--I'm sorry?
1992.91-7749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,342.125,344.335,"For a class of cases, I suppose."
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,344.335,346.297,The class being fugitive--
1992.91-7749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,346.297,348.6,Or was that just for the... was that just for the case that we had before us?
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,348.6,355.623,"--The class that Your Honor is referring to is the case where the fugitives are pending appeal... out, pending appeal."
1992.91-7749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,396.422,404.396,"I don't think you should lump together, Mr. Gailey, the cases we've had from State courts involving this, and the cases from Federal courts."
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,414.261,414.932,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.91-7749,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,447.563,460.272,"Well, suppose that in this case, your client had absconded and was absent for 3 years during which time an appeal had been pending and was dismissed."
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,466.025,484.489,"--Possibly, although obviously, as Your Honor points out, the longer and more protracted the period of fugitivity, the more likely it will be that the very nature of the fugitivity during the appellate process has some way compromised the appellate court's ability to deal with the appeal."
1992.91-7749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,576.447,582.36,Are you suggesting that one factor that must be considered is the likelihood of success on appeal?
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,582.36,590.548,"That is one of the factors, Your Honor, that has been considered in the past in evaluating whether or not a court ought to dismiss an appeal."
1992.91-7749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,591.537,595.54,"Ah... That really doesn't make a lot of sense, does it?"
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,618.205,620.628,"Well, it very well may be in many cases."
1992.91-7749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,655.371,663.434,"So, an appellate court can say we'd... under our other factors we'd hold you had defaulted."
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,672.64,674.231,"--Some appellate courts have, in fact, done that."
1992.91-7749,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,674.231,677.964,So--
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,677.964,678.805,The second factor--
1992.91-7749,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,678.805,683.808,"--so you really want a... a kind of a three-prong test, plus anything else the court wants to bring in."
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,686.219,688.75,"--It's a discretionary analysis, Your Honor."
1992.91-7749,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,690.953,696.337,But all I'm saying is... I thought your argument began by saying there's a... essentially a three-part inquiry.
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,697.806,706.231,"--I am going beyond that, only because of the nature of... of the... the merits on appeal is one of the factors that has been looked at."
1992.91-7749,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,714.609,716.279,On prejudice to the appellate process?
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,716.279,716.91,--That's correct.
1992.91-7749,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,716.91,718.419,How does it fit there?
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,718.419,733.37,"Well, in a case where the case has merit, but the period of fugitivity has been protract... a protracted period of time, it may be impossible or impractical for the Government to reprosecute."
1992.91-7749,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,746.338,751.161,"So the greater the chances of success, the less likelihood of being given relief?"
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,751.161,755.194,The greater the chances of success on the appeal--
1992.91-7749,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,755.194,755.585,On appeal.
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,755.585,757.366,--the greater the likelihood.
1992.91-7749,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,787.305,788.935,"Well, finish that, if you were answering that."
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,788.935,790.147,--I was moving on to another point.
1992.91-7749,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,790.147,790.587,Oh good.
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,792.147,792.598,Okay.
1992.91-7749,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,792.598,805.168,"I assume that... that... that the consequence of your proposition that each case has to be decided on its own facts is that there is no such thing as an abuse of discretion, right?"
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,825.6,836.757,"I believe that in a case where the court exercises its discretion not to hear an appeal, that that is always subject to an abuse-of-discretion analysis."
1992.91-7749,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,836.757,842.311,"Well, how could you possibly abuse discretion that is not subject to any general rules?"
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,845.923,857.931,"The general rules that exist are that the right to appeal is fundamental, especially in a criminal case."
1992.91-7749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,930.009,940.375,You mean there's no... there's no... there's no good reason for it deciding not to hear the appeal.
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,943.919,948.319,"That's... well, that's correct, not to hear the appeal."
1992.91-7749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,969.914,981.342,"When you say the only issue is sufficiency of the evidence, you mean that no... no question is being-raised on appeal about improper evidence admitted, or that sort of thing?"
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,981.342,981.773,"No, Your Honor."
1992.91-7749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,981.773,986.664,It's just strictly one question: was there sufficient evidence to support a finding of guilt?
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,986.664,986.964,That's correct.
1992.91-7749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,986.964,989.488,Which you say has already been decided.
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,989.488,992.14,"Well, it has been decided--"
1992.91-7749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,992.14,993.179,In another party's case.
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,993.179,995.84,--as to a codefendant that is similarly situated.
1992.91-7749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1036.789,1040.74,"Well, you could always say that."
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1065.931,1082.91,"Not necessarily in every case, but certainly in a case where the period of fugitivity begins before the appellate process starts off, and he has not been a fugitive, and has been available to accept the consequences of an adverse ruling at the court of appeals."
1992.91-7749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1084.13,1087.172,"Well, of course, the only real... that really is fortuitous in this case."
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1091.076,1092.525,--He was... he was arrested.
1992.91-7749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1092.525,1093.346,Yeah.
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1093.346,1094.087,That's correct.
1992.91-7749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1094.087,1096.919,"Well, so he gets credit for that?"
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1096.919,1099.571,He doesn't get credit for that.
1992.91-7749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1106.206,1111.318,"But he, nonetheless, gets favorable treatment because he was back... albeit not of his own will."
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1111.318,1114.33,"It's not a matter of favorable treatment, Your Honor."
1992.91-7749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1145.761,1150.034,What about dismissing an appeal for failure to file a timely notice?
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1154.517,1154.566,That's correct.
1992.91-7749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1154.566,1159.019,Is that a violation of Congress' conferring of a right to appeal?
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1159.019,1159.56,Not at all.
1992.91-7749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1172.257,1181.025,"No, but that is an example of a rule that certainly impinges on an unlimited right to take advantage of the congressional right."
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1187.007,1188.309,"Exactly right, Your Honor."
1992.91-7749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1198.744,1201.997,I didn't understand you to make any constitutional claim in this case.
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1201.997,1203.609,We did not make a constitutional claim.
1992.91-7749,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1222.36,1223.442,Has--
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1257.894,1260.527,"No, I do not believe that it would be."
1992.91-7749,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1260.527,1274.935,"Well, if it wouldn't be, then isn't the answer... isn't it going to be the case that in every case... whether a person has been prosecuted for escape or not... he could be; and whether bail has been revoked or not, it could be."
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1286.022,1304.555,"I do believe, Your Honor, that that third prong is one of lesser significance than the first two... primarily because Congress has spoken in the contempt statute, as well as the Bond Reform Act statute, in this whole area of vindication of the court's authority."
1992.91-7749,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1304.555,1320.143,"Well, given the fact that Congress has so spoken, what kind of a case might result in an act of discretion favorable to... to a waiver conclusion, as opposed to a nonwaiver conclusion?"
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1322.006,1323.286,Focusing just on the third prong?
1992.91-7749,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1323.286,1323.807,Yeah.
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1323.807,1345.162,"I suppose that if the period of fugitivity directly occurred while the appeal was pending... as this Court has been faced with on several occasions... there, I believe that as a response to that the court would be within its rights to dismiss the appeal."
1992.91-7749,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1345.162,1345.612,Why?
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1359.71,1364.124,Because the court has the right to regulate the matters that are before it.
1992.91-7749,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1367.056,1371.18,"You're saying it's like direct contempt, as opposed to indirect contempt?"
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1371.18,1375.664,--It would directly affect this Court or the appellate court's function.
1992.91-7749,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1377.624,1377.975,Why?
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1382.046,1388.53,"--The reasons why were set forth in the whole line of cases beginning with Smith, over 100 years ago... or nearly 100 years ago."
1992.91-7749,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1388.53,1390.743,"Yeah, but I think you're undercutting that."
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1404.803,1406.793,It's not a direct-contempt analysis.
1992.91-7749,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1453.683,1483.313,"Mr. Gailey, can you explain to me why you are willing to concede... as I think you have... that courts without special statutory authorization can establish time limits for filing of notice of appeal and say if you don't meet those limits, you are out; without going case by case and saying well, you know, this fellow came within 2 weeks, but there's a lot of trouble at home."
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1487.527,1488.018,Not at all.
1992.91-7749,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1488.018,1490.849,"Now, why is it okay there, but it's not okay here?"
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1490.849,1511.152,"First of all, those rules that the Court suggest are ones that are the product of... of thoughtful analysis and discretion and are the end result of... at least according to the Rules of Appellate Procedure in an appellate court context... a majority vote by the court of appeals judges."
1992.91-7749,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1532.277,1540.572,I don't understand... you mean those rules would not... a court would not be able to have such rules unless they were submitted to Congress and made statutory?
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1541.393,1541.824,Not at all.
1992.91-7749,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1541.824,1543.354,You can have those rules.
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1543.354,1544.244,Of course.
1992.91-7749,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1545.784,1548.237,In the exercise of its own supervisory authority.
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1548.237,1548.706,--Precisely.
1992.91-7749,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1589.434,1594.847,"But it didn't... but we didn't ascertain that it was not a rule, which is what you want us to ascertain here."
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1597.128,1601.482,No... I'm sorry if I've... I've misled the Court if that's the conclusion that you have.
1992.91-7749,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1633.032,1633.843,"Well, I wonder if--"
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1643.941,1645.441,"He was gone for 11 months, Your Honor."
1992.91-7749,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1645.441,1651.656,"11 months... well, for 11 months, because he wasn't present at his sentencing, he had a right to resentencing, because he had to be present."
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1660.78,1662.483,That's correct.
1992.91-7749,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1662.483,1669.786,So there was at least a reason why one could conclude that his flight had an adverse impact on the appellate process.
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1669.786,1672.018,Except the court didn't so conclude.
1992.91-7749,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1690.461,1693.172,"Well, they didn't write... they didn't really write an opinion explaining what they did, did they?"
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1694.364,1697.777,They merely... they granted the Government's motion to dismiss.
1992.91-7749,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1703.299,1708.743,"Did the defendant have a right to be resentenced, or could the trial court have said, no."
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1711.044,1713.605,The trial court was convinced that--
1992.91-7749,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1713.605,1717.259,"Well, did the trial court have to resentence him?"
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1717.259,1719.008,--The trial court did not have to resentence him.
1992.91-7749,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1719.008,1723.713,"And had it not, then the appeal time would have run, and he'd be out."
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1723.713,1727.744,"If not, then the appeal time would have been run... had run, and he would have been out."
1992.91-7749,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1728.185,1732.078,"What was the authority of the district court to reopen the sentence, anyway?"
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1732.078,1745.375,"Based upon the fact that the defendant was not present and could not allocute on his own behalf, the district court was satisfied that the sentencing ought to be vacated and resentenced."
1992.91-7749,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1745.375,1747.388,"Well, what's the authority of the district court to do that?"
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1747.388,1756.595,"The authority... there is a... a case in the Eleventh Circuit which allows the court, in its supervisory powers, to do that."
1992.91-7749,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1759.306,1765.262,You can vacate the sentence at any time if the defendant had been sentenced in absentia?
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1765.262,1769.034,--That's not the rule.
1992.91-7749,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1774.066,1777.018,I'm asking what the Eleventh Circuit's authority said.
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1786.164,1786.514,When--
1992.91-7749,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1786.514,1787.436,--of Criminal Procedure?
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1787.436,1787.786,--I'm sorry.
1992.91-7749,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1799.434,1808.419,"So the Eleventh Circuit says that any time a district court judge is satisfied sentencing has to... may be reopened, and it can do it, despite the provisions of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure?"
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1808.419,1813.893,"--The district court judge had the discretion, and still had jurisdiction over the case."
1992.91-7749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1828.974,1830.804,Oh--
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1830.804,1831.805,I'm sorry.
1992.91-7749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1831.805,1840.711,"--I wouldn't think there would be many cases like this, where you can be gone for 11 months and still have a right to appeal."
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1863.054,1863.625,That's correct.
1992.91-7749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1863.625,1867.038,And certainly Congress can do that by statute.
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1868.27,1868.881,That's correct.
1992.91-7749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1868.881,1874.953,"--if you're gone longer... if you run off and stay longer than your appeal time allows, you're out, normally."
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1874.953,1876.645,"Normally that's true, Your Honor."
1992.91-7749,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1876.645,1879.327,Unless you can convince some district judge to do what happened here.
1992.91-7749,0,30529,james_robert_gailey,,1879.327,1880.528,Normally that would be true.
1992.91-7749,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1881.858,1883.35,"Thank you, Mr. Gailey."
1992.91-7749,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1885.333,1889.156,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
