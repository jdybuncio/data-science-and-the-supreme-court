1992.91-1538,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,624.039,631.525,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1992.91-1538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,737.864,742.679,"Mr. Wright, I'd just like to raise a question to have you comment on it at your convenience."
1992.91-1538,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,757.519,757.97,Yes.
1992.91-1538,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,757.97,760.691,And you would say outer space is a foreign country.
1992.91-1538,1,20411,christopher_j_wright,,760.691,764.422,I... I'm not sure we would say outer space is a foreign country.
1992.91-1538,2,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,1856.476,1863.892,"I hope just to... Chief Justice, I hope just to briefly aver to some points made."
1992.91-1538,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2002.138,2017.695,"Mr. Bederman, how do you respond to the Government's argument about 1346(b), that the United States would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred?"
1992.91-1538,2,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,2017.695,2033.226,"Chief Justice, my construction of 1346(b) is that if a private party would be liable as a tort feasor in Antarctica... to Mrs. Smith, say, as plaintiff... then it follows that the Government would likewise be liable."
1992.91-1538,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2042.573,2059.101,"Well, but the Government's argument, as I understand it, is that there is no tort law governing in... in Antarctica, and therefore without regard to the foreign nation exception, you are not brought within 1346."
1992.91-1538,2,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,2059.101,2070.042,"That would be so, Chief Justice, if, under prevailing choice of law rules a private tort feasor would not... there would be no law applicable in a private action--"
1992.91-1538,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2070.042,2080.246,"But the statute says the law of the place where the act or omission occurred, which... and here the act or omission occurred in Antarctica, it's conceded, didn't it?"
1992.91-1538,2,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,2080.246,2080.888,"--Yes, sir."
1992.91-1538,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2080.888,2086.822,"And if there... if there is no law there, I... how do you get to choice of law?"
1992.91-1538,2,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,2086.822,2093.677,"Well, I read the... the Government's reading of 1346(b) is, frankly, disjunctive."
1992.91-1538,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2104.122,2107.094,Whereas you would prefer to read out the last clause?
1992.91-1538,2,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,2107.094,2109.275,"No, Chief Justice."
1992.91-1538,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2145.45,2148.221,Do you have any nonsubstantive points?
1992.91-1538,2,20529,david_jeremy_bederman,,2148.542,2153.557,"I will not rise to that invitation, Chief Justice."
