2005.04-905,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.345,We'll hear argument first today in Volvo Trucks North America versus Reeder Simco GMC.
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,8.642,11.127,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-905,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,58.075,67.077,"You concede, though, don't you, Mr. Englert, that the language of the statute covers the conduct here?"
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,67.077,69.031,"--Very much the opposite, Your Honor."
2005.04-905,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,69.031,76.673,"Well, you have a person who's engaged in commerce, who's discriminating in the price that they offer to different purchasers."
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,82.533,85.971,"Well, I don't agree, with respect, Your Honor."
2005.04-905,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,98.786,99.568,"Well, just to--"
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,99.568,99.99,--on competition.
2005.04-905,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,99.99,109.508,"--get to your first point, the statute talks about discrimination in price between different purchasers, and not different actual purchases."
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,109.508,110.195,But this--
2005.04-905,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,110.195,115.088,"It doesn't seem it's that much of a stretch to cover would be purchasers, potential purchasers."
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,115.088,123.417,"--Well, except that, back in 1947, this Court, in the Bruce's Juices case, made clear, in the early days of the Act, that it takes two completed sales to violate the Act."
2005.04-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,142.234,147.594,"But may I not ask, Isn't it true that each of the parties here, over a long period of time, was a purchaser?"
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,153.924,154.721,Yes.
2005.04-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,154.721,155.83,"So, they were a purchaser."
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,159.909,160.628,Yes.
2005.04-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,161.676,162.223,So there were--
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,162.223,162.879,--to sales transactions--
2005.04-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,162.879,163.488,--two purchasers.
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,163.488,165.943,"--Well, with respect to the sales to sales transactions in which there were--"
2005.04-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,165.943,166.646,Over a--
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,166.646,167.239,--two purchases--
2005.04-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,167.239,169.599,"--period of time, you had two purchasers."
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,169.599,171.365,--Yes.
2005.04-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,177.522,179.835,"And the discrimination occurred over a period of a couple of years, as I understand it."
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,179.835,180.242,"No, Your Honor."
2005.04-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,190.51,191.494,"Well, if--"
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,191.494,191.963,--another--
2005.04-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,191.963,197.949,"--these are ordinary automobile dealers who sold out of inventory, would you agree that they were... you had two purchasers?"
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,197.949,198.23,--Sure.
2005.04-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,198.23,205.044,So that the whole point of your case is they're negotiated transactions?
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,205.044,208.185,The whole point of the case is the... is twofold.
2005.04-905,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,225.049,227.69,"Well, but... I mean, you say that, but the title goes to the dealer."
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,249.382,251.445,"--If the requisite effect on competition is shown, yes."
2005.04-905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,251.445,254.493,"Well, and if there was a sale to the other dealer."
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,257.087,258.071,There have to be two sales.
2005.04-905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,258.071,258.946,Not just an--
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,258.946,259.446,But there would--
2005.04-905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,259.446,260.572,--not just an offer to the other dealer--
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,260.572,261.384,--Correct.
2005.04-905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,261.384,261.759,--of higher prices.
2005.04-905,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,261.759,264.198,"Yes, but there would be sales if they were selling from inventory."
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,270.011,270.542,And that's the typical--
2005.04-905,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,270.542,270.964,Yes.
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,270.964,271.261,--Robinson Patman case.
2005.04-905,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,291.266,292.485,Mr. Englert--
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,292.485,293.173,--why the Robinson Patman Act--
2005.04-905,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,293.173,328.508,"--suppose you had a case of two Volvo dealers, and the scheme is, as this one, specially ordered goods with competitive bidding, but, over a substantial period of time, one dealer... we'll call that dealer the ""favored dealer""... consistently gets higher concessions, and the other dealer, who ends up being the plaintiff in the case, consistently, in that same period, gets lower concessions."
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,354.655,356.186,"--It... yes, I think that's correct."
2005.04-905,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,362.812,365.844,"So, you go back to the language... are you finished with that answer?"
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,367.657,368.298,"Enough for now, Justice Breyer--"
2005.04-905,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,368.298,368.657,All right.
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,368.657,368.985,--yes.
2005.04-905,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,368.985,372.518,"In respect to the language, how do you read it?"
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,404.025,404.525,Well--
2005.04-905,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,404.525,410.448,"--literal reading of the statute to... I agree with you, 60 years, nobody's questioned it."
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,425.248,427.905,"--Well, two different issues, Justice Breyer."
2005.04-905,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,440.282,440.767,You're giving--
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,440.767,441.048,--should be construed--
2005.04-905,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,441.048,441.939,--me a policy argument.
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,462.162,463.115,--And there's a textual--
2005.04-905,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,463.115,475.727,"And what you're hearing, I think, is, well, this person, the dealer, bought other items in respect to which there was no discrimination in price."
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,490.278,493.232,--The textual answer to your question is--
2005.04-905,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,493.232,494.029,That's all I want--
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,494.029,494.357,--the phrase--
2005.04-905,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,494.357,495.561,--the textual answer.
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,495.561,499.967,"--the phrase ""the effect of such competition"" ties--"
2005.04-905,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,499.967,501.124,"Oh, no, no."
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,501.468,502.296,"--I'm sorry, the effect of such--"
2005.04-905,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,502.296,502.875,--sorry.
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,503.421,503.844,--discrimination.
2005.04-905,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,503.844,506.266,"--was conceded in this case, that there's the effect on the competition."
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,553.385,554.026,Correct.
2005.04-905,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,554.026,554.526,All right.
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,568.466,568.966,Well--
2005.04-905,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,568.966,574.202,"And there was a discrimination... namely, the offer was discriminatory."
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,581.939,583.533,"--Well, I still question whether--"
2005.04-905,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,583.533,584.221,"So, I want the textual answer."
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,584.221,584.565,--Okay.
2005.04-905,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,590.832,591.097,Yes.
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,591.097,591.363,--competition.
2005.04-905,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,591.832,597.911,"The effect of such discrimination is that his next door rival, in effect, ""got the sale""."
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,599.161,601.629,"--Yes, I do want to say that isn't enough."
2005.04-905,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,603.193,604.881,Let's assume I don't agree with you about that.
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,605.287,606.006,--Well--
2005.04-905,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,606.006,606.241,--what?
2005.04-905,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,606.241,610.039,"Mr. Englert, I thought you were relying on the succeeding phrase, where"
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,636.278,639.67,"--I think the statute, read as a whole, compels that conclusion."
2005.04-905,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,651.938,658.783,"Well, of course, if we can go back to the language, it's between different purchases of commodities of ""like grade and quality""."
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,676.413,682.586,"--Well, Your Honor, I think everyone, including the lower courts in this case, agrees that you don't look at the goods generically."
2005.04-905,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,688.243,690.963,It has to be purchase by purchase to determine like grade or quality?
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,690.963,691.275,--Yes.
2005.04-905,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,696.151,696.494,Fine.
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,696.916,698.104,--sale from the manufacturer to the dealer.
2005.04-905,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,698.104,698.792,--You've put your finger right on it.
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,726.36,726.767,Okay.
2005.04-905,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,726.767,727.579,Okay.
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,727.579,728.127,I'm a manufacturer.
2005.04-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,765.119,783.264,"May I ask this question, just to get it in the... Supposing Volvo had a policy of granting everybody a 20 percent concession, and they had... except Reeder... and they always granted Reeder just a 15 percent concession, and the... you had the same sales pattern you have here."
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,786.046,786.952,"Well, again--"
2005.04-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,786.952,788.03,Prima facie violation.
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,788.03,791.546,"--I think the answer is no, Your Honor, although that... although that would be a closer case--"
2005.04-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,791.546,791.984,Even if there--
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,791.984,792.421,--than this case.
2005.04-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,792.421,793.094,--were dozens and dozens--
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,793.094,794.704,This case was tried on the basis of the same transactions.
2005.04-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,794.704,795.563,--of sales to both.
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,795.563,796.0,Yes.
2005.04-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,803.753,817.459,"Well, it depends on how... whether you regard the purchase as on a single... each single transaction as a separate purchase or if you look at a course of dealing and say that, over a period of years, the favored dealer is one purchaser and the disfavored dealer is the other purchaser."
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,823.663,830.898,--That would be the argument in favor of an expansive reading of the language in the hypothetical example to cover that case.
2005.04-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,835.352,837.211,"It would be consistent with the literal language, wouldn't it?"
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,855.528,856.528,No.
2005.04-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,880.941,881.363,But--
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,881.363,881.863,--in this case.
2005.04-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,881.863,885.847,"--You would agree, in my hypothetical, there's discrimination, but you'd say there's no injury to competition."
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,885.847,889.004,There's no injury to competition that is the effect of such--
2005.04-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,889.004,889.488,Even if you--
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,889.488,890.161,--competition with--
2005.04-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,890.161,890.614,--got an expert to--
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,890.614,891.88,--a favored purchaser that is the effect of such--
2005.04-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,891.88,893.271,"--even if you got an expert to come and say,"
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,900.647,902.163,"--Oh, if you have that evidence?"
2005.04-905,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,902.163,903.054,--Yes.
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,903.054,908.008,"That there is a likelihood that, in a pattern, customers have gone to the favored dealer?"
2005.04-905,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,911.978,913.151,I understand--
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,913.151,924.481,"There is no customer testimony, no evidence of diversion to any favored dealer in this case, no evidence that Reeder lost profits because of the price given to any favored dealer, only evidence that if Reeder had gotten a price, it would have... better price... it would have made more money."
2005.04-905,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,925.277,930.42,--I understand your argument that there's no injury or impact in competition for resale of the trucks.
2005.04-905,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,948.237,954.034,"--The main problem with that interpretation of the statute is, it takes the last phrase of the statute and makes it no longer a limiting phrase."
2005.04-905,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,968.506,968.944,Thank you.
2005.04-905,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,975.288,978.946,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-905,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,999.856,1000.809,But how can you say--
2005.04-905,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1000.809,1001.606,--that the answer is no.
2005.04-905,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1001.606,1006.576,--that the dealer didn't purchase goods for resale in competition with other Volvo dealers?
2005.04-905,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1008.264,1008.702,"No, Your Honor."

2005.04-905,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1026.159,1026.487,Assuming--
2005.04-905,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1026.487,1027.207,--with other--

2005.04-905,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1108.896,1109.833,--hypothetical?
2005.04-905,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1155.265,1155.953,Just so--
2005.04-905,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1155.953,1170.815,"But I would point out that even if the Court is unwilling to go that far in this case, that you don't need to go that far to resolve this case and to reverse the judgment below for the other... because of the other failings in the plaintiff's case here."
2005.04-905,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1170.815,1178.458,--And the... and the main failing there is that Volvo Trucks and Reeder Simco do not compete in the same market for sales of Volvo trucks.

2005.04-905,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1190.804,1191.226,Okay.
2005.04-905,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1191.226,1191.664,--right.

2005.04-905,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1211.559,1211.809,Why not?
2005.04-905,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1213.356,1214.059,Because there--

2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2067.634,2069.744,"--and under State... Arkansas State law, it can't."
2005.04-905,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2069.744,2072.712,"--well, what... but it... under the Robinson Patman Act, it can."
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2072.712,2074.978,As long as it doesn't discriminate on the basis of price--
2005.04-905,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2074.978,2075.213,The classic--
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2075.213,2075.542,--you're right.
2005.04-905,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2075.542,2083.512,--case that the Robinson Patman Act is directed to is when you lose sales because they're giving bigger discounts to other sellers.
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2084.699,2086.341,But it... it's not just sales.
2005.04-905,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2101.547,2112.956,"But Volvo's interest may be in as... making as much money off of sales this year, and they may not be terribly concerned about whether you, as a reseller, are making enough profit to last 3 years or 5 years."
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2112.956,2113.753,--That's true.
2005.04-905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2120.193,2120.912,That... that's a--
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2120.912,2122.864,--and to do so by using price discrimination.
2005.04-905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2122.864,2136.008,"--that's a... that's a broad Robinson Patman principle you're arguing for, that a... that a seller such as Volvo has to make sure that each of its distributors makes the same profit?"
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2136.008,2136.571,"Oh, no."
2005.04-905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2137.508,2137.836,And if--
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2137.836,2138.242,--of course not.
2005.04-905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2138.242,2144.462,"--if it works its system in such a way that one of them is making less profit than another, it's liable?"
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2144.462,2146.916,"No, there are... there are two elements to this, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2188.598,2200.522,Do you have any instance where you made an offer to a buyer assuming that you'd get the kind of a break that Volvo gives to other dealers... all right +/?
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2206.257,2207.086,"Oh, sure."
2005.04-905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2208.617,2209.993,Where you made the offer to the buyer--
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2209.993,2210.493,Yes.
2005.04-905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2210.493,2212.383,--and the buyer had agreed to buy it--
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2212.383,2212.852,Sure.
2005.04-905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2212.852,2213.79,--and you--
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2213.79,2215.463,"Where we... well, I... had agreed to buy it."
2005.04-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2231.388,2232.732,This is the Robinson--
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2232.732,2234.404,That happened literally more than a thousand times.
2005.04-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2261.692,2275.647,"--If it's not, the... the reason... I thought, for about 60 years, the words ""different purchasers of commodities"", it forbids any person to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities."
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2290.057,2290.917,--All right.
2005.04-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2290.917,2297.136,It's a... it's forbidden to discriminate in price between different purchasers of commodities.
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2297.136,2297.48,Right.
2005.04-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2297.48,2305.404,"Now, I had always thought... and I think the courts' decisions bear that out, or the absence of decisions... that the words"
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2401.113,2409.443,"Well, I guess the difficulty I have, Justice Breyer, is understanding why you don't think we are... what we have here is precisely different purchasers of commodities."
2005.04-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2409.443,2426.383,"No, I said... I said they... in... the problem for you is that, in respect to discrimination between the item, or items, the... in respect to... the purchase of the item, or items, in respect to which the discrimination existed."
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2448.091,2452.201,I apologize for being--
2005.04-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2452.201,2453.233,"No, let me deal--"
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2453.233,2453.749,"--dense, Justice Breyer."
2005.04-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2454.53,2454.812,--with the latter.
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2455.233,2455.953,Let--
2005.04-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2455.953,2460.204,--there are some items where your client bought the truck.
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2460.204,2461.204,--Absolutely.
2005.04-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2461.204,2466.642,"When he bought the truck, he got the sale, although he earned less profit."
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2468.439,2469.471,It's difficult--
2005.04-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2469.471,2469.877,Let's focus--
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2469.877,2470.924,"--for me to do that, Justice Breyer--"
2005.04-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2470.924,2471.378,--But you are.
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2471.378,2471.69,--but I understand.
2005.04-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2471.69,2472.221,Let's focus--
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2477.16,2477.535,Right.
2005.04-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2477.535,2487.459,"When he didn't get the sale, there was no purchase of the item, or items, from the manufacturer in respect to which the discrimination existed."
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2487.459,2488.131,Right.
2005.04-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2488.131,2488.569,Okay?
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2490.71,2491.538,That's what you want me to focus on.
2005.04-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2491.538,2491.788,--Yes.
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2491.788,2492.194,That's fine.
2005.04-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2495.992,2496.835,Of course it's distinct.
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2497.086,2498.992,"--but... and it totally makes my case, as far as I'm concerned."
2005.04-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2498.992,2499.523,"--Oh, well, you have a--"
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2499.523,2501.243,"I realize you may disagree with me on that, but--"
2005.04-905,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2558.349,2560.225,You're not at the whim of a monopoly seller.
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2566.131,2573.838,"I have a 5-year contract that's already in place, so, at least for the 5 years, I'm pretty much at the whim of my... unless I want to breach the contract, which--"
2005.04-905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2573.838,2574.885,--You should have written a better contract.
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2574.885,2576.135,"--Well, unfortunately--"
2005.04-905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2577.682,2579.713,But on a misinterpretation of Robinson Patman.
2005.04-905,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2580.933,2608.704,"What do you do with the policy argument... at, sort of, the level of the forest, rather than the trees... that the antitrust laws are designed to prefer competition in interbrand... in the interbrand market, rather than intrabrand, and that, therefore, to the extent there's ambiguity, that supports an interpretation that allows the manufacturer to strengthen his interbrand position, as opposed to protect the intrabrand position?"
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2608.704,2619.394,"I think to make that argument you essentially have to make mush out of the last half of the Robinson Patman Act, because it's not injury in any line of commerce, which is where I think you would be talking about interbrand problems."
2005.04-905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2758.581,2759.112,"--Well, let me ask you--"
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2759.112,2759.581,--and affirmed--
2005.04-905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2759.581,2760.05,--this question.
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2760.05,2760.66,--on appeal.
2005.04-905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2760.66,2774.803,"Supposing you did have a contract, such as Justice Scalia suggests, in which the manufacturer agreed that, at any given point of time, you will get just as favorable a concession as any other Volvo dealer could get at the same time."
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2779.663,2781.695,"In this case, yes, it would have been."
2005.04-905,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2789.916,2800.043,"--But you did... you did get a judgment on the... whatever it was... the State Franchises Act, and that is not being contested--"
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2800.043,2800.841,That's correct--
2005.04-905,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2800.841,2801.309,--on appeal.
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2801.309,2801.981,--Justice Ginsburg.
2005.04-905,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2801.981,2808.122,So that if... the question is whether fair franchising practices... were there unfair practices?
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2814.811,2815.171,Right.
2005.04-905,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2819.704,2819.969,"Well, you won on it."
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2819.969,2820.297,--violation--
2005.04-905,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2820.297,2820.86,You won on it.
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2823.579,2826.721,"--Well, it also has a different statute of limitations, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-905,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2829.47,2829.861,On--
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2829.861,2831.08,--that we're pursuing here.
2005.04-905,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2831.08,2839.818,"--limitations, one of the aspects of this matches... that in one case you went back as much as... there was a 7-month differential."
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2847.459,2848.148,"Oh, of course."
2005.04-905,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2872.371,2876.356,And it's also not disputed now that these were goods of like grade and quality.
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2876.356,2879.138,"Not disputed that these are goods of like grade and quality, Your Honor."
2005.04-905,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2879.138,2881.919,"Mr. Phillips, how many States have these fair franchising laws?"
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2882.935,2884.576,"Oh, I'm sure there are some States that don't."
2005.04-905,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2886.78,2893.515,"Your argument that focuses on the dealer's profits, I guess, doesn't depend upon you losing those sales at all."
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2902.206,2908.723,"Well, I think if we had gotten all of those sales the first time around, we would have ended up with the profits that would have allowed us to make the sales--"
2005.04-905,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2908.723,2922.365,"Oh, no, you just go back and look again, 7 months or a year down the road, and if somebody else was getting a bigger discount... if you had gotten the bigger discount, you would have made more money on those sales, and then you would have had more capital, and you'd be able to be a dealer for a longer time."
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2922.365,2931.18,"--Well, I think, at the end of the day, what we're talking about is essentially a jury question, were we entitled to say these were lost profits, the margins were reduced, we didn't have as much money?"
2005.04-905,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2939.761,2940.557,So--
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2940.557,2941.401,It seems to me that's a jury question.
2005.04-905,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2943.042,2943.417,--Wouldn't--
2005.04-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2943.417,2949.169,"--You suggest something very... to me, quite interesting, but it would be quite a departure, I think, from prior law that--"
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2949.169,2950.669,I hope not.
2005.04-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2950.669,2955.107,"--If you want to go look at this, you know, you say, all right, here's... we should be realistic about it."
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2964.079,2964.501,Right.
2005.04-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2964.501,2966.391,But they got a lower profit.
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2970.486,2972.018,"That, by itself, wouldn't count as an injury."
2005.04-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2972.018,2972.283,Yes.
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2976.519,2976.894,Right.
2005.04-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2976.894,2990.006,"Indeed, the market in... the dealership market, whatever... if that's a separate market, which it might be... becomes more concentrated, and the result of... you know, I could make a... tell a little story there that would be quite consistent with the purposes of the antitrust law."
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3010.026,3010.291,Right.
2005.04-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3010.291,3011.589,"So, what do you think of that?"
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3036.906,3038.313,"Well, I'm not here to--"
2005.04-905,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3038.313,3038.97,--I'm being a little--
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3038.97,3042.876,"--I'm not here, necessarily, as an advocate for overturning Morton Salt, for obvious reasons."
2005.04-905,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3070.163,3070.617,"Well, in fact--"
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3070.617,3071.335,"--we, neverthe... I'm sorry, Justice--"
2005.04-905,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3071.335,3072.383,--you almost have to show that.
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3081.713,3082.369,--One--
2005.04-905,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3082.369,3086.933,"--I... your opposing counsel says you almost concede that, right?"
2005.04-905,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3086.933,3088.871,"--Well, we... I mean, we don't rely on it."
2005.04-905,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3119.362,3120.628,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
2005.04-905,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,3123.973,3126.52,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-905,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3282.584,3283.287,Thank you--
2005.04-905,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3283.287,3289.602,"Let me ask you, if you have a minute left, is your central point that there was no proof of damages or no proof of injury to competition?"
2005.04-905,3,39134,roy_t_englert,,3289.602,3290.79,"Both, Your Honor."
2005.04-905,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3291.587,3292.666,I know they--
