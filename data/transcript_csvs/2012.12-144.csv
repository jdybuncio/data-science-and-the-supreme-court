2012.12-144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.087,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 12-144, Hollingsworth v. Perry."
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,7.204,11.072,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,24.664,28.966,"Mr. Cooper, we have jurisdictional and merits issues here."
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,31.834,33.853,"--I'd be happy to, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,58.401,63.889,Have we ever granted standing to proponents of ballot initiatives?
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,63.889,68.707,"No, Your Honor, the Court has not done that."
2012.12-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,78.899,93.408,"Well, this is -- this is -- the concern is certainly, the proponents are interested in getting it on the ballot and seeing that all of the proper procedures are followed, but once it's passed, they have no proprietary interest in it."
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,104.797,135.151,"--They're distinguishable, Your Honor, because the Constitution of the State of California and its election code provide, according to the unanimous interpretation of the California Supreme Court, that the official proponents, in addition to the other official responsibilities and authorities that they have in the initiative process, that those official proponents also have the authority and the responsibility to defend the validity of that initiative--"
2012.12-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,135.151,140.403,"I guess the attorney general of this State doesn't have any proprietary interest either, does he?"
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,140.403,142.155,"--No, Your Honor, nor did--"
2012.12-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,142.155,143.205,"But -- but he can defend it, can't he--"
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,143.205,143.971,--nor did--
2012.12-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,143.971,145.621,--because the law says he can defend it.
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,145.621,147.34,"--That's right, Your Honor."
2012.12-144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,152.061,152.511,Could the State--
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,152.511,153.511,--any particular enforcement--
2012.12-144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,153.511,160.081,--could -- could the State assign to any citizen the rights to defend a judgment of this kind?
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,160.081,163.366,"--Justice Kagan, that would be a -- a very tough question."
2012.12-144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,176.691,183.527,"Well, I just -- if you would on the hypothetical: Could a State just assign to anybody the ability to do this?"
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,183.527,186.648,"--Your Honor, I think it very well might."
2012.12-144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,196.02,198.12,"Well, that would be -- I'm sorry, are you finished?"
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,198.12,198.956,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,198.956,199.472,Okay.
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,221.753,233.293,"But, Your Honor, I guess the point I want to make is that there is no question the State has standing, the State itself has standing to represent its own interests in the validity of its own enactments."
2012.12-144,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,257.661,263.648,"Well, the Chief -- the Chief Justice and Justice Kagan have given a proper hypothetical to test your theory."
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,290.798,293.25,"--But of course it is, and I think the key--"
2012.12-144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,293.25,311.296,"But can you tell me -- that's a factual background with respect to their right to put the ballot initiative on the ballot, but how does it create an injury to them separate from that of every other taxpayer to have laws enforced?"
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,311.296,320.167,"--Your Honor, the -- the question before the Court, I would submit, is not the injury to the individual proponents; it's the injury to the State."
2012.12-144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,333.409,355.925,"At least one of the amici have suggested that it seems counterintuitive to think that the State is going to delegate to people who don't have a fiduciary duty to them, that it's going to delegate the responsibility of representing the State to individuals who have their own views."
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,363.861,364.396,--Well--
2012.12-144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,364.396,368.315,--Justice Scalia proffered the question of the Attorney General.
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,371.284,372.869,--True.
2012.12-144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,372.869,374.936,He has a fiduciary obligation.
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,374.936,390.664,"The Attorney General, whether it's a fiduciary obligation or not, is in normal circumstances the representative of the State to defend the validity of the State's enactments when they are challenged in Federal court."
2012.12-144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,405.257,412.677,Why isn't the fiduciary duty requirement before the State can designate a representative important?
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,412.677,432.158,"Your Honor, I would submit to you that I don't think there's anything in Article III or in any of this Court's decisions that suggest that a representative of a State must be -- have a fiduciary duty, but I would also suggest--"
2012.12-144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,432.158,443.882,"Well, generally you don't need to specify it because generally the people who get to enforce the legislation of the government are people who are in government positions elected by the people."
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,443.882,444.882,--And Your Honor--
2012.12-144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,444.882,449.786,Here these individuals are not elected by the people or appointed by the people.
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,449.786,456.04,--And the California Supreme Court specifically addressed and rejected that specific argument.
2012.12-144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,509.758,516.595,"That's -- historically, I think, 40 States, many States have what was called a public action."
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,591.142,625.733,"What I want to say, Your Honor, is according to the California Supreme Court, the California Constitution says in terms that among the responsibilities of official proponents, in addition to the many other responsibilities that they step forward and they assume in the initiative process, among those responsibilities and authorities is to defend that initiative if the public officials which the initiative process is designed to control have refused to do it."
2012.12-144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,628.685,633.069,"Counsel, if you want to proceed to the merits, you should feel free to do so."
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,633.069,634.338,"Thank you very much, Your Honor."
2012.12-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,706.116,710.07,"Mr. Cooper, Baker v. Nelson was 1971."
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,718.691,720.158,That is--
2012.12-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,720.158,732.083,"And the same-sex intimate conduct was considered criminal in many States in 1971, so I don't think we can extract much in Baker v. Nelson."
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,732.083,739.255,"--Well, Your Honor, certainly I acknowledge the precedential limitations of a summary dismissal."
2012.12-144,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,786.903,791.805,Do you believe this can be treated as a gender-based classification?
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,791.805,793.405,"Your Honor, I--"
2012.12-144,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,793.405,799.975,It's a difficult question that I've been trying to wrestle with it.
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,799.975,800.825,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,856.311,885.329,"Outside of the -- outside of the marriage context, can you think of any other rational basis, reason, for a State using sexual orientation as a factor in denying homosexuals benefits or imposing burdens on them?"
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,897.738,899.671,"--Your Honor, I cannot."
2012.12-144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,907.527,907.86,All right.
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,935.444,937.712,"--No, Your Honor, we certainly are not."
2012.12-144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1019.866,1022.652,So you -- so what -- I don't quite understand it.
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1031.758,1051.904,"--Well, Your Honor, I would think that -- that -- I think it's a -- it's a very different question whether or not the Government can proceed arbitrarily and irrationally with respect to any group of people, regardless of whether or not they qualify under this Court's traditional test for suspectedness."
2012.12-144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1080.589,1083.041,"Mr. Cooper, could I just understand your argument."
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1102.937,1107.491,"I -- Your Honor, that's the essential thrust of our -- our position, yes."
2012.12-144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1107.491,1114.995,Is -- is there -- so you have sort of a reason for not including same-sex couples.
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1132.206,1155.655,"Your Honor, we -- we go further in -- in the sense that it is reasonable to be very concerned that redefining marriage to -- as a genderless institution could well lead over time to harms to that institution and to the interests that society has always -- has -- has always used that institution to address."
2012.12-144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1156.988,1161.559,"Well, could you explain that a little bit to me, just because I did not pick this up in your briefs."
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1175.551,1193.78,"--Once again, I -- I would reiterate that we don't believe that's the correct legal question before the Court, and that the correct question is whether or not redefining marriage to include same-sex couples would advance the interests of marriage as a--"
2012.12-144,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1193.78,1204.069,"Well, then are -- are you conceding the point that there is no harm or denigration to traditional opposite-sex marriage couples?"
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1205.255,1206.321,"--No, Your Honor, no."
2012.12-144,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1207.788,1212.741,"Well, but, then it -- then it seems to me that you should have to address Justice Kagan's question."
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1212.741,1213.674,"Thank you, Justice Kennedy."
2012.12-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1304.351,1307.303,"Mr. Cooper, let me -- let me give you one -- one concrete thing."
2012.12-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1342.307,1344.59,"California -- no, California does."
2012.12-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1344.59,1345.09,I don't think we know the answer to that.
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1347.792,1349.061,"No, Your Honor."
2012.12-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1349.961,1353.196,"But that's a possible deleterious effect, isn't it?"
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1353.196,1356.148,"--Your Honor, it -- it is certainly among the--"
2012.12-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1356.148,1360.019,"It wouldn't be in California, Mr. Cooper, because that's not an issue, is it?"
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1364.153,1365.203,"--That's right, Your Honor."
2012.12-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1371.574,1373.676,"I -- it's true, but irrelevant."
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1400.26,1417.72,"--And -- and that, Your Honor, is the point I am trying to make, and it is the Respondents' responsibility to prove, under rational basis review, not only that -- that there clearly will be no harm, but that it's beyond debate that there will be no harm."
2012.12-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1417.72,1425.491,"Mr. Cooper, you are defending -- you are opposing a judgment that applies to California only, not to all of the States."
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1425.491,1427.091,"That's true, Your Honor."
2012.12-144,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1444.469,1453.241,I -- I think there's -- there's substantial -- that there's substance to the point that sociological information is new.
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1490.849,1496.001,"Your Honor, I certainly would not dispute the importance of that consideration."
2012.12-144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1570.065,1572.215,"Mr. Cooper, we will afford you more time."
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1576.385,1577.002,Oh--
2012.12-144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1577.002,1587.275,"As long as you are on that, then I would like to ask you this: Assume you could distinguish California, suppose we accept your argument or accept Justice Scalia's version of your argument and that distinguishes California."
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1623.716,1625.816,--You're--
2012.12-144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1625.816,1626.751,Am I not clear?
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1634.022,1635.438,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1635.438,1639.826,"And the reason there was adoption, but that doesn't apply to California."
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1662.022,1663.357,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1692.71,1707.386,"Well, suppose a State said, Mr. Cooper, suppose a State said that, Because we think that the focus of marriage really should be on procreation, we are not going to give marriage licenses anymore to any couple where both people are over the age of 55."
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1709.922,1712.274,"--No, Your Honor, it would not be constitutional."
2012.12-144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1712.274,1715.909,"Because that's the same State interest, I would think, you know."
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1724.432,1737.422,"Your Honor, even with respect to couples over the age of 55, it is very rare that both couples -- both parties to the couple are infertile, and the traditional ----"
2012.12-144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1738.188,1749.23,"No, really, because if the couple -- I can just assure you, if both the woman and the man are over the age of 55, there are not a lot of children coming out of that marriage."
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1750.63,1763.82,"Your Honor, society's -- society's interest in responsible procreation isn't just with respect to the procreative capacities of the couple itself."
2012.12-144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1783.817,1784.819,"Actually, I'm not even--"
2012.12-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1784.819,1794.192,"I suppose we could have a questionnaire at the marriage desk when people come in to get the marriage -- you know, Are you fertile or are you not fertile?"
2012.12-144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1801.178,1802.464,"--Well, I just asked about age."
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1807.766,1815.355,"--Your Honor, and even asking about age, you would have to ask if both parties are infertile."
2012.12-144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1816.172,1823.861,Strom Thurmond was -- was not the chairman of the Senate committee when Justice Kagan was confirmed.
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1828.663,1834.817,--Very few men -- very few men outlive their own fertility.
2012.12-144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1835.567,1839.469,A couple where both people are over the age of 55--
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1839.469,1840.119,--I--
2012.12-144,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1840.119,1842.921,--A couple where both people are over the age of 55.
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1842.921,1851.527,"--And Your Honor, again, the marital norm which imposes upon that couple the obligation of fidelity--"
2012.12-144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1851.527,1853.712,"I'm sorry, where is this--"
2012.12-144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1853.712,1856.495,"I'm sorry, maybe you can finish your answer to Justice Kagan."
2012.12-144,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1856.495,1856.83,--I'm sorry.
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1856.83,1869.905,"--It's designed, Your Honor, to make it less likely that either party to that -- to that marriage will engage in irresponsible procreative conduct outside of that marriage."
2012.12-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1910.149,1923.622,"Mr. Cooper, we said that somebody who is locked up in prison and who is not going to get out has a right to marry, has a fundamental right to marry, no possibility of procreation."
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1923.622,1928.09,"Your Honor is referring, I'm sure, to the Turner case, and--"
2012.12-144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1928.09,1928.407,Yes.
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1928.407,1936.346,"--I think that, with due respect, Justice Ginsburg, way over-reads -- way over-reads Turner against Safley."
2012.12-144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1983.177,1983.977,"Thank you, Mr. Cooper."
2012.12-144,0,18687,charles_j_cooper,,1983.977,1985.377,"--Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1985.377,1987.628,Mr. Olson?
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1987.628,1991.599,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2028.705,2032.341,"Mr. Olson, I cut off your friend before he could get into the merits."
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2032.341,2034.776,"I was trying to avoid that, Your Honor."
2012.12-144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2034.776,2035.359,I know ----
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2047.098,2048.017,Yes.
2012.12-144,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2061.857,2063.059,But this is not whoever it wants.
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2097.432,2102.251,That's the -- that's the way the California Supreme Court saw it with respect to California law.
2012.12-144,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2129.569,2147.698,"Well, Mr. Olson, is it your position that the only people who could defend a ballot, a law that's adopted in California through the ballot initiative are the Attorney General and the governor, so that if the Attorney General and the governor don't like the ballot initiative, it will go undefended?"
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2148.798,2150.567,I don't -- I don't think it's quite that limited.
2012.12-144,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2167.843,2168.993,Who -- who would appoint him?
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2171.793,2172.795,"--Well, that happens all the time."
2012.12-144,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2188.221,2189.221,I suppose--
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2189.221,2194.708,--and that person would have a responsibility for the State and might have responsibility for the attorneys' fees.
2012.12-144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2194.708,2206.366,"I suppose there might be people out there with their own personal standing, someone who performs marriages and would like that to remain open to everyone but would prefer not to perform same-sex marriages, or other people."
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2217.907,2219.942,There might well be in -- in a different case.
2012.12-144,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2254.765,2256.365,"Mr. Olson, I think the bottom line--"
2012.12-144,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2256.365,2263.704,The States are not bound by the same separation of powers doctrine that underlies the Federal Constitution.
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2325.242,2329.246,--The only -- that's exactly what the California Supreme Court thought.
2012.12-144,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2370.74,2376.46,"--Mr. Olson, I think that you're not answering the fundamental fear."
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2398.474,2407.246,--I don't have an answer to that question unless there's an appointment process either built into the system where it's an officer of California or--
2012.12-144,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2407.246,2418.221,"So why -- why isn't this viewed as an appointment process, that the in -- the ballot initiators have now become that body?"
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2418.221,2419.554,--And that's the argument--
2012.12-144,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2419.554,2420.239,Is that your argument--
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2420.239,2422.873,--That's our -- that's the argument our opponents make.
2012.12-144,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2439.15,2443.285,"What the brief says is, of course, you can appoint people."
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2482.493,2483.093,"--Yeah, I don't--"
2012.12-144,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2483.093,2483.826,Why is it missing here?
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2483.826,2498.269,"--It is -- what is missing here, because you're not an officer of the State of California, you don't have a fiduciary duty to the State of California, you're not bound by the ethical standards of an officer of the State of California to represent the State of California, you could have conflicts of interest."
2012.12-144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2505.839,2507.391,You should feel free to move on to the merits.
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2507.391,2508.324,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
2012.12-144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2556.457,2562.778,"I'm not sure, counsel, that it makes -- I'm not sure that it's right to view this as excluding a particular group."
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2599.068,2602.603,"--Well, there's a couple of answers to that, it seems to me, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2609.942,2616.179,"Oh, that's only because Proposition 8 came 140 days after the California Supreme Court issued its decision."
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2616.179,2616.396,That's right.
2012.12-144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2616.396,2626.052,And don't you think it's more reasonable to view it as a change by the California Supreme Court of this institution that's been around since time immemorial?
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2626.052,2630.104,"The California Supreme Court, like this Supreme Court, decides what the law is."
2012.12-144,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2642.496,2645.448,--You -- you've led me right into a question I was going to ask.
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2682.804,2686.273,--When -- may I answer this in the form of a rhetorical question?
2012.12-144,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2695.128,2696.261,"It's an easy question, I think, for that one."
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2715.374,2730.468,"When the -- when the California Supreme Court faced the decision, which it had never faced before, is -- does excluding gay and lesbian citizens, who are a class based upon their status as homosexuals -- is it -- is it constitutional--"
2012.12-144,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2730.468,2733.003,That -- that's not when it became unconstitutional.
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2744.478,2748.68,"--That -- they did not assign a date to it, Justice Scalia, as you know."
2012.12-144,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2751.382,2753.233,I'm not talking about the California Supreme Court.
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2757.885,2758.251,--Yes.
2012.12-144,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2758.251,2760.237,Was it always unconstitutional?
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2760.237,2771.795,"It was constitutional when we -- as a culture determined that sexual orientation is a characteristic of individuals that they cannot control, and that that--"
2012.12-144,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2771.795,2772.778,I see.
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2773.48,2774.93,--There's no specific date in time.
2012.12-144,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2776.515,2778.565,"Well, how am I supposed to know how to decide a case, then--"
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2778.565,2779.817,Because the case that's before you--
2012.12-144,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2779.817,2781.484,--if you can't give me a date when the Constitution changes?
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2781.484,2802.913,"--in -- the case that's before you today, California decided -- the citizens of California decided, after the California Supreme Court decided that individuals had a right to get married irrespective of their sexual orientation in California, and then the Californians decided in Proposition 8, wait a minute, we don't want those people to be able to get married."
2012.12-144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2802.913,2811.336,So -- so your case -- your case would be different if Proposition 8 was enacted into law prior to the California Supreme Court decision?
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2811.336,2816.221,I would make -- I would make the -- also would make the -- that distinguishes it in one respect.
2012.12-144,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2835.385,2839.521,So it would be unconstitutional even in States that did not allow civil unions?
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2839.521,2840.856,"We do, we submit that."
2012.12-144,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2842.889,2843.089,Okay.
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2845.841,2848.626,"I don't -- when -- it seems to me, Justice Scalia, that--"
2012.12-144,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2848.626,2850.462,--It seems to me you ought to be able to tell me when.
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2852.664,2855.48,--I -- I submit you've never required that before.
2012.12-144,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2869.206,2870.139,"50 years ago, it was okay?"
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2870.139,2877.129,"I -- I can't answer that question, and I don't think this Court has ever phrased the question in that way."
2012.12-144,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2877.129,2877.562,I can't either.
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2879.012,2898.976,"But what I have before you now, the case that's before you today, is whether or not California can take a class of individuals based upon their characteristics, their distinguishing characteristics, remove from them the right of privacy, liberty, association, spirituality, and identity that -- that marriage gives them."
2012.12-144,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2907.398,2913.718,That's really -- that's a broad argument that you -- that's in this case if the Court wants to reach it.
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2938.349,2940.483,This Court has always looked into the context.
2012.12-144,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2960.862,2981.51,"Seriously, Mr. Olson, if California provides all the substantive benefits of marriage to same-sex domestic partnerships, are you seriously arguing that if California -- if the State -- if the case before us now were from a State that doesn't provide any of those benefits to same-sex couples, this case would come out differently?"
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2981.51,2989.799,"No, I don't think it would come out differently, because of the fundamental arguments we're making with respect to class-based distinctions with respect to a fundamental right."
2012.12-144,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3023.522,3024.939,I don't think you can have it both ways.
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3037.33,3041.365,I -- I think that it's not that we're arguing that those are inconsistent.
2012.12-144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3071.651,3074.436,So it's just about -- it's just about the label in this case.
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3074.436,3075.553,The label is--
2012.12-144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3075.553,3078.571,"Same-sex couples have every other right, it's just about the label."
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3078.571,3081.273,--The label “ marriage ” means something.
2012.12-144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3082.206,3082.473,Sure.
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3102.952,3108.09,"--It is like you were to say you can vote, you can travel, but you may not be a citizen."
2012.12-144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3125.885,3133.156,"How do we know -- how do we know that that's the reason, or a necessary part of the reason, that we've recognized marriage as a fundamental right?"
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3142.412,3158.606,"--But you have said that marriage is a fundamental right with respect to procreation and at the same level getting married, privacy -- you said that in the Zablocki case, you said that in the Lawrence case, and you said it in other cases, the Skinner case, for example."
2012.12-144,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3175.149,3189.392,"--Mr. Olson, the bottom line that you're being asked -- and -- and it is one that I'm interested in the answer: If you say that marriage is a fundamental right, what State restrictions could ever exist?"
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3215.376,3231.735,"--Well, you've said -- you've said in the cases decided by this Court that the polygamy issue, multiple marriages raises questions about exploitation, abuse, patriarchy, issues with respect to taxes, inheritance, child custody, it is an entirely different thing."
2012.12-144,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3265.891,3274.581,Is there any way to decide this case in a principled manner that is limited to California only?
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3274.581,3276.433,"--Yes, the Ninth Circuit did that."
2012.12-144,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3283.103,3297.027,"The problem -- the problem with the case is that you're really asking, particularly because of the sociological evidence you cite, for us to go into uncharted waters, and you can play with that metaphor, there's a wonderful destination, it is a cliff."
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3320.857,3323.809,"--Oh, the case was certainly properly granted, Your Honor."
2012.12-144,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3333.75,3336.119,But that's not the issue the Ninth Circuit decided.
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3336.119,3349.027,"--The issue -- yes, the Ninth Circuit looked at it and decided because of your decision on the Romer case, this Court's decision on the Romer case, that it could be decided on the narrower issue, but it certainly was an appropriate case to grant."
2012.12-144,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3375.944,3378.127,It was hundreds of years old in the common law countries.
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3380.412,3381.764,And -- and what we have here--
2012.12-144,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3381.764,3383.131,So -- so that's not accurate.
2012.12-144,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,3383.131,3392.503,--I -- I respectfully submit that we've under -- we've learned to understand more about sexual orientation and what it means to individuals.
2012.12-144,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3409.463,3410.298,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-144,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3430.961,3433.094,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-144,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3437.965,3441.85,"You don't think you're going to get away with not starting with the jurisdictional question, do you?"
2012.12-144,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3443.269,3446.154,"--As an amicus, I thought I might actually, Your Honor."
2012.12-144,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3497.253,3507.476,"Well, tomorrow you're going to be making a standing argument that some parties think is rather tenuous, but today, you're -- you're very strong for Article III standing?"
2012.12-144,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3507.476,3517.917,"Well, we said this was a -- we said this was a close question, and -- and our interests are, Justice Alito, in tomorrow's issues where we have briefed the matter thoroughly and will be prepared to discuss it with the Court tomorrow."
2012.12-144,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3552.74,3578.907,"General Verrilli, I could understand your argument if you were talking about the entire United States, but you -- your brief says it's only eight or nine States, the States that permit civil unions, and that's -- brings up a question that was asked before."
2012.12-144,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3597.452,3632.442,"That gets to my second point, Your Honor, which is that I do think the problem here with the arguments that Petitioners are advancing is that California's own laws do cut the legs out from under all of the justifications that Petitioners have offered in defense of Proposition 8, and I understand Your Honor's point and the point that Justice Kennedy raised earlier, but I do think this Court's equal protection jurisprudence requires the Court to evaluate the interests that the State puts forward, not in a vacuum, but in the context of the actual substance of California law."
2012.12-144,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3655.891,3656.675,"Well, the argument--"
2012.12-144,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3656.675,3657.358,None of the--
2012.12-144,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3657.358,3658.843,Justice Breyer.
2012.12-144,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3658.843,3668.466,"--What is the one -- look, a State that does nothing for gay couples hurts them much more than a State that does something."
2012.12-144,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3710.643,3717.13,"--Well, because you have to measure the -- under the standard of equal protection scrutiny that we think this Court's cases require."
2012.12-144,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3717.13,3726.571,"I know the principle, but I'm saying which are their good arguments, in your opinion, that would be good enough to overcome for the State that does nothing, but not good enough to overcome California where they do a lot?"
2012.12-144,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3726.571,3739.829,"Well, we -- what we're -- what we're saying about that is that we're not prepared to close the door to an argument in another State where the State's interests haven't cut the legs out from under the arguments."
2012.12-144,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3788.075,3793.545,"General, there is an irony in that, which is the States that do more have less rights."
2012.12-144,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3793.545,3801.466,"Well -- well, I understand that, Your Honor, but I do think that you have to think about the claim of right on the other side of the equation here."
2012.12-144,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3826.366,3841.04,"--You want us to assess the effects of same-sex marriage, the potential effects on -- of same-sex marriage, the potential -- the effects of Proposition 8."
2012.12-144,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3916.94,3921.491,"--I have four points I would like to make to that in response to that, Justice Alito, and I think they are all important."
2012.12-144,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3939.852,3948.708,"Well, just in response to that, of course the Constitution could be amended, and -- and I think I read that the California Constitution has been amended 500 times."
2012.12-144,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3948.708,3949.492,--But the--
2012.12-144,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3949.492,3951.858,So it's not exactly like the U.S. Constitution.
2012.12-144,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3951.858,3952.694,--But it does -- of course not.
2012.12-144,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3980.277,3982.546,"Yeah, but the rest of the country has been cautious."
2012.12-144,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3982.546,3983.846,And -- and that's why--
2012.12-144,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3983.846,3988.367,"And we're -- and you are asking us to impose this on the whole country, not just California."
2012.12-144,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3988.367,3990.067,"--No, respectfully Justice Scalia, we are not."
2012.12-144,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4003.893,4011.982,"I don't want to -- I want you to get back to Justice Alito's other points, but is it the position of the United States that same-sex marriage is not required throughout the country?"
2012.12-144,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4011.982,4016.717,--We are not -- we are not taking the position that it is required throughout the country.
2012.12-144,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4025.156,4036.198,"So your -- your position is only if a State allows civil unions does it become unconstitutional to forbid same-sex marriage, right?"
2012.12-144,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4036.198,4038.231,I -- I see my red light is on.
2012.12-144,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4038.231,4038.581,"Well, you can go on."
2012.12-144,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4038.581,4039.233,Thank you.
2012.12-144,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4090.016,4092.033,But you are willing to wait in the rest of the country.
2012.12-144,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4098.521,4112.029,If -- with respect to a State that allows gay couples to have children and to have families and then denies the stabilizing effect--
2012.12-144,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4112.029,4118.683,So it's got to happen right away in those States where same-sex couples have every legal right that married couples do.
2012.12-144,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4118.683,4119.102,"--Well, we think--"
2012.12-144,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4119.102,4122.404,But you can wait in States where they have fewer legal rights.
2012.12-144,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4122.404,4128.124,--What i said is it's an open question with respect to those States and the Court should wait and see what kind of a record a State could make.
2012.12-144,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4135.645,4137.08,How would the record be different elsewhere?
2012.12-144,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4137.08,4140.698,"--Well, they might try to make a different record about the effects on children."
2012.12-144,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4174.77,4176.289,Can I ask you a problem about--
2012.12-144,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4176.289,4176.689,Sure.
2012.12-144,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4176.689,4181.358,--I -- it seems to me that your position that you are supporting is somewhat internally inconsistent.
2012.12-144,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4198.72,4207.993,"Well, I -- I think what Proposition 8 does is deny the long-term stabilizing effect that marriage brings."
2012.12-144,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4210.528,4214.33,But you also tell me there has been no harm shown to children of same-sex couples.
2012.12-144,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4214.33,4221.667,"--California -- there are 37,000 children in same-sex families in California now."
2012.12-144,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4239.379,4243.249,"Well, the real cost right now would be you're asking me to write these words:"
2012.12-144,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4270.916,4282.641,"Well, we -- we think that, as I started my argument, Your Honor, that all the warning flags for exacting equal protection scrutiny are present here."
2012.12-144,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4313.177,4313.679,But they are not the only ones.
2012.12-144,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4313.679,4321.099,"--that States that haven't taken this step, that they are going to have an easy time meeting heightened scrutiny, which I think has to apply--"
2012.12-144,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4321.099,4325.57,Suppose one of those States repeals its civil union laws?
2012.12-144,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4325.57,4327.153,--It would be a different case.
2012.12-144,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4333.674,4334.693,"Thank you, General."
2012.12-144,3,18687,charles_j_cooper,,4338.811,4339.995,Thank you very much.
2012.12-144,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4339.995,4344.964,And you might address why you think we should take and decide this case.
2012.12-144,3,18687,charles_j_cooper,,4344.964,4350.285,"Yes, Your Honor, and that is the one thing on which I wholeheartedly agree with my friend Mr. Olson."
2012.12-144,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4390.429,4396.916,I think that begs your -- Mr. Olson doesn't really focus on this.
2012.12-144,3,18687,charles_j_cooper,,4412.359,4416.495,"--Because, Your Honor--"
2012.12-144,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4416.495,4429.054,"We let issues perk, and so we let racial segregation perk for 50 years from 1898 to 1954."
2012.12-144,3,18687,charles_j_cooper,,4429.054,4430.787,"--Your Honor, it is hard to--"
2012.12-144,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4430.787,4433.956,"And now we are only talking about, at most, four years."
2012.12-144,3,18687,charles_j_cooper,,4433.956,4442.478,"--It is hard to imagine a case that would be better, or more thoroughly, I should say, at least, briefed and argued to this Court."
2012.12-144,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4442.478,4444.914,"It's too late for that, too late for that now, isn't it?"
2012.12-144,3,18687,charles_j_cooper,,4457.305,4493.495,"And in this particular case, to not grant certiorari is to essentially bless a judicial decision that there -- that at least in the State of California, the people have no authority to step back, hit the pause button, and allow the experiments that are taking place in this country to further mature; that in fact, at least in California -- and it's impossible to limit this ruling, Your Honor, even to California, even the Solicitor General's argument, he says, applies to at least eight States."
2012.12-144,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4551.281,4554.716,"I thought he was saying, Mr. Cooper, that it's not before the Court today."
2012.12-144,3,18687,charles_j_cooper,,4580.7,4584.168,"Forgive me, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.12-144,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4587.886,4589.32,I think it was McLaughlin against Florida.
2012.12-144,3,18687,charles_j_cooper,,4589.32,4591.938,Yes.
2012.12-144,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4591.938,4595.89,It was cohabitation of people of different races.
2012.12-144,3,18687,charles_j_cooper,,4595.89,4598.928,Certainly.
2012.12-144,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4598.928,4603.063,And the Court took that case and waited to reach the merits case.
2012.12-144,3,18687,charles_j_cooper,,4603.063,4607.784,"It's -- yes, Your Honor."
2012.12-144,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4612.252,4628.028,"I may -- my memory may be wrong, but I think the case was that people of different races were arrested and charged with the crime of interracial cohabitation."
2012.12-144,3,18687,charles_j_cooper,,4632.499,4633.199,Yes.
2012.12-144,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4633.199,4633.715,Unlawful.
2012.12-144,3,18687,charles_j_cooper,,4633.715,4635.367,Yes.
2012.12-144,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4796.205,4797.805,"Thank you, counsel, counsel."
