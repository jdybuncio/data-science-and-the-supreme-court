1980.79-5932,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.289,"We will hear arguments first this morning in Doe vs. Delaware, No. 79-5932."
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,21.096,23.948,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-5932,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,40.291,43.577,"Do they want the children back, Mr. Myers?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,43.577,50.766,"The parents... if this order was vacated at this time, custody would still remain within the State."
1980.79-5932,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,61.289,61.922,Say that again.
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,63.14,65.358,The mother regaining them in her custody.
1980.79-5932,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,65.358,66.375,In her custody.
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,66.375,66.642,Yes.
1980.79-5932,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,66.642,68.06,So he doesn't want them back?
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,68.06,77.583,"Well, he is more than willing to allow the mother to have custody and allow him to have reasonable visitation rights so he can maintain his fatherly role with the children."
1980.79-5932,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,77.583,83.987,"Well, am I correct that neither mother nor father has seen these children in several years?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,83.987,87.039,State has resisted efforts for the--
1980.79-5932,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,87.039,90.574,"No, no; but they have not seen the children in several years, have they?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,90.574,91.707,--Since 1975.
1980.79-5932,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,91.707,93.526,"They are now separated, are they not?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,93.526,100.18,"The father lives and works in Atlanta and the mother lives with her stepson and her husband, and remains in Delaware."
1980.79-5932,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,100.18,100.93,She is now married?
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,100.93,102.132,Yes.
1980.79-5932,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,102.132,107.785,"But all they want, really, is access to these children, just want to know where they are, is that it?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,107.785,111.587,"No, I think they want to regain their children back into their own family, into their own family."
1980.79-5932,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,111.587,115.272,"They... when you speak, ""they"", they are not--"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,115.272,115.906,The mother wants to--
1980.79-5932,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,115.906,118.058,"--They are not a family unit anymore, are they?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,118.058,130.966,"--Well, I think the mother had a family relationship with her children before the State intervened in this family and she is more than willing to again create those day to day attachments."
1980.79-5932,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,130.966,132.234,There are five children?
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,132.234,132.851,That's correct.
1980.79-5932,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,132.851,134.084,And she wants all five?
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,136.87,141.857,They range in ages from six through nine.
1980.79-5932,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,141.857,142.84,Six through nine?
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,143.459,144.359,Yes.
1980.79-5932,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,150.712,152.981,I see.
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,152.981,159.401,"The nature of the proceeding below was a termination of parental rights proceeding, or a TPR."
1980.79-5932,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,192.106,197.926,"When it ends the relationship with the parents I gather it has the same effect as an adoption, doesn't it?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,197.926,202.062,"Well, a TPR does not necessarily lead to an adoption."
1980.79-5932,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,202.062,209.151,"No, but in terms of termination of any relationship of parent and child, doesn't it have the same effect as an adoption?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,209.151,211.436,"As to the parent, it makes him a stranger."
1980.79-5932,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,367.472,368.272,And did they?
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,368.272,369.205,"Yes, they did."
1980.79-5932,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,383.215,384.265,It's totally irrelevant.
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,387.017,387.65,"--Yes, he did."
1980.79-5932,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,387.65,388.802,Has he ever been reimbursed?
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,388.802,391.42,I don't believe so.
1980.79-5932,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,436.366,450.959,"Well, Mr. Myers, in reading the opinion of the Delaware Supreme Court at page 199 of Atlantic, 2d, the Court says that"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,465.219,469.587,"Well, we contend also that ""best interest"" is just as vague as ""not fitted"" language."
1980.79-5932,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,493.286,502.975,"Well, but, it wouldn't have been sufficient, as I read the Delaware Supreme Court opinion."
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,502.975,504.094,It's a precondition.
1980.79-5932,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,536.398,550.623,"Mr. Myers, do you agree or what is your view on whether the issues are the same for the mother and the father?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,575.523,578.325,I don't think the order is proper as to either parent.
1980.79-5932,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,578.325,581.76,"I understand that, but is it the same issue as to both?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,581.76,593.485,"Yes, I think... again, there's no conduct on behalf of either parent, particularly the mother, but even to the father's conduct, there's no conduct on his part which was shown that any of that conduct caused harm to his children."
1980.79-5932,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,593.485,604.71,"I understand on your harm argument, but on the best interests of the child argument, perhaps now that they're separated there's at least an arguable basis for drawing a distinction between the two?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,604.71,605.66,"Well, I think the best interests--"
1980.79-5932,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,605.66,608.578,"In fact, are their interests entirely parallel?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,617.45,629.858,"--Well, I think once the order terminating both of their parental rights, in effect giving their children to strangers, is vacated, then in effect those interests, the State courts may have to adjudicate those interests if they decide they conflict."
1980.79-5932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,645.787,652.873,"Well, when did the change of circumstance take place in these proceedings?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,652.873,654.742,When did they separate?
1980.79-5932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,654.742,656.075,"Yes, when did they separate?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,656.075,659.26,The record below does not reflect that.
1980.79-5932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,661.729,666.883,"Well, was it before or after the case went through the Delaware courts?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,666.883,670.735,They had separated prior to the final opinion of the Delaware Supreme Court.
1980.79-5932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,670.735,673.604,Did the Delaware Supreme Court know these facts?
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,673.604,674.972,They knew they were separated.
1980.79-5932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,678.507,692.684,"Well, do you suppose the same thing would have happened... do you think the same termination of parental rights would have occurred if the facts that now exist had existed at the time of the petition to terminate parental rights?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,692.684,694.184,You mean the parties' separation?
1980.79-5932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,694.184,694.434,Yes.
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,696.469,700.688,I can only speculate that that information was given to the Delaware Supreme Court and was--
1980.79-5932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,700.688,702.29,"It was never given to the trial court, though?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,702.29,702.74,--No.
1980.79-5932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,707.242,708.694,Did you ask them to?
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,708.694,712.246,"No, because we believe that even though those facts existed in '75--"
1980.79-5932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,712.246,714.347,"Well, I know, that's why I'm asking you, you never--"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,714.347,720.251,--There was no specific request of the Delaware Supreme Court to remand with those factual situations changed.
1980.79-5932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,720.251,727.588,"--Well, I would have supposed you might have had an easier time in the trial court on these facts, wouldn't you?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,738.129,744.783,"The parents aren't seeking if this order would be overturned to get their children back, given the passage of time, the next day."
1980.79-5932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,744.783,745.15,No.
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,745.15,750.854,They want to regain contact with the children and work towards eventually having them reintegrated into their home.
1980.79-5932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,750.854,757.19,You're interested in having the termination of parental rights overturned?
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,757.19,759.542,That's correct; as a starting point.
1980.79-5932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,759.542,764.463,"But you've never asked anybody... this judgment isn't final yet, is it?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,764.463,766.482,"Yes, I believe it is, if it... well--"
1980.79-5932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,766.482,767.082,"No, it isn't--"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,767.082,768.448,"--Not by direct appeal, it's not."
1980.79-5932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,768.448,769.365,--If isn't final.
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,769.365,772.117,Until you rule it's not final.
1980.79-5932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,772.117,779.54,"But you've never asked a Delaware court to reconsider in the light of new facts, have you?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,779.54,779.99,No.
1980.79-5932,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,923.434,934.992,"Mr. Myers, is it part of your position that a state may not ever terminate parental rights?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,934.992,944.848,We think that the only interest that the State can assert in a termination of parental rights that's so compelling is prevention of actual substantial or imminent harm to the children.
1980.79-5932,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,950.918,953.62,Physical or mental harm?
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,953.62,954.737,"Pardon me, Justice Marshall?"
1980.79-5932,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,954.737,956.672,Physical or mental harm?
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,956.672,968.963,"Physical harm, surely, and mental harm when it's characterized by some overt symptoms, not merely speculation, but symptoms such as aggressiveness withdrawal and so forth."
1980.79-5932,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,968.963,973.8,"I just wanted to know, do I have to get degree in psychiatry to decide the case?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,973.8,982.973,"Well, I think the trial courts decide these types of issues every day and it's not difficult to show those types of actual harm."
1980.79-5932,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,982.973,991.179,"Then you think also that the criteria for termination have to be spelled out in some detail, I take it?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,991.179,998.065,"I think that the appropriate way for state legislatures to go in this field is, in effect, to spell out the criteria of harm."
1980.79-5932,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,998.065,1005.921,"Well, appropriate isn't really what I had in mind, because we are dealing with a constitutional question."
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1010.973,1022.014,I think that's required so that individual social workers or judges don't in effect define within vague statutes what their own ideas of good parenting or bad parenting are.
1980.79-5932,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1025.133,1032.822,"Well, is the issue the welfare of the children, the interests of the children, not good parenting or bad parenting?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1032.822,1038.725,I think that's why the legislature should look to harm to the children rather than trying to detail any right or wrong parent.
1980.79-5932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1044.129,1054.319,So you don't really... you don't really say that the welfare of the children is necessarily an insufficient standard.
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1061.473,1063.891,If the legislature defined the welfare--
1980.79-5932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1063.891,1065.21,"No, I'm not saying legislature."
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1068.162,1074.066,"--A construction that would limit welfare to harm, I think, would be constitutional."
1980.79-5932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1074.066,1086.373,"Or in any specific case, if in applying the welfare of the children standard as a matter of fact they found that there was harm to the children?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1087.856,1095.746,"If the harm was in effect actual harm or imminent threat of actual harm, whether that be psychological or physical."
1980.79-5932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1106.87,1111.006,"--You wouldn't require the same standard for termination of custody, would you?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1111.006,1113.191,"Well, that case is not before you today."
1980.79-5932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1115.393,1131.235,"It is in a sense because I take it that you would say, if the State had custody of the children, and validly so, that there could never be an adoption, unless your standard is satisfied?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1131.235,1136.556,--Unless returning these children to their parents would cause them actual harm.
1980.79-5932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1136.556,1141.96,"So unless the State could prove that, the State would always just have to retain custody?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1141.96,1147.614,When the State is trying to take children from both of their parents and give them to someone--
1980.79-5932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1147.614,1152.583,And you would be required not to put these children in any kind of a permanent family?
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1152.583,1159.172,"--Well, I think they can return to their natural family, if the State in effect can't show that it's going to cause harm that the--"
1980.79-5932,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1159.172,1163.54,So are you saying custody then rests on the same standard or not?
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1163.54,1177.8,"--Well, I think that any time the State seeks to intrude in a family, that in effect the State surely has to show some possibility of harm at the custody stage and much more at the termination state where in effect it's permanent."
1980.79-5932,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1177.8,1189.774,"In taking this record as a whole, are you telling us that this record would not support a conclusion, a finding and conclusion that there was emotional harm to these children?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1189.774,1196.095,"Well, there's been no finding below and I think that that's the responsibility of the state court."
1980.79-5932,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1196.095,1199.964,I've asked you a hypothetical question: that it would not support?
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1202.681,1215.841,"Well, I think that any of the criteria that the trial court lists, frequent moves of the family, the half brother and half sister relationship, would not support a finding of sufficient harm for them to in effect permanently break up this family."
1980.79-5932,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1247.11,1252.864,The problem I have is that you admit that they're living in incest; they were.
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1252.864,1257.002,They were half brother and half sister and had five children and they were convicted of the crime.
1980.79-5932,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1257.768,1271.076,And you don't think that a child brought up in the home of two criminals continuing to practice their criminality is not a good home?
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1271.076,1277.249,"Well, that's a decision that the Delaware Legislature has not made and that's a problem with the ""not fitted"" conduct."
1980.79-5932,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1287.704,1292.675,That wasn't my question.
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1294.691,1295.777,My personal opinion?
1980.79-5932,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1295.777,1296.243,Yes.
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1296.243,1305.399,"In the absence of showing any of the types of harm I've outlined before, I'm not sure that the State had any reason to take children from both of these parents."
1980.79-5932,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1305.399,1329.847,"Well, suppose a state has murder as a misdemeanor, would a home of husband, mother and father convicted murderers, making murder their pastime, be a decent home, in your opinion?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1329.847,1338.203,"Absent the showing that the conviction and the conduct that caused the conviction harmed the child, there should be no reason for the state to intervene."
1980.79-5932,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1338.203,1342.405,So it's perfectly all right to live in the home of murderers?
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1346.124,1348.076,"I think, in the absence of harm, I think it has--"
1980.79-5932,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1348.076,1348.709,I'm just trying to get your position.
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1435.831,1439.402,"--Well, I think my response would be twofold."
1980.79-5932,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1478.027,1481.979,"Well, how about capital punishment in the McGautha case?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1481.979,1492.334,"Well, I think this Court has now in effect required the states to in effect take into those... to legislate and make law the types of factors the jury would consider."
1980.79-5932,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1518.485,1541.35,"Well, if the Delaware Legislature should say that a mother and father who were living in an incestuous relationship are unfitted as parents and that that alone is ground for termination of the parental rights, that would certainly eliminate the vagueness problem."
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1541.35,1542.0,That's correct.
1980.79-5932,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1542.0,1553.341,"But as I understand your answers to questions propounded to you by my colleagues, that would not eliminate either of the other two problems in this case."
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1553.341,1554.058,"Well, I think--"
1980.79-5932,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1554.058,1554.693,Is that correct?
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1554.693,1555.61,--That's a difficult issue.
1980.79-5932,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1555.61,1556.443,And is my understanding correct?
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1556.443,1559.662,And it should be decided on that case if the legislature makes that choice.
1980.79-5932,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1562.281,1563.383,But the court has.
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1566.283,1570.787,To say that conviction of a misdemeanor of incest was the triggering criterion.
1980.79-5932,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1570.787,1571.12,Right.
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1572.037,1581.527,"As I responded to Mr. Justice Marshall, my feeling is, in the absence of a final determination that that conduct caused harm to the children--"
1980.79-5932,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1581.527,1585.462,"So, in other words, it would not eliminate your other two challenges to the legislation?"
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1586.046,1586.729,"--No, no."
1980.79-5932,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1586.729,1587.931,Is my understanding correct?
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1589.114,1592.216,As to my personal belief whether that would be--
1980.79-5932,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1592.216,1592.902,"Well, not your personal belief."
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1596.187,1597.054,--No.
1980.79-5932,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1597.054,1598.62,It would not.
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1601.758,1604.408,"Surely it would eliminate the vagueness problem, but not the substantive due process problem."
1980.79-5932,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1604.408,1608.793,Right.
1980.79-5932,0,25732,gary_a_myers,,1608.793,1619.049,I'll just briefly point out that the third issue presented to this Court is the proper standards of proof.
1980.79-5932,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1717.312,1721.782,Mrs. Small.
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,1721.782,1724.068,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-5932,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1876.698,1878.984,How old was the child then?
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,1878.984,1884.019,"--My recollection is that he was an infant, Justice Stevens."
1980.79-5932,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1886.404,1889.756,There are all sorts of reasons why a child may continue to cry.
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,1889.756,1895.327,--But the foster mother was able to calm him very quickly.
1980.79-5932,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1895.327,1902.766,"I suspect something like that happens to every parent, though, doesn't it, Mrs. Small?"
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,1902.766,1913.971,"I have no doubt that it does, and more often than once, but this is the reaction that happened in a specific visitation session."
1980.79-5932,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1942.038,1946.156,"Mrs. Small, why do you suppose they're still litigating this case?"
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,1946.156,1953.679,"--That's a question I ask myself without a good answer, Justice Stevens."
1980.79-5932,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1963.468,1969.022,But is it not true that they did make efforts to and they were denied access to the children?
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,1969.022,1974.093,--They made some efforts through the Division and through counsel to--
1980.79-5932,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1974.093,1975.86,And they were denied.
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,1975.86,1976.811,--And they were denied.
1980.79-5932,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1978.011,1979.996,"Well, what were they supposed to do after that?"
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,1983.698,2001.677,"--They made an attempt in 1977, December of 1977, more than a year and four months after the first termination hearing, to obtain a stay of the termination hearing for the purposes of obtaining visitation rights."
1980.79-5932,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2035.333,2038.702,Had they made informal requests to the agency?
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,2038.702,2039.685,"--Yes, they had, and they continued--"
1980.79-5932,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2039.685,2040.904,Made and denied.
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,2042.304,2043.687,--That's correct.
1980.79-5932,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2043.687,2045.289,Maybe they got a little discouraged.
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,2050.01,2055.228,And they had the opportunity to make the application to the Delaware Supreme Court and did not do so.
1980.79-5932,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2055.228,2064.935,"Well, Mrs Small, has there ever been a request to reconsider this case in light of the current facts?"
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,2064.935,2087.349,"No, Justice Stevens, there has not been and in fact, at the time of oral argument before the Delaware Supreme Court, as the full opinion of the Delaware Supreme Court which appears in the appendix to the jurisdictional statement discloses, the Delaware Supreme Court was aware of the fact that Mr. Doe was living in Georgia."
1980.79-5932,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2087.349,2094.955,Do you think this represents a judgment by the Delaware Supreme Court that these changed circumstances wouldn't make any difference in the?
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,2094.955,2103.894,I think it undoubtedly does because not only was Mr. Doe's parental rights terminated but Ms. Roe's parental rights were terminated also.
1980.79-5932,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2115.083,2126.241,"Yes, but some of the problems that existed at the time of the proceeding in the trial court didn't exist anymore, did they?"
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,2134.78,2136.366,--That's correct.
1980.79-5932,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2141.833,2152.225,--So you really can't say that the Delaware Supreme Court has acted on a request to remand for further proceedings in light of the changed circumstances?
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,2152.225,2172.455,"--Undoubtedly they have not acted because they have not been requested to act, although it was a question of the Chief Justice of the Delaware Supreme Court which elicited the information on the present condition, then present condition, 1978, of the parents of these children."
1980.79-5932,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2180.359,2188.798,"In Delaware, does this same statute govern removing children from the custody of the parents?"
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,2188.798,2193.118,"--No, it does not, Justice White."
1980.79-5932,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2212.847,2218.318,"Well, what if this case were pending now in the Delaware Supreme Court?"
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,2230.641,2241.933,"--If the appeal were pending on... if the appeals were filed the day after the new statute was enacted, as I understand your question--"
1980.79-5932,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2241.933,2242.718,Yes?
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,2242.718,2252.074,--the Delaware Supreme Court would review the case under the statute existing at the time of the termination of parental rights.
1980.79-5932,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2252.074,2258.395,It wouldn't review it in the light of the new statute?
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,2258.395,2259.128,With the--
1980.79-5932,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2259.128,2261.696,"That's a little odd, isn't it?"
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,2261.696,2272.237,"--With the attack made on appeal, I can't see how the court could review it in light of the new statute except to say--"
1980.79-5932,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2272.237,2280.224,"Well, it could remand to see if the trial court... for reconsideration in light of the new statute."
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,2283.093,2298.52,"--You anticipated my exception: except to say that it could take cognizance of the record and make a determination on its own from the record, or more likely, to remand to the trial court."
1980.79-5932,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2304.106,2318.699,"But our rule here normally is in civil cases to adjudge a case in the light of the current law, the current statute."
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,2325.187,2331.709,"I can only give a practical answer to that question, Justice White."
1980.79-5932,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2332.109,2334.145,"Well, I'm really wanting a legal answer."
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,2334.145,2339.447,--Then I shall attempt to give a legal answer.
1980.79-5932,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2339.447,2344.683,"Which will probably be the same thing, so go ahead."
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,2344.683,2368.032,A remand of this case for application of the present Delaware statute by the Delaware courts would be no more and no less than a tacit recognition that the former statute was vague and likely--
1980.79-5932,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2368.032,2369.818,Why is that?
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,2373.02,2375.805,--As part of a more comprehensive statutory--
1980.79-5932,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2375.805,2377.905,"Well, but it's nevertheless replaced the statute."
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,2380.174,2394.933,"--No, it's... the language of the statute is different, although in the generic terms both unfitness and best interests are still required."
1980.79-5932,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2413.161,2425.051,"Well, then, why shouldn't... in a case that's not final, why shouldn't these parents now have their case judged in the light of the current State standards?"
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,2436.507,2447.315,That leads me only to my practical answer that it will be several more years before there can be permanent placement for these children.
1980.79-5932,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2708.984,2713.388,"Ms. Small, does the record tell us whether all the children are in the same family."
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,2715.59,2717.323,The record does not disclose that.
1980.79-5932,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2726.212,2730.081,The record does show that one was in nine families in one year.
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,2730.081,2734.135,"The record does not disclose that, Justice Marshall."
1980.79-5932,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2809.366,2813.754,But didn't you have a record of your own where the child was?
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,2813.754,2814.52,--Yes.
1980.79-5932,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2814.954,2816.289,Didn't the agency have a record?
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,2816.289,2816.756,"--Yes, the agency--"
1980.79-5932,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2816.756,2819.907,"Well, didn't the agency put the record in to contradict that?"
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,2819.907,2832.131,--There was no affirmative showing to contradict that rather questionable recollection on Miss Kinkaid's part.
1980.79-5932,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2832.131,2834.167,"But you could have done it, couldn't you?"
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,2834.167,2838.802,It could have been done.
1980.79-5932,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2862.9,2872.125,Is there anything in the record that shows that the present husband will take the five children?
1980.79-5932,1,40383,regina_m_small,,2872.125,2874.891,"There is nothing in the record, to my knowledge."
1980.79-5932,2,25732,gary_a_myers,,3698.661,3718.408,"Well, at this point, concerning the remand question, I think the remand question and the questions we've been posed concerning the vagueness issues, regardless of the change in the statutory language of the new section, I think the other two constitutional issues which we raised are properly before the Court and would have to be decided regardless of any remand."
