1989.89-504,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.939,"We'll hear argument now in Number 89-504, Louis W. Sullivan, Secretary of Health and Human Services v. Marilyn Finkelstein."
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,14.074,17.962,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-504,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,97.414,100.882,Does that section require a final judgment?
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,100.882,109.102,"Yes, it does, Your Honor, with the exception of decisions granting or denying preliminary injunctive relief."
1989.89-504,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,109.102,116.791,"Well, the... the regular section providing for appeal... certiorari to this Court from the Federal courts of appeals does not require a final--"
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,116.791,117.675,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,284.051,286.92,--May... may I interrupt you before you go into your legal argument?
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,311.535,313.42,"I don't believe so, Your Honor, except that--"
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,313.42,316.622,Well what is there in the district court's opinion would have precluded that?
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,316.622,331.282,"--The district court, I believe, squarely held that the... the respondent's individual residual functional capacity must be considered in order to determine whether she... whether or not she's entitled to benefits."
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,331.282,331.766,Well--
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,331.766,332.999,"That is, the district court--"
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,332.999,338.286,"--Well, it's clear... it's clear, under that reasoning, the district court would have reversed the ALJ if that had been found."
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,351.279,363.837,"--I think that the district court's decision at order was sufficiently clear, that it might be argued, although we don't rest on that branch of... of the finality doctrine."
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,371.341,375.728,"Well, he didn't enter an order saying you must grant review if you make the appropriate findings... grant relief if you--"
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,375.728,376.795,"He... well, he directed the--"
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,376.795,377.847,--He didn't say that.
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,377.847,378.58,--court to hold further proceedings--
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,378.58,379.33,And make findings.
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,379.33,381.715,"--Yes, with respect to the residual--"
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,381.715,381.982,Right.
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,381.982,382.449,--functional capacity.
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,382.449,383.299,Right.
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,383.299,394.772,"I mean, I do think it would perhaps have been theoretically possible, although it might have subjected the agency to... or the administrative law judge to some form of contempt."
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,400.093,400.51,Yes.
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,400.51,403.212,--unless... and then a possibility of review.
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,403.212,403.712,Correct.
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,404.914,405.364,That's true.
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,405.364,408.282,--fuller record the court of appeals would be able to assess the... the--
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,408.282,409.366,But the record... the record--
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,409.366,413.27,--the... the debate over whether the listings are an adequate response to the statutory requirements.
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,413.27,424.476,"--But the record would not have added anything to the underlying question of whether the Secretary can, under his own policy and regulations, stop with the listings of the agency as it--"
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,424.476,435.016,"Well, it would have answered this question, that the Secretary in some of these cases argues that there is no possibility of total functional... I don't have the right phrases in my... no possibility if you don't meet the listing requirement."
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,443.205,455.347,"--At the agency, I think in this case, as agencies I think do in all cases, they regard themselves, and I think quite properly, as governed by the terms of the remand."
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,484.699,487.318,"Yeah, but there would be an appeal at that point because the district--"
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,487.318,490.02,"--Well, but he would... at that point, I take it, the--"
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,490.02,496.84,"--The district court would then say, the findings having been made, you now must enter judgment allowing the claim."
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,496.84,497.724,"--Oh, if the findings--"
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,497.724,499.959,And then... then there would be an appeal directly to the court of appeals.
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,499.959,500.459,--Yes.
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,500.459,503.828,"So, the first case in which the findings were favorable to the claimant, would... would do it."
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,510.598,511.149,"Yes, indeed, there are--"
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,511.149,511.916,--to determine whether they will rise.
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,511.916,514.985,"--There are two problems, Your Honor, I believe, with that approach."
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,522.491,523.174,"Well, I understand that argument."
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,524.341,531.847,"--But the... but the second point, it seems to me is that that whole process would add nothing to the consideration of--"
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,531.847,537.251,"--Well, it will... it will answer the question whether there is the possibility of such a hypothetical ever really existing."
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,544.988,546.523,"--Yes, it is."
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,546.523,552.01,"But your... but your position on the law is that, well, we don't have... we don't have to put that to a factual test."
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,552.01,565.001,"Well, I... our position is that it really is an inappropriate relationship between an administrative agency and a court for the administrative agency in effect to be required to disregard the remand in order to--"
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,565.001,569.286,"No, merely to be required to do exactly what the remand ordered, namely make some findings of fact."
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,571.405,577.042,--But it was clearly remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion of the court.
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,582.113,586.148,It doesn't say for the proceedings consistent... it says for remands for further proceedings.
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,590.468,595.953,I think the agency has properly understood that it was proceedings consistent with the opinion of the court.
1989.89-504,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,595.953,614.251,"Well, Mr. Shapiro, I take it that if... that if... if the... your position is that if the case goes back, it's very likely that the... and the agency lives up to the remand order, that there will be a... the... the benefits will be granted."
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,614.251,615.867,"That's a distinct possibility, Your Honor."
1989.89-504,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,616.317,623.023,"Well, let's assume that the Secretary, following the remand order, grants... there's benefits granted."
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,624.423,625.24,That's our position.
1989.89-504,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,625.809,630.177,And you can never get... you can never have it reviewed then?
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,630.177,631.044,"That's right, Your Honor."
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,678.757,679.209,Mr. Shapiro--
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,679.209,693.886,"And the thing I think... excuse me... just... Justice Stevens, your question assumes that the... an agency would have to regard any findings with respect to her residual functional capacity as irrelevant to the outcome."
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,694.303,695.586,--Which is your legal position?
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,695.586,696.403,--It is our legal position.
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,696.403,697.388,They say that you only look at the listing.
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,697.388,698.338,But it is not a legal--
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,698.338,703.725,That's what... all the... all the Secretary would have to do is adhere to the legal position that he maintains on the merits.
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,703.725,706.261,--We believe he is not free to do that on remand--
1989.89-504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,706.261,706.711,"Well, that's--"
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,706.711,707.711,--until and unless--
1989.89-504,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,707.711,708.546,"--That's what, you know--"
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,708.546,709.163,--the district court's decision--
1989.89-504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,709.163,711.664,--That depends on how one reads the district court's language.
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,724.638,725.138,"--No, Your Honor."
1989.89-504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,752.991,756.609,"Mr. Shapiro, you've said you've been consistent here."
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,771.636,784.594,"--Your Honor, on one branch of our argument... that is, on one theory on which we support appealability... the claimant would not have been able to appeal."
1989.89-504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,784.594,785.213,"Well, pick the branch."
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,789.765,802.924,"With respect to the narrower argument we're making based on Cohen against Beneficial Loan, the claimant could not appeal because there is no doubt that down the line an adverse decision against the claimant would be--"
1989.89-504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,802.924,808.828,"Well, but you say... you say this is a final judgment for... for purposes of appealability anyway."
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,812.296,823.302,--If the Court agrees with our argument that this is a final judgment in the fullest sense of the word that a claimant... a claimant can appeal from an adverse decision of law underlying that judgment.
1989.89-504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,823.302,827.29,And has the government acted contrary to that position?
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,827.29,832.092,"The government, as we... as we concede in brief, has not always taken that position, Your Honor."
1989.89-504,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,832.092,848.369,"And... and I take it that... that answer applies to the circumstances in this case, so that if we accepted your argument on finality, she did lose in this case because--"
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,848.369,848.719,Yes.
1989.89-504,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,848.719,850.155,--she was confined to the listed impairments.
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,850.155,850.505,Yes.
1989.89-504,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,850.505,852.721,So she could have appealed in this case.
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,852.721,862.296,She could have appealed the determination that she was unable to show that she had a listed impairment.
1989.89-504,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,882.507,909.877,"Mr. Shapiro, is it possible that the statutes could be construed here to provide that the district court retains jurisdiction at the conclusion of the remand so that the government would be able to file a motion for reconsideration on the point that it's interested in at the conclusion of the remand with the district court?"
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,909.877,924.203,"Your Honor, we believe that that is a tenable construction of the statute, but one which we believe is quite strained and involves a very forced and, we think, unnatural reading of the statute."
1989.89-504,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,924.203,930.357,"Well, it might be somewhat consistent with Sullivan against Hudson, though."
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,930.357,949.252,"With respect to Sullivan against Hudson, Your Honor, which is relied thereon very heavily by the respondent, we believe that case has to be understood as a case which is quite clearly directed to the problem of finality under the Equal Access to Justice Act."
1989.89-504,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1005.671,1014.777,"Well, in... in your view was the Hudson remand under the sixth sentence of 405(g)?"
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1014.777,1026.734,There has been a very substantial argument between the parties about whether either this case or the Hudson case involved a sixth sentence remand.
1989.89-504,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1034.59,1040.028,"Well, what about the... what is your position as to the proper characterization of the remand in the Hudson case?"
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1040.028,1046.147,--Our view was that the remand in the Hudson was not a sixth sentence remand either.
1989.89-504,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1046.998,1050.034,"Well, then it was under the eighth... eighth sentence?"
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1050.034,1050.667,--The remand?
1989.89-504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1128.336,1137.125,"Mr. Shapiro, you've been talking about the... the... you know, the special application of... of 405(g)."
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1143.229,1143.962,"Yes, I do."
1989.89-504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1143.962,1148.966,Is there any need for a court to remand?
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1187.258,1187.791,Yes.
1989.89-504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1187.791,1188.675,--and then the matter would--
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1188.675,1189.108,Yes.
1989.89-504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1189.108,1202.35,"--I always thought it was really sort of... I never knew... when I was on the court of appeals and... and we had statutory review coming to the court of appeals, I never really knew whether we should say, you know, reversed and remanded or not."
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1205.469,1208.421,I think the same proceedings would follow.
1989.89-504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1242.16,1244.011,Which... which are still referred to in the APA--
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1244.011,1244.494,--Yes.
1989.89-504,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1244.494,1245.011,--explicitly.
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1245.011,1245.879,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-504,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1306.502,1318.492,"Is this... is this argument, Mr. Shapiro, also the one that is... is analogous to our handling of appeals from state courts in the treatment of finality there, or is this an alternate to that argument?"
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1318.492,1322.527,"--I believe that it, in truth, it's quite analogous."
1989.89-504,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1533.483,1548.143,"If your view prevails, Mr. Shapiro, and in some other case the government does not appeal, and there is a remand and the claimant then comes back, are you barred?"
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1548.143,1552.345,"Again, Your Honor, I believe that depends on which branch of our argument is accepted."
1989.89-504,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1593.672,1604.293,"If we... if we accept your interpretation that it's controlled simply by the language of 405(g), the eighth sentence, is that the first alternative of which you spoke?"
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1604.293,1620.322,"Number the 405... our argument based on 405(g), like the argument based on general principles of finality on the Administrative Procedure Act, is that the proceeding for judicial review has terminated in the fullest sense, that the judgment is truly final."
1989.89-504,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1620.322,1622.822,So... so you would be barred if we accepted that rationale?
1989.89-504,0,21559,david_l_shapiro,,1622.822,1624.107,"That's right, Your Honor."
1989.89-504,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1626.726,1628.293,"Very well, Mr. Shapiro."
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,1633.213,1636.182,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-504,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1732.662,1735.547,Is that the Cohen v. Beneficial Loan theory?
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,1735.547,1737.647,"--Well, not so much, Your Honor."
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1817.416,1817.899,"Well, but that--"
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,1817.899,1818.518,--is cited in our brief.
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1818.518,1831.676,"--that's entirely consistent with his position that the remand order is superfluous, that's it's really unnecessary, that the only judgment that the court made is the legal judgment here, that that's the only thing that was at issue."
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,1841.348,1857.976,"Your Honor, that's what... what happens under this statute and... and... and, first of all, a reading of this district court's opinion here clearly indicates, as Justice Stevens pointed out, that the district court sent it back for the taking of additional evidence."
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1861.628,1862.463,"Well, suppose it hadn't?"
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,1873.253,1875.105,"Under... under the new... yes, to go back."
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1875.105,1877.307,Even without the remand?
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,1877.307,1879.507,"I don't see how... oh, if... if they--"
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1879.507,1884.643,"Suppose the court had just simply said... you know, reversed."
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,1892.732,1895.434,"--No, Your Honor, the court here simply remanded the case."
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1901.255,1902.405,I understand that.
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,1909.611,1914.763,I'm not sure that would have been a final judgment either unless the court had actually entered final judgment.
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1915.28,1915.682,But that's not my question.
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,1921.336,1921.852,"--Certainly, Your Honor."
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1921.852,1922.369,--Of course.
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,1922.369,1922.819,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1922.819,1925.553,"So, the remand is really superfluous."
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,1925.553,1926.203,But what the--
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1926.203,1927.672,It's... it's what happens anyway.
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,1927.672,1932.524,--But what the Secretary is claiming here is that there are somehow two separable proceedings.
1989.89-504,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1967.63,1981.04,"Mr. Handal, under your view how would the government be assured of getting eventual appellate review of the issue that it's interested in... in having reviewed?"
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,1981.04,1982.24,"Your Honor, there are many ways."
1989.89-504,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1989.73,2002.121,"Well, if the claimant prevails on remand under the... the new theory of the district court, how can the government obtain review?"
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2002.121,2016.963,"Your Honor, under the statute, the Secretary is actually required to go back to the district court and... and file the transcript of the proceedings on remand... after the remand proceedings before the Secretary."
1989.89-504,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2045.482,2056.105,"Not... not at the time that the district court first issues its order, but after the remand proceedings are completed and the... as you say, the case is then back in the district court?"
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2056.105,2056.922,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-504,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2056.922,2059.407,Is there a judgment entered then?
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2059.407,2060.409,Presumably the--
1989.89-504,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2060.409,2060.859,No.
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2063.194,2065.543,"--After the remand proceedings, yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-504,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2065.543,2066.563,In the district court?
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2066.563,2067.612,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-504,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2067.612,2072.467,Is it... an actual judgment is filed just as--
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2073.317,2077.268,"Yes, Your Honor, and there's been no judgment entered so far in this case."
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2097.882,2102.753,When you say there's been no order entered in this case that depends upon what you consider to be the case.
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2108.89,2111.009,"Your Honor, I believe I said there--"
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2111.009,2118.013,"But if you choose to look upon it as this claimant's long battle to get money, then I suppose you're right."
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2121.381,2123.917,"--Your Honor, I believe I said that there was an order entered here."
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2125.869,2126.319,A final order.
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2126.319,2127.069,--or a judgment.
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2127.069,2127.585,Okay.
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2127.585,2129.47,"Clearly there was an order entered here, and--"
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2129.47,2129.92,Okay.
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2129.92,2130.922,--and that's what often happens.
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2130.922,2131.355,Okay.
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2133.738,2140.278,And... and Your Honor raises an interesting point about the... the claimant's entitlement to benefits.
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2162.442,2170.83,I... I find what you say just contrary to what... what our traditional manner of handling these cases has been.
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2215.259,2215.859,Your Honor--
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2215.859,2225.634,I find it amazing to think that... that all of these rule makings as well as adjudications have to go back to the agency and a revised rule or revised adjudication made before there can be an appeal.
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2230.936,2243.845,"--Your Honor, first of all, I'd note that in Califano v. Sanders, this Court held that there is very limited review under... under... under the APA for Social Security cases."
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2319.143,2325.647,Why... I... you're arguing your case just on the bases of this statute and you say this statute is peculiar.
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2334.503,2335.005,I... I--
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2335.005,2336.671,What... what indication is there that this is special?
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2336.671,2356.284,"--Your Honor, the Court said that for one thing in the Hudson case that is was, quote, an unusual statute... in that it took the district courts out of their ordinary role as, quote, administrative overseers and made them ground level participants in the administrative process."
1989.89-504,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2387.823,2390.692,What's... what's the authority for the... for that statement?
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2396.309,2405.451,"Your Honor, we... we set forth in our brief a discussion of the state of the law actually in 1939 when this statute was passed."
1989.89-504,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2432.852,2449.378,"Well, but I'm... I'm asking you, and I thought I had already asked you, are there cases from this Court saying that the word modify in that fourth sentence upon which you rely would give the district court the authority to simply fix Mrs. Finkelstein's benefits?"
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2449.378,2450.396,"--Not specifically, Your Honor."
1989.89-504,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2453.348,2466.49,"Under your view of the statute under the sixth sentence, in every case of this kind the Secretary would come back and file a transcript with the district court?"
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2466.49,2469.375,"Yes, Your Honor, that's the way the sixth sentence mechanism works."
1989.89-504,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2469.375,2472.577,"Well, but you said that this case is controlled by the sixth sentence."
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2476.295,2477.095,"Yes, Your Honor, it is."
1989.89-504,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2477.095,2490.103,"And that in this case, and in every case like it, even of the... the claimant is the one that prevails, the Secretary goes back into the district court and files a transcript?"
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2490.103,2492.889,"That's what is contemplated by the sixth sentence, and--"
1989.89-504,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2492.889,2495.157,"But that's not what happens, is it?"
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2495.157,2500.227,"--Your Honor, we understand it does happen in... in a lot of cases."
1989.89-504,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2500.227,2506.914,"Well, why would the Secretary go in and file a transcript in the hundreds of cases where there's a redetermination of benefits and he orders the benefits?"
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2506.914,2508.333,"Your Honor, in--"
1989.89-504,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2508.333,2513.218,Unless it's something the district court wants to review further.
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2513.218,2517.622,"--Your Honor, the parties are able to ask for further review at that point."
1989.89-504,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2536.15,2540.119,"Well, this... under this sentence it says ""shall"", so I assume it's every case."
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2540.119,2544.273,"--It... it certainly does seem to require that, Your Honor."
1989.89-504,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2548.708,2554.529,"Well, that was because in the Hudson case there were further... the court retained jurisdiction."
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2554.529,2556.331,"Your Honor, we have that same situation here."
1989.89-504,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2589.785,2606.33,"Well, Mr. Handal, does the sixth sentence apply only when the Secretary makes a motion before filing an answer in the district court proceeding?"
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2606.33,2608.532,"No, Your Honor."
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2652.043,2652.376,Excuse me.
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2683.997,2684.614,That's correct.
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2684.614,2692.186,"If the Secretary says, you know, I'm worried, I'm going to lose this case, before he files his answer, he can ask the court to send it back so he can take more evidence."
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2692.186,2692.653,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2693.703,2694.555,That's what the first part says.
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2701.958,2704.677,"--That's not the way that's been interpreted, Your Honor."
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2715.401,2729.978,"I think in its context, following after that first clause, it seems to me you... you don't think it... it only refers to ordering additional evidence to be taken before it makes its decision?"
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2729.978,2731.245,"No, Your Honor."
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2731.245,2734.847,And there are provisions like that in rule making review statutes as well.
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2736.982,2737.815,"Perhaps, Your Honor."
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2783.629,2799.889,"But why... if... if it applies even to post-judgment remand, why... why is there that condition that says only upon a showing that there is new evidence which is material and that there is good cause for the failure to proceed?"
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2799.889,2813.049,"Your Honor, as far as applying to post-judgment remands, I think Your Honor means remands after the claimant has answered."
1989.89-504,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2813.049,2817.417,"No, I mean after the court has found that the agency is wrong and it then remands."
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2830.693,2832.276,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-504,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2899.455,2919.484,"Yes, but, Mr. Handal, supposing, as your opponent argues, that the... they make the additional findings in the ALJ decides there's total functional impairment or whatever the phrase... the lack of ability to engage in gainful employment and so forth... and gives the claimant the money she's finding, can the government then get review?"
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2919.484,2937.796,"Yes, Your Honor, that's... that's the mechanism that I described earlier whereby the Secretary, under the statute, is... is required... if not required, the Secretary agrees that it's is appropriate... that he then go back to the district court, file the transcript of the proceedings."
1989.89-504,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2940.065,2945.885,On what authority does he have to go back to the district court if he has ruled in favor of the claimant?
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2945.885,2950.27,"--The statute requires him to go back to the district court, Your Honor."
1989.89-504,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2962.411,2969.101,"You're talking about sentence six in 405(g), are you?"
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2969.101,2971.301,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-504,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2971.301,2974.571,But supposing... supposing it was a remand under four.
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,2976.655,2985.843,"Your Honor, this whole idea of whether there is a remand under sentence six or sentence four is... is a phony issue."
1989.89-504,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3000.236,3003.222,"Well, let me just change the facts very slightly and see what your answer is."
1989.89-504,1,33853,kenneth_v_handal,,3030.155,3035.693,"Your Honor, the... the... it talks about the taking of additional evidence."
1989.89-504,2,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3455.613,3457.481,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.89-504,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3502.41,3513.068,"In every case where there's been a remand, must the Secretary file something in the... in the district court?"
1989.89-504,2,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3513.068,3518.706,"--Under 405(g), Your Honor, we believe that only in those cases covered by sixth sentence, however,--"
1989.89-504,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3518.706,3519.089,All right.
1989.89-504,2,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3520.772,3521.658,--Not under 405(g).
1989.89-504,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3527.477,3528.061,"Well, I understand that."
1989.89-504,2,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3528.061,3528.661,"--Yes, that's right."
1989.89-504,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3529.027,3529.861,I understand that.
1989.89-504,2,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3540.119,3540.485,No.
1989.89-504,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3540.485,3544.487,--before the case is over must the Secretary file something and get a judgment of the court?
1989.89-504,2,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3544.487,3545.623,"No, Your Honor."
1989.89-504,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3547.891,3551.343,"Well, your opponent says that in every case that is the case."
1989.89-504,2,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3551.343,3552.51,"--Well, I think he's wrong."
1989.89-504,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3555.229,3556.045,Plain and simple.
1989.89-504,2,21559,david_l_shapiro,,3557.581,3573.856,"Not only that, but I think the position he's taking is not in the interest of claimants because he is suggesting a much broader ability of the Secretary to obtain review of a decision in favor of the claimant than the Secretary believes he has under the Act."
1989.89-504,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3605.061,3606.078,"Thank you, Mr. Shapiro."
