1982.81-1802,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,4.385,"Mr. Frey, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1982.81-1802,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4.385,13.658,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is here on the government's petition for a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit."
1982.81-1802,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,293.074,298.895,Is this device operated on a particular wavelength or something?
1982.81-1802,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,302.513,305.381,"--Yes, it is a radio signal, and it could be picked up by others."
1982.81-1802,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1660.263,1677.975,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, before going to the issues and facts involved in this case, I would like to identify two things which in my view represent the... or reflect the extreme position which the government is taking in this case."
1982.81-1802,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1760.795,1783.308,"What would you say, Mr. Peterson, if in a kidnapping case, for example, all of the bills were impregnated with some chemical which would get onto the fingers and hands of anyone who touched it and could not be removed for quite a long time, but was something that could not be observed?"
1982.81-1802,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1795.016,1801.27,"I would not call that an invasion of privacy, at least not an illegal--"
1982.81-1802,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1801.27,1805.74,Would it have a negative... Would it have the consequences you are arguing for here?
1982.81-1802,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1805.74,1820.083,"--No, it would not have the consequences I am arguing here, because that would be a permissible police or bank practice which would be allowed under the exigencies of the situation."
1982.81-1802,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1834.593,1834.827,All right.
1982.81-1802,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1865.279,1876.854,"Well, no warrant would be possible in that case, Your Honor, because once again we would have an exigent circumstance where it would not be possible to obtain a warrant."
1982.81-1802,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1879.456,1902.654,"Well, but the warrant... let's assume that just as here, after this signal came to rest in one place, in the same manner as it was monitored here, then the police or the agents move in with a warrant which they have got on the basis of the electronic signal."
1982.81-1802,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1902.654,1914.129,"--We would have a more difficult case in that instance, Mr. Chief Justice, because of the fact, number one, the bag of bank money would be contraband in itself."
1982.81-1802,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1916.229,1917.414,Why is it contraband?
1982.81-1802,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1922.216,1936.875,"--It is stolen property, though, and in that situation he would have no right to possess it, whereas in our situation here, the defendant had the right to possess the can of chloroform."
1982.81-1802,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1936.875,1938.077,Mr. Peterson--
1982.81-1802,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1938.077,1941.712,--For the purposes that he purchased it and ultimately was using it?
1982.81-1802,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1941.712,1946.064,"He certainly, and again, we don't have it in the record."
1982.81-1802,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1954.937,1957.872,"Well, are you challenging that that is part of this whole package?"
1982.81-1802,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1957.872,1959.924,"--Oh, certainly not."
1982.81-1802,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1959.924,1962.276,"Well, then, why is it different from the money?"
1982.81-1802,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1962.276,1967.429,Because it is... stolen money is contraband per se.
1982.81-1802,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1977.885,1988.343,"Well, when it is found in the laboratory where they are making prohibited drugs, is it not as much contraband as the money, assuming the money is contraband, which I am not sure of?"
1982.81-1802,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,1988.343,1999.199,"Well, the money, Mr. Chief Justice, is something which the defendant in that case would clearly have no right to possess."
1982.81-1802,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2013.808,2021.331,"Well, what you have persuaded me of by that response is that the money and the chloroform are identically the same under the Fourth Amendment."
1982.81-1802,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2021.331,2029.254,"--I would submit that they are not, Your Honor, because one is contraband per se and one is not."
1982.81-1802,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2029.254,2038.443,"I thought you said that when it is in the laboratory for use in making illegal drugs, that it is contraband, part of an illegal operation."
1982.81-1802,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2038.443,2041.312,"If I said that, Mr. Chief Justice, I meant to say--"
1982.81-1802,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2041.312,2041.828,You said--
1982.81-1802,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2041.828,2052.869,"--that it is subject to forfeiture, which means that it could have been taken away from him if it were determined that it was going to be used for an illegal purpose."
1982.81-1802,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2052.869,2058.856,--But you have just previously said you do not challenge that it was to be used for that illegal purpose.
1982.81-1802,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2058.856,2068.379,"I do not challenge that, and for purposes of this case, I don't think that it makes any difference."
1982.81-1802,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2068.379,2086.091,"Mr. Peterson, I suppose the state of origin could require a purchaser of precursor chemicals to give their name and the destination of the chemicals as part of the regulatory scheme, could it not?"
1982.81-1802,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2086.091,2088.292,"I would imagine that they could, Justice O'Connor."
1982.81-1802,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2088.292,2097.731,So how is use of the beeper to determine where the chemicals went different from the state requiring that disclosure in the first instance?
1982.81-1802,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2097.731,2114.674,"Well, the mere fact, Justice O'Connor, that someone would write down their name and their address and where a particular chemical is going obviously does not mean that it would necessarily end up there, but--"
1982.81-1802,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2114.674,2133.987,"Well, they might lie about it, I suppose, but we are talking about the basic interests at stake here, and what greater interest in the ultimate destination of the chemicals does the owner of the property have than he would have if the state asked in the first instance when they were purchased where it was going."
1982.81-1802,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2133.987,2151.449,"--He does not have any greater interest than he would have in that situation, and the government would still have to get a search warrant before they went into his house to seize those--"
1982.81-1802,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2151.449,2154.984,"Sure, and the government did that, based on this information."
1982.81-1802,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2171.011,2198.93,"--In the hypothetical sense, that is true, Justice O'Connor, but in this situation, I don't think it can be shown to be true by the record, because as the record will show here, the reason that surveillance was terminated in the first place was because the co-defendant was engaged in what the agents determined to be evasive driving, and therefore they cut it off."
1982.81-1802,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2212.488,2215.004,"Mr. Peterson, help me a little."
1982.81-1802,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2219.642,2226.629,"Justice Marshall, I am not sure I understand at what point--"
1982.81-1802,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2226.629,2234.317,I understand that you have no Fourth Amendment problem with the putting of the beeper in the container.
1982.81-1802,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2234.317,2236.001,--No.
1982.81-1802,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2236.769,2242.507,And your Fourth Amendment problem does not come up until the private home is involved.
1982.81-1802,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2243.807,2269.508,"--The reason that no objection to installation of the beeper in the drum of chemicals was made is that it was purchased by a second co-defendant, then transferred to the first co-defendant, and therefore we would have no ""standing"" to object to something that happened to someone else's property."
1982.81-1802,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2272.71,2277.161,"Well, I am not sure that is an adequate answer, because he was held not to have any standing, either."
1982.81-1802,1,36467,mark_w_peterson,,2281.815,2288.286,"The one who actually bought the stuff, Justice Stevens, was convicted by a plea of guilty."
1982.81-1802,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3483.657,3489.261,"Just briefly, I want to make an important point, if I can come to something more mundane than my colleague closed on."
1982.81-1802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3563.823,3565.839,And neither does installing a wire tap.
1982.81-1802,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3565.839,3566.858,Excuse me?
1982.81-1802,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3566.858,3568.624,And neither does installing a wire tap.
1982.81-1802,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3568.624,3575.028,"Well, I don't know whether if you never turned it on it would be a fourth amendment violation."
1982.81-1802,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3585.134,3586.917,The case is submitted.
