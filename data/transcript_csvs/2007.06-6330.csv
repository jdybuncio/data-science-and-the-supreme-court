2007.06-6330,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.92,"We'll hear argument next in case 06-6330, Kimbrough versus United States."
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,8.67,24.18,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Derrick Kimbrough's case is about what a district court may consider when imposing sentence in conformity with Section 3553(a)."
2007.06-6330,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,128.83,135.167,Could the Congress have mandated the result and the rationale that the Fourth Circuit used here?
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,135.167,149.475,"Your Honor, Congress can certainly speak explicitly through its statutes to impose further refinements on the penalty structure that it set out in 841."
2007.06-6330,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,179.177,198.007,"If Congress made a finding that crack and cocaine are equally dangerous and passed a statute that said, for sentencing purposes, every district judge shall treat cases involving these two substances exactly the same, would there be a Sixth Amendment problem with that?"
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,204.677,211.898,"Justice Alito, Congress certainly can cabin the discretion of judges."
2007.06-6330,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,240.517,267.235,"What's your answer simply to the very simple argument that because the floor was set on the assumption of a 100 to 1 ratio, set by Congress, that any other sentencing assumption, regardless of the particular justifications in a given case, is simply incoherent with the statutory scheme and for that reason should be regarded as unreasonable?"
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,267.235,268.185,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-6330,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,268.185,271.805,It is the coherence problem that is bothering us.
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,271.805,272.871,Yes.
2007.06-6330,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,320.702,332.408,"But is that an argument for saying, well, in the LSD case, you approved of incoherence and irrationality, therefore, you want to do it across the board?"
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,345.234,368.016,"Well, Your Honor, I think what Neal reflects is that there's no implicit binding policy directive in 841 itself that requires either the Commission or sentencing courts to follow in lock step on a graduated proportionate scheme, whatever it is that Congress decided with respect to two specific triggers should be the case."
2007.06-6330,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,368.016,371.301,Did we have the cliff problem in the LSD case?
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,371.301,373.501,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-6330,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,379.722,383.359,"So we are in the same boat, then, you say with Neal in that respect, too?"
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,383.359,398.285,"Yes, and Your Honor, if I could also point out that there really is a myth here with regard to the 100 to 1 ratio as it stands now and as the Commission created it in 1987."
2007.06-6330,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,482.355,484.089,Maybe that was wrong.
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,500.215,502.65,"I agree, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-6330,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,556.369,558.57,That just goes back to Justice Scalia's point.
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,563.474,570.728,"--Well... Your Honor, Congress has a method--"
2007.06-6330,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,570.728,573.763,"It did not reject them, you are saying?"
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,577.615,585.352,"--Well, Congress did not reject the original table that was created by the Commission in 1987."
2007.06-6330,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,612.233,648.156,"Mr. Nachmanoff, in the absence of anything further from Congress, and accepting your argument that there's no... that the Guidelines did not have to adopt the ratio that is applicable to the mandatory minimum, could a district judge then say, I see that this disparity is untenable, but I think drugs are a very bad thing, so I'm going to sentence for powder as high as for crack?"
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,648.156,665.749,"Justice Ginsburg, our rule certainly contemplates the fact that there may be circumstances in which district judges may come to conclusions about the appropriate sentence, taking into consideration the purposes of sentencing and the parsimony provision--"
2007.06-6330,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,665.749,682.378,"But if we throw out the 100 to 1, what is the range open to the district judge... hundred to one is okay, but I have to use the... I'm going to use the crack for both?"
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,703.041,707.326,--Well those certainly are positions that judges could take.
2007.06-6330,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,735.928,758.926,"What if the Fourth Circuit sees a number of absolutely identical cases exactly like Mr. Kimbrough's, and it is apparent in one, the sentencing judge either explicitly or implicitly has used a 1 to 1, and the next one used 20 to 1, the next one has used 50 to 1, the next one has used 80 to 1, and the next one has used 100 to 1, what is it to do under reasonableness review?"
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,758.926,777.089,"The court of appeals has been given explicit instruction by this Court that it is to review all of those sentences under an abuse of discretion, which means that its job is not to substitute its judgment for the lower court."
2007.06-6330,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,784.826,787.795,But the cases are absolutely identical.
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,817.064,833.674,"--Justice Alito, sentencing courts now are free to consider the full range of punishment and to consider the purposes of sentencing in both issue-specific to the defendant and the offense and also general policy issues."
2007.06-6330,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,883.523,891.363,"Well, I take it your answer is that all or most of those cases would be affirmed under reasonableness... under abuse of discretion review?"
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,891.363,892.529,If... yes.
2007.06-6330,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,892.529,899.032,"If you were representing the one who got the 80 to 1 ratio you would file an amicus brief, no error in judgment?"
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,899.032,921.048,"Well, Justice Souter, if the court followed the procedural requirements of 3553(a), if the information was subjected to the adversarial process, and if the court imposed a sentence consistent with the parsimony clause, it would be hard to imagine a basis upon which to object."
2007.06-6330,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,921.048,923.631,The basis is that that would be the end of the Guidelines.
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,1005.533,1020.626,"Justice Breyer, the Booker remedial opinion makes it crystal-clear that to avoid the Sixth Amendment problem with the mandatory Guidelines, judges must be free to disagree with the Guidelines."
2007.06-6330,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1020.626,1036.885,"To the extent that it's reasonable, and where we're talking about individual cases we've already said, given the history of our legal system, it's very reasonable to give lots of discretion to the district judge."
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,1050.562,1059.584,"Your Honor, 3553(a) is driven by the purposes of sentencing."
2007.06-6330,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1059.584,1073.408,"Driven by a Congress that wrote guidelines; and at the last minute, in a separate matter that we've taken out and wasn't put in the initial draft added the word ""mandatory""."
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,1089.048,1102.808,"Well, Your Honor, the appellate courts still have a role to play and that role is to ensure that the sentencing courts have followed the mandate of 3553(a), and that--"
2007.06-6330,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1102.808,1110.045,"Indeed, it may be quite impossible to achieve uniformity through advisory guidelines, which is why Congress made them mandatory."
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,1112.33,1114.365,"--That very well may be, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-6330,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1130.559,1134.861,"In other words, I'm assuming now you have not... you don't have a good answer to my question."
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,1144.3,1148.085,"--Well, Justice Breyer, your question certainly is a difficult one."
2007.06-6330,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1168.546,1171.165,And you don't say... you don't say anything goes.
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,1195.712,1197.779,"That is correct, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-6330,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1198.581,1211.139,"And is ""reasonable"" defined as an appropriate interpretation of congressional intent, or does ""reasonable"" mean something else, like a just sentence?"
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,1214.591,1216.46,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that that--"
2007.06-6330,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1216.46,1230.351,"Whether or not the commission and then the district judge reasonably interpret the congressional intent, and if the commission reasonably interprets the congressional intent is the district court allowed to disregard that?"
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,1230.351,1238.473,--Sentencing courts must be able to disagree with the commission's conclusions about congressional intent.
2007.06-6330,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1238.473,1242.175,"Assuming the commission was reasonable, can they still disagree?"
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,1242.175,1243.941,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-6330,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1297.759,1314.668,"So in your case you ask us to establish the proposition that in any case, a sentencing judge must always be free to disregard a reasonable interpretation of the Commission, a reasonable interpretation of a congressional statute?"
2007.06-6330,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1314.668,1318.155,May I interrupt before you answer.
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,1328.261,1332.849,"That's... that's correct, Justice Stevens."
2007.06-6330,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1332.849,1342.271,You would go further... you would go further and... and submit to us the proposition that I... that I just stated?
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,1342.271,1350.841,"Well, Your Honor, if... if I understood it correctly, the question is whether or not when the commission concludes this is what Congress intended--"
2007.06-6330,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1350.841,1351.543,Reasonably.
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,1351.543,1359.197,--reasonably... does it somehow imbue that particular guideline with some special binding nature.
2007.06-6330,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1403.66,1415.717,But... and I take it your submission is that the district court must be able to make the determination that the commission's policy is to be disregarded in every case to come before the court?
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,1415.717,1420.352,"--Well, Your Honor, 3553(a) requires individualized sentencing."
2007.06-6330,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1461.393,1483.243,"And Mr. Nachmanoff, I think that you are agreeing, although you don't want to come right out and say it, with Justice Scalia's point; that is, anything from a hundred to one down to one to one is open to the district judge; and within that range, there is no abuse of discretion."
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,1483.243,1490.912,"Your Honor, I certainly agree that that full range is available to the sentencing court."
2007.06-6330,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1490.912,1493.364,Only because Congress has said 100 to 1.
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,1511.06,1512.643,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-6330,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1512.643,1526.736,"In any case, your answer is anything from what Congress has said, down to one to one, would be a reasonable sentence that would be... that would pass muster on appeal because it is not an abuse of discretion."
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,1526.736,1535.842,"Well, if I can be clear, Justice Ginsburg, sentencing courts must have available to them the full range of punishment as defined by Congress."
2007.06-6330,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1565.694,1583.073,"But you've given me a bunch of hand holds that, quite frankly, are quite easy for a district judge to say: Here's my laundry list; and I'm going to go through every one of them; but in the end I think the ratio should be 20 to 1; and that's what I'm going to impose."
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,1583.073,1587.441,"Well, again, Your Honor, Congress certainly has the power to cabin that discretion."
2007.06-6330,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1590.809,1597.713,"So... Congress not having done that, then the range is open to the district judges, 100 to 1 to 1 to 1."
2007.06-6330,0,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,1597.713,1598.582,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2007.06-6330,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1600.867,1602.2,"Thank you, Mr. Nachmanoff."
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1603.534,1620.496,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court: The question in this case is essentially, can a district court reasonably disagree with the judgment of Congress concerning the ratio between the quantity-based sentences for crack and powder."
2007.06-6330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1620.496,1626.483,"Mr. Dreeben, can I ask a question right at the outset that is critical for me."
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1676.332,1682.134,"Justice Stevens, let me start with the Neal decision, because I think Neal is fundamentally unlike this case."
2007.06-6330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1692.99,1700.762,"But that is a construction of what Congress intended, and for purposes of decision we assumed that Congress intended what we held the statute meant."
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1700.762,1714.855,"--Justice Stevens, the only question presented in Neal was, did the Commission's weight guideline for LSD require this Court to change its interpretation of Section 841."
2007.06-6330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1743.939,1754.23,It does hold that a guideline that does not conform with a congressional judgment merely expressed in a mandatory minimum is a guideline that would survive.
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1754.23,1758.432,"--Well, I disagree with that, Justice Stevens, because no one challenged the guideline in Neal."
2007.06-6330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1791.487,1802.342,"Yes, but there's also more data that the Commission has reflected on all this and still concludes that the 100 to 1 ratio creates an unwarranted disparity which is contrary to the statute."
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1802.342,1808.746,"--Well, the statute, itself, Section 841, establishes the ratio of a 100 to 1."
2007.06-6330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1813.15,1818.304,"It establishes the ratio for mandatory minimum purposes only, is what Neal held."
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1818.304,1825.724,"--Well I disagree with that, Justice Stevens, and I'm trying to explain why the legal context is different from the legal context in Neal."
2007.06-6330,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1905.91,1910.147,And if... you're talking about Public Law 104-38?
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1910.147,1910.88,That's correct.
2007.06-6330,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1910.88,1913.099,"Well, they also said, quote,"
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1919.52,1920.502,Correct.
2007.06-6330,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1920.502,1923.371,"Well, that's fine, but that's pretty far from 100 to 1."
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1939.797,1948.153,"This, Mr. Chief Justice, is what Congress instructed the Commission to consider in making recommendations to change the existing state of the law."
2007.06-6330,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1949.22,1952.205,"Well I know, but you are relying on an implicit directive anyway."
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1963.329,1965.845,--But they have never changed the 100 to 1 ratio.
2007.06-6330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2029.001,2033.822,"But those are the same cliff effects that are the product of Neal, precisely the same."
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2033.822,2040.659,--But this Court didn't consider whether those cliff effects were legally valid in Neal because it had no guideline before it.
2007.06-6330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2082.386,2088.056,"In response to that statute, did the commission revise the guideline that was involved in Neal?"
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2088.056,2089.373,"--It did not, and the government--"
2007.06-6330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2089.373,2090.492,Shouldn't it have done it?
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2090.492,2105.919,"--I think it should have, and I think that the commission's decoupling of its guidelines from the mandatory minimums that Congress has provided produces an irrational disconnect between guideline sentencing and sentencing--"
2007.06-6330,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2105.919,2107.186,"Well, that's because of the cliff."
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2208.301,2224.413,"--Justice Breyer, as a general matter, the government accepts that a sentencing judge can revisit, challenge the Sentencing Commission's policy determinations as an intrinsic feature of an advisory guideline system."
2007.06-6330,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2246.826,2253.265,"No, because Congress has nowhere said that you can't have cliffs."
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2280.165,2283.467,"But, Justice Breyer, the one time when the commission tried to do that--"
2007.06-6330,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2283.467,2285.234,They wanted to abolish the whole thing.
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2285.234,2298.477,"--They wanted to make it one to one, and Congress recognized that that would produce severe cliffs and said not appropriate; if you want to change the sentencing statutes and guidelines in tandem, that's fine, make a recommendation."
2007.06-6330,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2311.602,2321.992,"Isn't your answer also to Justice Breyer's question the post-Neal amendment to the statute which in effect says, you know, make your Guidelines consistent with the statute?"
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2321.992,2322.959,"Yes, it--"
2007.06-6330,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2322.959,2326.361,Quite... quite apart from the specific rejection of the proposal they came up with.
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2326.361,2329.43,"--The two of them work together in tandem, I think."
2007.06-6330,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2329.43,2329.765,Why?
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2357.332,2365.669,"Well, I think I want to rely on what the Sentencing Commission itself did before it concluded that it disagreed with the 100 to 1 ratio in the statute."
2007.06-6330,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2402.361,2415.669,"Well, that's why... and the 1993 statute that you said, that you referred to, did indeed require the guidelines to track the... the statutory prescriptions for sentencing."
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2415.669,2417.721,"--2003, I believe."
2007.06-6330,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2417.721,2418.321,Pardon me?
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2418.321,2419.487,It's 2003.
2007.06-6330,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2419.487,2419.971,2003.
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2439.9,2453.708,"What distinguishes this area, Justice Scalia, I believe, from other guidelines is that the backdrop for sentencing for drug crimes is a mandatory minimum statute that goes directly to the sentencing court."
2007.06-6330,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2465.849,2482.327,"Well, why don't you just skip the Guidelines and say that the effect of the sentencing statute is to make it unreasonable for a sentencing judge... never mind the Guidelines... to do anything other than follow the 100 to 1 prescription that Congress has established?"
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2482.327,2483.443,"Well, I'm happy to do just--"
2007.06-6330,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2483.443,2488.214,I don't know what the Guidelines add to... to your game except another... another stage.
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2488.214,2500.689,"--Well, if... if it's sufficient for the Court that Section 841 itself establishes the 100 to 1 ratio and that's something that's off-limits for the district courts to disagree with, I'm content."
2007.06-6330,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2521.519,2530.541,"Well, I would say that that statute reflects Congress's desire that sentencing, whether it's through the commission or not, be based on the 100 to 1 ratio."
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2530.541,2532.608,"And I agree with that, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-6330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2552.288,2562.929,"But is it not true that that only affects about 20 percent of the crack cocaine cases, because they say... maybe I'm wrong on this... that 80 percent of the sentences are actually fixed by the mandatory minimum?"
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2562.929,2572.035,"--There's a floor in the mandatory minimum, but I think that there are quite a few sentences that are above the mandatory minimum and there are sentences that are below the mandatory minimum."
2007.06-6330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2573.268,2575.403,I was... and correct me if I'm wrong.
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2581.891,2588.045,"--I didn't get that out of my attempt to plumb the data, Justice Stevens."
2007.06-6330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2625.836,2627.002,Isn't this another alternative?
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2649.284,2653.903,"--I don't think so, because I think here we're talking about a matter of statutory construction."
2007.06-6330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2658.64,2660.19,You have a conflict in the statute.
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2665.642,2668.36,That wasn't the two statutes I was thinking of.
2007.06-6330,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2673.248,2678.818,"No, Mr. Dreeben, your office used to argue that when Congress wants to do something, there's a way to do it."
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2698.815,2706.152,"--Our position here, I think, is consistent with our view that you read statutes both for what they say and for what they mean."
2007.06-6330,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2724.446,2729.648,We should read a negative pregnant in the Congress' vetoing of what the Commission wanted to do?
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2729.648,2747.86,"--At least the Court should do this much, that when a court of appeals is reviewing for reasonableness a sentence imposed by a district judge, the court of appeals should refract the Section 3553(a) factors through Congress' existing judgment that a 100 to 1 ratio is warranted."
2007.06-6330,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2747.86,2761.751,"If Congress passes a statute that says the mandatory minimum sentence of eight years for possessing a 12-inch shotgun unlawfully, does that mean it wants four years for a 6-inch shotgun?"
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2762.286,2763.92,It doesn't.
2007.06-6330,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2794.072,2794.591,At the cliff.
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2809.434,2818.02,"No, but I think that Congress doesn't view the Guidelines quantity determinations as being independent from its mandatory minimum determinations."
2007.06-6330,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2824.174,2849.473,"And then are you saying that either the guidelines are out of it and the statute controls, the ratio is a 100 to 1, or that Congress has, in effect, made a particular guideline, the one setting the drug quantity, made that mandatory?"
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2858.812,2867.767,"--They do come down to the same thing, Justice Ginsburg, in the sense that the guideline as it exists today incorporates the 100 to 1 ratio."
2007.06-6330,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2922.484,2930.34,"Why doesn't Congress... why didn't Congress, in fact, do what you say they implicitly did explicitly?"
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2936.411,2937.928,Because they had no reason to do it.
2007.06-6330,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2947.699,2950.568,Congress has legislated in this area after Booker.
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2956.139,2960.359,"--I'm not aware that they have legislated in this area after Booker, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-6330,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2991.395,2995.949,"But that, as you say, in effect, makes a certain element mandatory."
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3000.318,3017.046,"The only requirement, I believe, that exists under Booker is that judge not in all cases be required to find a fact in order to exceed the guidelines range that would be based on the jury verdict alone or the admission of guilt alone."
2007.06-6330,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3049.297,3066.276,"It seems to me that the gap in your argument is that whatever Congress legislated, it did not legislate the manner in which you transferred this 100 to 1 ratio onto the sentencing chart."
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3073.698,3077.734,It is done in a logically proportional manner--
2007.06-6330,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3077.734,3078.384,Maybe.
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3090.774,3093.809,--The Sentencing Commission at least started where Congress did.
2007.06-6330,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3093.809,3094.909,That's fine.
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3103.515,3120.258,"I don't think they do have to follow it through exactly the way the Sentencing Commission did it, because they don't... sentencing courts today which are sentencing under advisory guidelines need not use exactly the same base offense levels when they come down to final sentences after they've considered what the Commission has done."
2007.06-6330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3170.892,3180.248,Is it not a fact that this guideline is also unique in that it was not based on a history of other similar crimes like all the other... most of the guidelines were?
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3186.735,3187.269,--True.
2007.06-6330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3195.673,3196.208,I understand.
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3204.195,3206.361,"Well, the drug guideline was based on--"
2007.06-6330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3206.361,3210.599,The 100 to 1 ratio is not based on history?
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3210.599,3210.949,--No.
2007.06-6330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3212.082,3215.217,"Therefore, none of the sentencing guidelines relating to crack are based on history."
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3215.217,3219.287,--They are based on the fact that Congress made a supervening policy judgment.
2007.06-6330,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3226.108,3231.678,So there is really an entirely different rationale for defending these guidelines than any other guidelines in the system?
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3231.678,3251.859,"Well, there are some other guidelines where Congress has directly intervened, but my fundamental point here is that so long as Congress has made a determination that it has not changed, that it wants 100 to 1 as a mandatory minimum set point, district courts should not be free to say I think Congress got it wrong, I'm going to sentence on a different paradigm."
2007.06-6330,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3286.413,3296.037,"Does the Guidelines supersede the parsimony provision, because the parsimony provision is general and the Guidelines... the ratio is specific?"
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3296.037,3297.654,"Well, I would put it differently, Justice Kennedy."
2007.06-6330,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3347.387,3355.076,Suppose experience shows that the ratio is not consistent with the parsimony provision... we find that over a course of time?
2007.06-6330,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3355.076,3366.634,"Well, I don't think that the Court can interpret Congress in Section 3553(a) to make unreasonable what Congress did in Section 841."
2007.06-6330,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3402.557,3403.674,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
2007.06-6330,2,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,3407.092,3408.711,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-6330,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3512.778,3516.063,But I was wrong that they legislated after Booker.
2007.06-6330,2,36400,michael_s_nachmanoff,,3516.063,3537.477,"--Well, Your Honor, Congress has failed completely to address this particular problem, and they have understood since Booker that if they wanted to address the issue of the discretion that sentencing courts must have with regard to the advisory guidelines, they have a way of fixing the problem."
2007.06-6330,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3625.165,3626.349,"Thank you, Mr. Nachmanoff."
