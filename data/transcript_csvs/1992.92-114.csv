1992.92-114,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.499,"We'll hear argument now in 92-114, Cardinal Chemical Company v. Morton International."
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,12.008,15.341,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-114,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,36.284,49.284,"Mr. Schill, in addressing us, I hope you will tell us how, if at all, your position differs from that expressed by Mr. Coons."
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,49.284,51.054,"--I certainly plan to, Your Honor."
1992.92-114,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,51.054,54.907,And tell us whether you think we have any controversy here at all.
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,54.907,56.099,I certainly shall.
1992.92-114,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,58.28,58.771,Sure.
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,58.771,59.502,Okay.
1992.92-114,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,141.397,159.597,"I thought, though, that we granted certiorari on the question whether the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit errs when it vacates a declaratory judgment holding an asserted patent invalid merely because it determines that the patent is not infringed."
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,162.151,162.759,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-114,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,162.759,170.085,"As to that question, is there any difference between you and Mr. Coons' position?"
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,170.085,185.316,"I believe that the way I would put the issue, or resolve that issue, is that the court has erred because it has not resolved the controversy between the parties in this case."
1992.92-114,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,202.797,212.244,"Well, you take the position that the policy adopted and now followed by CAFC is in error, that it shouldn't follow that policy--"
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,212.244,213.205,That's correct.
1992.92-114,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,213.205,217.47,--And that seems to be the same position taken by your opponent.
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,217.47,220.899,"I agree that that is the same position, ultimately, that they take."
1992.92-114,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,222.831,226.275,"And so how is there a controversy, then?"
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,226.275,242.324,How is there... I'm not sure there is a controversy on the point of what the Federal Circuit should do on which... on which you granted cert. I'm not sure that there is a conflict between us--
1992.92-114,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,242.324,244.076,You do argue--
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,244.076,244.624,--We--
1992.92-114,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,244.624,248.257,"--That different consequences should follow, though."
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,258.505,261.076,"--No, you are correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-114,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,294.977,296.84,And the respondents differ with you on that point.
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,296.84,297.01,Yes.
1992.92-114,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,303.264,313.512,"Well, there's still an underlying dispute, of course, as to the validity vel non and infringement vel non of the patent, isn't there?"
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,313.512,314.583,"Yes, there is indeed, Your Honor."
1992.92-114,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,314.583,323.469,"Do you take the position that there is any difference with respect to jurisdictional mootness, depending on whether the issue is raised by counterclaim or affirmative defense?"
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,323.469,331.724,"I'm not sure I understand your question, Justice Souter."
1992.92-114,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,331.724,341.509,"Well, you've argued very persuasively that there is no jurisdictional mootness when the issue of validity is raised by means of a counterclaim."
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,352.738,360.092,"Yes, I believe that it does, because a... there is no right to have a decision on a defense."
1992.92-114,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,360.092,364.535,"Well, there may be no right to have it, but the court still has jurisdiction to render it, doesn't it?"
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,364.535,368.907,The court does still have jurisdiction to render it if it wishes to reach that issue.
1992.92-114,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,368.907,371.428,"So the difference is prudential, rather than jurisdictional."
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,371.428,372.489,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-114,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,372.489,372.669,Okay.
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,372.669,384.048,"In this case, the court... the Federal Circuit... vacated the declaratory judgment of invalidity that Cardinal won at the lower court."
1992.92-114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,410.273,412.906,"If that would work, what's wrong with that?"
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,413.657,434.16,"We find that that would... that is... the court is either... is incorrect in its formulation, I believe, because either the issue is moot and it has no discretion to reach it... that is, it's jurisdictionally moot under Article 3... or it's exercising its discretion and has taken into account certain factors in order to decide whether it should reach the issue."
1992.92-114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,449.684,475.622,"Well, to say that it has discretion is not to say that it cannot exercise its discretion on a generic basis, and to draw up entire categories of cases in which it will simply decide that it should not go any further, and I think this Court has said one large category is when the issue makes no difference to the judgment below, and it's a complex patent case."
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,484.328,495.024,"Well, if it made no difference to the judgment below, perhaps that would be proper, Your Honor, but I do believe it does make a difference to the decision below, especially in this case."
1992.92-114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,520.842,532.079,"I agree you have a much stronger case with respect to the counterclaim, declaratory judgment action, but just talk for a minute about the no counterclaim, just--"
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,532.079,533.511,Affirmative defense.
1992.92-114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,533.511,534.872,--Just an affirmative defense.
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,534.872,535.042,Yes.
1992.92-114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,549.604,562.82,"So it really makes no difference to the decision below whether the appellate court goes on to review the invalidity determination or not, and why should it expend its energy on that question?"
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,573.909,574.139,Right.
1992.92-114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,581.195,581.726,I'm sure it may.
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,582.948,583.159,Yes.
1992.92-114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,583.159,584.998,"--I concede it may, but why should it?"
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,588.191,588.361,Well--
1992.92-114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,588.361,589.002,--Or you don't care?
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,589.002,592.255,"--Not on the issue, Your Honor, where it's raised as an affirmative defense."
1992.92-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,598.479,603.691,"If it decided the validity issue, it would save itself a lot of work in the future, wouldn't it?"
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,603.691,607.173,"Do you mean no matter how it was raised, Your Honor?"
1992.92-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,607.173,607.404,Yes.
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,613.518,613.749,Yes.
1992.92-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,624.535,628.078,"But I just ask, wouldn't it save itself some work in the future?"
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,628.078,630.312,--It may well save itself some work in the future.
1992.92-114,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,635.286,648.624,"Well, shouldn't it turn, then, simply on whether it has reasonable... reason to believe that there are going to be a series of similar cases, and then if so, then it would make sense prudentially to exercise its jurisdiction and go ahead and decide it."
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,648.624,652.037,"I certainly agree, Your Honor, and in this case, that was the case."
1992.92-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,722.583,724.095,Because it's been vacated.
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,724.095,735.261,"--Because it's been vacated, and the only way he can really get a judgment is if he's first found to be infringing, and then presumably the court would reach the issue of validity."
1992.92-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,775.8,788.078,"If we agree with you and your colleague that the... if we agree with you there should have been a decision, what do we say, abuse of discretion, or what?"
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,788.078,789.968,"To the Federal Circuit, Your Honor?"
1992.92-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,789.968,790.218,Yes.
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,797.435,817.276,"I think really perhaps going back they seem to be depending upon this Court's judgment in the Altvater case, and I think what has taken the court off-track is the statement in that case that says that because there were additional claims and devices at issue there was proper jurisdiction."
1992.92-114,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,828.064,831.247,What do you mean by an exemplary issue?
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,831.247,856.585,"Well, for... I think that the jurisdiction of the Court is as broad as whatever fits under the Declaratory Judgment Act, and so long as there is a case of controversy under that act, then there is a right to have a determination made, and by exemplary, I meant a case, or additional claims or devices is one example of when there is still a controversy between the parties."
1992.92-114,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,856.585,857.857,An e.g.--
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,857.857,858.408,Yes.
1992.92-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,858.408,868.413,--Do you think the court of appeals in the original case felt bound to come out that way under our cases?
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,868.413,875.89,That's the only learning I can get from their view in the Vieau v. Japax case.
1992.92-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,875.89,895.751,"So do you think they've... if we thought they misconstrued those cases, do you think if we disabused them of their error that they would then decide the validity issue, or would they say, why should we fool with it?"
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,895.751,926.202,"I believe, Your Honor, that the instruction from this Court that the Altvater case should not be limited to the case of that was licensee estoppel, really, that was in extent at that point in time, and clarification that the jurisdiction, so long as there is adequate jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act, that issue should be decided so long as it is necessary to resolve the conflict between the parties."
1992.92-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,977.306,983.71,What was the vote in the Federal Circuit?
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,983.71,994.978,"It was... well, Judge Lourie wrote a concurring opinion saying that he would have reached the invalidity issue in this case and found the patent invalid."
1992.92-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1005.043,1008.656,Was there some suggestion of en banc?
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,1008.656,1017.742,"We had requested an en banc ruling, and three of the judges would have allowed the en banc hearing, including Chief Judge Nies."
1992.92-114,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1017.742,1022.997,And did that include the dissenting judge in the--
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,1022.997,1023.525,"Yes, it did."
1992.92-114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1026.748,1032.691,--But this issue has never really been addressed by the Federal Circuit en banc.
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,1032.691,1033.823,"It has not, Your Honor."
1992.92-114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1033.823,1039.637,"They just have a long series of panel decisions that... so this is the law of the circuit, and they looked at their--"
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,1039.637,1040.278,That's correct.
1992.92-114,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1056.939,1069.266,"--Well, maybe we should go no further than simply to say that it is an abuse of discretion to exercise no discretion, and leave it to them to work out criteria, rather than trying to set them here in this case."
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,1069.266,1078.343,"--I think... I guess I'm not sure how to respond to that, Your Honor."
1992.92-114,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1079.324,1082.226,"You don't like the suggestion, I take it."
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,1083.808,1104.581,"--Since I appear before the Court, I'd like to... I do believe that this Court's teachings in the precedent we've cited in Sinclair and Blonder-Tongue should play an important role in coming to the decisions of whether to reach invalidity in each case."
1992.92-114,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1148.49,1165.661,"Mr. Schill, it seems to me the formula that you're suggesting we adopt, or the rule, has enough imponderables and exceptions in it that it's not going to be too much guidance for the Federal Circuit."
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,1171.885,1183.532,"In the first instance, Your Honor, I believe the lower courts have the duty to decide whether there's a case or controversy."
1992.92-114,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1217.887,1225.362,And what are the situations in which you say that the Federal Circuit need not reach the validity issue?
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,1225.362,1239.942,"The only two that I've been able to come up with so far, Your Honor, are the issue, for example, where the patent has expired somewhere around the time of the appeal, and to decide that issue would really be a moot point."
1992.92-114,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1259.765,1263.939,"Mr. Schill, what's the difference between unenforceability and invalidity?"
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,1263.939,1269.421,"Unenforceability, there are a couple of different circumstances of unenforceability."
1992.92-114,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1277.769,1278.089,"Well, you mean like--"
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,1278.089,1286.106,"--Inequitable conduct before the patent office, which would make the patent perhaps invalid or unenforceable against any person."
1992.92-114,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1286.106,1290.358,"--Well, but that would be... that makes the patent invalid in the... if it's procured by fraud, doesn't it--"
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,1290.358,1290.908,Yes.
1992.92-114,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1290.908,1301.055,--But you're suggesting there might be a case where it's unenforceable against a particular licensee or particular infringer because of inequi... I see.
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,1301.055,1301.266,Yes.
1992.92-114,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1301.266,1301.786,Okay.
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,1309.791,1315.297,"I agree Your Honor, from the standpoint of the public interest--"
1992.92-114,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1315.297,1315.517,--Yes.
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,1315.517,1317.728,--I don't think the factors would require--
1992.92-114,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1317.728,1318.938,Which is one of the things Sinclair talks about.
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,1318.938,1328.615,"--Yes, but I don't see that there is a need to resolve the particular conflict before the Court to decide that issue, only from a societal need to try--"
1992.92-114,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1328.615,1331.986,And let me also be sure I get the thrust of your basic position.
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,1351.4,1361.848,"--Yes, I think that is a different situation, Your Honor, and the trial court has before it the closest... is closest to the facts of the case and knows when they're... or, how to judge whether--"
1992.92-114,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1361.848,1362.048,Yes.
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,1362.048,1364.23,--The controversy is real between the parties or not.
1992.92-114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1364.23,1371.956,"Well, I suppose you'd say the trial court is the same as far as the counterclaim is concerned."
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,1380.761,1382.882,"No, and I--"
1992.92-114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1382.882,1406.948,"I mean, I can understand on the defense, if the trial court wants to just find no infringement it may decide not to go ahead with the invalidity as a defense, but if there's a separate claim, a counterclaim on invalidity, can the trial court just say there's no infringement and that's the end of the case, case dismissed?"
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,1406.948,1415.793,"--Well, the Declaratory Judgment Act is discretionary, so even though there is a case or controversy, to me it seems as if that--"
1992.92-114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1415.793,1426.84,"To be sure, but is a proper basis for exercising that discretion merely that you have dismissed an accompanying infringement action--"
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,1426.84,1428.15,--No.
1992.92-114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1428.15,1434.364,"--Anymore than it would if you brought the declaratory judgment action separately, when there had been no infringement action?"
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,1434.364,1434.544,That's correct.
1992.92-114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1434.544,1447.385,"I mean, I can't imagine... can you say you can always dismiss a declaratory judgment action for infringement, in your discretion, with no other reason than it is a declaratory judgment action for infringement?"
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,1447.385,1448.854,"No, I wouldn't--"
1992.92-114,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1448.854,1449.165,Certainly not.
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,1474.552,1476.445,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-114,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1551.815,1555.778,"Mr. Schill, how do you think the Federal Circuit got into this box?"
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,1578.963,1599.637,"To me, it just seems as if the interpretation they felt was necessary to interpret Altvater in these situations led to the practice, that they were trying to... you know, preserve judicial economy so that they did not have to keep litigating the issue, but I don't think it saves judicial time in the long run."
1992.92-114,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1599.637,1604.079,"Mr. Schill, was Judge Markey still on the circuit when they adopted this rule?"
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,1604.079,1604.73,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-114,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1604.73,1605.35,He was.
1992.92-114,0,20084,charles_f_schill,,1609.115,1609.525,Thank you.
1992.92-114,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1609.525,1615.49,Mr. Coons.
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,1615.49,1618.921,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1634.161,1636.174,As to whether they should have decided the issue--
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,1636.174,1637.393,That is correct.
1992.92-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1637.393,1640.575,--But there's a major dispute between you on validity.
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,1640.575,1652.775,"There certainly is, and there is also a major dispute with regard to those situations in which the appellate court, the Federal Circuit, should decide validity."
1992.92-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1858.2,1871.749,"So you would say that if a... the district court, when it's faced with claims... infringement claims and claims on the other side of invalidity, has to decide them both."
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,1871.749,1873.038,--That's correct.
1992.92-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1873.038,1883.717,"Or maybe just decide... maybe you get to validity first, then you don't have to fool with invalidity, do you?"
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,1883.717,1885.518,You mean fool with noninfringement?
1992.92-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1885.518,1888.039,"I mean, noninfringement."
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,1888.81,1927.996,"I think that the better practice certainly... it's almost one of false economy, because I think the Federal Circuit practice is well-rooted, in fact, to have the trial courts decide both issues, because if the decision is deemed to be inappropriate on validity, for example, which before this Vieau v. Japax procedure... and that's part of the problem, that literally as many times as not, that trial court holding of invalidity was reversed, and so in those 50 percent of the cases the problem would be that not having decided infringement, then back down the case would go--"
1992.92-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1927.996,1928.267,--Yes.
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,1928.267,1937.663,--And certainly that sort of piecemeal litigation would be... I think would take up more judicial time than it would take to simply do it all at once.
1992.92-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1937.663,1944.259,"But at least your position would be the district court, if there's a validity issue presented, it should be decided."
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,1944.259,1945.869,"Yes, that's correct."
1992.92-114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1945.869,1956.306,"Are you telling us, or can you tell us that in almost every instance of patent litigation in the district court the district court reaches both issues?"
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,1956.306,1958.346,I think that's correct.
1992.92-114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1973.657,1995.521,"It would seem to me that there may be cases in which the evidence on infringement, the proof that's necessary to resolve the infringement is very easily managed and the patent validity question is extremely complicated, and that it's only wise for the district court to proceed to the infringement issue just to dispose of the case."
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,1995.521,2029.193,"And I think that certainly could be done by the exercise of judicial restraint, and like any court which is not a court of last resort, the problem would be that what may be entirely clear to that trial court, the appellate court may decide that's not the case and then send it back down for validity, but certainly within the exercise of judicial restraint, in the first instance, if it is that clear, I think that the trial court has the discretion to decide that issue or not, but eventually--"
1992.92-114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2029.193,2031.977,So that there is discretion so far as you're concerned.
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2031.977,2032.605,--That's correct.
1992.92-114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2032.605,2034.517,Is there discretion also in the appellate court?
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2034.517,2049.387,"Well, I think I misspoke, because I think there would be discretion to do so, but if you... once there is an appeal and the issue has been... well, let me backtrack on that."
1992.92-114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2131.182,2156.748,"If we were to adopt that rule, is there any danger that powerful and well-funded patent-holders could pick their target for declaratory relief by prompting a suit from an infringer, by suing an infringer with very little assets?"
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2156.748,2159.349,I don't think it would really make any difference.
1992.92-114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2159.349,2160.979,Why wouldn't it?
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2171.688,2186.498,"But even if that were done, and even if there were a decision of... that the patent was valid, technically it's the defendant's burden, so the holding would be that there has not been that clear and convincing showing that the patent was not valid."
1992.92-114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2211.794,2211.974,Each time.
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2211.974,2222.232,"Now, another point--"
1992.92-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2222.232,2234.05,"Well, at least, then, there's no reason to go forward if you don't think that this particular alleged infringer cares about the issue anymore, right, so it isn't just--"
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2234.05,2235.298,--Cares about the issue of validity?
1992.92-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2235.298,2236.009,--Right.
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2243.803,2253.38,"No, I... if I did, I spoke in error because I think in Blonder-Tongue there's a third party, and that is the public."
1992.92-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2259.075,2260.547,But the public isn't affected.
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2265.802,2266.852,"--Well, that's what we--"
1992.92-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2266.852,2268.655,"--But the issue can be relitigated, right?"
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2268.655,2298.204,"--It certainly can be relitigated, but there is a situation in which, if you do not resolve validity and you follow the Federal Circuit practice as has been done here... stepping back in point of time, the Federal Circuit has been around for well over 10 years, and prior to 1986, in '87 when this Vieau practice came into play, they had decided routinely both validity and infringement."
1992.92-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2353.03,2358.154,"What I'm saying is, I don't understand what that means if you say the whole thing can be relitigated again in the next case, anyway."
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2358.154,2367.179,"--It can only be relitigated if the validity of the patent is restored, or is determined on appeal."
1992.92-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2393.056,2398.349,"You say, if you lose on invalidity, that's the end of it."
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2398.349,2399.57,"That is the end, that's right."
1992.92-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2399.821,2403.231,"But if you win on invalidity, you're going to have to keep on litigating it, no matter what."
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2403.231,2403.381,--That's correct.
1992.92-114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2403.912,2414.73,"But will the court of appeals on essentially the same charge of invalidity, if it has previously found a patent valid, adhere to its earlier decision?"
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2414.73,2418.18,I think that's a good question.
1992.92-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2451.435,2463.063,"Well, suppose the appellate court is dealing with a case in which the district court has found the patent to be valid."
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2490.291,2500.396,"Well, I think it certainly... I think it certainly could, and there certainly is a distinction between whether a patent has been held invalid in the trial court or whether it has been held valid."
1992.92-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2500.396,2505.18,"Invalid is a stronger case for getting to it on appeal, a much stronger case, isn't it?"
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2505.18,2534.66,"That certainly... that certainly is the case, but if you follow Blonder-Tongue and you look at the concept of wanting to provide one full and fair opportunity, that includes the right to appeal on the merits, because just as the trial court could be wrong on either of that, you prevent that sort of a situation and it could be that the valid holding was incorrect and the patent should be held invalid."
1992.92-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2558.336,2576.695,"Would it make any difference as long... if validity's at issue, and infringement is at issue in a trial court, would it make any difference whether the patent was held to be infringed or noninfringed?"
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2576.695,2584.893,Not insofar as Blonder-Tongue is concerned and in our position with respect to considering that issue on appeal.
1992.92-114,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2633.313,2638.927,"Wherein does your position differ from Mr. Schill's in this respect, Mr. Coons?"
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2638.927,2643.962,I think it differs in the respect with which we were just discussing.
1992.92-114,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2674.171,2675.822,Or just an affirmative defense.
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2675.822,2677.322,Or just an affirmative defense.
1992.92-114,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2677.322,2681.876,You say that the validity should be decided in either event--
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2681.876,2682.487,That's correct.
1992.92-114,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2682.487,2683.488,--By the Federal Circuit.
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2683.488,2684.029,That's correct.
1992.92-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2684.029,2689.182,"At least where it's been... well, of course, where it's been decided by the lower court--"
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2689.182,2689.612,That's correct.
1992.92-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2689.612,2710.496,"--And when you were speaking earlier about when the lower court had to decide it in your view and it would be an abuse of discretion not to decide it, were you assuming that there was a declaratory judgment counterclaim or not, because frankly I... it seems to me that it's up to the district judge how many issues he wants to resolve."
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2734.522,2756.968,"I think the Federal Circuit practice and what we've all more or less grown up with is a situation in which trial courts have in fact exercised their discretion and have in fact considered both issues, and I think the reason is to attempt to avoid piecemeal--"
1992.92-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2756.968,2757.198,Right.
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2757.198,2771.499,"--litigation, because if they happen to be wrong on the issue that they decide... infringement, for example, then what happens is you then go back and you have to decide something else when it's not fresh, it takes more time and all that sort of thing, and--"
1992.92-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2771.499,2784.777,"Sure, but you can say that in a lot of different contexts in a lot of different other lawsuits, and I don't know any rule that says a district judge has to decide anymore than is minimally necessary to resolve the dispute."
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2786.877,2790.069,--And I think that... and I don't contend to the contrary.
1992.92-114,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2790.069,2817.448,"May I just throw out... I don't know if this really sheds any light on anything or not, but are there not some cases in which there's a dispute about how to interpret the claims, and if you interpret the claims broadly you may have a stronger claim of invalidity, or if you construe them narrowly there's a better defense to the infringement charge, and so that you're not always... I mean, sometimes your determination of the merits of one of the two issues may color your determination of the other issue."
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2818.59,2819.781,You are correct.
1992.92-114,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2819.781,2836.622,"--Yes, and I don't know if that might complicate it, and I'm... very frankly, one of the things that worries me about a case where you don't have an adversary on the precise question before us, and much of the discussion is about other cases where there's an affirmative defense, and so forth, whether we really have any business talking about that."
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2850.12,2870.405,"Well, I think it depends on... I think I would be certainly satisfied with that result, but I think this is an opportunity for this Court to provide some definitive bright line approach that would, I think, satisfy all the parties."
1992.92-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2870.405,2874.747,So you want us to talk about what district courts should do and all that?
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2874.747,2878.369,"Oh, I think district courts can take care of themselves right now."
1992.92-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2878.369,2885.135,"Well, all right, so you don't insist that we give the district courts a lot of advice."
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2885.135,2888.237,"Oh, I'm sure that that happens."
1992.92-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2982.76,2992.517,Do you think that most patent lawyers around the country agree with you?
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,2998.15,3000.352,I haven't made a survey.
1992.92-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3000.352,3006.626,Do you know anyone that doesn't agree with you that we can get up here to argue the other side?
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,3009.238,3014.531,"I was hoping you weren't going to put me in that situation, but all I can say by way--"
1992.92-114,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3014.531,3016.243,"You can say yes, but I don't respect him, right?"
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,3017.943,3041.238,"--Well, I think that the point is that certainly from the amici, from the American Bar Association, the American Intellectual Property Law Association, and from the Federal Circuit Bar Association, you see a unanimity of view that this practice is not something that everybody is fond of and that it feels--"
1992.92-114,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3041.238,3045.201,Maybe that's why we didn't get an amicus in this case.
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,3047.374,3062.483,"--Well, I have been... this is all hearsay, and perhaps it's not admissible at this stage, but I have been told that Judge Bennett's law clerk, and he wrote the concurring opinion in the Vieau v. Japax--"
1992.92-114,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3062.483,3064.665,"You mean, he drafted it, yes."
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,3069.557,3071.329,--I stand corrected.
1992.92-114,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3080.536,3083.518,"I think you're right, that's hearsay."
1992.92-114,1,25125,gordon_r_coons,,3085.208,3124.675,"--But I think that we're... from my point of view, that one of the things that frankly I have not found any precedent that is squarely on point, but it's the issue of, we have Article 3 case or controversy, we have prudential mootness, and we have mootness being thrown around oftentimes a little bit loosely, and I submit that a court such as the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which is not a court of last resort, cannot itself, by its own action, create either jurisdictional mootness, nor can it create prudential mootness."
1992.92-114,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3239.51,3241.483,"Thank you, Mr. Coons."
1992.92-114,2,20084,charles_f_schill,,3243.676,3249.951,I think I would just like to make two points.
1992.92-114,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3313.731,3315.293,"Thank you, Mr. Schill."
1992.92-114,2,20084,charles_f_schill,,3315.293,3315.722,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1992.92-114,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3315.722,3316.473,The case is submitted.
