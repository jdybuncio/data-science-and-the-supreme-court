1973.72-936,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,47.925,"We’ll hear arguments next in 72-936, United States against Robinson."
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,50.697,54.416,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-936,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,180.732,183.823,"What do you mean, Mr. Tuttle, a routine traffic check?"
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,183.823,201.676,I mean a stop where the officer will bring a car to the curb that he observes for any reason that leads him to wish to check whether or not the driver is duly licensed and the car’s property register.
1973.72-936,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,201.676,203.616,What was the reason in this search?
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,203.616,207.141,The record does not reveal any particular reason on this case.
1973.72-936,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,207.141,214.456,"Are you suggesting as I drive home, an officer can insist that I pull over the curb while he asks to look at my license?"
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,214.456,216.212,"Absolutely, yes."
1973.72-936,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,216.795,220.432,"Do -- you said routine, you mean routine or random?"
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,220.432,231.925,"Well, I mean -- I mean it was routine and that is -- it is a practice of the Metropolitan Police Department to do this and -- this kind of stop on a random basis."
1973.72-936,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,237.52,240.375,Have you ever experienced this since you live in Washington?
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,240.375,241.288,Such a stop?
1973.72-936,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,241.288,244.11,Yes.
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,244.11,247.872,I have been stopped but --
1973.72-936,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,247.872,249.36,Have that ever happened to you?
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,249.36,251.92,"In that particular circumstance, no, I haven’t."
1973.72-936,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,251.92,254.861,"Well, you’re relying, 17 years."
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,254.861,255.992,"Well, I may say that this --"
1973.72-936,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,255.992,257.416,But how routine is it --
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,257.416,262.526,That this is not a question before the court unless the court wishes to make it a question.
1973.72-936,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,263.119,268.608,"Well, I thought you were relying on the fact that this was something called a routine traffic."
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,269.133,275.029,I’m relying in the last analysis on the fact that this is a conceitedly lawful arrest.
1973.72-936,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,350.61,355.634,"But whether it was or not, I gather there's no challenge to the arrest here, is it?"
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,355.634,361.194,There is no challenge to the arrest here in this Court.
1973.72-936,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,565.805,569.504,You mean the right to search for weapons but incident to a lawful arrest?
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,569.504,576.144,"Oh, of course, I’m a -- the arrest was conceded by the Court of Appeals to be lawful when they remanded it."
1973.72-936,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,586.578,587.01,"Well, I thought you --"
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,587.01,590.126,Or the arrest here was not a pretext for a narcotic search --
1973.72-936,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,590.126,610.199,"General Tuttle, I thought you're argument was and maybe it’s what you’ve said that if there is a valid arrest of a person, then the law -- the settled law is that there is -- there can be a constitutionally a valid, complete search of his person."
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,616.29,617.368,"Well, it--"
1973.72-936,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,617.368,621.062,"The law, the constitutional law is that there can be a complete search of his person, isn’t it right?"
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,621.062,630.633,It’s conceivable to me that there might be a search which would exceed the scope of a permissible search for weapons.
1973.72-936,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,646.191,650.529,How about a sealed envelope?
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,650.529,656.074,"Well, we -- I’d have to develop the hypothetical a little bit if it were solid or had any kind of solidity to it --"
1973.72-936,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,656.074,656.894,"What’s that sealed envelope, that --?"
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,656.894,662.059,That it might contain a razor blade or some such thing then I would say it’d be a permissible weapon search.
1973.72-936,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,678.298,682.7,"Well a broader search looking in body cavities and what not, we’re talking -- not talking about that."
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,682.7,692.065,Well that -- of course we’re not because that would raise the Rochin kind of problem and that would be beyond the scope of a permissible weapon search.
1973.72-936,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,720.765,723.812,What’s the distinction between arrest and a custodial arrest?
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,723.812,731.45,"Well, I would as -- I would not want to argue that when a police officer stops a car to issue a summons that that was not an arrest."
1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,773.294,775.19,Could he be handcuffed?
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,775.19,775.834,Excuse me?
1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,775.834,778.154,Could he handcuff him?
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,778.154,779.61,He did -- could he or did he?
1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,779.61,780.744,Could he?
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,780.744,782.89,"He could but Your Honor, I think that that --"
1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,782.89,785.041,Would the officer be pretty safe then?
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,785.041,795.762,"Well, officer -- the court is probably aware that last month, Officer Pamraning (ph) in the Police Force in Arlington was shot and killed by a man that he handcuffed."
1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,797.033,802.213,I also am aware of a prisoner that was shot and killed while handcuffed and shackled.
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,804.28,817.741,It has to do Mr. Justice with the point I believe that handcuffing is not an adequate protection for police officers conducting custodial arrests and I just cite that as a single recent example.
1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,817.741,827.356,"Well, I ask you what I asked in the other case, once he had this crumpled package of cigarettes in his hand, I understand you're not relying on the evidentiary search, am I right?"
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,827.356,828.591,That’s correct.
1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,828.591,837.664,"Well, once he had this possible weapon in his hand, how could the prisoner use that weapon?"
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,837.664,848.432,"He could not use that particular weapon, but I believe that the search of that container which could’ve contained the weapon was wholly justified for a number of reasons."
1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,879.454,882.59,Would that go for a wallet?
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,882.59,884.632,It might if the officer --
1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,884.632,895.543,"Well, is there anything on the man’s possession -- in his possession that is safe from search and seizure, anything?"
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,895.543,900.377,"Anything that could contain a weapon, subject or possibly -- that could possibly --"
1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,900.377,901.027,That would include a handkerchief?
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,901.027,902.532,Subject the officer to injury.
1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,902.532,905.894,Wouldn’t include a handkerchief?
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,905.894,910.272,"I -- if it were folded, possibly."
1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,910.272,912.467,So nothing safe?
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,912.467,914.51,"Well, the -- there are number of reasons --"
1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,914.51,917.283,I’m just trying to have something in mind that would be safe.
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,919.726,921.131,"Well, it’s all safe."
1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,926.91,932.883,"Oh, then it depends on what you find in it."
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,936.337,937.112,Absolutely not.
1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,937.112,938.877,I’m sure you're not. [Laughter Attempt]
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,938.877,939.21,(Voice Overlap)
1973.72-936,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,939.21,947.613,"If you find a razor, suppose you find in that cartoon a razor with a small holder so that it could be used as a weapon --"
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,947.613,951.687,Would certain -- which could certainly be introduced an evidence against the person for carrying concealed weapon.
1973.72-936,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,951.687,968.974,"And would it suggest to the officer as I think Mr. Justice White brought out in the prior case that if the man had an a razor in a holder that could be used as a weapon, he might have some other weapons on him that would justify a more extensive search."
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,968.974,981.597,"That was the point Mr. Justice I -- Mr. Chief Justice, I was trying to make by suggesting that the search of these containers gives the officer information about the kind of possible dangers he maybe facing."
1973.72-936,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1002.431,1029.498,"Mr. Tuttle, wouldn’t the proposition put to you by Mr. Justice Stewart earlier and put to counsel in the proceeding here by Mr. Justice Brennan that is that where you have a valid arrest, you may have a full field search without further inquiry, solve a lot of the kind of parsing of factual situations and at least offer a certain simplicity of administration (Voice Overlap)."
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1029.498,1042.494,"Well, we -- we do think that such a rule of course would be understandable and manageable by a police officers attempting to deal with situations on the street."
1973.72-936,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1132.196,1147.507,"Well, that’s what I thought your argument was and that’s the reason I didn’t really quite understand your question of one of the -- your answer to one of the questions from the bench that it might make a difference whether a razor blade were found or were not found in the scene, the cigarette --"
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1147.507,1148.273,"No, it did not."
1973.72-936,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1148.394,1155.219,"Because I thought your basic argument was that when there's a valid custodial arrest, there can be a full field search."
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1156.326,1158.395,That that’s -- that is our basic argument.
1973.72-936,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1158.395,1158.945,That’s what I thought.
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1158.945,1161.898,But we do concede that searches could be excessive.
1973.72-936,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1161.898,1162.299,"Well, search --"
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1162.299,1171.634,"And searches are justified -- in our view, searches are justified by the reason which gives rise to the right to make the search and --"
1973.72-936,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1171.634,1178.076,And what reason do you need under your (Voice Overlap) valid arrest?
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1178.076,1189.991,"If it is, as in this case, a search for weapons then the reasonable possibility of finding weapons would indicate the -- would indicate the reasonable extent of the search."
1973.72-936,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1189.991,1198.099,"Well, then you apparently want to litigate the specific facts of every arrest when there's a search for weapons?"
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1198.099,1207.969,"Well, I recognize Mr. Justice White that there are two possible -- there's more than one ground upon which the court could sustain the search here."
1973.72-936,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1220.099,1221.877,"That’s been the law until now, hasn’t it?"
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1221.877,1226.047,It has been the law since the Weeks case.
1973.72-936,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1227.65,1229.956,Alright and until this case in the Court of Appeals.
1973.72-936,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1229.956,1231.838,"That’s right, that’s fairly wrong."
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1231.838,1242.554,This is the first case that I know of where a challenge has been made and made successfully in the court below that there ought to be limitations on the scope of a search incident to an arrest.
1973.72-936,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1242.554,1246.765,"Well it’s the decision of the court below that’s the aberration, certainly not the Weeks case --"
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1246.765,1265.066,"Absolutely and I would call the court’s attention to the decision in the Worthy case, which was a decision of the Court of Appeals in which the Chief Justice sat on the panel where the court below, a panel of the court below rejected an attempt to impose limitations on a search incident to a vagrancy arrest there."
1973.72-936,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1292.466,1301.951,Do you think Preston in anyway turned on the fact that the arrest there was for vagrancy?
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1301.951,1302.839,The question where?
1973.72-936,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1302.839,1304.795,You recall in Preston --
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1304.795,1305.094,Yes.
1973.72-936,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1305.094,1308.758,"-- you remember, we held invalid an automobile search --"
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1308.758,1309.294,Yes.
1973.72-936,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1309.294,1312.893,-- and that search while not at the scene as I recall it --
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1312.893,1313.176,It was back at the police station.
1973.72-936,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1313.176,1318.106,"-- I could be wrong about that, but nevertheless the original arrest was for vagrancy?"
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1318.106,1322.969,And the court held that there was no reason to think that evidence will be found in the car that would --
1973.72-936,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1322.969,1330.768,"Well, I just wondered, do you think that Preston in anyway rested on the fact that the arrest there was for vagrancy?"
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1330.768,1334.644,I think it did.
1973.72-936,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1336.04,1336.925,(Voice Overlap) holding one --
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1336.925,1339.044,There it was a question of an evidentiary search --
1973.72-936,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1339.044,1340.014,And it was not --
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1340.014,1340.753,It wouldn’t be found.
1973.72-936,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1340.753,1343.561,The court held there that it was not a search incident to an arrest.
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1348.172,1348.541,"Well, but under --"
1973.72-936,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1348.541,1349.258,But that question doesn’t exist here --
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1349.258,1356.384,"Under Chambers v. Maroney, if we were to take the case forward to today, the Court -- this question where the court would come out the same way."
1973.72-936,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1363.883,1372.726,Well didn’t the time factor enter into it also that they didn’t search the car in Preston until either several hours or some substantial time after the original arrest?
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1372.726,1374.123,"Yes, and which made it not incident --"
1973.72-936,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1374.123,1375.736,"So, it wasn’t incidental to the original arrest --"
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1375.736,1376.166,No.
1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1470.204,1474.523,And what could he have found in there that would’ve endangered him?
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1474.523,1475.575,Well --

1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1479.294,1479.431,Yes --
1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1479.431,1480.257,Folded up like this.

1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1481.327,1484.059,"So, it wasn’t razor blade, was it?"
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1484.059,1484.999,That was in it?
1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1484.999,1485.705,Yes.
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1487.627,1488.915,It -- perhaps could’ve been.
1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1488.915,1492.651,A collapsible razor blade.
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1492.651,1510.947,"Your Honor, we attempted to develop a record on the question of what kinds of things might be found in a small container in the hearing on remand and Officer or rather clandestine weapons expert Mr. Newhouser (ph) --"
1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1510.947,1513.857,I understand with things taped all over his body.
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1513.857,1519.736,He had approximately 25 weapons that were puffed -- had the possibility of subjecting --
1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1519.736,1522.055,Did he have a letter bomb on him?
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1522.055,1523.004,He did not have a letter bomb --
1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1523.004,1530.295,Then how did he forget that?
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1530.295,1535.905,"He could have but as a matter of fact, he didn’t have such an item on him."
1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1555.18,1556.145,My point is --
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1556.145,1557.255,"Whatever it be, the weapons."
1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1557.255,1567.056,"But granting that he had the right to take the package out, a crumpled (Inaudible), why did he have to open it, that’s my only point?"
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1567.056,1568.644,I’ve suggested --
1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1568.644,1571.224,Other than to search for evidence?
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1571.224,1573.031,I’ve suggested several considerations.
1973.72-936,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1580.439,1583.152,Would he have given it back to him if there was nothing in it?
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1583.152,1598.533,"Yes he would have and if he couldn’t, he’d be subjected to all kinds of difficulties of a custodial obligations attaching to it and I’ve suggested that in the Peters case, the Court has suggested that that is a perfectly permissible practice."
1973.72-936,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1723.388,1729.082,"That last branch of your argument would -- is in effect asking us to overrule Weeks against United States, isn’t it?"
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1729.082,1730.776,"I would ask you to modify it, yes."
1973.72-936,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1731.604,1734.917,"Decided 1914, right?"
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1734.917,1746.367,"We -- if the Court reached that point, it would not be that that we will be asking for the total abolition of the exclusionary rule, but for a consideration of the extent of deviation from normal --"
1973.72-936,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1746.367,1750.737,"Yes, but Weeks established the exclusionary rule as such in the lower courts."
1973.72-936,0,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1750.737,1758.378,"And there's no question that every case including up to -- I think a recent example is Davis, indicates that the Court has never adopted such a rule, that’s quite true."
1973.72-936,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1767.834,1770.177,Mr. Gartlan.
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,1770.177,1775.461,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-936,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2059.179,2072.489,While you -- are you reading the Terry case type of search as a limitation defining the outer boundaries of the kind of a search which can be made after a lawful arrest?
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2072.489,2091.219,"I am reading it as an articulation of principles Mr. Chief Justice that apply to all intrusions and since a search incident to a lawful arrest is an intrusion, yes and I think that the language in Terry is rather explicit in that regard."
1973.72-936,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2091.219,2097.003,"Peters is, if I remember it correctly, tell me if I’m wrong, but the Peters case did involve a lawful arrest, did it not?"
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2097.462,2098.246,The Court found it (Voice Overlap) --
1973.72-936,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2098.246,2107.399,Court here found that there was probable cause to arrest and that -- in that search therefore was by definition incident to a lawful arrest.
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2107.399,2115.885,"That’s correct but they did -- this Court did take pains to know that Officer Lasky's search in Terry, even though incident to a lawful arrest --"
1973.72-936,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2115.885,2117.081,In Terry or in Peters?
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2117.081,2118.036,"I’m sorry, in Peters."
1973.72-936,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2118.036,2118.55,That’s what I thought.
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2118.55,2127.406,Was not thorough going and unrestrained and was limited to the purposes for which it could be made which justified it in its inception.
1973.72-936,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2190.628,2191.611,And if you’re relying on --
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2191.611,2194.619,"Was done implicitly in the Terry, Sibron, Peters --"
1973.72-936,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2194.619,2202.315,I gather -- I need make this argument without regard to what the offense was for which the petitioner was arrested -- responded to.
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2202.315,2202.521,Yes.
1973.72-936,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2208.348,2216.237,"In other words, it's not -- there's no significance here that the arrest was connected only with an alleged traffic offense?"
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2216.237,2217.433,Yes there is.
1973.72-936,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2221.401,2222.163,I know.
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2223.349,2224.717,The reasonableness of the search.
1973.72-936,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2224.717,2238.452,"Assuming that were -- you mean, it does -- the scope of the search, assuming a valid arrest maybe one thing if the arrest is for a minor traffic offense and something else if its for an armed robbery?"
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2238.452,2239.501,Yes sir.
1973.72-936,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2265.446,2269.535,"Like, you could search in a crumpled cigarette package?"
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2269.535,2270.41,Why could not?
1973.72-936,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2270.41,2274.675,You -- could you search in a crumpled cigarette package?
1973.72-936,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2274.675,2275.924,In the case of the armed robbery?
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2275.924,2276.753,Of armed robbery?
1973.72-936,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2276.753,2277.671,Yes.
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2277.671,2280.471,Yes.
1973.72-936,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2281.277,2295.667,"If you're relying on Terry, as you say to support the judgment of the Court of Appeals, that would be dicta I take it, since in Terry there was no lawful arrest?"
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2295.667,2301.5,As I -- I haven’t looked up recently the technical law dictionary definition of dicta.
1973.72-936,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2322.566,2323.072,"Well, one can teach --"
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2323.072,2323.774,Without limitations.
1973.72-936,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2323.774,2326.706,Well one can teach by dicta as well as by holding?
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2326.706,2333.226,That’s correct and I think that our Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia was not guilty of an aberration.
1973.72-936,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2335.434,2342.297,"And the Peters case is really an all force with your case, isn’t it, constitutionally because there, there was a valid arrest?"
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2342.297,2343.22,That's right.
1973.72-936,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2355.819,2357.644,"That was a prowler in the Bronx apartment, if I remember the case, was it not?"
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2357.644,2358.921,Yes sir.
1973.72-936,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2360.843,2365.384,"Yes, but the Court justified it as a weapon search in Peters?"
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2365.384,2377.961,"No, the court in Peters, Mr. Justice White said that the -- that deci -- that search be properly limited to its evidentiary and protective purposes."
1973.72-936,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2377.961,2378.792,And protective?
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2378.792,2380.894,Yes sir.
1973.72-936,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2380.894,2392.726,"Now so in the example awhile ago, you said that you might be able to search in a cigarette package in case of arrest for some purposes, but not further."
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2408.146,2413.057,Examine its contents incident to the arrest for the theft of the television set?
1973.72-936,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2415.523,2423.598,So it would -- really would depend in each case on what the arrest was for and what kind of evidence there might be of a particular kind of crime?
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2423.598,2425.665,I would not want to get that particularized.
1973.72-936,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2473.268,2488.681,"Well, let’s see, in dealing with our case, this Robinson case, your submission is that a search with an evidentiary purpose could not be permissible in the circumstance?"
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2488.681,2491.13,The government stipulates that in that case.
1973.72-936,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2491.13,2506.469,Now -- does that go as far to suggest that it was wrong even to go into Robinson’s pocket for the crumpled up cigarette package or is it wrong only to open the package?
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2506.469,2510.63,"I think in the light of the record in this case, it was wrong to go into that pocket."
1973.72-936,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2556.713,2560.198,"Well, may I ask this Mr. Gartlan, this is not your case."
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2580.851,2600.843,If I may ask the question Mr. Justice Brennan by coming really I think to what the heart of this case is as far as the reasonableness of the search -- of this search is the balancing job placed upon courts which this Court did when it articulated the scope limitation principles.
1973.72-936,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2663.554,2666.946,So your answer to me then is it wouldn’t make any difference to your case?
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2666.946,2667.451,That’s correct.
1973.72-936,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2667.451,2668.996,If it had been the box rather than (Voice Overlap).
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2668.996,2670.092,It would not.
1973.72-936,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2678.074,2691.218,"Mr. Gartlan, do you concede that a pat down always maybe made in a custodial arrest?"
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2691.218,2692.465,"Yes sir, I do."
1973.72-936,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2814.971,2825.224,"Well, if they teach all of policemen to do that, what’s the real difference then Mr. Gartlan between whether it’s a standing order or a standing practice?"
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2825.224,2854.134,"Because I think that if there were a -- I think this Mr. Chief Justice, the difference is that when he was explored -- when his testimony was explored on cross-examination, Sergeant Donaldson came out as a much more sanguine individual about the circumstances of an arrest than the instructions he gave would make him to a rookie policeman."
1973.72-936,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2885.647,2895.499,"Well, you're not questioning that a search is permitted incidental to a lawful arrest, are you?"
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2895.499,2896.494,No.
1973.72-936,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2897.276,2898.05,"You are -- well, do you --"
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2898.05,2898.883,We are saying --
1973.72-936,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2898.883,2901.886,You regard that as an exception to some rule.
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2904.538,2915.937,"Yes, as this Court has on a number of occasions framed the search incident to arrest as described and as an exception to the prohibition of the Fourth Amendment and I --"
1973.72-936,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2915.937,2925.384,"It’s a warrant -- it’s a warrantless arrest to be sure, but it's -- no question about its standing and it's being recognized, is there?"
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2925.384,2937.35,No there is not Mr. Chief Justice and what this case is all about is whether or not there should be some limitation on the scope of that search.
1973.72-936,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2937.35,2942.092,Chimel put a limitation upon the geographic scope of the -- of such a search?
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2942.092,2943.487,Exactly.
1973.72-936,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2943.487,2957.492,"Only, it only dealt with the geographic scope did it not really and your submission today is that there ought to be a limitation upon the scope of the intensity of the search within that geographic area?"
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,2957.492,2960.198,Exactly.
1973.72-936,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3287.377,3294.019,"Well, Mr. Gartlan, the Constitution doesn’t require Miranda warnings, how do you explain the Miranda decision?"
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,3294.019,3307.974,"The Miranda decision I explain Mr. Justice Rehnquist as a tool to ensure the voluntariness, an informed making of incriminatory -- incriminating statements before they are used against the defendant."
1973.72-936,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3324.988,3331.415,"Well, the Constitution doesn’t say that warrant shall issue for every search?"
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,3331.415,3331.591,That’s --
1973.72-936,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3331.591,3335.269,It says that warrants shall not issue except for probable cause?
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,3335.269,3343.083,"That’s correct, via magistrate, but it is all -- it is all inclusive with respect to that requirement, but the Fourth Amendment transcript --"
1973.72-936,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3343.083,3345.379,(Voice Overlap) says when the warrants have to issue?
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,3345.379,3345.732,Pardon?
1973.72-936,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3345.732,3351.222,It doesn’t say when warrants have to issue.
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,3351.222,3352.795,I didn’t mean to imply that it did.
1973.72-936,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3352.795,3354.031,I thought you said that it did?
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,3357.379,3360.287,Before a search can be made unless the search --
1973.72-936,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3360.287,3361.539,That isn't what the Constitution says?
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,3361.539,3362.126,Pardon?
1973.72-936,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3362.126,3363.87,That isn't what the Constitution says?
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,3363.87,3368.623,"The courts have carved out the exception to the Constitution, no doubt."
1973.72-936,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3431.387,3449.579,"If the arrest had been made here Mr. Gartlan explicitly for driving while under the influence of some intoxicating substance, wouldn’t all of your arguments be the same?"
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,3452.528,3456.963,I think that is a crime for which there maybe corroborating evidence.
1973.72-936,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3468.63,3472.312,"Or heroin, on marijuana, the same?"
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,3472.312,3485.021,"That’s correct, but while I’m not an expert in the matter, I think that the discernable odor of at least on the breath [Attempt to Laughter] of an arrestee in a drunk driving case is different."
1973.72-936,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3485.021,3494.85,"But here, the evidence -- there were some indication that there was no odor of liquor and therefore the officer was --"
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,3494.85,3495.446,In this case?
1973.72-936,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3495.446,3495.894,Yes.
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,3499.572,3516.63,"Mr. Justice -- Chief Justice Burger, the arrest was solely because Officer Jenks had checked the Metropolitan Police traffic records and knew that Robinson had had his permit lifted and had obtained a new one under false pretext and he stopped him after having ascertained that three or four days later."
1973.72-936,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3535.701,3540.361,"Mr. Gartlan, I am clear that you do concede the validity of the arrest?"
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,3540.361,3540.563,Yes.
1973.72-936,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3540.563,3542.793,"But -- yes, well, I thought --"
1973.72-936,1,30612,joseph_v_gartlan_jr,,3542.793,3553.039,This is part of the law and that you are sworn to up -- that you are sworn to uphold the rights that you have committed to defendant.
1973.72-936,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3553.039,3561.319,"Mr. Tuttle, do you have -- just two minutes left."
1973.72-936,2,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,3561.319,3564.876,I’ll try and cover a few very brief points.
1973.72-936,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3574.782,3579.262,"You have that same problem don’t you, is it Chimel -- [Laughter]"

1973.72-936,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3580.663,3584.616,"What we were told here one day, it was Chimel by by someone who said he knew Chimel.[Laughter]"
1973.72-936,2,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,3584.616,3587.331,Knew the individual? [Laughter]
1973.72-936,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3621.76,3626.399,"The Terry situation, you don’t put him beside you in a cruiser. That’s just a brief straight encounter."
1973.72-936,2,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,3626.399,3630.068,It contemplates with ticketing to do that Mr. Justice.
1973.72-936,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3634.666,3636.219,Oh I thought you meant to take him down to jail?
1973.72-936,2,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,3636.219,3636.919,"No, no."
1973.72-936,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3636.919,3637.162,No.
1973.72-936,2,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,3637.162,3638.286,And that’s what he was referring to.
1973.72-936,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3638.286,3640.087,I see.
1973.72-936,2,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,3640.087,3650.045,"Now, there is also the point about the concession that a search of a cigarette package would be permissible in the case of an armed robbery."
1973.72-936,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3687.303,3687.961,Thank you gentlemen.
