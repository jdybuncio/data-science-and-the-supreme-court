1979.79-121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,62.492,We'll hear arguments next in United States against Henry.
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,66.44,69.743,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.79-121,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,360.992,364.442,Do you think this is basically a question of fact or law?
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,364.442,367.414,Question of law as the case now stands.
1979.79-121,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,385.483,391.699,"Well, you don't mean in a technical sense that the Court of Appeals granted summary judgment against you, do you?"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,391.699,397.137,They granted relief without a hearing having been held on the facts.
1979.79-121,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,408.853,413.848,Has this Court ever held who has the burden of proof in a federal habeas action?
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,413.848,417.248,The habeas petitioner would have the burden of proof.
1979.79-121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,462.287,469.296,Do you think it -- the case turns on whether he was deliberately placed there or he got there?
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,469.296,471.658,We don't think the case turns on that.
1979.79-121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,484.785,490.631,"So we should decide the case on the assumption, among other things, that he was deliberately placed there?"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,490.631,492.431,"No, I don't think if (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,492.431,495.065,(Voice Overlap) made any difference so that make (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,495.065,495.28,We --
1979.79-121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,495.28,495.667,-- so we can (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,495.667,500.943,-- say that you could not sustain the decision of the Court of Appeals even if he were deliberately placed there.
1979.79-121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,500.943,502.616,Right.
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,502.616,505.823,"But I'm not sure that it would make no difference, it's a little hard for me."
1979.79-121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,505.823,506.717,I thought that's what you did?
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,506.717,514.304,We believe we should win even if he were deliberately placed there as long as there was not the kind of deliberate elicitation or interrogation that --
1979.79-121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,514.304,516.86,Well now Massiah didn't require interrogation?
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,516.86,521.681,"Well, I'd be happy to discuss that now if you like --"
1979.79-121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,521.681,522.678,Are you going direct yourself?
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,522.678,528.552,I certainly will direct myself to that.
1979.79-121,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,551.276,556.232,"Well, in that latter case if that's all he did and then informed the authorities to the statements that he (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,556.232,557.045,"No, I'm talking about state, (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-121,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,557.045,559.115,-- had made then he wouldn't been in government --
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,559.115,562.592,There would be no problem it would be the statements made thereafter.
1979.79-121,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,562.592,564.028,I understand.
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,564.028,567.153,There would be no issue as to statements already made.
1979.79-121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,628.891,635.304,"What would you say about placing a transmitter right in the cell, not a person but transmitter?"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,635.304,638.427,I would say that would not violate the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.
1979.79-121,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,649.488,661.388,"When you say a third party, do you draw a distinction between third party who is paid by the government and a third party who is just another convict so to speak?"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,661.388,668.952,"Well, that's -- I think it's clear that if he speaks to another convict, who was not a government agent there is no Massiah issue whatsoever."
1979.79-121,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,694.504,697.852,But there is no question this man was a government agent?
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,697.852,700.082,We don't question that this man was a government.
1979.79-121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,700.082,700.681,(Voice Overlap)
1979.79-121,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,700.681,702.887,And being paid?
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,702.887,707.11,"Well, we know that he was paid at some point for the information that he provided."
1979.79-121,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,707.11,711.591,"And he was paid for listening, but not asking questions?"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,711.591,713.203,That's what he was instructed to do.
1979.79-121,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,713.203,718.872,"And do I assume from that if he said he did ask questions, he wouldn't be paid?"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,718.872,723.03,I don't know.
1979.79-121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,723.03,729.46,"Well, if he didn't ask questions, he'd be like, he'd be in a passive role like the transmitter bug, wouldn't he?"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,729.46,730.654,That would be true.
1979.79-121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,730.851,733.895,But you said transmitter would be alright too?
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,733.895,755.753,"I think that there is no basis in any of these Court's decisions to suggest that the transmitter would violate the right to counsel and while the opinion of the Court of Appeals initially cast the issue in terms of monitoring the defendant's conversations, I don't think even its decision really can be read to hold that near overhearing violates the right to counsel."
1979.79-121,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,851.515,855.079,"Well, was that the holding, you think?"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,855.079,859.779,"No, holding is that the right to counsel was violated by what was tantamount to interrogation."
1979.79-121,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,859.779,860.571,"By interrogation, by interrogation."
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,860.571,861.423,"However, --"
1979.79-121,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,861.423,872.201,"But it didn't -- is there something -- is there any case, I guess if there were a case we wouldn't be here, saying that no violation if no interrogation?"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,872.201,879.844,There is no case of this Court saying that there's no violation in any circumstances that had been before this Court.
1979.79-121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,879.844,882.519,"There was no interrogation as such in Massiah itself, is there?"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,882.519,883.668,"Well, --"
1979.79-121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,883.668,887.242,It certainly wasn't in McLeod against Ohio.
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,887.242,892.734,There's nothing in McLeod to suggest that there was not interrogation.
1979.79-121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,930.728,936.153,"There was another summary reversal in which it was even clear that there was not interrogation, wasn't it?"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,936.153,939.05,"Well, I -- the Brady case is --"
1979.79-121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,939.05,939.981,"What's the name, Brady?"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,939.981,942.518,"Brady, yes."
1979.79-121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,954.422,958.257,"Well, it's a person who's been indicted, isn't it?"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,958.257,958.667,Yes.
1979.79-121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,958.917,961.612,(Voice Overlap) under indictment.
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,961.612,964.819,No question when I used the word “defendant” I am referring to somebody who was (Voice Overlap).
1979.79-121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,964.819,966.932,Not a suspect but somebody who was been indicted?
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,966.932,968.898,"That's correct, that's correct."
1979.79-121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,968.898,972.343,And just all goes back to the concurring opinions in Spano against New York?
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,972.343,974.196,Indeed it does.
1979.79-121,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,974.196,991.146,"And none of those opinions nor any other case from this Court has ever held that if defendant simply blurts out to the warden of the jail in which he is confined, I want to get this out of my chest, I want to tell you what happened, that that's inadmissible, isn't it?"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,991.146,992.707,They haven't and I'm almost certain that --
1979.79-121,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,992.707,997.719,Can you find anyway he blurted out to his minister either way?
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,997.719,997.903,To the minister --
1979.79-121,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,997.903,1000.804,This is paid government informant.
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1000.804,1001.297,That's true.
1979.79-121,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1001.297,1006.936,"And a paid government informant, do you recognize is different from a warden?"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1006.936,1010.066,"Well, a warden is also an agent of the government."
1979.79-121,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1010.066,1012.612,Is he a paid government informer?
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1012.612,1013.112,He's paid.
1979.79-121,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1014.139,1016.696,"Is he paid (Voice Overlap) government informer, do you?"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1016.696,1018.336,"Well, no not in colloquial sense."
1979.79-121,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1018.336,1019.457,You don't?
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1019.457,1025.547,"No, I'm saying that the warden is not a (Voice Overlap) or a --"
1979.79-121,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1025.547,1028.729,He's legal stoolie.
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1028.729,1040.394,"Well, let me come back to make the point that I slightly lost touch with here about what Brewer does hold in response to Justice White's question."
1979.79-121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1088.236,1101.222,Is the statement of the defendant that the conversation was in reality a form of interrogation disputed categorically anywhere or other than (Voice Overlap)?
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1101.222,1102.506,The statement in this case?
1979.79-121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1102.506,1103.348,Yes.
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1103.348,1104.208,"Well, I --"
1979.79-121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1104.208,1135.292,"No, I'm referring to the concurring opinion of Judge Butzner who says nevertheless absent testimony by the informant where he suggested that there should have been a hearing by the district judge on this issue, absent testimony by the informant about what he said to the defendant, the judgment must be reversed because of the informant's admission that he had conversed with the defendant and because of the defendant's assertion that the conversation was a form of questioning --"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1135.292,1135.423,"Well, --"
1979.79-121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1135.423,1137.038,"-- now, is that disputed?"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1137.038,1137.382,I have this --
1979.79-121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1137.382,1140.295,Does the informant dispute to that at any point?
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1140.295,1142.698,"Well, I think we do dispute --"
1979.79-121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1142.698,1145.208,"Well, (Voice Overlap) but the informant, did he?"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1145.208,1150.213,"Well, informant -- we don't have an affidavit from the informant in the record in this case."
1979.79-121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1217.053,1221.048,"And that's what generally follows an indictment, isn't it?"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1221.048,1222.069,"Yes, those are things that follow indictment."
1979.79-121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1222.069,1224.094,In our system of the administration --
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1224.094,1224.207,Yes.
1979.79-121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1224.207,1233.975,"-- of the criminal law when a person is indicted is followed by formal judicial proceedings in an open courtroom, there are all sorts of constitutional rights to counsel, to confrontation (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1233.975,1235.042,That's true.
1979.79-121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1235.042,1238.398,(Voice Overlap) -- it's open to the public and it's presided over by judge.
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1238.398,1250.412,"Well, if I can -- I agree with that completely and in those cases, the need for counsel is obvious when we are talking about those proceedings."
1979.79-121,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1250.412,1253.304,"The courtroom isn't always open to the public of course, is it?"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1253.304,1254.204,"Well, I'd rather not get involved."
1979.79-121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1276.675,1278.903,"Well, have you read the final paragraph in the Spano case --"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1278.903,1279.89,I'm coming to that.
1979.79-121,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1400.248,1402.214,"Well, was he drawn out or not?"

1979.79-121,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1404.375,1406.046,What if he was?
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1406.046,1406.668,Excuse me.
1979.79-121,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1406.668,1409.97,"What if he was drawn out, was that interrogation or --"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1409.97,1412.858,"Well, I think we would have to know more."
1979.79-121,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1427.707,1446.777,"There have been questions used and certainly low languages drawn out elicited, interrogated, do you conceive those to be just use in their ordinary dictionary sense of the word or do you conceive them to be words of our representing various places along the spectrum that you described?"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1446.777,1464.382,"Well, I'm frankly somewhat at a loss because the sources in terms of this Court's decisions to draw on a relatively limit in terms of an explication of what the concept of deliberately elicited means."
1979.79-121,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1466.084,1467.949,That was the word in Massiah I gather?
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1467.949,1470.416,That was the expression in Massiah deliberately elicited.
1979.79-121,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1470.416,1472.916,And Brewer was interrogated?
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1472.916,1476.485,"Yes, although I think there is a reference to deliberately elicited as well."
1979.79-121,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1476.485,1478.75,"Well, that was a quote from Massiah."
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1478.75,1482.648,"Well, there are several places where the topic is touched upon but --"
1979.79-121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1482.648,1506.978,"Can you tell us that the facts in the Massiah case can be gleaned from the record in the District Court or the Court of Appeal or perhaps in the trial court but the so far as a review in the opinion of this Court the facts in the Massiah case were no more nor less than a conversation between Massiah and his supposed friend, weren't they?"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1506.978,1507.888,"Well, except that the --"

1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1510.41,1515.988,"Well, the opinion says that -- I will see if I can find the place."
1979.79-121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1523.353,1532.126,"No, I'm -- yes, but I'm talking about the so far as the facts are viewed in the Massiah case by the -- by this Court, there wasn't much review of them, was there?"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1532.126,1532.692,There was not much.
1979.79-121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1532.692,1551.187,It was given that Massiah had been indicted and that his supposed friend was in fact a government agent and if the government agent deliberately elicited or acquired information from Massiah sitting on the front seat of that car in New York (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1551.187,1556.046,"(Voice Overlap) deliberately elicit, it didn't say deliberately was elicited or acquired, it said deliberately elicited."
1979.79-121,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1556.046,1558.015,"Well, what -- and what's -- well --"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1558.015,1566.725,"Well, I mean in my view, I confess that I have some difficulty in evaluating it."
1979.79-121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1597.067,1607.955,"Jail house banter, isn't it a little bit different when one of the bantering parties has a contingent prearrangement with the government that if the bantering elicits information he gets paid if it doesn't he does not get paid."
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1607.955,1615.647,It is different only in the sense that there would be no issue at all about the admissibility of the statements if he were not a government agent.
1979.79-121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1615.647,1619.97,It is clear that the informer -- informant had a motive to elicited information.
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1619.97,1620.197,It's clear --
1979.79-121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1620.197,1624.534,And if he in fact received information and in fact was paid for it.
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1627.098,1629.196,"Well, I think our position is there is nothing --"
1979.79-121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1629.196,1639.031,"It's hard to draw constitutional line on just suggesting, giving a lot of conversation that will sooner or later draw out the statement in square questioning."
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1639.031,1654.281,"Well, the difficulty is that the alternative it seems to me is to push these principles to their logical extreme because of the difficulty of drawing a line and to end up with the situation where you simply can't overhear the defendant."
1979.79-121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1654.659,1659.901,It's easy to draw a line between somebody who was not had contact with the government before and didn't have a motive to do --
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1659.901,1667.569,"Well, I understand but the government does have to stop investigating a crime because the defendant has been indicted."
1979.79-121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1667.569,1671.737,"Well, but it has to stop taking him off by himself and asking questions at least that much --"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1671.737,1672.681,"Well, but that's (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1672.681,1674.041,-- (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1674.041,1676.102,-- and that is what Massiah and Brewer held.
1979.79-121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1683.568,1690.101,"Generally, (Voice Overlap) have a man under indictment within custody unless you pretty -- your case pretty well made, would you?"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1690.101,1699.697,"Well, that is not -- well, usually by the time of indictment although often there are cases where more evidence would be very helpful at getting an accurate outcome of the trial."
1979.79-121,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1766.799,1773.247,This is a jail bird and a stoolie pigeon and you talk about scrupulous?
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1773.809,1779.231,"Yes, it seems to me that the agent certainly was acting scrupulously."
1979.79-121,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1779.519,1782.65,I know but this man did if he testify?
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1782.65,1784.41,"Well, we're talking about excluding --"
1979.79-121,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1784.41,1789.083,Is it true that if he admitted the question he wouldn't get paid?
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1789.083,1790.419,I can't say that.
1979.79-121,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1790.797,1794.491,"Well, wasn't he told not to question and he would be paid?"
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1794.491,1795.836,He was told not to question him.
1979.79-121,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1796.94,1798.334,And he was paid.
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1798.334,1799.257,Yes?
1979.79-121,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1799.257,1800.612,And he was paid?
1979.79-121,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1800.612,1803.471,And we that don't know that he questioned him.
1979.79-121,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1813.336,1815.412,Mr. Gletner.
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,1815.412,1818.61,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.79-121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1976.138,1990.069,"Mr. Geltner, let me ask you one question referring to a statement you made a couple moments ago that as to whether the Court of Appeals should've remanded for another hearing after the District Court treated them the first remand the way it did."
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,1997.662,1999.327,"No, quite the contrary Your Honor."
1979.79-121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2011.492,2019.534,"Well, it assumed then all resolved doubts in favor of the government and nonetheless set the conviction aside."
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2019.534,2030.042,"Yes Your Honor, precisely and a point of my summary of the record now is to establish that he record is quite adequate to support that conclusion."
1979.79-121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2278.705,2289.561,"Mr. Geltner, I understand there's no question about what Henry had been indicted, but you say he'd been arraigned and counsel had been appointed?"
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2289.561,2293.941,He was arraigned and counsel was appointed on 27th of November.
1979.79-121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2293.941,2295.427,That appears somewhere here?
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2295.427,2305.837,That appears -- it appears in the record on Page 1 of the joint appendix.
1979.79-121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2324.195,2325.288,Was the appendix an error?
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2325.288,2326.376,The appendix is an error.
1979.79-121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2362.447,2368.187,"And then when did Nichols conversations take place, sometime between the 15th (Voice Overlap)?"
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2368.187,2371.237,The Nichols' conversations with Henry --
1979.79-121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2371.237,2371.427,Yes.
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2371.427,2377.632,-- in the jail cell occurred sometime between the 21st of November --
1979.79-121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2377.632,2378.196,Yes.
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2378.196,2382.191,-- and the Sixth of December.
1979.79-121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2382.191,2382.773,So that --
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2382.773,2385.549,All of which all post indictment --
1979.79-121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2385.549,2387.665,All post indictments (Voice Overlap)?
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2387.665,2401.284,That much is clear as I'm sure Your Honor is aware the case is interpreting -- the cases in this Court interpreting Massiah some of them involved counsel plus indictment some of them involved simple indictment.
1979.79-121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2401.284,2408.015,"The Massiah and Brewer invited -- involved the counsel, indictment plus counsel."
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2408.015,2411.604,Massiah and Brewer both involved counsel plus indictment.
1979.79-121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2411.604,2412.002,Indictment?
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2412.002,2412.743,(Voice Overlap) in McCloud --
1979.79-121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2412.743,2414.808,(Voice Overlap) indictment or charge or some kind?
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2414.808,2417.194,Yes in Brewer involve the --
1979.79-121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2417.194,2417.59,Counsel of the Massiah (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2417.59,2425.064,-- formal charge is not yet -- not indictment yet but there have been a counsel in the case formal charges had been filed.
1979.79-121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2432.53,2432.912,You know what they know --
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2432.912,2435.547,That's likewise true in the Brady case.
1979.79-121,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2435.547,2439.291,"Brady, from in what jurisdiction was Brady?"
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2439.291,2442.057,Brady was a Fifth Circuit decision.
1979.79-121,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2442.057,2455.712,"Mr. Geltner, do you have any comment about the Hoffa and then Hearst cases, the latter you don't cite, the formal one you do only and describing the dissenting opinion below?"
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2455.712,2456.801,Yes Your Honor.
1979.79-121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2586.998,2587.627,Mr. Geltner --
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2587.627,2589.997,-- that's sufficient to distinguish from this case.
1979.79-121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2589.997,2596.947,Where do you draw the line in this spectrum that Mr. Frey has referred to?
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2608.57,2609.35,No Your Honor.
1979.79-121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2620.529,2630.768,"So, a totally voluntary confession in effect to someone in the employ of the Government does not violate Massiah?"
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2630.768,2634.142,Unconnected with the case?
1979.79-121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2634.142,2639.226,"Well, unconnected with the case, I don't know exactly the --"
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2639.226,2647.462,In your example Your Honor if the warden is waiting in his office and Mr. Henry goes up and says “I'd like to confess today.”
1979.79-121,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2667.183,2686.487,"Well, what if a cellmate who isn't a Government agent at the time interrogates or finds out then as it turns out his quite willing to testify for the Government because he knows that people who knew get a break but he was never put there for that purpose?"
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2686.487,2695.176,I think I have to agree with Mr. Frey on that Your Honor that that is not a violation of the Massiah right because that is not the Government obtaining information (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-121,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2695.176,2695.999,"Well, --"
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2695.999,2697.294,-- from the accused (Voice Overlap) -- after that --
1979.79-121,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2697.294,2707.863,"-- perhaps, to be the policy of this prison and this warden and this Government that people who -- people who do as a favor and get down a favor."
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2707.863,2708.793,The word is put at?
1979.79-121,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2709.813,2715.659,"Well, the word is just seeps through the wall."
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2715.659,2723.094,I think I have to still agree with Mr. Frey that that's not this case and that is not a Government agent.
1979.79-121,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2729.109,2746.972,"Then I suppose if the Government agent who is put in the cell if he was a mute he couldn't speak, okay, he could just listen, I suppose you're be still making your argument because he was put there to elicit."
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2746.972,2748.497,"Put there to obtain information, (Voice Overlap) -- that's right."
1979.79-121,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2748.497,2752.99,And it wouldn't make any different believes whether he said a word or interrogated anybody or not.
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2752.99,2753.94,"Precisely, Your Honor."
1979.79-121,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2753.94,2759.567,He'd be the passive of a person like the passive electronic about you (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2759.567,2760.205,Yes sir.
1979.79-121,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2761.56,2779.081,"Except one when a man is on bail, he's indicted, he has counsel his out on bail and the prosecutor that gets all one of this guidance that he hangs out of the bar down the 8th street, you go up there and see if he is bragging --"
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2779.081,2780.497,Same case Your Honor.
1979.79-121,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2783.119,2783.329,What?
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2783.329,2785.079,-- the right to counsel.
1979.79-121,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2785.079,2787.918,You mean if he was in the public bar bragging?
1979.79-121,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2787.918,2788.869,Yes.
1979.79-121,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2788.869,2792.066,"And the agent happened to hear him, he can't talk about?"
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2792.066,2794.21,If the agent went there for that purpose yes Your Honor.
1979.79-121,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2796.504,2806.552,But suppose he goes up and he brags and the FBI agent is there getting a drink too but he didn't go there for that purpose?
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2806.552,2808.723,I think that's the warden in Justice Rehnquist's example --
1979.79-121,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2808.723,2810.621,You think just the warden (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2810.621,2820.668,"That's a very factual inquiry, isn't it as to the intent with which the government employee approaches the defendant?"
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2820.668,2823.662,That's why I'm summarizing the facts Your Honor.
1979.79-121,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2842.696,2854.054,"So, suppose we disagree with you on your submission that just passive listening by the agent would've -- would violate the right to counsel, do you lose this case?"
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2854.054,2855.055,Of course not Your Honor.
1979.79-121,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2855.114,2855.188,(Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2855.188,2856.855,That's precisely where I was going --
1979.79-121,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2856.855,2857.429,Yes.
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2857.429,2859.855,-- with my recitation of the record.
1979.79-121,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2867.068,2873.225,"What do you think, what do you think the Court of Appeals answer it to my question would be?"
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2873.225,2875.109,Precisely the same as mine.
1979.79-121,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2878.026,2885.912,"So, do you think this -- so you think they said there's a violation here because passive listening would violate the right to counsel?"
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2885.912,2888.047,"Well, then --"
1979.79-121,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2888.047,2892.711,"If they said that, I'm not sure they went on and answered the question that you brought to answer."
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2892.711,2909.891,"Well, Judge Winter's opinion which is the majority opinion that which Mr. Butzner's occurred with says, “If by association by general conversation or both Henry developed sufficient confidence in Nichols' that Henry bared his incriminating secrets, we have a violation and then --"
1979.79-121,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2909.891,2914.978,And that's agreeing with you that passive listening is enough by an agent?
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2914.978,2917.828,It is either or Judge Winters' opinion is --
1979.79-121,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2917.828,2918.354,Yes.
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2918.354,2919.778,-- is either or.
1979.79-121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2934.391,2936.43,Yet he concurred in Judge Winter's opinion?
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2936.43,2937.274,He did sir.
1979.79-121,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2937.274,2945.869,"Do you think his limitation is narrow, the thrust of the Court's opinion?"
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2945.869,2948.653,"The Fourth Circuit's opinion, I think they do."
1979.79-121,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2948.788,2954.513,Which he's indicating he agrees with the limitations expressed in his concurring opinion?
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,2954.513,2963.106,I think that's a fair reading and as I was indicating I think that they read the record well and fairly.
1979.79-121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2981.082,3014.552,"But in -- Mr. Geltner, you say that the record would've supported a narrower opinion in effect than in the Court of Appeals' wrote I take it because on Page 7 (a) of the petition the language you have been referring Judge Winter's opinion, he says, “Even if we assumed that Nichols obeyed his instructions and not to interrogate Henry about the bank robbery, he did testify he engaged in conversation so that they certainly don't go much beyond purely passive listening to find a violation that Massiah did."
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3014.552,3028.051,I think that's correct and I think particularly Judge Winter's opinion which uses an either or if by association by general conversation or both which I think is either or.
1979.79-121,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3058.435,3058.924,And you draw the line (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3058.924,3061.783,-- (Voice Overlap) happened to this case or -- excuse me Your Honor?
1979.79-121,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3061.783,3062.503,Go ahead.
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3062.503,3066.006,"Unless, there has been a suitable waiver or unless counsel's present."
1979.79-121,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3066.006,3073.776,And you draw the line on whether this is pursuant to arrangements made in advance as distinguished from something that develops after the event?
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3073.776,3074.523,Yes I do Your Honor.
1979.79-121,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3074.523,3090.176,"In other words, if the arrangements are made in advance then the listening post to this an agent if they're not made in advance then he is just an ordinary informant like any other witness for the prosecution?"
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3090.176,3091.538,Yes sir.
1979.79-121,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3091.538,3107.139,"Mr. Geltner, let's assume the Congress passed the statute requiring that listening device is be placed in the cells of all federal prisons and operated 24 hours a day, would you think that would be a valid?"
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3107.139,3111.06,I think we would have terrific Fourth Amendment problem but your question (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-121,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3111.06,3111.482,(Voice Overlap) What if I need them in the problem?
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3111.482,3113.979,-- you need to address to the Six Amendment question.
1979.79-121,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3113.979,3114.758,Yes.
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3114.758,3117.183,And I think that's Hearst.
1979.79-121,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3143.145,3159.264,"I take it your position would be no different if the agent in this case, the cellmate had said to him by the way whether you ignored or not I'm a government agent."
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3159.264,3168.491,Then I think we've got something more like Brewer than we have here that is we have the possibility of waiver.
1979.79-121,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3179.319,3199.944,"But if the -- if all the agent there, if all the cellmate ever said is, “By the way government has asked me to report very thing (Inaudible) and asked me to report and I promise report everything ever say” and that then he just shuts up he never says another word and the other fellow sooner or later tells him something that's incriminating."
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3199.944,3201.667,We might have a waiver?
1979.79-121,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3201.667,3202.262,Might have (Voice Overlap) a waiver --
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3202.262,3203.383,We might have a waiver?
1979.79-121,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3203.383,3206.318,But except for that would be the same.
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3208.067,3210.987,"Yes, yes."
1979.79-121,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3239.441,3242.732,"Now, you're really going to try to win the case now?"
1979.79-121,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3245.224,3245.742,(Inaudible) my question --
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3245.742,3247.359,I thought that's what I was here for.
1979.79-121,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3247.359,3257.926,Do you go so far after indictment that if counsel is appointed any information obtained by any government agent cannot be (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3257.926,3258.229,Any government any --
1979.79-121,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3258.229,3259.924,-- under any circumstances?
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3259.924,3265.612,Any information obtained by a government agent who seeks to obtain information for use --
1979.79-121,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3265.612,3266.031,(Voice Overlap)
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3266.031,3267.428,-- in a pending trial.
1979.79-121,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3267.428,3271.343,"I don't mean seeks, this guy is just standing there."
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3271.343,3272.526,Why did he go there?
1979.79-121,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3272.917,3273.326,(Voice Overlap)
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3273.326,3274.538,-- to obtain information --
1979.79-121,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3274.538,3278.776,"I said the FBI agent went there to get a drink, that's what I said in my hypothetical (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3278.776,3280.315,In your bar room hypothetical?
1979.79-121,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3280.315,3280.406,Yes --
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3280.406,3288.861,If the FBI agent went there to get a drink and it just happened that Mr. Henry came along and made incriminatory statements?
1979.79-121,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3288.861,3289.493,Yes.
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3289.493,3292.71,In my position is that is not a violation or the right to counsel.
1979.79-121,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3294.906,3296.59,I thought you said you did --
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3296.59,3299.704,I'm sorry Your Honor I'd must have confused you with my answer.
1979.79-121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3354.033,3368.794,"Well, have you overseen transcripts of your own examination witnesses and realize that colloquial expressions are frequently used in what eliciting testimony at trials?"
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3368.794,3378.3,I think Your Honor we must assume that Mr. (Inaudible) prepared his witness and that he knew what the witnesses' story was and he wanted to get to the jury accurately.
1979.79-121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3404.101,3414.098,"So, the case turns on the use of the word “tell” as opposed to overhear by the prosecutor in examining a witness on direct?"
1979.79-121,1,35891,michael_e_geltner,,3414.098,3432.379,The case does not completely turn on that but if the Court cares -- if it is crucial to the Court's decision as to whether or not this was overhearing as oppose to some efforts to draw the defendant act out it seems to me that the record supports that conclusion.
1979.79-121,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3475.942,3477.241,Mr. Frey.
1979.79-121,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3477.241,3479.909,There's just a couple of points.
1979.79-121,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3545.443,3547.488,I think we have your point Mr. Frey.
1979.79-121,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3547.488,3548.704,Okay.
1979.79-121,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3548.704,3561.885,Thank you gentlemen the case is submitted.
