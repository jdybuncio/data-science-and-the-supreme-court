2014.14-7955,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.8,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14-7955, Glossip v. Gross. Ms. Konrad."
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,8.8,25.25,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Oklahoma chooses to execute our clients with a three-drug formula that includes a paralytic and potassium chloride, drugs that cause intense pain and suffering."
2014.14-7955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,46.24,59.66,"Why is that a matter of law? I mean, as I see it, it's just -- just a fact question, and -- and the district court found that it -- it did eliminate the pain."
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,69.005,73.765,"Justice Scalia, the -- there's a question of law and there's a question of fact."
2014.14-7955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,73.765,74.9,What's the question of law?
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,74.9,93.51,"The question of law includes the -- the fact that the district court found that this three-drug formula was constitutionally tolerable in spite of two facts, the first one being that there is a medical consensus that this drug cannot be used as the sole drug --"
2014.14-7955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,93.51,95.77,It's a question of fact. That's a question of fact.
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,95.77,95.93,That --
2014.14-7955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,95.93,101.55,You're saying the question of law is that the -- the district court ignored two facts.
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,106.44,122.045,"The -- if -- if I can, Justice Scalia, the second point is the question of law also involves that the district court found that this drug creates a greater risk of harm than sodium thiopental, but that it could not quantify."
2014.14-7955,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,138.47,144.165,Could you -- the way I've thought of this -- and I know that in your brief you think de novo review goes to everything.
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,158.295,159.32,The midazolam.
2014.14-7955,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,159.32,174.41,"Midazolam, but that it's a legal question of whether how that drug works creates a risk of harm that's constitutionally intolerable."
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,177.735,179.53,"Yes, Justice Sotomayor, and --"
2014.14-7955,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,179.53,195.275,"So the facts are now. Now let's go to my real question, okay? That a judge ignores evidence is not necessarily an abuse of discretion or a clear error."
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,204.11,209.27,"So the clear errors in this case, we have to look at what this case is about."
2014.14-7955,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,242.32,252.76,"Well, but what the district court determined is that it was -- was not able to tell precisely when the ceiling effect kicked in, precisely when they hit the ceiling, right?"
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,252.76,253.295,That is --
2014.14-7955,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,253.295,258.99,"And that -- that is your theory for when pain is possible, when it hits the ceiling, right?"
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,258.99,285.09,"What the district court found, Mr. Chief Justice, is whatever the ceiling effect may be, it takes effect only at the spinal cord and that 500 milligrams of midazolam will, quote, ""create a phenomenon which is not anesthesia,"" but effectively paralyzes the brain and eliminates awareness of pain. Now, that finding, we have to -- we have to look at what undisputed facts were before the court in making that finding to --"
2014.14-7955,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,285.09,294.02,"Well, is it undisputed facts? I thought you had the burden of showing that the determinations were clearly erroneous. So it's certainly not a case where the facts have to be undisputed."
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,294.02,297.125,"And I'm sorry if I misspoke, Mr. Chief Justice."
2014.14-7955,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,307.685,316.905,Do you even have to go that far? The State here doesn't even propose that their doctor was right on this point.
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,316.905,317.52,"Well, that --"
2014.14-7955,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,317.52,322.11,"They're not defending it, they don't say it's true."
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,335.235,336.82,"That is correct, Justice Sotomayor."
2014.14-7955,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,336.82,343.585,So it's clear error. Now we've got an admission that the expert was plainly wrong.
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,352.635,353.79,That is correct.
2014.14-7955,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,382.01,418.11,"Ms. Konrad, can I make sure I understand this because, you know, I read that -- the part of the opinion that you're referring to and I just really couldn't figure it out. So is it that the court said, well, we don't know what the ceiling effect is generally, but the ceiling effect only goes to how something operates at the spinal cord level, it doesn't go to how it operates at the brain and this -- and -- this -- this takes -- what we -- what we care about is how it operates at the brain, so we don't even have to worry about ceiling effect; is that right?"
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,418.11,418.275,That's --
2014.14-7955,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,418.275,418.53,Is that --
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,418.53,418.97,That is --
2014.14-7955,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,418.97,420.52,Is that what the court said?
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,420.52,444.325,"Justice Kagan, that is what the district court found based on the testimony of the State's experts that's not supported by any scientific literature, any -- any medical information and, in fact, is inconsistent with the State's expert's own testimony. Because he testified and explained that the way this drug works is it works throughout the central nervous system."
2014.14-7955,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,445.15,447.93,So you're saying we do have to worry about the ceiling effect.
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,466.39,466.48,That --
2014.14-7955,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,466.48,467.45,Is that how it goes?
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,467.45,468.61,"Yes, Justice Kagan."
2014.14-7955,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,468.83,473.875,Did you introduce any evidence to show the dosage at which the ceiling effect would occur?
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,473.875,481.44,"We had testimony from our expert who -- who indicated that it could be calculated, but it was not calculated."
2014.14-7955,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,490.23,494.164,"Well, what if the ceiling effect is 1,000 milligrams?"
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,494.164,498.1,There is no evidence in the record to support that.
2014.14-7955,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,498.37,498.54,No.
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,503.15,505.29,It doesn't matter.
2014.14-7955,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,505.89,506.39,Of course it matters.
2014.14-7955,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,506.39,517.655,"Well, the one proof we do have is the Wood execution, not the one that was botched, but Mr. Wood was given 750 milligrams, correct?"
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,517.655,518.83,"Yes, Justice Sotomayor."
2014.14-7955,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,518.83,526.87,And he laid writhing in pain for 20 minutes? 25 minutes? I don't remember how long.
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,526.87,528.455,Mr. Wood was 2 hours.
2014.14-7955,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,528.455,544.565,"I'm sorry, 2 hours. Now, there's been some defense that the 750 wasn't immediately delivered, but it was still 750 that went into his system and caused that kind of pain, correct?"
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,544.565,545.0,Yes.
2014.14-7955,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,555.4,559.555,"Well, how many executions have been carried out using this drug?"
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,559.555,561.29,Using midazolam?
2014.14-7955,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,561.29,561.565,Yes.
2014.14-7955,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,561.565,562.58,Okay.
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,565.06,584.73,"No, we're actually talking of several executions that -- the execution in this case, in Oklahoma, that happened a year ago of Mr. Lockett demonstrates why midazolam is not a proper drug that can do what the State intends it to do and put a prisoner in a deep coma-like unconscious."
2014.14-7955,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,584.73,590.53,"I thought there were issues of the administration of the drug, you know, the -- the nature of the veins and so forth."
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,594.575,596.23,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
2014.14-7955,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,596.23,605.98,"No? I'm sorry. ""No"" what? That was not that or -- were -- were there issues about -- I thought there were issues involving the veins and the ability to make an intravenous connection?"
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,605.98,622.83,"There were problems with the catheter, but -- but Mr. Lockett received enough midazolam such that he was unconscious and the doctor -- the physician executioner found that he was unconscious and then he regained consciousness."
2014.14-7955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,625.88,629.23,Not if he didn't -- not if he didn't receive the proper dosage.
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,635.075,635.45,He --
2014.14-7955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,635.45,637.02,I don't -- I don't see how that follows.
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,645.37,659.05,"What we know about this drug, Justice Scalia, is that it can never maintain the deep coma-like unconsciousness that is necessary to prevent a prisoner from feeling the painful effects of the -- I'm sorry, of the potassium chloride."
2014.14-7955,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,659.05,662.03,How do we know that? I thought that what we knew was something different.
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,686.065,703.61,"Justice Kagan, we know because of the pharmacological properties of this drug, the way that -- that when the drug was being tested and being introduced, it is not used for the sole purpose of preventing somebody from feeling pain during a painful procedure."
2014.14-7955,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,703.61,715.89,"Well, I thought it wasn't used for that purpose just because we don't know whether it's capable of being used for that purpose, as opposed to we know it's incapable of being used for that purpose, if you see the difference."
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,715.89,733.16,"I do see the difference, but I think what's important here is this Court in Baze explained that it's important to reemphasize that a proper dose of sodium thiopental obviates the concern that the prisoner will not be sufficiently sedated. That was the key aspect of Baze."
2014.14-7955,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,733.31,740.33,And why is Oklahoma not using sodium thiopental? Why is it not using that drug?
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,740.33,744.59,"It isn't using it -- you'll -- you could ask my friend here, but --"
2014.14-7955,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,744.59,745.57,You don't know?
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,745.57,750.0,The -- the finding here is that it was unavailable at that time of the hearing.
2014.14-7955,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,750.0,750.51,Yes.
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,830.17,850.14,"Well, Justice Alito, the purpose of the courts is to decide whether a method of execution or the way that the State is going to carry out an execution is, in fact, constitutional, and it -- whether we're going to tolerate -- is it objectively intolerable to allow the States to carry out a method in this way."
2014.14-7955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,850.725,865.16,And I guess -- I guess I would be more inclined to find that it was intolerable if there was even some doubt about this drug when there was a perfectly safe other drug available.
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,902.835,925.7,"Justice Scalia, I don't think that it's relevant to the decision as to what's available because what this Court needs to look at is whether the drug that the State is intending to use to cause what they say is a -- put the prisoner in a -- in a place where he will not feel pain, that that drug is good enough."
2014.14-7955,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,926.68,927.23,"Counselor, I --"
2014.14-7955,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,927.23,948.545,Is any State -- is any State using a lethal injection protocol without this questionable drug? We know that two are not available. Is there another combination that has been used by States that doesn't involve this questionable drug?
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,948.545,950.16,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2014.14-7955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,955.98,956.55,But is that --
2014.14-7955,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,956.55,960.8,That doesn't answer Justice Scalia's and Justice Alito's question.
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,977.13,986.13,"Justice Kennedy, the fact that the State chooses a certain method should not -- should not have bearing on whether that method is constitutional."
2014.14-7955,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,986.13,986.85,"Counsel, if there is no --"
2014.14-7955,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,986.85,989.085,I -- I would like an answer to the question.
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,994.515,995.635,No.
2014.14-7955,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,998.78,1001.285,There are other ways to kill people regrettably.
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,1001.285,1002.27,"There are, Justice Sotomayor."
2014.14-7955,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1002.27,1003.12,That are painless.
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,1012.785,1013.98,"That is correct, Justice Sotomayor."
2014.14-7955,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1013.98,1022.465,"I know that you'll get up and argue that those other ways are -- are not constitutional either potentially, but people do that with every protocol."
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,1070.05,1072.7,"I would agree, Justice Sotomayor, that --"
2014.14-7955,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1072.7,1076.435,Doesn't -- doesn't a firing squad cause pain?
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,1076.435,1089.61,"Justice Ginsburg, we don't know -- we don't know how, if the State chose to carry out an execution by firing squad, whether, in fact, it would cause -- rise to the level of unconstitutional pain and suffering under the Eighth Amendment."
2014.14-7955,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1089.61,1089.96,"Well, you don't know."
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,1102.88,1102.98,Yes.
2014.14-7955,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1102.98,1109.35,"And -- and you're not suggesting that those other methods are preferable to the method in this case, are you?"
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,1109.35,1123.45,"I'm not suggesting that, Mr. Chief Justice, but the reason why States moved to more humane methods is, as we learn more, and as we learn more about science, and develop, then, as a society, we move forward."
2014.14-7955,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1124.8,1146.795,"But you have no suggestion as what -- to what would be an acceptable alternative to what you propose right now for Oklahoma. Do you have any -- I mean, the case comes to us in a posture where it's recognized that your client is guilty of a capital offense, it's recognized that your client is eligible for the death penalty, that that has been duly imposed."
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,1153.515,1154.59,I would --
2014.14-7955,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1154.59,1158.315,And you have no suggested alternative that is more humane.
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,1158.315,1164.025,I would actually disagree with the characterization that it's -- that he can't be executed.
2014.14-7955,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1171.53,1173.335,What does the new statute provide?
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,1173.335,1183.41,"The new statute provides that if the lethal injection protocol is found unconstitutional, or drugs are unavailable, then they can go to other methods."
2014.14-7955,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1183.41,1184.5,What other method?
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,1184.5,1187.85,"They go to nitrogen gas, and then go to --"
2014.14-7955,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1187.85,1190.5,And are you suggesting that that's okay with you?
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,1190.5,1193.88,I'm not -- I don't know anything about that protocol.
2014.14-7955,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1194.71,1202.62,"Well, what do you think? Do you have an instinct about whether or not the gas chamber is preferable to this lethal injection or not?"
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,1202.62,1212.08,"Mr. Chief Justice, it's hard for me in the abstract to say whether it's preferable. The -- the legislature has said that this could be a painless method."
2014.14-7955,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1215.6,1216.06,Suppose it were true --
2014.14-7955,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1216.06,1233.69,"If I understand the facts here, your client was already in jail with a life sentence, right, for murder? And while in jail on that life sentence, he stabbed and killed a prison guard, and that's the crime for which Oklahoma is seeking to execute him."
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,1236.09,1238.67,"One of the Petitioners here before the Court, but --"
2014.14-7955,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1238.67,1265.67,"Perhaps there is that larger question, that if, in fact, for whatever set of reasons, it's not you, you didn't purposely hide these other kinds of drugs, if there is no method of executing a person that does not cause unacceptable pain, that, in addition to other things, might show that the death penalty is not consistent with the Eighth Amendment."
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,1268.865,1272.77,"That -- that perhaps could be true, Justice Breyer, but the narrow issue --"
2014.14-7955,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1272.77,1273.905,And is that -- is that your argument?
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,1273.905,1274.34,No.
2014.14-7955,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1274.34,1276.985,You're marking -- you can make one of two arguments.
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,1299.53,1300.82,"You are correct, Justice Alito."
2014.14-7955,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1300.82,1307.4,So you are arguing -- you want us to reverse a finding of fact of the district court on the ground that it is clearly erroneous.
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,1309.98,1320.74,"The Court in Comcast in -- we cited that opinion, it was a few years ago, and explained that where there are clearly -- clearly erroneous findings."
2014.14-7955,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1338.1,1342.05,"But 500 milligrams is a lethal dose, isn't it?"
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,1342.05,1342.34,That --
2014.14-7955,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1342.34,1346.55,Itself it's capable of causing death; is that right?
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,1346.55,1360.655,"That, I don't know, Justice Alito, that -- if the -- the expert who testified for the State talked about a potential toxic dose, but there's no information of -- of, yes, this dose will cause death."
2014.14-7955,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1361.81,1361.93,Well --
2014.14-7955,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1361.93,1362.29,Does the --
2014.14-7955,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1362.29,1370.28,-- isn't a therapeutic dose -- is there -- is it ever administered in that quantity for any therapeutic reason?
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,1370.28,1371.9,"No, but --"
2014.14-7955,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1371.9,1377.865,Does the fact that something is a lethal dose necessarily mean that it's not incredibly painful?
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,1377.865,1379.49,"No, Justice Kagan, and that's --"
2014.14-7955,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1379.49,1381.65,It could be a lethal dose and be incredibly painful.
2014.14-7955,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1381.65,1382.975,"No, that -- but that's not the point."
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,1392.715,1403.65,"Justice Alito, you don't need to do a study in this case because we already know from science and the pharmacology of the drug, how the drug works."
2014.14-7955,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1408.01,1409.23,Is it -- now let's get to that -- I'd like to get --
2014.14-7955,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1409.23,1410.36,"Well, maybe to the extent that you can't --"
2014.14-7955,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1410.36,1411.77,"Justice Kagan, I think it's your turn."
2014.14-7955,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1411.77,1412.92,"Please, go ahead."
2014.14-7955,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1412.92,1416.22,I'd just like -- since we're on the narrow question.
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,1487.0,1488.21,"That is correct, Justice Breyer."
2014.14-7955,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1488.21,1488.5,All right.
2014.14-7955,0,56186,robin_c_konrad,,1531.005,1531.84,Okay.
2014.14-7955,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1531.84,1533.68,Okay.
2014.14-7955,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1533.68,1536.535,Mr. Wyrick.
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,1536.535,1539.045,That's better.
2014.14-7955,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1539.045,1540.774,"You could ask me, maybe."
2014.14-7955,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1540.774,1542.47,Mr. Wyrick.
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,1542.47,1555.175,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The district court found, as a matter of fact, that a 500-milligram dose of midazolam would, with near certainty, render these Petitioners unconscious and unable to feel pain."
2014.14-7955,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1585.81,1651.185,"Mr. Wyrick, as -- as I understand it, there were three subsidiary findings that underlay this conclusion. The first is the one that we talked a little bit about with Ms. Konrad, which has to do with the ceiling effect, which, as I understand it you, don't at all defend. The second is the idea that 500 milligrams of this drug would likely kill a patient in 30 minutes or an hour, which seems to me irrelevant given that a lethal dose is completely consistent with unbearable pain. And the third is that that dose of midazolam would keep a patient unconscious while a needle is inserted into his thigh, which also seems irrelevant given the -- what everybody understands to be the much, much, much greater potential for pain of potassium chloride. So those were the three subsidiary findings. One of them nobody thinks is anything other than gobbledygook, and the other two are irrelevant."
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,1652.43,1654.29,"Well, I'm going to take those in reverse order."
2014.14-7955,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1667.74,1671.005,"Well, it does not sound pleasant to have a needle put in your thigh."
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,1683.29,1685.66,And -- and this is what I want to clarify as to your first point.
2014.14-7955,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1695.76,1696.09,"No, no, no."
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,1697.505,1698.07,-- it's talking about.
2014.14-7955,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1708.88,1709.2,"No, no, no."
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,1709.2,1709.63,It's a central --
2014.14-7955,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1709.63,1709.85,There's --
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,1709.85,1710.57,-- nervous system --
2014.14-7955,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1710.57,1710.75,"No, no, no."
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,1740.61,1751.605,"The question before the Court is whether the district court's factual finding that they would be unconscious and insensate is clearly erroneous. And on that point, let's look at the record case that these Petitioners put on before the district court."
2014.14-7955,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1782.36,1783.56,Would any doctor -- would any doctor --
2014.14-7955,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1783.56,1785.77,They are pain relief medications.
2014.14-7955,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1785.77,1789.71,What -- what's the third point you had? I -- I was anxious to hear your third point.
2014.14-7955,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1789.71,1791.26,As was I.
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,1791.26,1794.315,In response to Justice Kagan's question?
2014.14-7955,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1794.315,1795.185,Yes.
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,1795.185,1795.635,Yes.
2014.14-7955,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1801.31,1801.43,You know --
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,1801.43,1802.12,-- which was a factual finding --
2014.14-7955,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1802.12,1802.31,There is --
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,1802.31,1802.47,-- but --
2014.14-7955,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1802.47,1828.39,"There is the fact that this is a lethal dose, again, completely consistent with the possibility of potassium chloride causing great pain. There is the fact that it rendered -- it keeps a patient unconscious with a needle, completely consistent with it not keeping a patient unconscious with potassium chloride running through his body, and, again, this -- this statement that nobody can figure out about the ceiling fact."
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,1828.39,1828.48,Right.
2014.14-7955,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1868.595,1880.42,"What do we do with this brief of the pharmacology professors that state, flat out, midazolam cannot induce coma-like unconsciousness?"
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,1880.42,1887.31,"They actually go further and say, you know, in several respects that it can induce unconsciousness, and that's something that no one agrees with."
2014.14-7955,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1892.45,1892.8,Can I -- can I ask --
2014.14-7955,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1892.8,1893.07,What -- what's the --
2014.14-7955,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1893.07,1903.375,"-- the same question, which is I -- I've had this one question, and that is, as I read this record -- you remember what I said was the standard from Baze."
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,1961.995,1963.47,If any of that were --
2014.14-7955,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1963.47,1964.21,If we stop there.
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,1964.21,1966.52,If any of that were supported by the medical literature.
2014.14-7955,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1966.52,1969.525,But he pointed to -- he pointed to two articles.
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,1978.88,1979.15,Yes.
2014.14-7955,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1979.44,1993.6,"Now let's look at the other side, because your side then says -- he says right here that -- he says it will put you into a coma."
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,2057.58,2064.215,"Well, a couple of things. First, that assumes that a deep coma-like level of unconsciousness is the relevant question."
2014.14-7955,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2078.17,2079.19,Would any doctor --
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,2079.19,2080.11,It's beyond --
2014.14-7955,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2080.11,2104.31,"-- use this drug -- any doctor who is conducting a surgical procedure, doesn't want the patient to suffer pain, wants to induce this unconscious state, would any doctor in the country give this as the drug to induce that -- that coma-like unconsciousness?"
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,2104.31,2107.91,It is routinely used to induce anesthesia.
2014.14-7955,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2164.355,2170.6,"I -- I have a real problem with whatever you're reading, because I'm going to have to go back to that article."
2014.14-7955,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2256.44,2257.57,Do you have an answer to that one?
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,2257.57,2262.24,"Respectfully, Justice Sotomayor, in the brief we explained that --"
2014.14-7955,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2262.24,2262.6,"No, sir."
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,2262.66,2279.475,The FDA -- the FDA label says that the effects of the drug depend upon three things: The rate of infusion -- I think it's the -- the maintenance -- the infusion -- the rate -- the dosage of the rate of infusion and whether it's used in conjunction with other CNS depressants and --
2014.14-7955,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2279.475,2290.71,But you didn't -- you quoted this for the proposition that it could cause a fatality because of the depression of -- or it could produce general anesthesia.
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,2290.71,2294.66,"At JA 217, their expert agrees that it can cause a fatality."
2014.14-7955,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2296.34,2306.445,"Sure, but he said it's in old people. I'm -- you know, there have been 80 deaths from therapeutic doses of this drug."
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,2356.875,2359.19,The FDA has said no such thing.
2014.14-7955,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2359.19,2360.865,"Well, they put it in that section."
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,2360.865,2366.635,They described in that section the potential effects and they described -- they said 3 thing matter when you're looking at the effects.
2014.14-7955,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2371.305,2371.82,Exactly.
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,2371.82,2376.79,"Now, their -- their expert said -- unqualifiedly he said the FDA tested this drug and injected --"
2014.14-7955,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2376.79,2377.0,All right.
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,2463.37,2474.165,"Respectfully, Justice Sotomayor, what they were comparing was a .2 milligram per kilogram dose of a different drug to a .6 milligram dose -- per kilogram dose of midazolam."
2014.14-7955,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2498.47,2498.82,"Well, we're back."
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,2503.72,2506.01,And let's talk about their evidence.
2014.14-7955,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2540.37,2554.1,"But Mr. Wyrick, it would be very different if the court had said, look, we don't think you've presented enough evidence that the ceiling effect kicks in at this point, right? But that's not what the court said."
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,2568.495,2571.95,I -- I -- that's not quite how we read the district court's opinion.
2014.14-7955,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2584.62,2584.71,Yes.
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,2594.83,2612.5,"We know the central nervous system depressant works throughout the central nervous system, right? So it -- it's affecting these GABA receptors which are located in the spinal cord and in the brain. Now, his point was perhaps those GABA receptors could be fully saturated with GABA at the spinal cord level, but the question is at the brain level."
2014.14-7955,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2624.44,2639.45,"Well, I just read it -- I think if we go back and read it, it will show that what he was saying was we just don't have to worry about the ceiling effect because at the brain level, the ceiling effect has no relevance. Let me ask you another question."
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,2676.56,2681.66,If there is a risk of serious pain that rises to a substantial or objectively intolerable.
2014.14-7955,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2681.66,2681.83,No.
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,2693.81,2702.21,"If what you're suggesting is shifting the burden to the State to show that there's some medical consensus that a drug can, in fact, do this at these dosages, we know that --"
2014.14-7955,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2702.21,2703.27,I guess I'm not talking about burdens.
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,2717.475,2738.76,"Well, this Court in Brewer v. Landrigan, which was an appeal from the Ninth Circuit in a -- of a similarly postured case, it was a temporary injunction, that was a challenge to the efficacy of lethal injection drugs vacated a -- a temporary injunction granted by lower courts and said the burden is on the petitioner to show that it is sure or very likely that they will suffer from the harm."
2014.14-7955,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2742.82,2750.91,"So then I think I have not found a place where I agree with you, because that seems -- that seems quite something to me."
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,2782.11,2793.89,"I think that that -- a Petitioner in that case would have no trouble meeting -- satisfying the burden this Court imposed in Baze, which is showing that that puts me at a substantial risk, objectively intolerable risk of severe pain."
2014.14-7955,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2797.38,2801.04,"No, I'm -- I'm saying, because you just don't know about the anesthesia."
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,2808.77,2812.81,"That isn't the world that we live in, and it's certainly not the world that this district court lived in."
2014.14-7955,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2828.39,2829.76,"Induction, but not maintenance."
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,2829.76,2830.13,"For certain, yes."
2014.14-7955,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2830.13,2833.025,"And there is the world of difference between the two, isn't there?"
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,2833.025,2835.82,Induction is the creation of anesthesia.
2014.14-7955,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2840.69,2844.975,Or for -- or for the time it takes for the potassium chloride to kill somebody.
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,2844.975,2853.07,"And we also put on evidence that this drug is approved for usage and is commonly used for painful, invasive procedures like setting of a femoral IV."
2014.14-7955,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2864.49,2874.88,"What you have here, their expert saying, as I previously said, that this drug will not keep you asleep."
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,2975.405,2982.09,"Again, and I have to make this point, whether it creates a coma or not is not the constitutionally relevant question."

2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,2982.48,2987.09,"But based on how a central nervous system depressant works, that a central nervous --"
2014.14-7955,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2987.09,2989.915,"Let me put it differently. Not the word ""coma"""
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,3020.355,3023.89,Because of how a central nervous system depressant works.
2014.14-7955,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3025.41,3042.25,"I'm not asking you for even -- I really want to know where in the record does he provide support for that statement, that the, quote, that state, end quote, precedes the death caused by this drug."
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,3042.25,3044.0,"Well, he describes a couple of things."
2014.14-7955,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3050.91,3051.255,But --
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,3051.255,3057.57,-- it works by paralyzing the brain to such an extent that your respiratory drive is knocked out.
2014.14-7955,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3058.05,3060.375,But that's the clear error here.
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,3085.76,3089.615,"This is a central nervous system depressant, just like a barbiturate."
2014.14-7955,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3089.615,3092.34,"Depressant, but it's not a --"
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,3092.34,3094.16,"It's not -- it's not a barbiturate, but makes -- they are both --"
2014.14-7955,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3094.16,3094.51,Exactly.
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,3096.785,3099.565,"No, but they're both central nervous system depressants."
2014.14-7955,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3105.36,3115.645,"You're right, it -- it -- but it's still -- I don't know where you're getting -- Justice -- Justice Breyer said, the proof of that."
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,3115.645,3124.365,Because it's a conceded fact on this record that a 500 milligram dose will render them unconscious within a matter of 60 to 90 seconds.
2014.14-7955,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3134.01,3166.045,"You're unconscious, but that doesn't tell me that you're not feeling pain, or that a noxious stimulant like being burned alive won't cause pain. Look at what happens with the intubations. They paralyze your throat, they give you this drug, but they're paralyzing your throat, and that has its own anesthetic effect and pain relief. So what you're arguing is very different from what's happening here."
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,3173.83,3176.74,"Respectfully, you have that backwards on intubation."
2014.14-7955,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3204.68,3210.28,"No, they paralyze them also with the throat local anesthetic."
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,3212.24,3215.98,The rapid sequence intubation describes midazolam as the first-line choice.
2014.14-7955,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3215.98,3218.14,"Sure, it's a first line in a lot of things --"
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,3218.14,3218.64,But we also --
2014.14-7955,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3218.64,3222.625,But it doesn't keep you in an anesthetic state forever.
2014.14-7955,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3226.63,3228.33,-- during surgeries.
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,3228.33,3229.85,It can.
2014.14-7955,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3229.85,3231.05,In some.
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,3231.05,3243.645,"Look at the Saari article cited by their experts which describes the use of the anesthetic. The other thing I want to point out is the 16 professors' brief, because this really is their ceiling effect in a nutshell, this -- this figure that's in the brief."
2014.14-7955,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3336.99,3356.28,"If I come out of this argument, because you presented a lot of things to us that wasn't before either the district court or the court of appeals, wouldn't be -- and I believe that your experts didn't prove their point at all and that they showed enough."
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,3367.605,3377.13,"Two quick responses. One is they didn't meet their burden under Brewer v. Landrigan, a showing that is sure or very likely on the record that they presented."
2014.14-7955,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3388.675,3394.295,"Mr. Wyrick, to an extent that's unusual even in this Court, you have been listening rather than talking."
2014.14-7955,1,56187,patrick_r_wyrick,,3403.615,3404.63,I appreciate that.
2014.14-7955,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3572.025,3578.395,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Konrad, why don't you take 8 minutes, up to 8 minutes."
2014.14-7955,2,56186,robin_c_konrad,,3578.395,3584.12,"Justice Kagan, I wanted to address your hypothetical."
2014.14-7955,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3606.575,3616.585,"I guess the question I was asking was if a person was burned alive and we didn't know whether he had appropriate anesthesia, would that be unconstitutional, too?"
2014.14-7955,2,56186,robin_c_konrad,,3616.585,3628.73,"That would be, Justice Kagan, and that's -- the point here is that the district court below found that there is a greater risk in using midazolam, but found it was unquantifiable."
2014.14-7955,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3645.25,3655.8,"If an -- if an anesthesiologist rendered a person completely unconscious, and then the person was burned alive, would that be cruel and unusual punishment?"
2014.14-7955,2,56186,robin_c_konrad,,3655.8,3660.83,"Justice Alito, I think the problem isn't rendering somebody unconscious."
2014.14-7955,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3668.52,3668.61,Yes.
2014.14-7955,2,56186,robin_c_konrad,,3679.54,3681.0,It could be.
2014.14-7955,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3683.69,3684.99,Because potassium chloride --
2014.14-7955,2,56186,robin_c_konrad,,3684.99,3685.13,An --
2014.14-7955,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3685.13,3689.36,"-- is kind of like that, isn't it? It's being burned alive from the inside. That's what it is."
2014.14-7955,2,56186,robin_c_konrad,,3689.36,3692.45,"That's exactly what it is, Justice Kagan, but what --"
2014.14-7955,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3692.45,3699.58,But you're not sure that being burned alive -- that you think there are circumstances in which burning somebody at the stake would be consistent with the Eighth Amendment?
2014.14-7955,2,56186,robin_c_konrad,,3699.58,3700.09,It is --
2014.14-7955,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3700.09,3702.88,"It's an irrelevant point, but you're -- you're not certain about that?"
2014.14-7955,2,56186,robin_c_konrad,,3702.88,3709.8,"Well, what I'm saying is that this Court has -- the founders say burning at the stake is unconstitutional."
2014.14-7955,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3725.98,3735.03,That's an incredible answer. You think that there are circumstances in which burning alive would not be a violation of the Eighth Amendment? Burning somebody alive would not be a violation of the Eighth Amendment?
2014.14-7955,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3735.03,3738.145,"You see, but potassium chloride is burning somebody alive."
2014.14-7955,2,56186,robin_c_konrad,,3742.34,3749.78,"Which is what we have here and here the district court found a risk, a risk that it could not quantify."
2014.14-7955,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3833.29,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
