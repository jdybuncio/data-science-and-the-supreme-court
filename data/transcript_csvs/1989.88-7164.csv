1989.88-7164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.268,"We'll hear argument next in No. 88-7164, Terry Brice Horton v. California."
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,68.975,71.589,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-7164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,197.648,218.174,"Now, what if the officers in obtaining and seeking a search warrant lack probable cause to list some items on the search warrant and the affidavit and, therefore, they don't."
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,234.875,236.296,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-7164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,236.296,236.767,No?
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,236.767,239.198,Not if the police officers intended to search.
1989.88-7164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,263.778,277.726,"Well, I have put to you the possibility that there may be several items, some of which they have probable cause to get a warrant to search, and some they don't."
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,283.851,289.907,"Your Honor, if they find those items because they searched for those items, the seizure would be invalid."
1989.88-7164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,289.907,296.022,"No, they find it because it's in plain view when they enter pursuant to a valid search warrant for other items."
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,296.022,302.507,"If they find the items in plain view and the seizure is inadvertent, yes, they may seize those items."
1989.88-7164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,302.507,309.272,"But they knew they were there, likely to be there, but they lacked probable cause to include them in the warrant requirement."
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,309.272,318.788,"The fact that you... that you look at, I believe, is... for inadvertence, is whether or not the police officers were in fact searching for them."
1989.88-7164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,328.936,331.927,How do you... how do you instruct these police officers when you send them out?
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,359.632,365.164,"There's a difference in saying, we believe that ""b"" might be there, but don't look for it."
1989.88-7164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,373.55,373.75,"I mean, you--"
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,373.75,374.662,--and you're quite right--
1989.88-7164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,374.662,379.787,"--you can tell them, don't look in any place where ""a"" wouldn't be just because you think that ""b"" might be there."
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,380.748,380.927,--That's right.
1989.88-7164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,380.927,385.452,"But how can you tell them, while you're looking for ""a"", for pete's sake, don't think ""b""?"
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,393.018,397.432,"If their intention in going into that residence is to find ""b"", that's a violation."
1989.88-7164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,397.882,400.275,I don't know.
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,403.757,404.739,--That's correct.
1989.88-7164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,404.739,406.531,"They also know that ""b"" might be there."
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,406.531,409.563,"If they happen upon ""b"", it's a valid seizure."
1989.88-7164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,409.563,410.902,"Well,--"
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,410.902,411.954,In this... in this case--
1989.88-7164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,411.954,412.194,--Happen upon it.
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,412.615,419.951,"--we have... we have the testimony of the police officer that in... in fact, when they entered the residence they intended to search for items not listed on the warrant."
1989.88-7164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,433.94,437.223,"--The basic reason, I think, is to... is to describe the scope of the search."
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,449.35,455.584,"There's also the possessory interest which the Fourth Amendment protects, as this Court has recognized in a number of cases."
1989.88-7164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,497.352,509.48,"But nevertheless... nevertheless, officers cannot search even for contraband if... which is not listed on the... on the... on the warrant."
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,517.727,518.996,--That's correct.
1989.88-7164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,518.996,530.146,They cannot... they cannot just search generally for things... for... outside the area where the items they're supposed to find and are listed might be.
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,530.146,531.134,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-7164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,545.625,557.075,"Well, is there any indication in this case that when the officers made this... seized these articles that are at issue that they were not in a place where they were not entitled to be?"
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,561.429,568.505,"Your Honor, to answer that, the Attorney General in his brief argues against listing."
1989.88-7164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,568.505,569.075,"Well, this--"
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,569.075,570.536,I am... I am answering your question.
1989.88-7164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,570.536,571.587,"--Well, how... you're going to answer it, are you?"
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,571.587,572.847,"Yes, I promise I will."
1989.88-7164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,572.847,573.808,Like yes or no or--
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,573.808,575.166,It's not a yes or no.
1989.88-7164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,608.251,614.546,"--Well, you can't say that they were... that they exceeded the scope of the search either."
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,614.546,615.146,That's correct.
1989.88-7164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,615.146,615.627,Well--
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,615.627,617.04,You can come to neither conclusion.
1989.88-7164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,617.04,622.942,"--Well, but the... the trial court denied the motion to suppress and the court of appeals... the court of appeals affirmed."
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,628.406,645.579,"Well, Your Honor, the initial motion made after the preliminary hearing was granted by the magistrate prior to binding Mr. Horton over for trial... the district attorney then filed the motion in the superior court to reinstate the evidence which was granted."
1989.88-7164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,655.996,672.377,"Well, but that's all within a framework of people... of the officer being lawfully in the place... having a lawful right to be in the place where he was and seeing... seeing something that was subject to seizure."
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,672.377,683.155,"Well, Your Honor, in this case the facts don't support the conclusion that the officers were simply in a place where they had a right to be and saw."
1989.88-7164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,683.155,683.546,They were--
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,683.706,685.158,--looking for these things.
1989.88-7164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,685.158,697.957,"--Well, but certainly the California Court of Appeals, the California Trial Court, the Supreme Court of California in deciding the North cases know this debate about... you know, is inadvertence a requirement."
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,714.74,716.643,That's correct.
1989.88-7164,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,716.643,727.359,Don't you marvel at the fact that after all of these cases and all this publicity these thugs always leave stuff in plain view?
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,727.359,728.959,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-7164,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,740.59,744.332,That's the way it is.
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,744.332,745.961,--That's the way it is.
1989.88-7164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,745.961,757.771,"Ms. Drous, could you tell me why... why... why would we... we don't have an inadvertence requirement for dispensing with a seizure warrant elsewhere, do we?"
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,768.83,769.06,That's correct.
1989.88-7164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,769.06,778.156,"--Must they go get a seizure warrant before they can come up and even though they lay in wait fully expecting him to come, do they have to get a seizure warrant?"
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,778.156,780.66,You mean when an individual is walking down the street?
1989.88-7164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,780.66,780.82,Yes.
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,796.621,806.117,"If... if the police at that point have probable cause for an arrest, the police officer may arrest the person without a warrant--"
1989.88-7164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,806.117,806.868,Right.
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,806.868,809.389,--and the search of the person would then be pursuant to that arrest.
1989.88-7164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,809.389,821.017,"But... even though they had full knowledge and could have gotten a warrant for the seizure you don't require advertence in that... inadvertence in that situation, do you?"
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,821.017,823.561,"Well, because there you have an exigent circumstance."
1989.88-7164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,830.403,832.815,It isn't an exigent circumstance because they could have gotten a warrant.
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,840.481,842.093,On the... on the street?
1989.88-7164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,842.093,842.484,Yeah.
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,852.792,857.747,Because there you have the difference of the rules relating to an arrest.
1989.88-7164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,865.522,880.46,"But once you have a warrant to enter the home and your concern is with the possessory interest, why isn't that met if the officers have probable cause to seize the items?"
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,880.46,887.056,This Court has consistently held that probable cause alone will not support a warrantless search and seizure.
1989.88-7164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,887.056,889.727,It's not warrantless.
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,906.843,912.268,"What you have there, however, is a warrantless seizure, and warrantless seizures are not allowed."
1989.88-7164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,912.268,914.099,"Well, that... that's not correct."
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,932.063,938.398,"Well, Your Honor, that's the second portion of United States v. Marron, which has... is... is no longer the rule."
1989.88-7164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,947.615,952.539,"If... if it's within control according to the Chimel doctrine, it would have been admissible, would it not?"
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,952.539,953.02,--Correct.
1989.88-7164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,959.043,959.213,But--
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,959.213,963.437,--the entire premises on... from which the person was arrested.
1989.88-7164,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,963.437,964.538,"--Yes, but... but you--"
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,972.306,979.9,"However, in this... in this case Mr. Horton was not present and none of the items were sized from his person--"
1989.88-7164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,979.9,980.681,"Well, Ms.--"
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,980.681,985.994,--You always... police officers are always allowed to search a person pursuant to a lawful arrest.
1989.88-7164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,985.994,1005.127,"--Ms. Drous, are you suggesting that if a police officer is walking through a public park and sees a piece of property that he thinks is either contraband or there is probable cause to believe is evidence in making a case against him, he needs to get a warrant to... to seize that?"
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1005.127,1006.196,Excuse me?
1989.88-7164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1009.208,1009.358,If he's walking through a--
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1009.358,1010.269,--walking in a public park--
1989.88-7164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1010.269,1010.42,--Yes.
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1010.42,1011.481,--and it's in plain view?
1989.88-7164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1011.481,1012.212,Yes.
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1012.212,1014.916,"No, he does not need a warrant in that case."
1989.88-7164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1015.705,1023.512,"Well, why... why should it be any... he's lawfully in the public park, he's seizing a piece of property which he has probable cause to seize."
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1030.915,1035.27,--There the police have... have made no illegal seizure... no illegal search.
1989.88-7164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1036.789,1037.941,"Well, what... what's illegal about this search?"
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1037.941,1041.203,--The police officers... let's go back to the beginning.
1989.88-7164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1054.974,1057.047,Why... why don't you say regardless rather than irregardless?
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1057.047,1057.598,--I'm sorry.
1989.88-7164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1075.711,1083.637,"Well, why does that make it illegal, unless they intended to search in places where they were not otherwise authorized to be by the warrant?"
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1083.637,1092.693,We don't know if in fact... that their search for these items not listed in the warrant broadened the search.
1989.88-7164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1092.693,1096.777,"Well, but you moved to suppress."
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1103.102,1105.055,Not when there's a warrantless seizure.
1989.88-7164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1105.055,1114.679,"You mean you can come into court and say, I move to suppress and it's up to the government to show why the evidence is admissible?"
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1114.679,1116.282,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-7164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1129.471,1134.203,"Well, and... and here the trial court in the California... the court of appeals were satisfied the state had met that burden."
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1134.203,1134.864,That's correct.
1989.88-7164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1134.864,1136.596,They must have thought the search was alright.
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1136.596,1137.635,That's correct.
1989.88-7164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1139.688,1145.042,"Well, then you say it's illegal, but you're fighting the factual determinations of the lower court."
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1145.042,1147.543,"--Well, that's a legal determination also."
1989.88-7164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1181.924,1195.905,"Ms. Drous, have we... have we ever... have we ever held that... that the Constitution requires a warrant for a seizure without a... without a search?"
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1195.905,1196.264,Yes.
1989.88-7164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1196.264,1203.619,"I know we have... we have for an arrest and we have for a search and seizure, but... but what... what case says it just... just--"
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1203.619,1203.92,In United States--
1989.88-7164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1203.92,1205.833,"--Where there's probable cause, I mean."
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1207.433,1212.856,"--In United States v. Place, the language is that a warrantless seizure is per se unreasonable."
1989.88-7164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1226.247,1230.959,"So, it... so, it follows then... I'm... I'm... I don't know what the answer is."
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1247.821,1248.84,Your Honor--
1989.88-7164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1248.84,1249.621,There's no search involved.
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1250.402,1255.237,"--Your Honor, in that case it would depend where the car was to be located."
1989.88-7164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1256.727,1257.799,It's going to be on the street.
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1257.799,1260.991,--Not... not in the driveway of a home?
1989.88-7164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1260.991,1261.452,No.
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1262.43,1269.196,"On the street, because of the movability of automobiles, I think that that search... that seizure would always be upheld."
1989.88-7164,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1275.009,1281.064,It's not an exigency that... of the sort that prevents a warrant from being obtained.
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1305.85,1308.122,"In the case of automobiles, that's correct."
1989.88-7164,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1317.519,1330.838,"Well, take Justice Scalia's example but make it lawn furniture in the back yard or in plain... in plain view of somebody's front lawn some furniture, and an officer has probable cause to believe it's stolen, as in this case."
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1333.78,1334.689,"Your Honor, again, in that--"
1989.88-7164,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1334.689,1335.451,--help himself to that furniture?
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1335.451,1335.931,--I'm sorry.
1989.88-7164,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1345.478,1353.365,"Well, there's... there's probable cause to believe there's no interest to protect, but it hasn't been resolved by any judicial authority that that's the fact."
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1357.418,1357.549,"No, I do not."
1989.88-7164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1370.544,1376.05,"--Well, one of the items that... that was listed in the warrant was some Halloween masks, weren't they?"
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1376.05,1377.941,That's correct.
1989.88-7164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1378.952,1380.041,They were not found.
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1399.896,1401.336,That's correct.
1989.88-7164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1418.419,1419.28,"Well, you don't suggest they--"
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1419.28,1419.431,--you do not know.
1989.88-7164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1419.431,1423.184,"--You don't suggest that they didn't search for the Halloween mask, do you?"
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1423.184,1423.772,"Oh, no."
1989.88-7164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1426.206,1426.854,Well?
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1426.854,1429.087,"In fact, the police officer stated as such."
1989.88-7164,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1429.087,1437.553,Well and they... and I suppose they would look on shelves and anywhere a Halloween mask might be.
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1437.553,1439.974,That's correct.
1989.88-7164,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1457.114,1472.305,"There would still be a desire on the part of the police, I suppose, to have a warrant that would properly enable them to describe the scope of their search."
1989.88-7164,0,30059,juliana_drous,,1484.514,1502.776,"However, in this case in the closing pages of the Attorney General's brief, he notes that the police officers relied on the fact that California does not follow the inadvertence requirement so they didn't think that it was necessary to bother going back and correcting the warrant before they entered the premises to conduct the search."
1989.88-7164,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1608.605,1611.887,"Thank you, Ms. Drous."
1989.88-7164,1,36108,martin_s_kaye,,1613.129,1620.024,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-7164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1668.117,1671.799,I... I meant to talk about the ring rather than the mask.
1989.88-7164,1,36108,martin_s_kaye,,1671.799,1671.94,Yes.
1989.88-7164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1672.751,1675.834,But the same... the same result would follow.
1989.88-7164,1,36108,martin_s_kaye,,1677.203,1677.353,--Precisely.
1989.88-7164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1688.172,1688.373,Yes.
1989.88-7164,1,36108,martin_s_kaye,,1703.525,1707.807,If you stay after you find--
1989.88-7164,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1707.807,1712.991,Suppose you... the police stay on the premises after they've found all the listed items on--
1989.88-7164,1,36108,martin_s_kaye,,1712.991,1713.152,--Yes.
1989.88-7164,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1713.152,1715.563,"--the warrant, I take... it take it then it's a general search."
1989.88-7164,1,36108,martin_s_kaye,,1715.563,1719.696,That... we would concede that once the listed items are found the search much seize.
1989.88-7164,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1722.178,1723.911,And there was no contention that that happened here?
1989.88-7164,1,36108,martin_s_kaye,,1723.911,1724.66,No.
1989.88-7164,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1725.3,1730.574,That... that principle would serve as a deterrent to just leaving things off the warrant.
1989.88-7164,1,36108,martin_s_kaye,,1743.192,1743.893,"Precisely, Your Honor."
1989.88-7164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1750.348,1753.991,"Well, you put everything in the warrant that you've got probable cause to--"
1989.88-7164,1,36108,martin_s_kaye,,1753.991,1754.732,"--Well, certainly."
1989.88-7164,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1754.732,1755.003,--think is on the premises.
1989.88-7164,1,36108,martin_s_kaye,,1755.003,1756.415,"Sure, I'm assuming probable cause."
1989.88-7164,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2016.288,2031.919,"Well, is it permissible to search... execute a search warrant for crime ""a"" if there is probable cause for that if your real intent is to search for evidence of crime... is to... is to look for evidence of crime ""b"" that might be in plain view?"
1989.88-7164,1,36108,martin_s_kaye,,2031.919,2035.739,"Well, the Court has never... has never discussed that--"
1989.88-7164,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2035.739,2037.161,"Well, you seem to be conceding it."
1989.88-7164,1,36108,martin_s_kaye,,2037.892,2039.533,"--No, I'm not conceding it."
1989.88-7164,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2079.659,2083.641,You've used the term Mr. Kaye.
1989.88-7164,1,36108,martin_s_kaye,,2086.023,2100.925,The lower courts generally agree that a pretext situation is where you are obtaining permission to search or arrest for one crime when the underlying motivation is to look for evidence of a second crime.
1989.88-7164,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2100.925,2103.885,"Well, you say underlying motivation."
1989.88-7164,1,36108,martin_s_kaye,,2110.769,2112.592,"Well, that's not clear."
1989.88-7164,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2121.059,2123.271,"Well, I would think it would be very difficult."
1989.88-7164,1,36108,martin_s_kaye,,2127.915,2128.106,Precisely.
1989.88-7164,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2200.076,2208.521,"--Not that it matters, but what was the value of those rings?"
1989.88-7164,1,36108,martin_s_kaye,,2208.521,2210.021,What was the value?
1989.88-7164,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2210.021,2210.602,Yeah.
1989.88-7164,1,36108,martin_s_kaye,,2210.602,2212.405,I don't know if the record reveals.
1989.88-7164,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2213.567,2216.739,Was he ever tried for possession of them?
1989.88-7164,1,36108,martin_s_kaye,,2216.739,2218.181,No.
1989.88-7164,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2221.364,2226.088,"So, nothing was done about the warrant?"
1989.88-7164,1,36108,martin_s_kaye,,2230.951,2232.951,"Well, it was never discovered during the search."
1989.88-7164,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2232.951,2236.615,"Thank you, Mr. Kaye."
1989.88-7164,2,30059,juliana_drous,,2240.647,2240.905,Thank you.
1989.88-7164,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2396.48,2399.022,"Yeah, and you can't search within the home with an arrest warrant."
1989.88-7164,2,30059,juliana_drous,,2399.022,2399.192,--That--
1989.88-7164,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2399.192,2401.575,"You can find the defendant and that's it, isn't it?"
1989.88-7164,2,30059,juliana_drous,,2401.575,2402.143,--Absolutely.
1989.88-7164,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2484.509,2487.549,"Thank you, Ms. Drous."
