2004.03-710,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,7.142,"We'll hear argument in No. 03-710, Devenpeck against Alford."
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,8.173,10.94,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-710,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,61.384,73.523,"Ms. Hart, is there any requirement in Washington or generally that an officer state the grounds for the arrest to the person being arrested at the time?"
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,73.523,83.015,"--Justice O'Connor, there's no constitutional requirement and there is no requirement in... in Washington that that be done."
2004.03-710,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,89.126,95.275,"We're dealing here with a case from the State of Washington, and you assert there is no such requirement in Washington."
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,95.275,95.814,--There is not.
2004.03-710,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,95.814,107.702,"But in this case when the respondent was arrested, he was informed by the officer that the arrest was for making a tape recording of the conversation?"
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,107.702,108.9,That is correct.
2004.03-710,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,108.9,117.362,"And it turns out... do you concede that that was, in fact, not a lawful grounds for arrest?"
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,117.362,120.539,"That... at this point, the question of the--"
2004.03-710,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,120.539,121.82,Do you concede that--
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,121.82,123.761,--Your Honor--
2004.03-710,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,123.761,131.274,"--that in the State of Washington, that it is perfectly lawful to record the conversation with the police?"
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,131.274,137.757,"--This... the facts of this particular case have not been before a... a court in Washington, Your Honor."
2004.03-710,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,137.757,139.076,But I'm asking you.
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,150.51,158.395,"Your Honor, I believe in this case there would be probable cause for an officer to believe it was and therefore effect an arrest."
2004.03-710,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,175.735,183.537,"Well, do we decide this case on the understanding that it was lawful to make the recording?"
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,187.131,187.874,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-710,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,191.339,194.683,"Well, for argument--"
2004.03-710,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,194.683,197.988,"Now, Washington also has an anti-stacking policy, does it?"
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,197.988,200.134,"The State Patrol does, Your Honor, yes."
2004.03-710,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,200.134,204.425,Is... is that just a rule of the patrolmen in the State?
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,204.425,205.168,It--
2004.03-710,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,205.168,210.081,They won't arrest someone for several charges?
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,210.081,215.365,--It's an agency policy and troopers with the Washington State Patrol are trained to it.
2004.03-710,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,215.365,222.795,"Well, is it an agency policy that the State endorses, and if so, why... why do you endorse or adopt the policy?"
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,222.795,229.854,"Well, Your Honor, I believe that... that stacking charges really is... there are good reasons to endorse the policy."
2004.03-710,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,232.538,233.941,Not... not stacking charges you mean.
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,233.941,234.313,--I'm sorry.
2004.03-710,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,258.173,266.635,"Well, is that... I mean, is that the... the real basis for the policy, that we... that Washington does not want to make it difficult for... for arrestees to raise bail?"
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,266.635,272.002,"Your Honor, I can't tell you precisely what the Washington State Patrol's thinking is on it."
2004.03-710,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,289.752,319.391,"What do you make of the argument that unless the cause of the arrest is, number one, stated and, number two, a... a cause that a defendant can rely on, that in any case like this in which the stated grounds of the arrest turn out to be... we will assume, turn out to be inadequate, the police will always, particularly in traffic cases, be able to come up with something later on to justify the arrest?"
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,321.87,337.102,"Well, I... I think what I would make of it, Justice Souter, is that provided that there's probable cause for arrest, that the fact that there may be a basis to... to stop a number of... of motorists is not... is not relevant."
2004.03-710,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,346.512,354.851,"But that was for an... an arrest in which, so far as we can tell, the... the stated grounds for the arrest were those for which there was probable cause."
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,382.528,400.011,"--Well, Your Honor, the... if there is probable cause for arrest, that is the concern of the Fourth Amendment, and I... I don't believe that the... the concern... I don't know that there's any empirical evidence that the concern that you are expressing has been borne out."
2004.03-710,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,400.011,403.726,That... that may be... that may be the... the best response.
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,411.157,413.652,"Not as... as far as I know, Your Honor."
2004.03-710,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,427.027,427.377,No.
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,448.741,467.029,"--Well, and... and Your Honor, I... I do believe that the concern of the Fourth Amendment, which is the only constitutional provision at issue in this case, is that there in fact be a reasonable basis for arrest and that subsequently or promptly subsequently or prior to arrest be tested by a neutral magistrate."
2004.03-710,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,468.06,472.601,"Ms. Hart, I'm... I'm not sure what you mean by... that there has to be probable cause for arrest."
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,507.236,513.058,If there was probable cause based on the... if there was reason based on the objective facts and circumstances--
2004.03-710,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,513.058,515.538,And it doesn't matter whether he knew those facts and circumstances.
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,515.538,516.736,--that... known to the officer at arrest.
2004.03-710,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,516.736,518.676,"Oh, so it has to be known."
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,518.676,519.214,Yes.
2004.03-710,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,519.214,523.856,"So in my example, the arrest would be invalid because at the time of the arrest, he didn't know about the sticker."
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,523.856,531.929,"Absent the circumstances at arrest giving rise to a reasonable basis to believe that a crime had been committed, there would not be probable cause."
2004.03-710,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,531.929,533.87,So you're saying it's the facts known to the officer--
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,533.87,534.696,Precisely.
2004.03-710,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,534.696,535.977,--that have to establish the probable--
2004.03-710,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,535.977,536.465,That's--
2004.03-710,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,536.465,543.491,"--Once... once you establish that limitation, are you willing to accept the horrible that... that Justice Souter proposed to you?"
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,553.726,556.987,It is not and... and... it is not.
2004.03-710,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,581.962,583.365,--That was LaFave.
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,587.059,587.535,--Yes.
2004.03-710,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,587.535,598.763,"You... you made the point, in answer to Justice O'Connor, that a police officer in Washington is not required to divulge on the spot the reason for the arrest."
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,608.961,628.113,"At charging, Your Honor, there... there... the... the individual who has been arrested, as a matter of the Sixth Amendment, would be entitled to know the charges against him or her, and the officer is required, in a warrantless arrest, to appear before a neutral magistrate and have the probable cause for the arrest tested--"
2004.03-710,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,628.113,633.027,Is it... is it at the arraignment or the... at the earlier booking in the police station?
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,633.027,636.204,--I'm sorry.
2004.03-710,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,637.502,654.863,"Is it... is it... is the time when the arrestee must told you are being arrested for X reason, is that when the arrestee appears before the magistrate or is it earlier when he's brought into the police station and he's booked?"
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,658.745,661.55,"Neither, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.03-710,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,675.918,679.428,You mean he could be held until a charge is filed without being told why he's being held?
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,679.428,681.574,Justice Stevens--
2004.03-710,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,681.574,682.5,So that could be a week or 2.
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,682.5,691.893,--But it would be... he would be held in that case following a determination by a neutral magistrate that there are grounds to hold him.
2004.03-710,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,693.917,696.063,Would the magistrate keep those grounds secret?
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,696.063,698.004,"--They would not be secret, Your Honor, no."
2004.03-710,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,698.004,700.233,"Well, wouldn't the magistrate tell him why he's being held?"
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,700.233,710.059,"The magistrate would tell the... the arrestee why he's being held, provided the arrestee is present for that particular procedure."
2004.03-710,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,710.059,711.878,And how soon is he entitled to appear before the magistrate?
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,711.878,713.281,I'm sorry?
2004.03-710,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,713.281,718.482,How soon after his physical arrest does he have a right to appear before the magistrate?
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,718.482,725.829,My... my recollection under Washington's law would be... 72 hours is the time for the charge.
2004.03-710,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,725.829,730.453,"So for 72 hours, he could be held incommunicado without knowing why he was arrested."
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,730.453,745.481,"But... but for that period, the arresting officer would have had to... during the 48-hour period at the outset, that this Court discussed in Riverside, the probable cause for the arrest would be tested by a neutral magistrate."
2004.03-710,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,745.481,758.606,You also said that you thought this case is distinguishable on the legitimacy of taping the conversation with the police officer on the highway.
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,773.549,779.328,"Well, first of all, again, Justice Ginsburg, the Privacy Act issue is not one that we have raised before this Court."
2004.03-710,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,816.358,830.021,Do you know if there's been any instruction in the State of Washington to police following that Flora decision about taping... about arresting people for taping conversations with police officers?
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,830.021,831.507,"I do believe there has, Your Honor."
2004.03-710,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,836.725,842.836,The flashing headlights which was... there was a citation.
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,858.09,864.284,"Under Washington law, the flashing headlights, the wig-wag lights, in and of themselves would not be an arrestable offense."
2004.03-710,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,877.204,882.693,"But he was never... never charged with the impersonating an officer, only with the flashing headlights."
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,883.148,883.602,That's correct.
2004.03-710,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,883.602,893.179,"The... the case, as far as I'm thinking of it at the moment, comes down to everybody is agreeing... well, no."
2004.03-710,0,36051,maureen_a_hart,,895.286,896.046,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2004.03-710,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,896.046,910.807,Mr. Comey.
2004.03-710,1,29497,james_b_comey,,910.807,912.952,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.03-710,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,921.497,924.181,"Do the facts, on your view, have to be known to the officer?"
2004.03-710,1,29497,james_b_comey,,924.181,925.295,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-710,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,925.295,929.382,Is... is there... and correct me if I'm wrong.
2004.03-710,1,29497,james_b_comey,,942.674,944.16,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-710,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,944.16,945.729,Why wouldn't we have the same rule?
2004.03-710,1,29497,james_b_comey,,953.41,957.246,"I suspect, Your Honor, that the Government would urge such a rule if it were at issue in this case."
2004.03-710,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,957.246,958.322,But it's not urging it here.
2004.03-710,1,29497,james_b_comey,,958.322,961.499,"Well, I don't see it at... at issue in this case, Your Honor."
2004.03-710,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,961.499,961.787,I don't think it is.
2004.03-710,1,29497,james_b_comey,,963.19,964.676,"That's... that's correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-710,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1037.204,1042.202,"So far as you know, there... there are no empirical studies looking into this particular horrible?"
2004.03-710,1,29497,james_b_comey,,1042.202,1043.976,"No, I'm not aware of any, Your Honor."
2004.03-710,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1081.832,1088.685,"Mr. Comey, I think you rely, in part at least, on this Court's case in Whren--"
2004.03-710,1,29497,james_b_comey,,1088.685,1089.9,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-710,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1089.9,1092.485,--for the result for which you argue.
2004.03-710,1,29497,james_b_comey,,1118.453,1120.31,"I don't believe it does, Your Honor."
2004.03-710,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1168.236,1174.348,"But if... if we had gone the other way in Whren, we would still have the problem that we have in this case, wouldn't we?"
2004.03-710,1,29497,james_b_comey,,1189.701,1201.385,"I think we would still be discussing whether the subjective functioning of an officer's mind is relevant for Fourth Amendment purposes, which turns upon whether the action was reasonable in the case of an arrest--"
2004.03-710,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1201.385,1204.152,But the question here is the scope of the Fourth Amendment inquiry.
2004.03-710,1,29497,james_b_comey,,1217.238,1229.498,"--I think we would, Your Honor, to the extent that Whren is about motives and this case is about something very closely related, still the inner working of an officer's mind, what legal conclusion he draws from facts."
2004.03-710,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1229.498,1231.827,Why is it subjective?
2004.03-710,1,29497,james_b_comey,,1266.074,1275.362,"I would suggest, Your Honor, that his speaking, his invocation of a particular code section is an objective manifestation of an essentially subjective process."
2004.03-710,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1313.462,1318.17,"But, of course, even in those examples, there could be a difference in what the police officer had actually observed."
2004.03-710,1,29497,james_b_comey,,1326.715,1327.746,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-710,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1389.972,1394.991,You... you predicted that this would be in practice very bad.
2004.03-710,1,29497,james_b_comey,,1400.07,1401.928,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-710,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1402.587,1405.188,But the... outside the Ninth Circuit.
2004.03-710,1,29497,james_b_comey,,1405.188,1405.765,"Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-710,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1407.622,1414.271,"Do we know whether these horribles have occurred there, that the police are booking for everything?"
2004.03-710,1,29497,james_b_comey,,1414.271,1416.955,"I do not, Your Honor."
2004.03-710,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1449.36,1455.387,"In... in the Federal system, is the arrest based on what the officer knew and... and see... and saw at the time?"
2004.03-710,1,29497,james_b_comey,,1455.387,1456.752,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.03-710,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1460.384,1466.616,"Suppose he had asked for a gun permit and he sees the gun permit, and he said, well, it's... that's okay."
2004.03-710,1,29497,james_b_comey,,1485.48,1495.511,"Well, I... I would suspect that any statements made or seizures made pursuant to the arrest, which was made on facts known to the officers, that did not include what was in his wallet would be in jeopardy."
2004.03-710,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1501.001,1505.997,So you would confine the rule to what the officer has seen at the time of the arrest.
2004.03-710,1,29497,james_b_comey,,1505.997,1510.372,"Facts known to the officers, including facts known to officers with whom he or she is working."
2004.03-710,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1512.396,1512.973,"Thank you, Mr. Comey."
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,1518.917,1526.719,"Justice Stevens, may it please the Court:"
2004.03-710,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1550.291,1561.891,"Well, I thought at its core it was about this rule that the Ninth Circuit adopted about closely related offenses."
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,1565.773,1574.44,"--Well, Your Honor, the closely related offense doctrine itself is... it's in five circuits... six depending on how you count the cases."
2004.03-710,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1607.216,1623.935,"Well, what if the arresting officer just doesn't give a reason for the arrest, just makes the arrest, and it turns out, at the end of the day, that indeed there were objective facts that would have justified an arrest."
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,1628.272,1631.244,"Your Honor, that... that implicates several other rights."
2004.03-710,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1641.563,1646.514,"Well, could... could an arrest made under the circumstances I described be valid?"
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,1646.514,1660.511,"--I hate to say this, Your Honor, but it depends because at some point, for example, when the person is brought before the magistrate for the probable cause determination, they're not operating in a vacuum."
2004.03-710,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1661.254,1661.587,No.
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,1690.648,1698.246,"--Your Honor, the... in this case, of course, that's... that's not the... that's not this case because the officer was very clear."
2004.03-710,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1724.745,1736.157,"Well, if the objective review shows that there were, indeed, facts that would have justified an arrest, then what's wrong with allowing that to proceed?"
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,1736.157,1752.775,"--Your Honor, the... the danger of that is that allowing this, as... as I termed it, a general right of arrest with... with no articulated basis at any point up until charging runs contrary to some of the basic principles--"
2004.03-710,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1752.775,1753.435,Okay.
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,1783.24,1784.809,--I'll be very happy if you--
2004.03-710,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1784.809,1786.212,And I'm... I'm sure you'd be delighted.
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,1796.865,1812.113,"--Well, Your Honor, to sort of piggyback on what Justice Souter and what Justice Ginsburg had commented on, there's no empirical evidence to suggest that there is or would be a movement by police officers towards silence."
2004.03-710,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1824.812,1827.041,Must... must be very stupid police officers.
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,1859.446,1860.189,--Your Honor--
2004.03-710,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1860.189,1878.022,"To put it this way, it seems to me the burden should be on you to... to tell us why a police... police officers are so stupid that they... that they go around and... and continue to give reasons when that's... when that's going to make it more difficult for them to sustain the arrest and subject them to... to personal liability."
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,1878.022,1884.959,"--Well, for the most part, Justice Scalia, it does not come back to haunt the officers because the vast majority of arrests are lawful."
2004.03-710,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1893.049,1907.333,"But if they're told in this case that they're subject to 1983 liability out of their own pockets if they get it wrong, then it seems to me they would pursue the safe course and say nothing."
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,1923.802,1928.343,The issue of... of the constitutionality of that has never been ruled on by this Court.
2004.03-710,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1928.759,1937.342,"Well, you're not urging that the Constitution requires the officer on the spot to state the cause of the arrest, or are you?"
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,1937.342,1944.28,"--Personally, Your Honor, I think that that would... that would certainly comport more with the common law that was extant at the time the Constitution was--"
2004.03-710,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1944.28,1958.481,"Well, regardless if it... whether it comports with the common law, I don't see why the rule that you are urging, closely related, is going to make a dime's worth of difference unless ultimately we hold that there is an obligation to state the cause at the time of the arrest."
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,1958.481,1968.307,"--Because, Your Honor, even if the... even if the cause of the arrest is not stated at the time of the arrest, the person must be booked for something."
2004.03-710,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1970.908,1971.651,Okay.
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,1980.818,1981.811,"--Correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-710,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1981.811,1982.304,Okay.
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2004.39,2008.122,"Well, Your Honor, I would analogize it to the... the arrest rule."
2004.03-710,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2017.66,2021.747,"Well, based on an objective test, we'll get absolutely nowhere."
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2053.492,2056.464,"It would certainly make it easier, but it's not necessary."
2004.03-710,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2056.464,2057.041,All right.
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2083.297,2092.585,"Well, Your Honor, I would say that the fact that there are six circuits that have adopted this policy shows that this is... that this is a problem that occurs nationwide."
2004.03-710,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2092.585,2095.724,"Then what is the... yes, but what's the justification for doing it?"
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2098.78,2107.447,"The practical problem is that people are being arrested for conduct that is, at its base, not criminal."
2004.03-710,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2107.447,2108.727,But they should have been arrested.
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2149.39,2150.254,"Well, Your Honor--"
2004.03-710,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2150.254,2160.618,"It seems to me he should have been arrested, and the... and the mere fact that the police officer gave the wrong reason for arresting him doesn't make me feel very bad about the arrest at all."
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2162.309,2165.115,--I'm going to disagree on two points.
2004.03-710,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2182.948,2185.631,"Yes, but did you object to the instructions in the trial court?"
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2185.631,2187.406,"No, Your Honor, because the--"
2004.03-710,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2187.406,2198.923,"One of the problems I have with the case, very frankly, is that the jury has already ruled against your client on the qualified immunity issue carrying out instructions given by the judge that were not objected to by your client."
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2198.923,2208.105,"--That's correct, Your Honor, but the only instructions that were given regarding... regarding what they needed to find to find a violation were the Privacy Act instructions."
2004.03-710,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2208.105,2209.037,But whose fault is that?
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2209.037,2214.527,"Well, Your Honor, I think if the State wanted them to... qualified immunity is an affirmative defense."
2004.03-710,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2265.797,2285.077,But I thought that the reason that the police went after your client after he left the vehicle that was disabled was because the officers at that point suspected that he might be impersonating a police officer.
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2306.292,2315.209,"Yes, Your Honor, and that... that... we have not argued that there was not suspicion sufficient to... to have a stop to do investigation."
2004.03-710,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2323.177,2326.854,"Under Washington law, is it lawful for your client to have headlights... wig-wag lights?"
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2326.854,2327.718,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.03-710,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2336.346,2339.69,Was your client ever found guilty of any offense at all?
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2339.69,2340.312,"No, Your Honor."
2004.03-710,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2344.603,2351.169,"But it's unlawful to have wig-wag lights, and I take it it's an arrestable offense to impersonate a police officer."
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2351.169,2353.231,"Yes, Your Honor, but that--"
2004.03-710,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2353.231,2364.171,"So that would... that would certainly be probable cause to arrest just based on the wig-wag, plus the fact he lied to the police in... in instructing them the button to push or didn't tell them what button to push to make them go."
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2364.171,2365.286,"--No, Your Honor."
2004.03-710,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2421.591,2423.41,"Well, that... that isn't the issue before us here."
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2450.076,2457.878,"Your Honor, we raised the issue at the Ninth Circuit that there had been no evidence put forward on the other crimes."
2004.03-710,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2474.718,2476.947,But... but that's not the ground on which the Ninth Circuit decided it.
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2481.488,2482.027,"Correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-710,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2482.027,2487.766,"--because it found, even if there was these other grounds, they're not closely related to the illegal taping."
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2503.082,2504.113,"That's exactly right, Your Honor."
2004.03-710,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2532.265,2535.032,May I ask one other question about the proceedings in the trial court?
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2535.032,2535.487,"Yes, sir."
2004.03-710,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2535.487,2541.143,"Was there a motion for summary judgment by the defendants claiming, as a matter of law, they should be entitled to qualified--"
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2541.143,2541.514,"Yes, sir."
2004.03-710,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2541.514,2542.546,--And that was overruled.
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2542.546,2543.661,"That was denied, yes."
2004.03-710,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2543.661,2549.483,"And then there was a jury trial and the jury disagreed with it and, in effect, said there... there was basis for qualified immunity."
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2549.483,2550.885,Yes.
2004.03-710,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2620.359,2624.363,What is your understanding of the reason for the jury's verdict on this issue?
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2624.363,2629.564,"I almost hate to say it, Your Honor, but I believe it was a lack of sympathy."
2004.03-710,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2647.851,2652.598,May I ask one other question then too?
2004.03-710,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2652.598,2653.713,That's not my reason.
2004.03-710,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2656.935,2668.164,In... in your view is the closely related doctrine a... a matter of closely related as a matter of law between two different offenses or is it a matter of... are the facts relevant?
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2676.459,2698.007,"In our brief, Your Honor, I often used the phrase same conduct test because in amalgamating the six different circuits, that appeared to be the most consistent test and the one that's most consistent with the objective standard and with the reasonableness standard, that if... and I, again, go to the no harm/no foul."
2004.03-710,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2715.718,2719.35,"Well, then you have a very narrow view of closely related."
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2760.422,2767.398,"--They did describe the entire episode to him, Justice Ginsburg."
2004.03-710,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2767.398,2774.251,So why couldn't it be related in time and space rather than legally related?
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2774.251,2779.165,"Well, I'm not urging something as narrow as... as a semi-Blockburger test."
2004.03-710,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2838.153,2849.382,"Why... why is it exactly that a policeman who comes on a difficult scene, gun in one pocket, the guy has a knife in another, and he throws a punch?"
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2864.038,2873.326,"Well, Your Honor, we're not concerned so much... this doctrine is not concerned so much with what to label the crime."
2004.03-710,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2873.326,2873.985,"No, no."
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2944.036,2959.368,"Well, Your Honor, the distinction in... in this particular case and the distinctions in the... in the cases that run the gamut around the circuits generally show one thing that we--"
2004.03-710,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2959.368,2961.292,--that the circuits all agree with you.
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,2967.979,2984.16,"--Your Honor, if we start with first principles, and the first principle that underlies this case is there is, from the framing area... era, a general mistrust of warrantless arrests."
2004.03-710,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3043.232,3045.711,"Yes, but Mr. Phillips, let me go back first principles."
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,3055.863,3056.856,"In this instance, Your Honor?"
2004.03-710,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3056.856,3057.206,Yes.
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,3057.206,3057.682,Certainly not.
2004.03-710,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3057.682,3059.334,"Oh, I misunderstood."
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,3067.507,3070.935,"No, Your Honor, because we don't feel that there was probable cause for the arrest."
2004.03-710,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3070.935,3072.254,"We don't that challenge that here, though."
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,3084.038,3086.35,That in order to address the Ninth Circuit's holding--
2004.03-710,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3086.35,3088.208,"Exactly, exactly."
2004.03-710,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3088.208,3093.409,"And... and there's no need for the Ninth Circuit's rule unless there was probable cause because if there was no probable cause, you win on that ground."
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,3097.496,3099.891,--If there was probable cause--
2004.03-710,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3099.891,3100.346,No.
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,3101.377,3101.948,"--Oh, correct."
2004.03-710,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3103.03,3104.888,Then you win without this fancy doctrine.
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,3104.888,3108.398,"--That's... that is correct, Your Honor, and that was--"
2004.03-710,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3108.398,3121.029,This... this doctrine only comes into play and is only required in cases involving a valid arrest and a... a mistake by the officer in identifying the wrong cause for the arrest.
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,3131.72,3139.029,"--Well, because it actually... to turn it back around, you're not protected because you did not act lawfully."
2004.03-710,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3140.925,3145.755,"No, but if you say the arrest was valid, he did act lawfully although we didn't realize the reason why he did."
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,3145.755,3155.004,"--Your Honor, the cases that have examined this doctrine have... have looked at it as sort of straddling the Fourth Amendment and the qualified immunity analysis."
2004.03-710,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3155.004,3169.0,"But... but don't you reconcile the... the problem of the straddle by saying that unless the probable cause, which we will assume existed, is for a closely related offense, the whole arrest was invalid?"
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,3170.198,3170.552,Correct.
2004.03-710,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3171.451,3171.989,Okay.
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,3189.655,3191.492,"Certainly, Your Honor, and there we would--"
2004.03-710,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3191.492,3195.457,"So it has nothing to do, essentially, with warrantless or nonwarrantless arrests."
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,3195.457,3199.172,"--Well, in this case it does, but had there been a warrant--"
2004.03-710,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3199.172,3202.97,"Well, in this... yes, but on your theory, that is... that is incidental."
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,3209.74,3212.424,--That there was no probable cause for the arrest.
2004.03-710,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3212.424,3213.167,That's... that's right.
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,3213.167,3213.789,"Correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-710,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3213.789,3214.039,Yes.
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,3214.039,3225.306,"And I think that that... of course, that... as we point out in our brief, there's support for that, that historically the warrant must show the reason that someone is being arrested."
2004.03-710,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3228.444,3231.705,"Well, you don't have any case law to cite to us for that."
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,3234.184,3249.992,"--Well, Your Honor, I think one of the most fundamental principles that we can look at on showing the reason why you're being arrested is the great writ of habeas corpus where, in order to hold someone, they must show why he is being held."
2004.03-710,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3249.992,3267.016,But you've already conceded that it... Washington law doesn't require the officer on the spot to say why he's making the arrest and that there's no decision of this Court or any court that I know that said the Constitution requires the officer on the spot to give a reason.
2004.03-710,2,40164,r_stuart_phillips,,3267.016,3268.774,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2004.03-710,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3298.002,3299.571,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
2004.03-710,3,36051,maureen_a_hart,,3303.204,3317.321,"I think I'd only like to make one point, Your Honors, and that is that the Fourth Amendment does not make the validity of arrest a game that the government loses even when there's probable cause for arrest, but the closely related offense doctrine does."
2004.03-710,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3322.977,3327.064,"Thank you, Ms. Hart."
