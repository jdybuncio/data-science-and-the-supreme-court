2019.19-715,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,17.2,"The first case we will argue today is Case 19-715, Donald Trump versus Mazars, USA. Mr. Strawbridge."
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,17.2,27.92,"Before these cases -- Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The subpoenas at issue here are unprecedented in every sense."
2019.19-715,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,141.64,181.12,"Mr. -- Mr. Strawbridge, I want to make sure that I understand the scope of your argument. Your -- your brief begins by questioning whether the House has any power to subpoena presidential records, but you seem at the end of the brief to pull back from that. You say that such subpoenas ""press the outer limits of Congress's authority"" and that there is every reason to doubt whether subpoenaing the personal documents of the President is a necessary incident of lawmaking. Do you concede any power in the House to subpoena personal papers of the President?"
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,181.12,203.48,"I think it is very hard to imagine that the House is ever going to have the power, you know, pursuant to its legislative powers, to subpoena the records of the President because, quite frankly, the House has limited powers to regulate the presidency itself. So I think it's very difficult to imagine a situation where its implied power to subpoena --"
2019.19-715,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,203.48,206.96,"Well, that's another --"
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,206.96,207.08,-- documents --
2019.19-715,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,207.08,209.8,-- that's another formulation for what I was just focusing on.
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,227.64,239.92,"Yes, we have argued that, at a minimum, this Court should apply the demonstrated need standard that it has applied in other cases when -- when -- when there's an attempt to serve process that targets the President."
2019.19-715,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,240.4,240.76,Okay.
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,241.0,241.56,-- the Court does --
2019.19-715,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,241.56,246.08,"-- so you say -- you say there is some power, in the House, you think there's a high standard."
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,260.16,266.2,"Well, I don't -- I don't think that we're asking this Court to do anything different than it has to do in an ordinary case."
2019.19-715,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,276.48,294.72,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas? Justice Thomas? Justice Ginsburg?"
2019.19-715,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,294.72,304.0,"Counsel, in so many of these prior cases, there was a cooperation, for example, tax returns."
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,381.32,389.6,"Well, Your Honor, we distinguish them in a number of ways. With respect to Watergate and Whitewater, obviously, those are cases of relatively recent vintage."
2019.19-715,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,435.88,438.84,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas?"
2019.19-715,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,438.84,439.56,Yes.
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,457.92,470.32,"I think that there might be limited powers in some cases for the House to subpoena private documents, although the Court has been very clear in Watkins and a number of other cases that Congress lacks any power to just inquire --"
2019.19-715,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,470.32,470.48,Okay.
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,472.56,484.56,"Well, I think -- I think that we -- we don't quarrel with the general notion that Congress has some implied power to exercise its legislative powers."
2019.19-715,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,510.72,511.48,"Well, it said --"
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,511.48,512.32,-- of precisely what --
2019.19-715,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,512.32,531.48,"-- in the D -- in the D.C. Circuit opinion, it says that this sort of information or subpoena should be requested under the impeachment power. What's the line between the -- a subpoena, a legislative subpoena, and a -- an impeachment-related subpoena?"
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,531.48,545.16,"Well, in Kilbourn, this Court recognized that -- that -- that they're two very different powers and that -- and that when impeachment is properly pending before either body of the House, the ability to subpoena pursuant to impeachment is coextensive with that of a court."
2019.19-715,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,561.16,562.32,Justice Breyer?
2019.19-715,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,562.32,562.72,All right.
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,612.68,646.76,"Well, if I can answer that last question first, I think that the Court cannot refuse to see what others see, to quote Rumely, and -- and the -- the -- the threat in this case of subpoenaing, you know, decades worth of papers, not only of the President but of the President's family members, of his children, of his grandchildren, as the House has done in this case, poses an obvious problem with respect to harassment and infringement upon the ability of the executive to discharge his duties 24 hours a day. Unlike Congress, the President is never in recess."
2019.19-715,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,651.96,670.56,"Are you saying that a weaker case -- look, whatever it is, why wouldn't whatever standard applies to personal papers before the Presidency be equal to or weaker than the standard for material that is the workings of the administration at the time?"
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,670.56,692.16,"Well, setting aside any executive privilege concerns, which I understand is not -- not the focus of your question, the answer is because Congress has -- or this Court has repeatedly emphasized in Kilbourn and Watkins and everywhere else that Congress lacks any power to inquire into the private affairs of any individual. And that's distinct from whatever interest it may have in informing themselves about the workings of government."
2019.19-715,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,698.32,698.76,Thank you.
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,705.56,711.6,This case -- we do not -- we do not argue that and we do not need to address the power of impeachment because it's not at issue in this case.
2019.19-715,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,711.6,712.64,It wasn't impeachment.
2019.19-715,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,712.64,713.28,Justice Alito?
2019.19-715,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,713.28,736.92,"Counsel, are there any circumstances in which a House of Congress can justify a subpoena for a sitting President's personal records on the ground that it wants to use the President as a case study for possible broad regulatory legislation?"
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,736.92,767.16,"I -- I think it's difficult to imagine for a couple of reasons. One is, even setting aside the fact that it's the President, this Court has always required some showing that -- that -- that the information being sought is pertinent. And I think that the -- the -- the swath and the -- and the -- and the scope of the subpoenas that are at issue here create serious problems even in an ordinary case. But -- but, to directly answer the question, no, the President's personal papers are not related to anything having to do with the workings of government."
2019.19-715,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,794.0,797.0,"Well, perhaps before my time expires I can ask you one other question."
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,817.0,820.0,"The answer to that, I think, is clear from this Court's cases."
2019.19-715,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,859.0,861.0,Justice Sotomayor?
2019.19-715,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,861.0,871.0,"Counsel, there is a long, long history of Congress seeking records and getting them, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, from Presidents."
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,944.0,956.0,"Well, taking -- taking the relevance question first, yes, even if you accepted that there was some legitimate legislation that could be had that reached the President because what we're seeking here is presidential finances, when you look at --"
2019.19-715,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,956.0,958.0,"No, we're --"
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,958.0,959.0,-- the face of the --
2019.19-715,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,959.0,960.0,"-- I'm sorry. Pardon, sir."
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,1000.0,1001.0,"Okay, so there are a number of issues there."
2019.19-715,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1015.0,1019.0,"Well, that -- those papers all have to do with executive privilege questions, and --"
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,1019.0,1020.0,Not in --
2019.19-715,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1020.0,1020.0,-- they're not --
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,1020.0,1021.0,-- not in Eastland.
2019.19-715,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1021.0,1023.0,-- personal -- they're not personal papers.
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,1032.0,1033.0,"Well, Eastland --"
2019.19-715,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1033.0,1035.0,"Briefly, counsel."
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,1035.0,1036.0,Yeah.
2019.19-715,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1069.0,1071.0,Justice Kagan?
2019.19-715,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1071.0,1072.0,"Good morning, Mr. Strawbridge."
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,1125.0,1131.0,"Well, no, I -- I -- I don't -- I don't think that that's the case because -- well, and for several reasons."
2019.19-715,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1171.0,1172.0,But I -- I -- I --
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,1172.0,1173.0,And whatever --
2019.19-715,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1173.0,1174.0,Go ahead.
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,1175.0,1183.0,"I was going to say whatever power Congress has to conduct oversight of lower branch agencies or inform itself as to the workings of government, these documents are not relevant to that."
2019.19-715,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1188.0,1197.0,"Yeah, I mean, I think some former presidents might contest the idea that this -- these subpoenas go further than has ever gone before."
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,1226.0,1234.0,"Well, because I -- I guess -- I guess because the -- the fact that they seek personal documents doesn't mean that they're not targeting the President."
2019.19-715,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1265.0,1278.0,Justice Gorsuch?
2019.19-715,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1628.0,1631.0,"Counsel, I'd like to pick up right there where you left off."
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,1292.0,1293.0,"For several reasons, Justice Gorsuch."
2019.19-715,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1349.0,1363.0,"Counsel, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I -- I guess my question was more practical than that. Why is this subpoena not provide -- supported by a substantial legislative need?"
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,1363.0,1367.0,"Well, one -- I guess three answers."
2019.19-715,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1412.0,1416.0,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Kavanaugh?"
2019.19-715,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1416.0,1419.0,"Thank you, Chief Justice. And good morning, Mr. Strawbridge."
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,1436.0,1498.0,"Well, in a case like this, obviously, where Congress is -- is asserting its desire to enact general legislation, I think it's going to be very difficult. I don't hold out the possibility that they could meet the demonstrated need -- I mean, I don't -- I don't completely rule out that possibility, although I think it is telling that the House devoted all of one sentence to each of these subpoenas, attempting to just assert very broadly that they meet the demonstrated need criteria. But, if there was some situation in which Congress was actually -- you know, had -- had -- had put forth a statute for which they -- they needed some information to decide whether to enact a statute, the statute was valid, and for some reason the President's personal papers were necessary to inform Congress, then perhaps in that case it could meet the demonstrated need statute. I can't imagine that any of these subpoenas could come close, given how far back they look and how much of a dragnet they set up. These are the kinds of subpoenas that the Court in Watkins said raise specific questions about whether they're really attempting to expose alleged wrongdoing as opposed to achieve a valid legislative end."
2019.19-715,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1498.0,1518.0,"Secondly, following up on Justice Kagan's point about the future, on page 6 of your supplemental letter brief, you say that ""it is likely that civil litigation over the subpoenas would have been foreclosed had the committee issued them to the President."" And you say this case is different because the subpoenas were issued to a third-party custodian."
2019.19-715,0,63242,patrick_strawbridge,,1533.0,1564.0,"The -- the -- the recipients of these subpoenas have indicated that they consider it to be a dispute between the President and the House of Representatives, and -- and -- and absent some sort of court order regarding its validity, they feel obligated to comply. And this Court in Eastland recognized that it's not -- it's just not reasonable to expect in this situation the third-party custodian to risk contempt of Congress or other collateral consequences, and there needs to be a vehicle to let -- to allow for review, especially in this case, where the President is suffering a personal injury arising --"
2019.19-715,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1564.0,1572.0,"Thank you, counsel. General Wall?"
2019.19-715,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1572.0,1577.0,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: These cases are truly historic."
2019.19-715,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1625.0,1637.0,"Counsel, you spend a lot of time in your brief documenting that the purpose of these subpoenas was actually investigatory rather than legislative."
2019.19-715,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1660.0,1661.0,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
2019.19-715,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1706.0,1709.0,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas?"
2019.19-715,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,1709.0,1736.0,"Mr. Wall, what if, following up on the Chief Justice's question, what if it was clear from those statements that you reviewed that their intention was actually to remove the President from office rather than the sort of pretextual reason that it is for legislative -- pre-textual legislative reasons?"
2019.19-715,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1736.0,1748.0,"I -- I do think, if you look at the statements, and we haven't urged that, but if you do, yes, I -- I think they make clear that the subpoenas are not in aid of valid legislation. That's the only enumerated power to which Congress has pointed here."
2019.19-715,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,1795.0,1797.0,Thank you.
2019.19-715,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1797.0,1800.0,Justice Ginsburg?
2019.19-715,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1800.0,1805.0,One must investigate before legislation.
2019.19-715,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1881.0,1926.0,"Justice Ginsburg, I absolutely agree that Congress can investigate in service of what legislation might be needed. Our submission is much more modest, that when that legislative -- when that inquiry involves the President, that you need a somewhat higher standard with respect to purpose because the room for regulating the President is so much narrower than it is with respect to private parties. And on the need side, because of the dangers of harassing and distracting and undermining the President, and that's a common theme that runs through the Court's cases, that the President gets some measure of heightened protection because you can't proceed against the President as against an ordinary litigant. And all I'm saying is that Congress hasn't met that standard here."
2019.19-715,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1926.0,1927.0,Justice Breyer?
2019.19-715,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1927.0,1929.0,How did that work out in the Paula Jones --
2019.19-715,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1929.0,1933.0,Justice Breyer?
2019.19-715,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1933.0,1949.0,"Following this up, assume, as I do, that for reasons set out in an opinion by Judge Griffith, that we're not very good courts at -- at deciding disputes between two powerful political branches."
2019.19-715,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2010.0,2012.0,"I would, Justice Breyer, on two grounds."
2019.19-715,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2074.0,2077.0,Justice Alito?
2019.19-715,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2077.0,2088.0,Could you apply the standard that you think is appropriate to the subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee?
2019.19-715,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2088.0,2089.0,"Sure, Justice Alito."
2019.19-715,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2141.0,2166.0,"Justice Ginsburg referred to legislation concerning disclosure requirements that would apply to the President, and there's also mention of conflict-of-interest legislation that might apply to the President. Does Congress have the power to regulate the President in these ways?"
2019.19-715,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2166.0,2180.0,"I think it's very unlikely on the conflict-of-interest side, Justice Alito, that even the D.C. Circuit did not rely on that because of the serious constitutional questions it would pose if you disabled the executive from managing some part of the executive branch. I think the financial disclosures are the hardest."
2019.19-715,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2220.0,2225.0,Justice Sotomayor?
2019.19-715,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2225.0,2240.0,"Mr. Wall, that's the issue, isn't it? Which is, until Congress investigates, A, it doesn't have a chance to determine what might be valid, and, B, we don't have a chance then to look at an actual law and say it may or may not be valid."
2019.19-715,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2294.0,2307.0,"Justice Sotomayor, if it wants to do that -- our submission is just a fairly modest one -- it needs to do more than wave its hands about general purposes and say that the President would be a useful case study for prospective and generally applicable laws."
2019.19-715,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2307.0,2308.0,Mr. Wall --
2019.19-715,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2308.0,2309.0,"Again, I'm not denying --"
2019.19-715,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2309.0,2323.0,"-- Mr. Wall, in what other setting does any investigative body have to do more than what was done here?"
2019.19-715,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2323.0,2325.0,I would point to the prosecutor in Nixon --
2019.19-715,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2325.0,2328.0,For private -- for private records?
2019.19-715,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2328.0,2338.0,"Well, this particular question hasn't come up to the Court before in a constitutional context, but, in Nixon, of course, the prosecutor had to show, demonstrate a specific need."
2019.19-715,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2340.0,2341.0,I'd rather that you --
2019.19-715,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2341.0,2343.0,-- the congressional committee had to show --
2019.19-715,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2343.0,2348.0,"Mr. Wall, please, I don't want you to go to executive privilege cases."
2019.19-715,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2367.0,2384.0,"I think that makes the problem worse, not better, Justice Sotomayor. They're targeting the personal life of the President before he was a candidate for office. That raises, granted, somewhat different but deeply troubling and equally problematic constitutional concerns that you will harass --"
2019.19-715,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2384.0,2388.0,Justice Kagan? Justice Kagan?
2019.19-715,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2388.0,2394.0,"Mr. Wall, I'd like to go back to your use of Clinton v. Jones because I -- I had read that case differently."
2019.19-715,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2459.0,2461.0,"Well, yes and no."
2019.19-715,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2478.0,2487.0,"Well, harassing and undermining the President -- I mean, the point of some of those suits is presumably to harass and undermine the President, and the Court let them go, let -- you know, let them proceed."

2019.19-715,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2544.0,2571.0,"Counsel, I believe in earlier discussions with Justice Alito, you indicated that Congress might be able to regulate in the area of financial disclosures of the President, and that is one of the interests the House has asserted here. What more would you require the House to do to assert that interest? What -- what would be enough, in your mind, to demonstrate the heightened need you suggest is needed?"
2019.19-715,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2571.0,2575.0,"I don't think it has to go provision by provision, Justice Gorsuch, or anything like that."

2019.19-715,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2677.0,2683.0,"The response, Justice Kavanaugh, is that 507, if you -- if you look at its terms, it's both a rubber stamp and a blank check."
2019.19-715,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2726.0,2746.0,"Second question: History and practice matter quite a bit in separation of powers cases, as you know. Justice Ginsburg earlier cited precedent from Watergate and Whitewater, as did Justice Breyer. Can you respond -- and -- and those dealt with legislative subpoenas."
2019.19-715,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2750.0,2751.0,Yes.
2019.19-715,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2758.0,2762.0,What about -- sorry to interrupt -- but specifically Watergate and Whitewater.
2019.19-715,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2762.0,2763.0,So that's what I was coming to.

Mr. Wall, my very good friend, Mr. Wall, said that the legislation here doesn't match up."
2019.19-715,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2939.0,2943.0,"Mr. -- Mr. Letter, the -- let's talk about the standard you propose."
2019.19-715,2,21108,douglas_n_letter,,2962.0,2975.0,"Your Honor, I think the best I can do is refer you to the Court's decision in Kilbourn, where the Court there said that Congress didn't seem to put forward any possible legislation there."

2019.19-715,2,21108,douglas_n_letter,,2987.0,2998.0,"Oh, no, obviously, bankruptcy could be, and -- but in the Kilbourn case, this Court thought that no such reason had been put forward."
2019.19-715,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3007.0,3010.0,"Well, that's what I'm suggesting, that your -- your -- your test is really not much of a test."
2019.19-715,2,21108,douglas_n_letter,,3032.0,3038.0,"Yes, I do, Your Honor. And I'm -- by the way, the test that I'm referring you to was the test that this Court had set about pertinent to a legislative purpose."

2019.19-715,2,21108,douglas_n_letter,,3084.0,3110.0,"Your Honor, this -- this Court has explained in -- in quite a few cases -- I think Watkins, Barenblatt, others -- that the Congress's legislative power, which -- I mean investigative power, which stems from the British parliament's power, is an obvious and integral part of legislation. We obviously can't have Congress passing legislation in -- in ignorance."
2019.19-715,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3130.0,3142.0,"Can you give an example, another example of a power that -- a legislative power that is implied?"

2019.19-715,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3148.0,3149.0,That's okay.
2019.19-715,2,21108,douglas_n_letter,,3159.0,3170.0,The -- the Congress investigated the -- the St. Clair expedition. It didn't actually issue a subpoena in that case but its equivalent of the time.

So what is your answer to -- what is the principle, the limiting principle, that would say legitimate legislative purpose, yes, looking toward enacting a law, but not to harass a President from the opposing party?"
2019.19-715,2,21108,douglas_n_letter,,3248.0,3255.0,"Two answers, Your Honor. First is this Court's decision in McGrain, which is -- is extremely important here."

2019.19-715,2,21108,douglas_n_letter,,3522.0,3524.0,"Absolutely, Justice Alito."
2019.19-715,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3550.0,3553.0,"So, I mean, I -- I don't want to cut you off, but I have very limited time."
2019.19-715,2,21108,douglas_n_letter,,3569.0,3570.0,Correct.
2019.19-715,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3574.0,3576.0,"Well, that's not much protection."
2019.19-715,2,21108,douglas_n_letter,,3578.0,3584.0,"It is protection, Your Honor, if what -- what Congress is doing is interfering with the President's ability to do his job."
2019.19-715,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3590.0,3599.0,"Well, when you talk about interfering with the President's ability to do his job, you mean this is going to take up too much of his time, or do you -- does that include the potential for the use of subpoenas solely for harassment and political purposes?"
2019.19-715,2,21108,douglas_n_letter,,3599.0,3607.0,"Your Honor, if they were solely for harassment, then they wouldn't meet the standards of they have to be pertinent to a legislative purpose."
2019.19-715,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3614.0,3628.0,"But you were not able to give the Chief Justice even one example of a subpoena that would be -- that would not be pertinent to some conceivable legislative purpose, were you?"
2019.19-715,2,21108,douglas_n_letter,,3628.0,3642.0,"As -- as I said, Your Honor, the -- that -- that's correct, because this Court itself has said Congress's power is -- to legislate is extremely broad, especially when you take into account appropriations."
2019.19-715,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3642.0,3669.0,"Well, so the end result is that there is no protection whatsoever in your view, and maybe this is -- this is the correct answer, but, in your view, there is really no protection against the use of congressional subpoenas for the purpose of preventing the harassment of a president because the only requirement is that the subpoena be relevant to a conceivable legislative purpose, and you can't think of a single example of a subpoena that wouldn't meet that test?"
2019.19-715,2,21108,douglas_n_letter,,3669.0,3678.0,"No, Your Honor, because, remember, there may be constitutionally based privileges or things like executive privilege -- you know, executive privilege --"
2019.19-715,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3678.0,3679.0,All right.

2019.19-715,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3693.0,3696.0,What are they? Would you name one?
2019.19-715,2,21108,douglas_n_letter,,3696.0,3699.0,"Well, it seems to me executive privilege could enter in."
2019.19-715,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3707.0,3754.0,"Let me ask you one more thing if I -- if I can and there's time. Are there any limits on the use -- on using a president's records as a case study relating to the need for legislation? So, for example, if the salary and the net worth of a future president before election was that of a person who would be regarded as middle class, and Congress says, you know, we want to study possible revisions of tax laws and the provision of services to members of the middle class, so we're going to subpoena all available information about the assets, income, expenditures, and services obtained by this sitting President and his family for purposes of considering that legislation, would that be permissible?"

And your -- the other side points to some hypotheticals that are troubling: the President's transcripts simply to pass on educational reform legislation or subpoenas of his personal medical records simply to enact general healthcare reforms. Tell me what we say to ensure against those hypotheticals and against a proposed subpoena that might be just for the sake of exposure."
2019.19-715,2,21108,douglas_n_letter,,3862.0,3864.0,"Your Honor, a couple of answers."

How could this investigation help improve those or change those?"
2019.19-715,2,21108,douglas_n_letter,,3926.0,3933.0,"I assume what Your Honor is referring to is disclosure laws, disclosure laws by the -- the President."

2019.19-715,2,21108,douglas_n_letter,,4551.0,4568.0,"Because then, Your Honor, you could look at -- you could demand that the executive branch show that its reason for -- for seeking something over -- outweighs the executive privilege claim.

2019.19-715,2,21108,douglas_n_letter,,4642.0,4670.0,"Your Honor, I'm having difficulty thinking of a -- of a hypothetical where, if -- if Congress is -- is examining and deciding on amendments to the Affordable Care Act, how the President's personal medical records would be relevant to that. It -- if -- as I say, the -- the most important public health statute of many, many decades I don't think would be affected by that at -- at all."
2019.19-715,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4670.0,4671.0,Okay.
2019.19-715,2,21108,douglas_n_letter,,4671.0,4699.0,"So I'm sure we can come up with some odd hypotheticals where presidential health would clearly be relevant, maybe changing the -- the statutes that involve the succession of when a president becomes incapacitated, something like that, I -- I suppose.

Mr. Letter, I know you will be delighted to learn that we have time for additional questioning, so I think I'll begin with myself, and then we'll go through in order and just see how far we get. One thing that hasn't come up is the fact that we're dealing here with three separate committees, and we're concerned, as you've recognized, with the potential for harassment. And how does that play in? I mean, at what point does the number of committees investigating the -- the President's personal papers become a factor in an analysis of the issue of harassment?"

But, Your Honor, it -- it would seem to me that there are situations, again, you'd have to look to, you know, Clinton versus Jones, when does it reach a particular stage?

2019.19-715,2,21108,douglas_n_letter,,5162.96,5164.12,Very interesting question.
2019.19-715,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,5190.56,5192.84,"Well, let's say they're similar to the subpoenas here."

2019.19-715,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,5223.68,5227.48,"Well, pertinent to a legislative purpose."
2019.19-715,2,21108,douglas_n_letter,,5227.48,5227.64,Then --

2019.19-715,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,5319.12,5374.12,"Mr. Letter, I'm wondering if I could ask you to comment on a potential difference between, on the one hand, the Oversight and Intelligence Committee subpoenas and, on the other hand, the Financial Services subpoena. The -- the first two subpoenas address the President directly, you know, the financial disclosures that the President makes, conflicts of interest, foreign involvement in Presidential campaigns, but the Banking Committee, Financial Services Committee, you know, was taking a much broader scope. And -- and when the -- when -- when that's true, when the Congress doesn't seem to be looking into the President but in a much broader topic, might there not be some heightened need for Congress to say why it is that they're focusing on Presidential records for that purpose?"
2019.19-715,2,21108,douglas_n_letter,,5374.12,5380.28,"Your Honor, I think that still would get into -- would raise major separation of powers problems."

2019.19-715,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,5549.52,5560.56,"Well, if it was personal records exactly identical to the personal records here but for members of Congress, none of those would apply, presumably, at least under what you've articulated so far today."
2019.19-715,2,21108,douglas_n_letter,,5560.56,5562.24,I -- I think that's right.

You know, my friend from the other side struggled with every hypothetical that he was given about his ability to set some sort of limiting principle or some category of information or documents about the President that would not be obtainable under his theory. And I think that's very telling because there are no limits to their theories. And, in particular, let's just consider the example that was given regarding medical records."
