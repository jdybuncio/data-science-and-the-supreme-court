1988.88-411,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.356,"We will hear argument next in No. 85-411, Edward W. Murray versus Joseph M. Giarratano."
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,16.026,34.321,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, two years ago in the case of Pennsylvania versus Finley, this Court said that there is no Constitutional obligation on the States to provide counsel for State prisoners in State collateral attacks on State court judgments."
1988.88-411,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,104.233,111.471,You are not thereby suggesting that Virginia is particularly gracious toward prisoners of this kind?
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,114.673,121.029,"--Your Honor, I am pointing out that Virginia meets the Constitutional requirements of counsel for the trials and direct appeals to the Virginia Supreme Court."
1988.88-411,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,121.029,125.731,"That is your basic argument, that you are just within the Constitutional prerequisites?"
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,125.731,127.599,"No, sir, it is not that argument at all."
1988.88-411,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,144.209,148.16,I am really suggesting that the Old Dominion is one of the tougher States in the Union.
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,148.16,150.462,"We try to be in some respects, Your Honor."
1988.88-411,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,150.462,156.616,"Mr. Harris, in that direct review, does the State Supreme Court review the entire record in every case?"
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,156.616,162.336,The Virginia Supreme Court reviews the record on the errors of trial that are raised.
1988.88-411,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,167.907,170.09,But not on the merits of the original case?
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,170.09,172.276,It will review the errors that are raised by counsel.
1988.88-411,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,172.276,177.263,"It does not necessarily review the entire record on the appeal on the merits of the conviction, does it?"
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,177.263,179.632,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1988.88-411,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,181.232,184.917,And is that not rather unusual among the States of this country?
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,184.917,191.689,"--As I understand it, practically every State has a rule isolating review to those claims that are raised by the parties."
1988.88-411,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,201.978,206.299,"And of course, your rights of direct appeal are rather limited in the Old Dominion."
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,206.299,207.749,"Not in a capital case, at all."
1988.88-411,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,210.167,212.519,"But generally, they are."
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,212.519,214.819,"In other cases, there is an appeal to an intermediary court."
1988.88-411,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,214.819,218.673,"Whom they recently installed, I might say."
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,218.673,221.792,"Yes, Your Honor, within the last few years."
1988.88-411,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,294.405,298.792,"Are you talking just about capital cases, or about all collateral review?"
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,298.792,300.575,In all habeas cases.
1988.88-411,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,317.253,322.074,And who determines whether it is or is not frivolous?
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,322.074,326.692,"The trial court, and it is very similar to the summary judgement inquiry in the Federal courts."
1988.88-411,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,418.432,419.868,"May I interrupt just a second, Mr. Harris?"
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,446.332,448.832,"--I am sorry, I do not think that I understand the question."
1988.88-411,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,448.832,461.508,"Well, you have just described two ways in which prisoners in death cases have in fact gotten representation in collateral proceedings, one by the volunteer organization, and two by the judges on occasion appointing counsel."
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,476.018,479.47,I would say that it would not make any difference for this issue.
1988.88-411,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,479.47,480.536,Right.
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,480.536,481.369,Because we say there is no Constitutional right to counsel.
1988.88-411,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,481.369,491.142,And it would be perfectly consistent with the Constitution to have all collateral proceedings by prisoners in Virginia handled by the prisoner himself.
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,491.142,497.212,"Consistent with the requirements that the Constitution does impose, of giving them some means of legal assistance to present their claims."
1988.88-411,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,497.212,500.264,"And anything beyond that is simply a matter of grace, in your view?"
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,500.264,501.081,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.88-411,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,501.081,505.567,Yes.
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,505.567,512.636,"And in the matter of what this Court has required as some form of legal assistance, that comes under the right of access to the courts."
1988.88-411,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,566.283,572.037,"But do you think those lawyers are Constitutionally required, or is this again just something that Virginia does as a matter of generosity?"
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,572.037,575.322,--Virginia has chosen to give these inmates more than what the law requires.
1988.88-411,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,575.322,578.626,"My question is, do you think Virginia could have chosen otherwise?"
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,578.626,582.162,"If Bounds means what Bounds says, yes."
1988.88-411,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,593.418,594.969,Because you have to do something.
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,594.969,595.519,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1988.88-411,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,595.519,599.521,You have to have either a law library or some kind of legal assistance.
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,599.521,600.456,That is correct.
1988.88-411,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,638.147,639.73,That was not a capital case.
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,639.73,641.848,"--It was not, Your Honor."
1988.88-411,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,647.168,648.318,Do you really believe that?
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,654.656,659.31,This Court has refused to create special rules in post-conviction proceedings.
1988.88-411,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,670.099,682.223,"Why do you think that a majority of the States with capital punishment have, by statute, created a right to have counsel in matters of this kind?"
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,682.223,684.925,--I do not think that is correct.
1988.88-411,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,685.96,687.71,I think there are 19.
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,687.71,695.816,"--In the plaintiffs' briefs submitted to this Court, it is indicated that, I believe, 18 States have a method of providing automatic appointment of counsel in all habeas cases."
1988.88-411,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,706.172,716.23,The point was just that they do not always provide counsel to help people prepare a habeas petition.
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,716.23,716.83,That is correct.
1988.88-411,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,898.314,903.284,May I ask just one other question on this notion of finality?
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,929.498,938.171,There may be some incidental shortening of the time at that very initial stage if the inmate were to make a request for counsel.
1988.88-411,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,945.527,947.093,"Well, that is quite an incentive."
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,947.093,952.097,"It is quite an incentive, and it is one that we prefer not to do hastily."
1988.88-411,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,969.408,970.758,"Well, I was thinking a little bit ahead."
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,995.191,1002.612,"--Well, again, we think we may in fact have a system that allows for prompt and automatic appointment, if the inmate simply asks the circuit court to appoint counsel."
1988.88-411,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1009.533,1011.385,That is not going to help much.
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,1015.77,1021.238,"All I am talking about is filing a motion for appointment of counsel, a one-page document that says, ""Get me a lawyer""."
1988.88-411,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1021.238,1025.291,"How do you file a motion... you mean, even before anything else is filed?"
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,1025.291,1028.743,"We have said, the trial court has the discretion to do that very thing."
1988.88-411,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1036.147,1039.968,"But the trial court has discretion to grant or deny such a petition, I take it?"
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,1039.968,1044.02,There is no guarantee that the trial court will do it in every instance.
1988.88-411,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1046.204,1070.321,"If we ruled in your favor, would it be acceptable or recommended that we relax the requirements of for cause showing on Federal habeas, so that if it is a pro se litigant we are less strict about procedural bar in Federal proceedings?"
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,1070.321,1074.523,--I don't know the Court needs to look at that issue for one particular reason.
1988.88-411,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1094.151,1098.554,"Well, but you are asking us to adopt a rule that you do not require a lawyer."
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,1099.971,1109.577,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1988.88-411,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1114.898,1124.087,"Mr. Harris, I do not understand what you have been telling us about all you have to do is file a paper with the District Judge in Virginia, saying I want counsel."
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,1127.539,1128.841,That is one of the means of obtaining it.
1988.88-411,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1128.841,1131.21,"When that paper is filed, he does not know anything?"
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,1131.21,1132.06,That is correct.
1988.88-411,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1132.06,1134.245,On what basis does he exercise his discretion?
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,1144.95,1150.821,"The motion would be filed, in all instances, with the judge who is the presiding judge at trial."
1988.88-411,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1153.689,1155.308,"I see, the judge who conducted the trial."
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,1155.308,1158.01,It would be the very same judge who tried the case.
1988.88-411,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1180.023,1181.292,To have counsel appointed?
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,1181.292,1182.225,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.88-411,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1182.225,1183.092,So long as he files?
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,1183.092,1187.962,It is more convenient for us to deal with a lawyer representing an inmate in a death case than it is a pro se inmate.
1988.88-411,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1236.962,1246.234,"May I ask you, on these appointments by the trial judges, pursuant to this discretionary authority, are counsel compensated in the same way as they are in the original trial itself?"
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,1246.234,1247.751,There is no cap on their compensation.
1988.88-411,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1250.27,1253.238,"But it is the same procedure, basically, as it is for the trial itself?"
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,1253.238,1253.904,That is my understanding.
1988.88-411,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1260.827,1265.695,"But the fact of the matter is that most of the inmates have instead used the volunteer organization, have they not?"
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,1265.695,1274.551,We only have evidence in this record of three instances where inmates have ever even sought appointment of counsel before a petition was filed.
1988.88-411,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1277.687,1279.055,And what happened in the third?
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,1279.055,1281.055,"In the third, the trial court did not."
1988.88-411,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1281.055,1281.907,I see.
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,1281.907,1285.026,The record in this case contains the order from the trial court in that case.
1988.88-411,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1304.17,1308.558,Is this group of lawyers different from the group that tried the cases?
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,1308.558,1310.76,"Yes, Your Honor, in every case."
1988.88-411,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1312.726,1314.645,I was wondering about that.
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,1322.734,1327.186,"Inmates often do raise that very claim, yes, Your Honor."
1988.88-411,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1327.186,1334.958,But it is... it is still this rumor or possibility of a shortage that does not exist as of now.
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,1338.41,1340.945,"As of now, every inmate has had a lawyer."
1988.88-411,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1340.945,1342.112,Right.
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,1342.112,1349.801,"As of now, we think there are systems in place that will make certain that any inmate who makes a request will get a lawyer."
1988.88-411,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1370.632,1372.751,"Mr. Harris, you may save the rest of your time for rebuttal."
1988.88-411,0,39532,robert_q_harris,,1379.404,1379.754,Thank you.
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1379.754,1396.247,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in their effort to conjure up the specter of additional rounds of litigation in death penalty cases, the Petitioners have misrepresented the nature of the Constitutional right recognized by the District court, and exaggerated the scope of the relief granted by it."
1988.88-411,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1412.726,1415.76,Which gave each of them a right to counsel?
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1415.76,1422.064,--Which gave each of them attorneys to assist in the preparation and investigation of their claim and the preparation of their petitions.
1988.88-411,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1422.064,1425.366,What is the difference between that and a right to counsel?
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1425.366,1433.205,"Well, it is different in terms of right to counsel being a term of art that has certain implications under the Constitution."
1988.88-411,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1437.693,1449.834,"What is the difference between saying that you do not have a right to counsel, or in saying that you do not have a right to the kind of attorney that is to be appointed for you in this case?"
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1451.034,1465.093,"--The difference has to do with the fact that we do not have the Court creating a right which is somehow enforceable in a collateral proceeding on a new habeas corpus, which is the specter which the State is attempting to create here."
1988.88-411,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1465.093,1467.978,How do you know it is not enforceable in the new habeas proceeding?
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1467.978,1470.228,"Well, theoretically... I mean, it is not as a conceptual matter."
1988.88-411,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1523.029,1532.552,"So, in your view, the right which you are claiming, or the relief that you are claiming, would be satisfied by the courts appointing incompetent counsel?"
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1532.552,1535.754,"--No, sir, we do not say that."
1988.88-411,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1572.229,1582.567,"So part of the relief you are requesting is a Constitutional rule that capable, competent counsel be appointed to give rights of access to the court."
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1582.567,1584.603,"--Yes, In death penalty cases on Virginia's Death Row."
1988.88-411,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1587.555,1598.744,"If some other district court in North Carolina were to reach different conclusions, Death Row inmates in North Carolina would not have any right to counsel."
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1598.744,1599.327,The question is whether or not--
1988.88-411,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1599.327,1602.029,"Well, can you answer my question?"
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1602.029,1605.398,--The result would... it depends on the facts of the case.
1988.88-411,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1607.314,1608.515,"Well, look."
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1613.836,1614.386,I will try.
1988.88-411,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1614.386,1631.579,"If a district court hearing evidence in North Carolina had reached a different conclusion than the district court in the Eastern District of Virginia, and said no, there is not any right to counsel of the sort that Judge Merhige found, then the rule in North Carolina would be different than the rule in Virginia."
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1631.579,1633.114,"No, sir, my answer to that is no."
1988.88-411,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1658.145,1670.137,"Well, supposing the district court in North Carolina said we think it is enough that there are law libraries like Bounds required at the institutions... even in the case of death penalty inmates... so we do not think there is any necessity for having appointed counsel."
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1670.137,1674.607,"If that decision was supported by the factual record in the case, then it could reach that conclusion."
1988.88-411,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1675.507,1679.042,"So you would have a right to counsel in Virginia, but not in North Carolina?"
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1679.042,1681.661,--I disagree with the premise that we are dealing with a right to counsel.
1988.88-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1778.786,1780.92,"Excuse me, why are the last 15 days critical?"
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1786.541,1788.51,"--Yes, I would agree, Your Honor."
1988.88-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1789.876,1794.064,"I mean, I am sure that every day is more important as it gets closer and closer, but I do not see why, legally, it is more critical."
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1794.064,1805.436,"--Well, the reason that I just said it is from what Your Honor just suggested, which is that if a petition has not been filed, then obviously that last period of time is the most critical, because time is running out."
1988.88-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1805.436,1806.602,But it should have been filed.
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1809.971,1816.725,"I agree, and unfortunately the access is not being provided at the earlier stage to ensure that, either."
1988.88-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1816.725,1823.231,Just because then are housed in a separate part of the facility during the 15 days before the date of execution?
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1823.231,1825.064,"No, sir, that does not... in itself--"
1988.88-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1825.064,1829.801,What is the average space between the date of conviction and the date of execution?
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1831.284,1833.836,"--No, but typically what happens is--"
1988.88-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1833.836,1835.038,Six months?
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1835.038,1836.071,"--No, less."
1988.88-411,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1875.894,1880.782,"Mr. Zerkin, before I lose the thread of your thought, you never did tell us what happens in this last 15 days."
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1880.782,1888.888,"--What happens in the last 15 days is, he is in the death house, isolated from the rest of the population at the penitentiary."
1988.88-411,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1950.777,1967.988,"Well, if Virginia is not living up to its duty under Bounds to provide access to these Death Row people, I would suppose that it is also falling its duty under Bounds to non-capital inmates."
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,1972.94,1978.094,"Not necessarily, Justice White, and the reason is that... and they may be."
1988.88-411,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2010.731,2012.933,"Well, what about the library?"
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,2012.933,2023.206,"The... at Mecklenburg, the problem with the library is that the access is limited to two and a half hours twice a week."
1988.88-411,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2090.683,2099.039,"Counsel, do we have a situation where a Death Row prisoner has asked the institutional attorney for help and been refused?"
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,2099.039,2100.439,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, we do."
1988.88-411,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2100.991,2101.858,Is that this case?
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,2101.858,2102.725,"--Yes, we do."
1988.88-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2204.393,2207.178,"Of course, we have never said that he had to be given counsel, have we?"
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,2208.578,2215.014,But he has no... he does not even have the assistance at that point of an institutional attorney to assist him in preparing.
1988.88-411,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2221.068,2223.77,We will resume there at one o'clock.
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,2231.643,2235.245,"--Thank you, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1988.88-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2509.67,2512.538,What was the error that was confessed?
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,2513.724,2516.592,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.88-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2517.276,2518.459,"The merits error, or what?"
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,2518.459,2525.198,--As to... they had relied upon convictions from the State of North Carolina that were invalid.
1988.88-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2525.198,2527.531,"Oh, so it went to the sentencing?"
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,2527.531,2529.316,"Yes, sir, and he received new sentencing."
1988.88-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2630.598,2640.906,"Let me ask you... I meant to ask you earlier, when somebody on the other side made the objection that you will have a challenge to whether the counsel you had was adequate."
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,2655.214,2662.784,"--Well, as I indicated to Chief Justice Rehnquist, that does not result in a new habeas petition, because theoretically that is not a basis for habeas corpus."
1988.88-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2663.284,2664.485,"What does it result in, then?"
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,2664.485,2671.856,"--What it could result in would be what would exist even at the present time, which would be a claim that he had been denied access under Bounds."
1988.88-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2676.727,2682.464,"Yes, except that the basis for that Bounds claim would then be the inadequacy of his counsel, right?"
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,2682.464,2684.733,"--No, I disagree with that."
1988.88-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2695.505,2696.389,"Well, I do not understand that."
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,2697.357,2697.774,--The standard--
1988.88-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2697.774,2701.493,"--Could you give him ineffective counsel, and you think that would be adequate?"
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,2701.493,2710.948,"--I think that the Constitutional standard of ineffective assistance of counsel, and the standard for providing meaningful access, are not necessarily the same."
1988.88-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2716.418,2717.787,"Maybe you do not need counsel at all, then."
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,2717.787,2721.072,"Well, we think clearly that you do need counsel, and there are a number of reasons for that."
1988.88-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2721.072,2722.622,But not necessarily competent counsel?
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,2722.622,2724.191,"Well, we would like to have competent counsel."
1988.88-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2724.191,2726.643,But it is enough if he is incompetent?
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,2726.643,2728.293,"No, we would not say he is incompetent."
1988.88-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2728.293,2730.028,But incompetent counsel does not have to be counsel.
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,2733.797,2747.473,"Your Honor is drawing a line distinction that says attorneys are either one or the other, and I suggest to the court that within the concept of meaningful access, there are certain things which that attorney must do in order to provide meaningful access in a capital case."
1988.88-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2778.493,2781.495,"But nonetheless, after the habeas proceeding is completed--"
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,2781.495,2782.147,--Yes.
1988.88-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2782.147,2795.97,"--With counsel that has been provided somehow, there would still be a claim remaining that that proceeding was itself inadequate because you would not call it ineffectiveness of counsel, you would call it--"
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,2795.97,2796.554,Lack of access.
1988.88-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2796.554,2798.489,--Lack of access.
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,2798.489,2799.689,"Yes, there would."
1988.88-411,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2801.558,2803.476,But you would not need counsel for that last proceeding?
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,2806.428,2806.795,"--No, sir."
1988.88-411,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2853.993,2861.23,"If you found that the order was being violated, then I suppose all capital sentences would be stayed?"
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,2861.23,2869.752,"No, Your Honor, only as to... only as to an inmate who was immediately facing execution, and as to--"
1988.88-411,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2869.752,2873.906,"How would you define ""immediately facing execution""?"
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,2873.906,2880.476,"--Well, I think within the standard definitions of what one is allowed to... the basis of a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction."
1988.88-411,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3064.613,3075.22,"Well, did the district court order cover help, legal help, in filing Federal post-conviction writs?"
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,3075.22,3075.537,"--No, Your Honor."
1988.88-411,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3102.252,3107.556,I suppose then that the inmates in Virginia could go right into Federal habeas if they do not get any help?
1988.88-411,1,26356,gerald_t_zerkin,,3107.556,3113.34,"Well, it creates an interesting dilemma, and it is somewhat responsive to what Justice Kennedy asked before."
1988.88-411,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3144.562,3146.531,"Thank you, Mr. Zerkin."
1988.88-411,2,39532,robert_q_harris,,3150.466,3152.167,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.88-411,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3236.904,3242.475,"Mr. Harris, can I ask you, this problem of delay troubles everyone interested in this area."
1988.88-411,2,39532,robert_q_harris,,3253.716,3255.216,"That is a rough average, and--"
1988.88-411,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3255.216,3261.536,"What, in your judgment, causes that delay?"
1988.88-411,2,39532,robert_q_harris,,3265.321,3273.075,"--No, usually the first State habeas corpus petition would be filed rather promptly after the denial of cert.--"
1988.88-411,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3278.879,3288.603,So then it is about seven or so years between the filing of the first State collateral proceeding and the conclusion of both that proceeding and whatever Federal proceedings there are?
1988.88-411,2,39532,robert_q_harris,,3288.603,3290.736,I cannot explain any one item.
1988.88-411,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3290.736,3299.709,"Is one part of the proceeding more slow, more difficult to conclude than another, do you know?"
1988.88-411,2,39532,robert_q_harris,,3299.709,3301.244,I do not see any one area as being particularly difficult.
1988.88-411,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3301.711,3303.529,"In some States, it is the direct review that is very slow."
1988.88-411,2,39532,robert_q_harris,,3309.183,3310.933,--It is an expedited process in Virginia.
1988.88-411,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3325.459,3329.846,"They start the first proceeding promptly, and it still takes six years?"
1988.88-411,2,39532,robert_q_harris,,3329.846,3333.315,"Well, I will give you an example... Mr. Giarratano's case in this."
1988.88-411,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3364.234,3367.286,It pended in the district court for five years?
1988.88-411,2,39532,robert_q_harris,,3367.286,3383.812,"That habeas action pended, was interrupted on several occasions... the last occasion that it was interrupted was, Mr. Giarratano added another claim which made a mixed petition, and he was allowed to go back to State court to file a second State petition while the district court kept the Federal action open."
1988.88-411,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3445.433,3453.539,I suppose we have to look at the experience in other States... a lot of States do provide counsel in this proceeding... and see if they have in fact been slowed up by the process you described.
1988.88-411,2,39532,robert_q_harris,,3453.539,3459.426,"Well, again, we are talking about a system in Virgin where the delay is not caused by an absence of counsel."
1988.88-411,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3470.115,3471.15,I do not understand that.
1988.88-411,2,39532,robert_q_harris,,3477.487,3484.208,"If we are creating a new Constitutional right to counsel, presumably there will be some right to seek redress in some court if you have a claim against that counsel, even under--"
1988.88-411,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3484.208,3487.493,"Well, all I am saying is that is true in a lot of other States right now."
1988.88-411,2,39532,robert_q_harris,,3501.483,3506.137,"--No, I am talking about an extra right to an additional collateral review of collateral counsel."
1988.88-411,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3506.137,3507.989,"Well, they have that... why do they not have that in Florida?"
1988.88-411,2,39532,robert_q_harris,,3507.989,3509.056,Florida has made that decision.
1988.88-411,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3512.591,3519.631,"But I am just saying, under your argument, it must be true that Florida has a lot more delay than Virginia does, because they have this extra right."
1988.88-411,2,39532,robert_q_harris,,3520.981,3527.301,--But they have not given them that State-created remedy of attacking collateral counsel.
1988.88-411,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3527.301,3531.521,"I do not know why it is not a State-created remedy there, any more than it would be here."
1988.88-411,2,39532,robert_q_harris,,3541.96,3549.483,"Florida gives them a representative for their actions, but it has specifically said, we did not mean to create another layer of litigation by doing that."
1988.88-411,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3549.483,3550.683,Yes.
1988.88-411,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3550.683,3551.716,"Thank you, Mr. Harris."
