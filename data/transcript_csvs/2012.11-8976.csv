2012.11-8976,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.404,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-8976, Smith v. United States."
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,8.404,11.022,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-8976,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,73.262,75.964,"Yes, but that -- is that an element of the crime?"
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,75.964,77.13,No.
2012.11-8976,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,82.701,84.301,"It has to be raised by the defendant, right?"
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,84.301,86.403,--It does have to be raised initially--
2012.11-8976,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,86.403,88.188,Which means it's not an element.
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,100.746,111.017,"--Well, I don't -- it is not an element, I agree with that; but it is -- I would say that it's engrafted onto every Federal criminal statute by statute."
2012.11-8976,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,127.979,135.3,But you could prove the crime without a reasonable -- beyond a reasonable doubt if you never raised the statute of limitations.
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,163.152,164.736,--I think several reasons.
2012.11-8976,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,228.262,247.223,"But you -- I think you -- you recognized that -- that the defendant has the burden of production, not the Government, the burden -- burden of coming forward with this defense and producing some evidence of the withdrawal."
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,247.223,263.768,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, we do accept that there is a burden of production as with several other things that are not affirmative defenses like entrapment or alibi, also have a burden of production before the Government has to prove the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt."
2012.11-8976,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,264.785,266.054,Mr. -- I'm sorry.
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,266.704,274.057,"--It's -- it's not dissimilar to those in that respect, and it does go to negate an element of the crime."
2012.11-8976,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,283.163,287.133,Not -- only for the later period.
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,311.265,312.249,That's true.
2012.11-8976,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,326.092,328.127,Isn't that like an amnesty?
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,329.827,334.948,"There are some cases that call it an amnesty, some cases call it an extinguishment of liability."
2012.11-8976,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,334.948,345.554,What is the difference between the two in your mind that makes it an element of the crime or a negation of some element of the crime?
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,345.554,354.944,"In a conspiracy there is the conspiracy that -- the Government has to prove obviously the conspiracy itself, which is an agreement between -- it can be anyone."
2012.11-8976,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,358.829,366.752,"So you are a member, you are liable for all the foreseeable acts of your coconspirators, whether or not you knew they were going to happen, so long as they were foreseeable?"
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,366.752,368.269,"Yes, under Pinkerton, yes."
2012.11-8976,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,368.269,374.906,And you can be liable for as long as you stay until you prove you withdrew.
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,374.906,375.775,Until--
2012.11-8976,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,375.775,380.493,And that extinguishes your liability for the continuing conspiracy.
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,380.493,384.381,"--I would say until you produce evidence that you withdrew, yes."
2012.11-8976,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,391.368,391.901,Why?
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,391.901,393.902,This Court has never said in Hyde--
2012.11-8976,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,393.902,401.14,"The why is, once you've joined, you are trying to extinguish liability."
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,410.429,417.685,"--I think, Justice Sotomayor, that it's really no different than if the Government has to prove you guilty of a crime in the first place."
2012.11-8976,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,426.708,436.063,"Well, your argument basically reduces to the fact that when it comes to the statute of limitations, you treat the conspirators as individuals rather than as members of the conspiracy."
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,436.063,437.013,--Yes.
2012.11-8976,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,437.013,441.55,"Well, that's not true with respect to other aspects of the conspiracy."
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,461.297,464.166,He would be treated for the withdrawal purpose.
2012.11-8976,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,472.237,482.894,"No, my point is that once you prove the conspiracy, a member who doesn't -- it doesn't actually participate in the activities of the conspiracy is still responsible for them."
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,489.114,492.066,"Well, I think actually it's just the opposite."
2012.11-8976,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,506.576,516.781,"But what the Chief Justice indicates, it seems to me, is that if we accept your view, then there is going to be a different statute of limitations for each member of the conspiracy."
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,524.954,536.845,"Well, actually in this case there was different statutes of -- I believe there were three different statute of limitations that the district court instructed the jury about because there were superseding indictments and people were indicted at different times."
2012.11-8976,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,556.342,570.268,"What is -- is there any -- I'm trying to find an analogous instance without the statute of limitations, and what occurred to me just as an example that you might have in your practice found a different one, the Thomas Crown Affair."
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,595.551,610.893,"I do, and I think that an argument can be made if the intent -- if one of the elements of that offense is to deprive the owner permanently of the property and he did not have that intent, the Government would have to prove what it would have to prove originally, which is that he intended to deprive the--"
2012.11-8976,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,610.893,628.272,"So you have never found a case -- I will ask the Government this -- in the substantive criminal law, no matter what, who is -- even if the defendant is the only one ever likely to know anything about it, you've never found a case where once the burden is produced, the burden of persuasion remains on the defendant?"
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,628.272,631.641,--That the burden of persuasion remains on the defendant?
2012.11-8976,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,631.641,634.426,"Yes, because you agree the defendant has the burden of production here."
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,634.426,634.776,Yes.
2012.11-8976,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,634.776,651.82,"And so I was trying to think of some instance -- as I said, I would be repeating myself -- I am looking for any instance in which, leaving the statute of limitations out, the burden of persuasion shifts to the defendant; so I'm saying did you ever find one?"
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,656.041,658.024,"Well, I guess--"
2012.11-8976,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,658.024,658.274,Have you heard of it?
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,659.243,665.147,"--Self defense and duress, as the Court said in Dixon dealing with duress, because it did not negate the elements of the offense."
2012.11-8976,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,667.682,674.836,This is not -- this does not negate the elements of the defense -- this does not negate the elements of the crime.
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,674.836,682.073,"--If it doesn't negate the elements of the crime, I would say then this Court has classified it as an affirmative defense."
2012.11-8976,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,682.073,682.441,All right.
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,698.968,700.653,"Well, I don't think, first of all--"
2012.11-8976,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,700.653,702.27,And how do you prove it?
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,702.27,712.811,"--that the Government has shown -- well, first of all, they -- they have to prove nothing more than what they would have to prove originally, that the defendant was joined -- knowingly and willfully joined the conspiracy."
2012.11-8976,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,712.811,714.83,But you would have the Government prove that twice.
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,722.983,726.118,"No, they would not have to prove that twice."
2012.11-8976,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,751.753,759.441,What would you -- what would you have to produce to get over your threshold of satisfying the burden of production?
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,759.441,762.81,"It's actually, I think, quite a high burden of production."
2012.11-8976,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,789.811,797.901,"That's why it's very difficult to put the burden on the government, because the people -- he says, well, I told so and so I'm out of this business, I'm not going to do it any more."
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,814.326,817.195,"--No, I disagree with that."
2012.11-8976,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,838.775,839.359,They often do.
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,873.13,877.484,"--The defendant -- as I understand it, the defendant has to -- and, of course, it could vary by state."
2012.11-8976,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,877.484,878.2,"Yes, of course."
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,878.75,879.584,The states may put different burdens.
2012.11-8976,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,880.102,880.636,"Yeah, yeah."
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,880.636,887.755,--the defendant has the burden by a preponderance to prove the duress defense or the self-defense defense.
2012.11-8976,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,887.755,888.005,All right.
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,891.374,902.615,"It's not though in the sense that the only thing that connects an individual defendant to a conspiracy is that defendant's membership, knowing and willful participation in the conspiracy."
2012.11-8976,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,902.615,917.959,"The fact that there is a statute of limitations makes your case weaker, not stronger, because -- because the statute of limitations is most directly connected to the elements of the offense than is self-defense or duress."
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,917.959,928.499,I actually think it makes it stronger in the sense that Congress has made this choice to require that every crime be proved to have been committed within the statute of limitations.
2012.11-8976,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,928.499,939.39,"You say that you have to prove that the defendant was knowing and willfully a member of the conspiracy, right?"
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,939.39,940.04,That was the--
2012.11-8976,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,940.04,940.607,That's what you said.
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,940.607,942.176,--That was the jury instructions in this case.
2012.11-8976,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,942.176,945.628,"And you agree that that's the rule of law, right?"
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,945.628,945.878,Yes.
2012.11-8976,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,945.878,948.044,Doesn't duress eliminate willfully?
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,948.044,966.023,"The Court said in Dixon -- it might, to my thinking, but the Court said in Dixon that it did not negate any of the elements of the offense, that she had to do the acts knowingly and willfully in Dixon and that it did not negate those elements."
2012.11-8976,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,966.023,967.041,Why is that different from this?
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,979.699,987.455,Because the only way a defendant can prove -- the way a defendant shows that he withdrew is to produce evidence of withdrawal.
2012.11-8976,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,998.477,1000.863,"Well, I'm having trouble understanding how your argument would work."
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,1033.117,1035.686,"No, I don't think they have to disprove the conversation."
2012.11-8976,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1045.625,1050.111,But how can they prove that he did not withdraw at any other time during this conspiracy?
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,1050.111,1052.813,As in this case they had a number--
2012.11-8976,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1052.813,1054.03,Between the statute of limitations.
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,1054.03,1060.651,--As in this case they had a number of cooperating witnesses who testified about Mr. Smith's actions.
2012.11-8976,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1069.423,1073.311,Aren't you transforming the nature of withdrawal?
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,1088.003,1088.354,--No.
2012.11-8976,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1109.934,1113.436,What evidence of withdrawal did you produce in this case?
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,1113.436,1129.23,"--In this particular case it was the -- well, it was the jury that actually called the issue to the attention of everybody in the first place by sending out a note saying that if we -- the conspiracy continued but we think a defendant left, must we find him not guilty?"
2012.11-8976,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1138.003,1139.536,That doesn't prove that he withdrew.
2012.11-8976,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1139.536,1145.323,But you agree -- you agree that that would not have necessarily meant withdrawal.
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,1145.323,1150.561,"--No, there are some circuit cases that say that alone may be enough, but there was more in this case."
2012.11-8976,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1176.628,1178.661,Which of those are affirmative actions?
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,1197.456,1206.562,"--Whatever that may be, it's not an issue in this case in the sense that the government is actually the one who requested that the district court give the withdrawal instruction after the jury's note."
2012.11-8976,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1206.562,1207.079,Maybe not.
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,1208.597,1223.523,"I think that whether this qualified as affirmative acts or not is, in a sense, irrelevant to the question before the Court, because after the jury's note came out, the government itself requested the withdrawal instruction."
2012.11-8976,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1234.146,1234.596,Mr. Kramer--
2012.11-8976,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1234.596,1238.533,I'm -- I'm having trouble understanding how this works.
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,1256.327,1265.933,"The government can just say -- they can rest on the fact that the proof outside the membership period, and rest on the inference from Hyde that his membership continued."
2012.11-8976,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1265.933,1273.021,"Well, how is that -- how is that carrying the burden that you say is on it to prove the absence of withdrawal beyond a reasonable doubt?"
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,1277.091,1284.562,"I think -- I think they can by just saying to -- well, I don't think they have a burden to prove the absence of withdrawal."
2012.11-8976,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1288.299,1289.649,But they have already done that.
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,1290.133,1293.351,"Within the limitations, his membership within the period."
2012.11-8976,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1301.49,1301.756,"--No, no, no."
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,1324.556,1327.691,I think it's up to the jury whether to believe that evidence or not.
2012.11-8976,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1329.876,1331.06,Believe what evidence?
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,1331.06,1335.446,--The evidence that was produced by the defendant that he actually told somebody he--
2012.11-8976,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1335.446,1340.565,But there can't be any evidence because nobody is willing to testify under -- because they invoked their Fifth Amendment rights.
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,1340.565,1341.017,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
2012.11-8976,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1352.825,1364.798,"Well, if the defendant does testify, and he says, I told the ringleader I want out, is an attack on his credibility sufficient to prove the absence of withdrawal beyond a reasonable doubt?"
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,1364.798,1365.648,--Absolutely.
2012.11-8976,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1384.343,1386.645,They didn't have to prove within the limitations period.
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,1397.769,1398.186,Yes.
2012.11-8976,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1398.186,1401.554,You acknowledge that that is an affirmative defense.
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,1420.183,1421.052,I--
2012.11-8976,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1421.052,1422.018,I can't understand that.
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,1426.854,1433.443,"--I mean, an alibi or entrapment negate elements are not affirmative defenses."
2012.11-8976,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1438.644,1448.202,--But that's not an affirmative -- I want an example of something which is an affirmative defense and where the proof of that affirmative defense becomes an element.
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,1448.202,1450.019,--I may have given the wrong impression.
2012.11-8976,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1457.058,1460.677,Why does it have to be contained in the indictment if it's an element?
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,1460.677,1462.712,"It's not -- well, it's not an element."
2012.11-8976,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1464.929,1468.081,Why is it up to the defendant to raise it if it's an element?
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,1468.081,1484.892,"--I think in Ledbetter this Court said that although there doesn't have to be a date in the indictment, the government -- it's sufficient if the government proves a date before the indictment within the limitations period, this Court specifically referred to in Ledbetter, which is at page 21 of our brief."
2012.11-8976,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1492.814,1494.464,That at least is logical.
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,1496.65,1497.802,"--Well, I'm halfway there."
2012.11-8976,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1498.485,1507.491,I actually thought your stronger argument in your brief was in trying to explain why it negated an element.
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,1524.452,1533.225,"That is -- that is the heart of our argument, that it negates the element of membership within the statutory period which is what the government has to prove."
2012.11-8976,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1544.681,1547.699,But the government doesn't have to prove within the statutory period.
2012.11-8976,0,16322,a_j_kramer,,1553.52,1556.405,"--Well, I think it is up to the government to prove it."
2012.11-8976,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1572.433,1573.2,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1579.52,1581.556,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court::"
2012.11-8976,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1620.264,1621.064,Ms. Harrington--
2012.11-8976,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1621.064,1638.559,"This is true, but his point, basic point, and he has responded to the points I've made, is that, of course if there is a five-year statute on robbery, it doesn't help the government that he create -- he committed a robbery before."
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1638.559,1639.827,Correct.
2012.11-8976,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1639.827,1649.266,So he's saying what you charged in the indictment is that he was a member of a conspiracy that existed between 1995 and 2005.
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1706.634,1707.886,So I guess I have two responses.
2012.11-8976,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1719.425,1724.729,"In other words, you can charge me or anybody in the audience or anybody here with what?"
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1732.601,1733.384,"--He does, and there's no--"
2012.11-8976,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1733.384,1734.234,And that's an element of the crime?
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1734.234,1740.204,"--And an -- but when Petitioner talks about the membership or participation element, what he is really talking about is the agreement element."
2012.11-8976,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1748.894,1762.367,"There is no more relevance, is there, to the fact that there happened to be a pre-1995 conspiracy, except as a matter of proof, I shouldn't say relevance, that he happened to rob a bank before 1995?"
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1793.756,1795.624,"--But again, the element is agreement."
2012.11-8976,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1805.746,1807.182,"--So, how do we tell that, Ms. Harrington?"
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1842.605,1849.092,"--Well, we know it's not an element for the reasons I explained, because it doesn't have to be charged in the indictment, it doesn't have to be proved in every case, the defendant can waive it."
2012.11-8976,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1891.769,1897.49,Didn't the government charge in the indictment that the conspiracy existed during this five-year period?
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1897.49,1897.906,--Yes.
2012.11-8976,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1897.906,1899.34,During the particular five-year period.
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1899.34,1899.723,Yes.
2012.11-8976,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1899.723,1901.042,Did it have to do that?
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1901.042,1903.977,"It did not have to do that, but there's no dispute--"
2012.11-8976,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1903.977,1911.981,"And if it did not have to, it would have been up to the defendant to say: The statute of limitations runs on my participation, right?"
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1911.981,1920.736,"--To be clear, I'm not sure it specifically used that phrase, but it charged -- it charged overt acts that were part of the conspiracy that happened within the five-year period."
2012.11-8976,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1920.736,1926.49,But it -- it didn't say the conspiracy only existed within that five-year period?
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1926.49,1930.377,"I'm not sure what -- I'm not sure exactly the language that is used in the indictment, but it--"
2012.11-8976,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1930.377,1931.227,"Well, let's assume it did."
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1953.558,1962.765,--This Court -- this Court has held since the Cook case that the -- the government does not have to charge that satisfaction of the limitations period in the indictment.
2012.11-8976,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1962.765,1965.198,"So it's -- it's up to the defendant to say, no--"
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1965.198,1965.883,It's up to the defendant--
2012.11-8976,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1965.883,1966.633,--seven years is too long.
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1966.633,1967.0,"--to raise it, right."
2012.11-8976,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1967.0,1977.608,So I guess the issue here is whether the government's statement that the conspiracy existed within this five-year period causes that to be an element of the crime?
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1977.608,1981.493,"But I think this part has been clear, that it doesn't cause it to be an element of the crime."
2012.11-8976,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1991.665,1992.867,But what if it is?
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1992.867,1994.55,--But what if it is?
2012.11-8976,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1995.652,1997.235,If it is charged in the indictment?
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1997.235,2000.454,--Then that doesn't -- that doesn't cause it to be an element of the crime.
2012.11-8976,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2012.078,2016.815,What he's saying is that it wasn't proven to be within the limitations period with respect to him.
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2016.815,2033.825,"That's true, but once the -- it's true that that's his argument, but once the government has proved that he willingly joined the conspiracy, which it did in this case, then the law presumes that every person who has willingly joined the conspiracy remains a member of an ongoing conspiracy unless or until he takes some affirmative action to withdraw from the conspiracy."
2012.11-8976,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2033.825,2040.097,"I mean, I am looking at it as a puzzle here, because I think you could look at it either way."
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2089.745,2090.364,But it can't--
2012.11-8976,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2090.364,2094.232,And I'm -- I'm sort of -- I'm torn here.
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2096.434,2103.421,"--I mean, I think it can't be an element of the crime because if the defendant doesn't raise it, the government doesn't have to prove it or disprove it, depending on how you look at it."
2012.11-8976,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2104.121,2105.123,"No, that isn't true."
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2106.406,2107.991,--You have to prove membership--
2012.11-8976,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2107.991,2110.943,And it happens in this instance that you bring in a prima facie case.
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2118.431,2131.791,"--But withdrawal does not negate membership, because again, membership is really just the agreement, and in fact a withdrawal defense tends to confirm that a particular defendant agreed to join a conspiracy, because there is nothing to withdraw from if he didn't join--"
2012.11-8976,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2131.791,2142.479,"But then the withdrawal prior to the time charged negates membership in the conspiracy that you have charged, because there was no membership during that time."
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2142.479,2147.866,"--It's true, but the government has to prove that the defendant joined the conspiracy and the conspiracy continued to exist and to bring you back to the Hyde--"
2012.11-8976,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2147.866,2163.643,"Counsel, in a normal case where it's a robbery or burglary, whatever, you charge the crime happened in X date, and the defendant raises an affirmative defense that it's not within the statute of limitations."
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2168.447,2171.399,--This Court stated in Grunewald that the government bears the burden.
2012.11-8976,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2171.399,2172.099,All right.
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2184.473,2187.408,Yes.
2012.11-8976,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2187.408,2206.239,"Because -- and you still have to prove -- you're saying that the elements of the statute of limitation there are that there was an agreement to commit a crime, this person joined it at any time during the conspiracy, and the conspiracy continues."
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2206.239,2207.555,Right.
2012.11-8976,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2207.555,2217.547,You don't have to prove that the defendant was part of that conspiracy or joined that conspiracy during the statute of limitations; that's your point.
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2217.547,2234.556,"We don't have to prove that he -- that the agreement happened in the limitations period or that any particular defendant did something to sort of re-agree within the limitations period; and that again is clear from this Court's decision in Hyde, where in that case the defendant raising the limitations defense had not done anything related to the conspiracy within the limitations period."
2012.11-8976,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2234.556,2245.364,"I think his intuitive argument is, I can't be responsible for a crime I wasn't a part of during the limitations period."
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2267.812,2268.612,"Well, what the statute--"
2012.11-8976,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2268.612,2270.847,--I think that that's the simplicity of his argument.
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2270.847,2273.799,--It -- that is the simplified version of his argument.
2012.11-8976,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2275.233,2277.585,So simplify your response to me.
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2278.218,2278.935,--Okay.
2012.11-8976,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2282.739,2283.539,That's not a simple response.
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2286.274,2288.159,--What we have to prove is that the crime was committed within the limitations period.
2012.11-8976,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2302.366,2312.024,Isn't it essential to your argument that the very definition of a conspiracy is a crime that continues over time?
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2312.024,2312.741,Absolutely.
2012.11-8976,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2339.909,2343.443,I wish I had -- we had the supervening indictment.
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2346.479,2347.347,It's very long.
2012.11-8976,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2347.347,2351.983,But it -- it's described in the court of appeals opinion as follows:
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2387.472,2389.691,It was charged as an ongoing conspiracy.
2012.11-8976,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2391.46,2391.81,That's right.
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2399.114,2400.149,That's right.
2012.11-8976,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2401.316,2402.649,I suspect I agree.
2012.11-8976,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2423.23,2424.597,"It's a jackalope, maybe."
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2426.364,2427.049,--That's really a rabbit.
2012.11-8976,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2427.049,2439.857,"--Yet it's so rare that the government doesn't have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt, that it suggests when in doubt, say reasonable doubt."
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2446.261,2448.047,Insanity is another.
2012.11-8976,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2448.047,2448.713,Insanity.
2012.11-8976,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2448.713,2449.78,Anything else?
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2449.78,2452.332,Extreme emotional disturbance.
2012.11-8976,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2457.319,2468.876,"Ms. Harrington, would you agree that as this argument is developing, what really is at issue has less to do with the statute of limitations than the nature of conspiracy?"
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2533.986,2549.661,"The view established by this Court is that the crime of conspiracy continues, and once a person joins the conspiracy he or she is liable for all the acts of his co-conspirators that were reasonably foreseeable in furtherance of the conspiracy; and that is true even if that person, once he joins the conspiracy, doesn't ever do anything else--"
2012.11-8976,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2549.661,2565.271,"Yes, but you recognize -- you recognize, as I think Justice Alito's question doesn't, that there is -- there is a withdrawal defense and the question is how do you allocate the proof burden."
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2600.778,2601.994,--That's right.
2012.11-8976,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2628.928,2636.599,"And I suppose a conspiracy is defined by relation to its criminal objects, not to its membership."
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2651.591,2657.309,"No, this Court has said the opposite, has said that, you know, people can come and go in a conspiracy and--"
2012.11-8976,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2657.309,2659.411,Because it's the criminal objects that define the conspiracy.
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2659.411,2660.028,--That's right.
2012.11-8976,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2662.797,2665.832,But you've indicted -- you haven't indicted a conspiracy.
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2675.207,2676.007,Because once--
2012.11-8976,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2676.007,2682.71,At least when he comes forward with -- under the burden of production with evidence suggesting the opposite.
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2682.71,2696.203,"--Well, again, if we can take the due process part off the table because we think it's not an element of lack of withdrawal, then you ask sort of, you know, what -- how would Congress have understood the state of the law to be when it enacted these crimes, that's how the Court approached this question as to duress in Dixon."
2012.11-8976,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2710.194,2715.765,"Well, but Mr. Kramer says it's not that big a deal, I mean, you don't have to do -- he says you don't have to do anything at all."
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2715.765,2719.818,--I think that's kind of a remarkable assertion.
2012.11-8976,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2735.995,2740.732,Suppose this thing doesn't come up in the -- in the statute of limitations context.
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2769.549,2771.334,Your cases don't say anything about that.
2012.11-8976,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2773.286,2773.62,And I didn't hear you.
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2773.62,2780.957,"--Your cases don't say anything about that question, so our view would be that the -- the burden stays on the defendant to prove that he withdrew from a conspiracy in that context."
2012.11-8976,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2787.094,2789.38,Nothing to do with statute of limitations.
2012.11-8976,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2789.38,2790.63,Justice Kennedy.
2012.11-8976,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2790.63,2793.848,I was just -- I was curious.
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2809.025,2810.209,"No, we -- we do rely on that."
2012.11-8976,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2812.843,2814.545,"Well, that was -- it was kind of a throwaway line."
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2819.232,2820.382,"--No, I think it is dispositive."
2012.11-8976,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2839.194,2842.515,"All of this is questions for the jury under -- under the Petitioners' view, right?"
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2842.515,2843.531,"Yes, certainly."
2012.11-8976,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2851.102,2854.488,"Could I make sure I understand one part of your argument, Ms. Harrington."
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2879.103,2879.636,Not.
2012.11-8976,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2879.636,2885.274,And so you are essentially saying that this case should be treated just as every other case.
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2896.897,2898.081,It's never an element.
2012.11-8976,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2911.907,2918.745,"Why is it then -- I mean, why would Grunewald be right, that you do have the burden if in fact this isn't an element?"
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2918.745,2924.632,I think just because it is an -- it is a burden that is placed on the government by Congress in Section 3282.
2012.11-8976,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3024.744,3032.434,"Well, but that last point seems to me spurious itself, because to prove withdrawal, he's got to accept the fact that he was in the conspiracy in the first place."
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3043.892,3064.388,"--But in cases where -- such as this where a defendant goes through a period of inaction with respect to the conspiracy, which this Court said in Hyde is not enough to withdraw, then there would be an incentive to raise a spurious assertion of withdrawal, because it would require the government to sort of -- to rebut that by proving that the defendant had done something within that period, which it doesn't have to prove in order to establish liability."
2012.11-8976,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3064.388,3069.59,I suppose he could present his defense in the alternative.
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3077.196,3077.896,He certainly can.
2012.11-8976,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3080.079,3086.835,"Well, but I mean, that works in a civil case, but I mean, in a criminal case, it's kind of a big thing to say -- begin my first argument is that"
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3094.239,3094.656,It's true.
2012.11-8976,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3128.079,3130.879,You have -- you have to prove that every defendant did?
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3130.879,3137.951,"That every defendant willingly joined the conspiracy, yes, with the understanding that they were advancing some illegal objective, the objective of the conspiracy."
2012.11-8976,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3139.97,3149.242,"Let me -- so you charge ten people as participating in this conspiracy and the jury determines that one wasn't, then everybody's off the hook?"
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3149.242,3149.992,"--No, no, no."
2012.11-8976,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3150.892,3152.277,So you don't have to prove--
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3152.277,3154.646,"To prove liability for each person, you have to prove that that person--"
2012.11-8976,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3154.646,3155.162,--Yes.
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3155.162,3155.896,--satisfied all these things.
2012.11-8976,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3156.262,3156.996,You have to treat them as individuals.
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3156.996,3157.462,"--That's what I meant, yes, yes."
2012.11-8976,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3157.462,3160.131,Which is what your friend is trying to argue for in this case.
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3160.131,3166.87,But that is -- this is high evidentiary burden that the government has to bear to prove that each defendant took some affirmative action to get into the conspiracy.
2012.11-8976,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3184.748,3192.319,"Is this -- the burden allocation, is this a more hypothetical academic question?"
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3213.449,3216.368,"I mean, it would not have made a difference in this case for the reasons you suggest."
2012.11-8976,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3243.62,3249.358,"Well, when you say it wouldn't have made a difference in this case, you're basically saying you had some good evidence."
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3251.558,3252.56,"Oh, it certainly could have; right."
2012.11-8976,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3255.262,3260.314,"Well, but I think it's a little much to say it wouldn't make a difference because the jury would definitely have ruled in your favor."
2012.11-8976,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3260.314,3260.58,--Okay.
2012.11-8976,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3266.3,3269.771,"Thank you, Ms. Harrington."
2012.11-8976,2,16322,a_j_kramer,,3271.804,3272.504,Thank you.
2012.11-8976,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3292.163,3294.499,"Well, that's because they thought that you had the burden."
2012.11-8976,2,16322,a_j_kramer,,3319.899,3329.338,The -- the government could just rest on whatever they had presented originally and tell the jury that's plenty to prove beyond -- to meet our burden of proof.
2012.11-8976,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3329.338,3334.159,"Well, if you make an assertion and they don't really respond to the assertion and -- you win."
2012.11-8976,2,16322,a_j_kramer,,3334.159,3336.092,"It -- I mean, it happens all the time."
2012.11-8976,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3352.62,3372.784,"I think the crux of your argument is that the government is going to have to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, active participation in the conspiracy during the statute of limitations period, because it is impossible for the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that on no day during a five-year period did the defendant withdraw from the conspiracy."
2012.11-8976,2,16322,a_j_kramer,,3380.455,3387.543,"--All they have to prove, Justice Alito, is that the person was a member of the conspiracy within the limitations period."
2012.11-8976,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3395.363,3396.815,And say what?
2012.11-8976,2,16322,a_j_kramer,,3399.684,3400.151,--No.
2012.11-8976,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3400.151,3402.303,--the opposite of what they have to prove?
2012.11-8976,2,16322,a_j_kramer,,3402.303,3402.653,No.
2012.11-8976,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3410.206,3418.912,I thought you argue that every day that there is -- that something has to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt because the prosecution hasn't provided sufficient evidence?
2012.11-8976,2,16322,a_j_kramer,,3418.912,3419.262,It is.
2012.11-8976,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3430.453,3439.726,"Well, Mr. Kramer, if they really have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there is membership in the conspiracy during the limitations period, they couldn't just come in and say,"
2012.11-8976,2,16322,a_j_kramer,,3449.665,3451.082,--They get a permissive inference.
2012.11-8976,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3463.239,3469.578,Couldn't you argue they have the burden of proving that the defendant did not withdraw during this five-year period?
2012.11-8976,2,16322,a_j_kramer,,3480.734,3482.136,Of course--
2012.11-8976,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3482.136,3483.436,You can make that argument?
2012.11-8976,2,16322,a_j_kramer,,3483.436,3484.005,--Yes.
2012.11-8976,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3489.64,3497.145,"Your -- I'm sorry, the Thomas Crown Affair again, all the evidence shows he took $10,000 from the bank."
2012.11-8976,2,16322,a_j_kramer,,3505.501,3506.351,--Right.
2012.11-8976,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3506.351,3506.751,Yes.
2012.11-8976,2,16322,a_j_kramer,,3506.751,3513.607,"I mean, and that happens every day, I think, in cases where the prosecution just stands up and says,"
2012.11-8976,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3519.761,3520.328,"Thank you, counsel."
