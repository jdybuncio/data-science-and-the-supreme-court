1993.92-1223,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.456,"We'll hear argument now in No. 92-1223, United States Department of Defense v. Federal Labor Relations Authority."
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,11.239,13.974,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1223,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,140.805,152.512,"And yet it's true that every circuit so construed this complex of statutes until this Court's decision in Reporters Committee, is that not right?"
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,152.512,158.333,"That's correct, Your Honor, and the Fifth Circuit noted that in its decision in this case."
1993.92-1223,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,176.664,182.65,It was... it was more than collective bargaining interests in itself.
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,184.967,186.185,That's correct.
1993.92-1223,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,207.683,215.205,So do I take it that your position is that the labor management relations statute counts for nothing?
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,237.135,239.154,That's how we read the... that's how we read the statutes.
1993.92-1223,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,275.077,276.11,Why does that... why does that follow?
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,289.503,298.525,"--Well, it's... unless this Court goes back on what it says in Reporters Committee, the identity of the requester makes no difference."
1993.92-1223,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,311.666,316.904,"But in Reporters Committee there was no other Federal statute that came into play, was there?"
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,316.904,326.176,"--Well, Your Honor, in Reporters Committee the Court... the Court emphasized that there's a very strong public interest in learning about anyone's criminal history."
1993.92-1223,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,327.962,334.116,There was nothing comparable to the... that was a straight FOIA request by the Reporters Committee.
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,348.274,350.225,Let me... let me make two responses there.
1993.92-1223,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,388.797,409.025,I took it to be one of the bases of our decision in Reporters Committee that the personnel at agencies who have to deal with FOIA requests cannot be expected to inquire into the individuated needs of each requester.
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,440.163,444.8,"Well, I... the U.S. Code is pretty big these days."
1993.92-1223,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,456.941,460.826,"Well, what other statutes would be called into play, for example?"
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,460.826,463.345,--If some--
1993.92-1223,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,463.345,463.878,Are there many?
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,464.595,475.152,"--If someone made a FOIA request, I'm sure they could... since the Federal Government is involved in so many things these days, I'm sure that they could... they could... people could make claims."
1993.92-1223,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,492.531,508.706,"--Well, I suppose that the... that the inconvenience or the impracticality for the... for the FOIA processor is not simply the number of statutes, but rather the necessity of figuring out who the requestor is."
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,508.706,510.742,Well that--
1993.92-1223,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,510.742,526.585,"Even if there are only a few statutes, you would add to the FOIA process the necessity of determining that this is, indeed, a labor union or a labor union officer, or whatever other individual is the beneficiary of one particular Federal statute or another, whereas currently you don't have to know who the requestor is."
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,527.568,530.454,"--Well, you know, we look at this as a Privacy Act case."
1993.92-1223,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,592.158,595.943,"I don't find it very appealing as a Privacy Act case, to tell you the truth, Mr. Wright."
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,639.167,642.971,"Well, if I can make both a legal and an equitable argument to that point."
1993.92-1223,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,730.16,748.788,"On your... on your first argument, the Privacy Act applies to the public sector and not the private sector, but the... the union, it applies to the public sector, but in the interests of private people as well as public employees, right, the Privacy Act?"
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,748.788,749.99,That's true.
1993.92-1223,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,749.99,757.227,"So it's, as far as the employee is concerned, a little hard to distinguish the situation of the employee."
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,757.227,764.148,"Well, Federal employees are protected by the Privacy Act and private employees, as employees, are not."
1993.92-1223,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,765.648,777.122,"Because they happen to work for a Federal agency, not because there's something about their employee status that would require... that indicates a congressional policy to give them greater protection."
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,777.122,782.276,"--Well, the... the Privacy Act applies in the... to Federal employees."
1993.92-1223,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,784.676,798.969,"And so does the labor management relations statute, which would otherwise make this information... at least that's a given in this case, isn't it, that were it not for the reference to the Privacy Act, that this information would be relevant to the collective bargaining function--"
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,798.969,799.552,"Yeah, we--"
1993.92-1223,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,799.552,800.371,--And therefore discloseable?
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,800.371,803.356,--We haven't challenged the FLRA's decision in that respect.
1993.92-1223,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,805.475,813.129,"That's another factor in this case, of course, is not only is this request arguably supported by a statute."
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,829.84,831.79,--I'm not sure.
1993.92-1223,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,851.435,851.935,I agree.
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,868.195,873.948,"Well, the FLRA also agrees with us, I might... might mention, that the phrase"
1993.92-1223,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,920.412,922.262,But that happens in the private sector.
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,922.262,922.845,That's true.
1993.92-1223,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,964.089,975.461,"Did Congress... in the private sector area, is it a provision of the National Labor Relations Act that unions have to provided with the home addresses of employees?"
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,976.23,977.63,"No, that's not in the... that's--"
1993.92-1223,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,977.63,978.613,--That's a determination--
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,978.613,979.849,--Of the board.
1993.92-1223,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,979.849,983.467,"--Probably not by rulemaking, but by adjudication, right, of the National Labor Relations Board?"
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,983.467,983.717,Yeah.
1993.92-1223,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,985.167,992.323,And presumably you think... do you think... do you think the National Labor Relations Board might come out the other way on that subject and still... and still be upheld by this Court?
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,992.323,995.206,Could the... could the board decide that--
1993.92-1223,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,995.206,1005.463,"That there's enough of a privacy interest on the part of... on the part of private citizens, that their home addresses should not be given by private sector... to private sector--"
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1005.463,1006.213,"--Of course, they haven't come out that way."
1993.92-1223,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1007.179,1010.581,"--If they did, do you think it would contravene the Federal Labor Relations Act?"
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1010.581,1012.033,--You mean--
1993.92-1223,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1012.033,1013.283,I mean the National Labor Relations Act.
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1013.283,1013.65,--No.
1993.92-1223,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1015.469,1025.175,So you can't really say that there is a congressional policy in the private sector that would permit what we are... would not be permitting here if we took your position.
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1028.108,1036.031,"--Well, I certainly think it's fine for the National Labor Relations Board to consider privacy interests, but it's not directed by the Privacy Act to do so."
1993.92-1223,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1043.935,1048.003,"Mr. Wright, would you just help me out on the private sector law and the private sector."
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1068.299,1068.465,Yes.
1993.92-1223,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1070.282,1070.865,Both--
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1070.865,1072.084,--During an election campaign time.
1993.92-1223,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1072.084,1075.786,--Do you have that sort of situation often in the Federal sector where you have two unions trying to--
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1075.786,1076.452,Yes.
1993.92-1223,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1111.542,1114.577,"--Sending letters to the shop, but not to the home."
1993.92-1223,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1114.577,1115.327,That's right.
1993.92-1223,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1162.808,1164.491,"Very well, Mr. Wright."
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1166.093,1174.449,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-1223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1186.339,1187.089,May I just interrupt you.
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1193.077,1194.627,--Justice Stevens.
1993.92-1223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1194.627,1196.362,Say we need them for organizing purposes and so forth.
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1196.362,1200.081,"Justice Stevens, when unions have tried to do that, the courts have uniformly said no."
1993.92-1223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1203.366,1206.485,"Have they uniformly held that the disclosure is not required under the FOIA, then?"
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1206.485,1216.357,"--If the request is made purely under the Freedom of Information Act, as opposed to under the Federal sector labor relations statute where the request was made in this case, the courts have said no."
1993.92-1223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1217.991,1219.309,But then how do you get around the language
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1221.828,1225.197,How do we get around the language of the Privacy Act?
1993.92-1223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1225.197,1226.413,"The language in the Privacy Act, yeah."
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1226.413,1229.981,We get around it by remembering where this case emanates.
1993.92-1223,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1260.833,1262.801,"Well, why is that so, Mr. Smith?"
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1276.693,1278.943,"Several reasons, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-1223,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1309.497,1318.52,"Well, you can bargain collectively without having the names of employees who don't want to give... without the union having the names of employees who don't want to give their names to the union."
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1318.52,1331.244,"--We take exception to the notion... and, indeed, there's no evidence in the record to support the conclusion that the only addresses that the Federal sector unions do not have are those of employees who have chosen not to provide them."
1993.92-1223,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1376.354,1379.623,"Well, certainly your request would cover that kind of employees."
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1381.824,1382.99,"Indeed, it would."
1993.92-1223,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1404.551,1406.335,It seems to me that doesn't answer the question.
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1449.729,1454.05,"Justice Scalia, we agree that Federal employees have a privacy interest."
1993.92-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1518.993,1526.83,But does the Federal... does the National Labor Relations Act have a privacy guarantee for employees?
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1526.83,1530.467,"No, sir, nothing... nothing in line with the Privacy Act."
1993.92-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1530.467,1536.787,"But this... but the Federal Labor Relations Act does have it, so to that extent it's not modeled after the NLRA."
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1536.787,1551.814,"Well, we don't contend that they are mirror images, but there's no salient public policy reason why you would discriminate in this case, why you would allow to private sector unions a tool which this Court has recognized they need, but deny the same to Federal--"
1993.92-1223,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1551.814,1553.564,Well the reason... the reason is the language of the statute.
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1561.936,1567.006,"--Justice O'Connor, we think the language of the statute holds us in good stead in this case."
1993.92-1223,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1585.368,1591.689,"Well, you have to view it in the context of the Reporters Committee decision, I suppose."
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1591.689,1594.557,We don't think you do.
1993.92-1223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1636.913,1643.752,"Well, but, Mr. Smith, if they're not a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy, and I understand your argument, then I should think you should get them directly under FOIA."
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1643.752,1648.121,"Well, we would... as a fallback position, we would contend as much."
1993.92-1223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1648.121,1650.323,It seems to me you really should argue that in the alternative.
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1650.323,1659.928,"Well, we think it more important that this Court recognize the importance of collective bargaining considerations in evaluating whether or not Federal sector unions obtain information."
1993.92-1223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1659.928,1670.986,"Well, but, as Justice Scalia was suggesting to... in colloquy with your opponent earlier, if we look at policies of other statutes in interpreting the exception to FOIA, we could look at it even if the requests were made directly under FOIA."
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1679.258,1680.342,Indeed--
1993.92-1223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1680.342,1682.127,"You could make that the direct argument, it seems to me."
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1682.127,1683.944,"--I think it does, Your Honor."
1993.92-1223,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1685.912,1697.136,"Mr. Smith, isn't the difference, and what makes this a hard case, is under the Freedom of Information Act the union has no better standing than anyone else?"
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1733.874,1737.862,"--I think that's a good articulation of our position, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.92-1223,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1749.05,1752.502,So is it... and I want to be clear on what your position is.
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1764.977,1766.679,--That is exactly our point.
1993.92-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1778.569,1788.925,"But if ""clearly unwarranted"" can take account of that individuating characteristic, why should it not take account of all individuating characteristics?"
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1822.695,1828.448,"--At page 771 of your Reporters Committee opinion, Justice Scalia, the Court said:"
1993.92-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1847.477,1850.262,"You've just changed your answer to Justice Stevens' early question, then."
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1856.583,1860.903,Our position is we don't need to look to the Freedom of Information Act in this case.
1993.92-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1860.903,1861.42,"Well, I understand you don't need to."
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1869.258,1873.294,I'll try once more to save both positions and then abandon one if I have to.
1993.92-1223,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1895.993,1907.884,"Mr. Smith, you had said earlier, I guess in answering Justice Stevens' question, as I understood you, not that you did not believe that you were entitled to get it if you asked under FOIA, but simply that the courts had not been giving it to you under FOIA."
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1911.836,1912.553,That's correct.
1993.92-1223,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1912.553,1918.406,What... what were the rationales in the... in those cases for refusing the requests under FOIA?
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1918.406,1924.024,The court engaged in traditional Exemption 6 balancing in the two cases that I'm familiar with.
1993.92-1223,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1925.743,1927.928,Did it bring the Privacy Act concern into the balance?
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,1927.928,1935.682,"--Yes, it did, and in those cases determined that the invasion of privacy outweighed the public interest."
1993.92-1223,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2048.152,2049.187,But doesn't that tell you what the Government's up to?
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2049.187,2053.806,"Well, perhaps it would, but that's a pretty rigorous standard in every request for--"
1993.92-1223,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2053.806,2058.46,"But, I mean, if it would, then your parade of horribles is short by at least one example."
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2058.46,2061.126,"--If... if the... if that's true, that would be fine."
1993.92-1223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2130.138,2136.226,In your performance evaluation hypothetical you couldn't... the employee could give the xx to have the performance evaluation.
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2136.226,2140.778,"--The Solicitor General notes in their xx that that is, in fact, the answer."
1993.92-1223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2144.796,2148.034,I'm assuming you've got a case where the employee is the one who's prosecuting the grievance.
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2154.854,2156.221,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-1223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2156.688,2157.688,That's what I thought your hypothetical was.
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2157.688,2158.004,--No.
1993.92-1223,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2161.89,2162.675,"Oh, I see."
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2162.675,2166.96,"--The one who's been complained about, that employee would not be likely to provide consent."
1993.92-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2166.96,2168.293,So it's not all grievances.
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2194.424,2198.626,"I'd like to respond to your first point and then answer your second question, if I could, Justice Scalia."
1993.92-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2198.626,2199.062,Uh-hum.
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2199.062,2200.612,We don't agree it's a pretty limited category.
1993.92-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2209.501,2214.672,No... not within a hypothetical where the person effected would not be entirely willing to give his consent.
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2237.687,2241.655,"Well, I would disagree with you, but let me turn to the second point."
1993.92-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2265.937,2266.187,Excuse me.
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2270.972,2272.257,--With respect--
1993.92-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2272.257,2272.673,You're quite right.
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2291.052,2293.337,--It already has been declared a routine-use.
1993.92-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2328.591,2332.795,"If I understand you correctly, you really can't say you don't get anything in this grievance situation."
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2337.83,2340.949,"--Under the routine-use exemption, that's correct."
1993.92-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2340.949,2341.199,Right.
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2359.695,2360.562,"Yes, they have."
1993.92-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2397.701,2406.574,"Well, it seems to me you ought to... you ought to fight that out on the proper... on the proper field, and that is on the field of whether that's a proper interpretation of the routine-use exemption or not."
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2406.574,2410.776,"Well, it has... it has been fought a good deal."
1993.92-1223,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2414.311,2421.965,"Mr. Smith, on the routine-use part, that seems... there was some confusion over the role that that, in fact, plays in this picture."
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2454.269,2456.721,"You're right, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.92-1223,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2457.338,2460.923,But the FLRA didn't seem to go that far in its argument.
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2468.528,2479.42,"--Well, the FLRA's position was, at the time that it issued its decision in 1990 in its Portsmouth Naval Shipyard case decision, that this information was discloseable as a routine-use."
1993.92-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2526.332,2527.817,But that's not the hypocrisy of the Government.
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2542.577,2547.612,"I think your point is well taken, that perhaps the law could be better written in that guard... regard."
1993.92-1223,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2577.677,2584.533,"Well, did Wyman and Gordon indicate that the board would have had to reach that result, or just that it was a permissible conclusion?"
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2584.533,2586.217,"--The latter, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-1223,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2586.217,2589.319,"Well, then why would you say we would have to overrule Wyman and Gordon?"
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2589.319,2597.025,"I would say the board is pretty well frozen on the release of names and home addresses issue, absent a change in the opinion of this particular Court."
1993.92-1223,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2611.083,2613.368,"I think you're... I'm sorry, Chief."
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2664.05,2673.406,"We do know that at the time the Federal sector labor management relations statute was enacted, the policy clearly was and had been for some 10 years that names and home addresses were released."
1993.92-1223,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2684.63,2693.319,"Mr. Smith, are you arguing that the FLRA deserves the same respect in what it thinks the Federal labor statute means as the NLRB does in its field?"
1993.92-1223,1,21550,david_m_smith,,2693.319,2693.952,Absolutely.
1993.92-1223,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2792.482,2794.316,"Thank you, Mr. Smith."
1993.92-1223,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2797.101,2800.303,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-1223,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2907.791,2913.076,"Mr. Wright, can I ask you a question about the exempt... the language of Exemption 6."
1993.92-1223,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2921.932,2922.967,I like that assumption.
1993.92-1223,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2922.967,2923.667,--Pardon me?
1993.92-1223,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2923.667,2924.884,I like that assumption.
1993.92-1223,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2924.884,2925.503,I know.
1993.92-1223,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2958.14,2966.794,"I think Justice Scalia answered that for me by saying that the whole thrust of Reporters Committee, as I read it, is that individuating characteristics don't count."
1993.92-1223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2985.624,2987.659,Information is releasable or not releasable.
1993.92-1223,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,2993.111,2994.897,That's... that's the whole thrust of FOIA.
1993.92-1223,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3002.051,3003.919,And it's clearly unwarranted.
1993.92-1223,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3009.538,3020.159,"Well, when... when you get... the way these statutes work is that the Privacy Act exception that's at issue here puts the issue wholly within FOIA's domain, and the question really is whether--"
1993.92-1223,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3020.159,3020.909,"Well, I understand that."
1993.92-1223,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3036.419,3042.406,"--Well, I guess I think that the identity of the requester goes hand in hand with the purpose for which the requester wants the information."
1993.92-1223,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3042.406,3049.06,"So this is just as though it was an advertising agency wanting to make up a list of people to send catalogs to, or something like that."
1993.92-1223,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3049.06,3052.845,"And, of course, many of those people have requested lists of Federal employees' home addresses."
1993.92-1223,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3052.845,3053.329,Yeah.
1993.92-1223,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3088.887,3089.303,Right.
1993.92-1223,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3097.291,3101.778,Is the result... you had a good adjective there.
1993.92-1223,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3119.906,3121.358,Well--
1993.92-1223,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3121.358,3125.743,"I suggested to him that that purpose, at least, was... was, indeed, to find out what the Government is up to."
1993.92-1223,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3128.112,3132.13,--There's probably a good... a good argument to that effect.
1993.92-1223,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3156.995,3157.261,Sure.
1993.92-1223,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3157.261,3159.947,So this parade of horribles was quite exaggerated.
1993.92-1223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3161.665,3163.582,"Mr. Wright, could I ask about deference."
1993.92-1223,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3204.642,3205.026,Right.
1993.92-1223,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3217.651,3223.139,So there's deference in making the argument that this doesn't... doesn't adopt the Privacy Act unamended.
1993.92-1223,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3241.434,3251.873,"I hadn't actually looked at their argument that way, but if what they're really trying to do... and I guess this is what they're really trying to do, is read a thirteenth exception into the Privacy Act, and deference won't carry them that far."
1993.92-1223,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3253.409,3255.742,"Thank you, Mr. Wright."
