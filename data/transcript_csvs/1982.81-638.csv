1982.81-638,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.968,We will hear arguments first this morning in Hewitt against Helms.
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,15.807,21.1,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.81-638,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,267.751,282.887,"General Zimmerman, would you tell us what section of the Pennsylvania Code, or sections, you believe governed the proceedings in this instance against the prisoner?"
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,282.887,293.601,"Your Honor, the relevant sections, we believe, are first Section 107... 107 appears at page 46 of our brief."
1982.81-638,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,369.131,384.204,"Mr. Attorney General, while we're speaking of regulations, your brief doesn't cite Hughes Hughes against Rowe, a case that is made a good bit out of by the opposing briefs."
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,397.917,412.271,"--Your Honor, in Hughes v. Rowe, in reading the case the key unclear point was the effect of administrative segregation in those regulations in that case."
1982.81-638,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,440.196,446.616,"General Zimmerman, when was the first date the Respondent was given a hearing?"
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,446.616,458.987,"Your Honor, the Respondent was given a notice of his charge on December 4, 1978, the next day, and a hearing on December 8, 1978, within six days."
1982.81-638,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,458.987,462.579,At that hearing did he have an opportunity to speak for himself?
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,462.579,472.605,"Our regulations in Pennsylvania provide that an inmate has the opportunity to be present, to call witnesses on his behalf, and to speak."
1982.81-638,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,474.105,477.869,Was he advised of the opportunity to call witnesses on his behalf?
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,477.869,482.414,"The record does not... yes, he was."
1982.81-638,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,488.256,492.317,"And on January 2nd, did he have the same opportunity?"
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,492.317,498.471,January 2nd is a hearing conducted by the program review committee.
1982.81-638,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,511.232,514.402,Is a transcript made of those hearings?
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,514.402,518.259,A written summary was made of those hearings.
1982.81-638,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,521.977,529.568,"Meanwhile, Mr. Attorney General, I gather he was in administrative custody and confined as such, wasn't he?"
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,529.568,531.942,"Yes, Your Honor, he was in administrative custody."
1982.81-638,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,531.942,532.583,For how long?
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,532.583,541.391,"From December 3rd, right after the riot in the prison, until January 22nd, a total of 51 days."
1982.81-638,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,541.391,547.467,"And the January 22nd is what, after the final hearing he had?"
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,547.467,557.525,"January 22nd is the day that he had a full-blown Wolff-type hearing, at which he had the opportunity to speak, call witnesses, and be heard."
1982.81-638,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,557.525,565.068,"Now, was he changed after January 22nd from administrative custody to disciplinary custody?"
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,565.068,574.441,"At the conclusion, one of the determinations, of course, at that January 22nd hearing was that he was guilty of the second misconduct charge."
1982.81-638,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,580.078,587.358,Is there any difference between disciplinary and administrative custody in terms of what the prisoner experiences?
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,587.358,603.771,"Well, in Pennsylvania prisons, Your Honor, the physical setup, disciplinary custody is much the same as administrative custody and not at all dissimilar to general population, either."
1982.81-638,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,616.783,618.657,"Well, in either case he's treated the same way, isn't he?"
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,618.657,619.813,"Yes, he is."
1982.81-638,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,640.835,641.99,How about good time?
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,641.99,645.239,"--Your Honor, we don't have good time in Pennsylvania."
1982.81-638,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,654.861,670.902,"Mr. Attorney General, when you spoke of the January 22nd hearing, did that relate to the offense of assaulting an officer, allegedly, while he was in administrative custody?"
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,670.902,677.258,"The January 22nd hearing dealt with the two misconducts, in essence."
1982.81-638,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,697.563,700.062,"The second one was assaulting one of the guards, one of the officers?"
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,700.062,700.156,Yes.
1982.81-638,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,719.243,723.758,"Could you explain, though, what's the difference between the two charges?"
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,727.538,729.021,"They were different guards, Your Honor."
1982.81-638,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,729.021,730.505,At the same date?
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,730.505,734.581,"The first date... the dates are the same, December 3rd, 1978."
1982.81-638,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,762.82,769.489,Is it reasonable to assume that it really related to the same incident and the second one was just merely more specific in identifying the particular officer?
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,769.489,774.518,"The same incident, different individuals, and more specificity in the second misconduct."
1982.81-638,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,774.518,777.533,So the first one related to a different correctional officer?
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,777.533,780.611,There's a reference to a different corrections officer.
1982.81-638,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,780.611,780.829,I see.
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,780.829,781.467,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-638,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,781.467,802.319,Have the Pennsylvania courts interpreted the Section 95.104(b)(3) to mean that administrative custody may be maintained so long as there has been no determination on the misconduct charge?
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,802.319,813.487,"104(b)... to answer that question, Justice O'Connor, there have been... I have been unable to find any Pennsylvania cases interpreting that section."
1982.81-638,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,886.661,894.516,"Mr. Attorney General, I'm sorry, but I'd like to interrupt you, if I may, once more on these two charges, because the Chief Justice's question concerned me."
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,899.843,908.075,"The second charge, Justice Stevens, was filed on January 19."
1982.81-638,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,908.075,908.637,I understand.
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,913.417,917.601,The misconduct date was not the 19th.
1982.81-638,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,917.601,919.18,That's what it says.
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,939.749,943.326,That must be an error.
1982.81-638,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,961.461,965.335,"Well, the earlier one uses the term ""misconduct date"" to refer to the date of the riot."
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,972.302,987.514,"The misconduct in the joint appendix at 37A, misconduct 90908, he was give that charge on December 4th, and the alleged misconduct--"
1982.81-638,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,987.514,990.481,"--See, he was given the charge on the 4th and it refers to the misconduct date as the 3rd."
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,990.481,996.963,"--The 3rd was the date of the incident, the riot, the day before."
1982.81-638,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,996.963,1004.335,"And that's what made me think that the later one, when it says misconduct date January 19, probably meant what it said."
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,1004.335,1024.311,"Page 30A of the joint appendix, the misconduct date is stated, December 3rd, 1978, 90986."
1982.81-638,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1027.748,1027.919,I see.
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,1036.541,1041.571,Subsequent to the January 22nd hearing--
1982.81-638,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1041.571,1042.351,They were dropped.
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,1042.351,1045.271,"--Those were dismissed against him, yes, sir."
1982.81-638,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1190.448,1211.627,"Before you sit down, may I just ask, is it your view that since there's no liberty interest at all and since administrative custody is physically the same as disciplinary custody, that without giving any hearing whatsoever an inmate could be put in administrative custody for the entire period of his confinement?"
1982.81-638,0,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,1211.627,1212.532,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-638,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1212.532,1218.983,Mr. Fishman.
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1218.983,1222.841,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1982.81-638,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1339.433,1347.961,"Mr. Fishman, what did the Court of Appeals hold with respect to whether that first hearing on December 8th had or had not taken place?"
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1347.961,1359.723,They remanded it for a determination factually as to whether or not that was a hearing in respect to the procedures that Mr. Helms asked for.
1982.81-638,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1359.723,1367.252,"So they didn't... they made some comment in their opinion, didn't they, about the fact that your client had signed some sort of a statement?"
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1367.252,1399.348,"Yes, there was some... it had been decided on summary judgment initially in the district court and the court felt that there were some contradictory statements, the answer to the complaint that I just mentioned, the paragraph 19 stating that the first adjudication was on the 22nd of January, and then the statement that Mr. Helms signed on the 8th which indicated the opposite, that he had a hearing on that day."
1982.81-638,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1425.399,1425.977,You say convicted?
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1426.696,1429.96,--Of a misconduct or a disciplinary rule violation.
1982.81-638,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1434.177,1439.597,Are you suggesting that the action must be supported by a conviction?
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1439.597,1442.175,"No, but I'm trying to show--"
1982.81-638,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1442.175,1444.705,Do you mean a finding?
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1444.705,1445.5,--A finding.
1982.81-638,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1534.792,1542.697,"Well, doesn't any kind of confinement have some psychological reaction?"
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1542.697,1555.425,"Yes, but I think in this case it's a question of degree, and I don't think that the confinement involved here that I've described is what naturally inures as part of a Pennsylvania sentence."
1982.81-638,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1574.745,1584.616,Are the only differences in the administrative custody and the disciplinary custody the effect on parole status and pre-release time?
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1584.616,1586.101,No.
1982.81-638,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1594.113,1599.454,You assert that administrative custody does affect the parole release?
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1599.454,1600.033,--Yes.
1982.81-638,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1621.258,1627.552,Do the conditions of administrative confinement differ from the conditions of disciplinary confinement?
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1627.552,1629.286,I would say yes.
1982.81-638,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1631.645,1633.394,"Well, is that the only difference?"
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1645.483,1646.717,"Well, yes."
1982.81-638,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1649.014,1653.543,"And if he's in administrative confinement, he has only ten minutes a day for exercise?"
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1653.543,1654.777,Yes.
1982.81-638,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1654.777,1657.166,And no showers available?
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1657.166,1660.244,"Virtually none, correct."
1982.81-638,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1660.244,1664.024,So there's just no difference in that as to confinement?
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1664.024,1664.991,Yes.
1982.81-638,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1664.991,1668.115,"Whether administrative or disciplinary, it's the same thing, is that it?"
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1668.115,1669.037,Yes.
1982.81-638,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1669.037,1686.765,"Well, while they're investigating a serious disruption... well, a riot... would it be proper to have disciplinary... not disciplinary, administrative segregation of people charged?"
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1686.765,1688.015,Yes.
1982.81-638,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1688.825,1691.106,"You have no question about that, do you?"
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1691.106,1691.855,--No.
1982.81-638,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1710.629,1718.345,"Is there a qualifier there, that if no behavior violation has occurred he is to be released?"
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1718.345,1725.281,"--No, I believe the ""but in all cases"" is afterwards, so that it would not be conditioned on a behavior--"
1982.81-638,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1725.281,1727.124,So it's your position that
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1734.511,1734.98,--Yes.
1982.81-638,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1734.98,1738.479,There is no Pennsylvania case so holding?
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1738.479,1759.361,"Well, there is a Pennsylvania case, Hoss versus Cuyler, which I cited in my brief, which interprets the same regulation as stating that it creates a liberty interest in the freedom from the, and the words are, ""harsh conditions of administrative custody"" in Pennsylvania."
1982.81-638,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1787.24,1792.769,"Mr. Fishman, what was the issue in the case that led to the consent degree?"
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1792.769,1795.532,That was a general conditions suit.
1982.81-638,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1803.64,1805.234,Mr. Fishman--
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1805.234,1806.14,Yes.
1982.81-638,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1806.14,1811.934,--did the Respondent serve the entire six months to which he was sentenced on January 22nd?
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1811.934,1823.336,"Yes, he was, because the Court of Appeals decision throwing out the misconduct conviction did not take place until much afterwards."
1982.81-638,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1823.336,1826.335,And was his parole deferred as a result of that?
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1826.335,1830.13,"Well, the record is unclear on that."
1982.81-638,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1833.129,1834.488,But he was paroled?
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1834.488,1835.551,"--Eventually, yes."
1982.81-638,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1835.551,1837.348,In June or May of--
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1837.348,1838.426,1980.
1982.81-638,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1838.426,1838.911,--1980.
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1843.379,1844.252,Direct connection.
1982.81-638,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1844.252,1845.549,--deferment of parole?
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1845.549,1847.596,No.
1982.81-638,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1854.078,1860.934,Would you clarify again how administrative custody affects parole or pre-release?
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1863.448,1882.925,"Well, the Pennsylvania statutes, as well as the policies of the Board of Probation and Parole in Pennsylvania, require that the conduct of the individual be reported by prison officials as well as investigated by the parole board."
1982.81-638,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1903.026,1905.432,It has an indirect effect.
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,1905.432,1908.79,"--Yes, yes, an indirect effect."
1982.81-638,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2128.983,2134.058,"May I ask, he's now on parole?"
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,2134.058,2135.26,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-638,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2135.26,2141.992,What do you contemplate would happen in the further proceedings which the Court of Appeals has directed?
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,2141.992,2146.804,There's a damage issue pending in the case.
1982.81-638,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2146.804,2147.458,Oh.
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,2148.583,2149.318,Yes.
1982.81-638,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2149.318,2155.691,Any damage suits brought by the injured guards against him?
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,2155.691,2157.159,No.
1982.81-638,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2161.906,2163.89,I'm speaking of civil actions.
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,2163.89,2165.576,"No, no civil actions."
1982.81-638,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2205.014,2209.888,May I ask another question Mr. Justice Brennan's question raises in my mind?
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,2226.194,2226.6,--Yes.
1982.81-638,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2226.6,2233.582,And so isn't it true that your damage proceeding is going to go forward on that issue no matter what we do with this other issue?
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,2241.392,2249.199,"Well, there would be two... there would be a possibility that... there was a remand on the issue of good faith."
1982.81-638,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2297.727,2298.446,I see.
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,2298.446,2302.209,--even if we didn't prevail for the whole six months of the disciplinary.
1982.81-638,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2302.209,2304.569,"That would be the 51 days, would it?"
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,2304.569,2306.052,"Correct, 51 days."
1982.81-638,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2504.738,2506.456,"Well, in this case he did have a witness."
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,2506.456,2507.878,--He did what?
1982.81-638,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2507.878,2511.109,"He did have a witness, the Respondent."
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,2514.031,2518.293,"No, I do not believe he did in this particular case."
1982.81-638,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2518.293,2520.121,"Well, the General said he did."
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,2523.385,2532.428,"I think what he was referring to, I think, was the correctional officer who testified against him."
1982.81-638,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2598.042,2605.883,"Mr. Fishman, was there a written summary of the hearing on December, what was it, 8th, December 8th?"
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,2605.883,2606.368,Yes.
1982.81-638,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2607.555,2609.617,Is that in the record?
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,2609.617,2610.008,--Yes.
1982.81-638,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2613.523,2614.007,Of the printed appendix?
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,2614.007,2614.726,Yes.
1982.81-638,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2614.726,2615.413,Okay.
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,2620.27,2621.223,Yes.
1982.81-638,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2623.004,2623.597,Right.
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,2658.398,2662.113,"Well, I think one thing."
1982.81-638,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2684.153,2685.964,I understand that.
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,2705.441,2705.831,Yes.
1982.81-638,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2716.047,2721.122,"But you do not contend, if I understand your argument correctly, that it amounted to a violation of the Eighth Amendment?"
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,2721.122,2724.449,I don't think this Court has to reach that issue.
1982.81-638,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2742.207,2749.407,"Mr. Fishman, I'm not entirely clear as to the full scope of your claim."
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,2762.918,2763.418,Yes.
1982.81-638,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2763.418,2770.07,There was a hearing on the 22nd that resulted in the six months of confinement.
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,2775.303,2777.818,Not in a general sense.
1982.81-638,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2779.145,2783.066,"Your complaint doesn't include that, as I read it."
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,2783.066,2801.199,"--Well, it did, because we challenged the basis of the conviction on the informant's testimony, and the Court of Appeals... that issue isn't before this Court, but the Court of Appeals agreed with my position that the January 22nd hearing was defective."
1982.81-638,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2801.199,2807.525,But is the adequacy of the due process at the January 22nd hearing before this Court in this case?
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,2807.525,2808.103,No.
1982.81-638,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2808.103,2808.851,All right.
1982.81-638,1,39211,richard_g_fishman,,2812.928,2813.85,Correct.
1982.81-638,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2813.85,2819.301,"Mr. Attorney General, do you have something further?"
1982.81-638,2,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,2819.301,2821.785,Briefly.
1982.81-638,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2941.127,2942.439,"No, you said he was there."
1982.81-638,2,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,2942.439,2943.798,That he was there.
1982.81-638,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2943.798,2945.703,I misunderstood you.
1982.81-638,2,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,2950.452,2956.996,"I made an inquiry, Justice Marshall, to determine that a witness was there at that hearing, sir."
1982.81-638,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2959.807,2962.276,But do we know whether it was a corrections officer?
1982.81-638,2,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,2966.118,2970.037,There was also a witness on behalf of the inmate at that hearing.
1982.81-638,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2972.693,2983.033,"Well then, am I correct, there is no record of what transpired at that hearing?"
1982.81-638,2,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,2983.033,2984.156,"Yes, there is a record."
1982.81-638,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2984.156,2985.328,"Well, where is it?"
1982.81-638,2,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,2992.497,2993.372,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-638,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2997.105,2999.463,Or on behalf of anybody else.
1982.81-638,2,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,3002.353,3032.31,"At page 39A of the joint appendix and 40A, the reference to the action on that date, the misconduct and the hearing committee's action, you'll see the block there, the inmate entered a plea of not guilty to the December 8th--"
1982.81-638,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3032.31,3036.26,This is what you call a report of a hearing?
1982.81-638,2,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,3036.26,3039.666,--These are findings of the hearing.
1982.81-638,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3039.666,3041.056,"Oh, these are findings."
1982.81-638,2,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,3041.056,3041.541,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-638,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3041.541,3051.005,"Where would we find out what transpired at the hearing, who testified as to what?"
1982.81-638,2,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,3051.005,3062.64,"The report... there is a... however you characterize it, this is the evidence of what transpired at the December 8th hearing."
1982.81-638,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3062.64,3067.654,"Well, where do I find who said what about what?"
1982.81-638,2,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,3067.654,3073.605,There were no... at none of these hearings are there verbatim transcripts made.
1982.81-638,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3078.431,3080.009,My final question: This is all?
1982.81-638,2,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,3080.009,3081.414,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-638,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3081.414,3083.086,There's nothing else?
1982.81-638,2,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,3083.086,3083.616,"No, sir."
1982.81-638,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3083.616,3085.585,May I clarify?
1982.81-638,2,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,3090.441,3092.3,December 8th.
1982.81-638,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3092.3,3092.909,The December 8th.
1982.81-638,2,35309,leroy_s_zimmerman,,3102.796,3107.075,We concede the point that a liberty interest was created there in disciplinary custody.
1982.81-638,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3127.645,3129.676,"Thank you, gentlemen."
