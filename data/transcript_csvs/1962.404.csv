1962.404,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,48.96,"Number 404, National Labor Relations Board, Petitioner, versus General Motors Corporation."
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,50.249,53.947,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,120.769,128.345,It would be fair to say that it requires all the burdens of membership if it confers not all the benefits of membership.
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,128.345,151.445,"No, I don't think that would be fair to say, as I shall develop a little later in my argument, it's entirely clear under this proposal and under the existing General Motors UAW contract that anyone who pays the money is entitled, if he alleged that it's entirely his right in his free election to all the benefits of membership."
1962.404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,165.152,167.576,I don't -- I still don't think get your answer.
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,170.953,183.948,"I'm saying that this is the -- well, I'm saying that anyone who offers to pay these sums is entitled to be a member."
1962.404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,279.523,289.103,"Well, on the case of pension funds, Mr. Solicitor General, do you have to become a member as well as pay these equivalent sums?"
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,289.103,304.152,"Well, the normal collective bargaining pension fund is applicable to all the employees in the union and such funds are common even though there is no union shop clause or -- and no Agency Shop Clause."
1962.404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,307.808,310.711,This is what I'm talking about.
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,310.711,318.291,"This contract, as I understand it, would not -- well this union, I believe, doesn't operate any such pension fund."
1962.404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,561.08,582.725,"I still have a little philosophical difficulty in understanding this -- understanding why you say that an agency shop is so much more of power than much more liberal -- liberal with respect to an individual employee, the employee has to pay exactly the same initiation fee and dues as a member, General."
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,590.433,593.41,"He -- well, I would put it -- I would put it this way."
1962.404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,607.611,612.567,"Well, a member doesn't have to go to meetings, and he doesn't have to have his fellow union members to his house for dinner."
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,617.328,629.883,"Well, I -- to the extent, Mr. Justice Stewart, that one does not have any feelings that it makes difference to him whether he must belong to an organization, then I would say there was no difference."
1962.404,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,629.883,630.027,Well what's --
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,630.027,634.392,But there are those who feel that there is an important difference.
1962.404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,637.744,638.28,Yes.
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,638.28,643.247,-- where it was felt that there was a major difference between these two things.
1962.404,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,654.508,654.787,"Well, what you're saying --"
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,654.787,655.356,Indeed --
1962.404,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,655.356,668.254,"-- Mr. Solicitor General, I gather, is that there is a difference between compelled association and compelled contribution to the cause of something from which you've entered."
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,668.254,670.654,"Precisely, precisely."
1962.404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,670.654,673.119,It doesn't hurt your argument at all to say they're exactly the same thing.
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,673.119,673.536,No.
1962.404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,673.536,674.063,And you --
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,674.063,674.222,No.
1962.404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,674.222,675.759,-- you win your case.
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,675.759,676.273,No.
1962.404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,864.603,870.565,"It suggests that the Supreme Court of Indiana was wrong, doesn't it?"
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,870.565,883.461,"No, I think it suggests if counsel will forbid me, that the UAW was wrong and not contending that the present contract is an Agency Shop Clause under Indiana law."
1962.404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1230.985,1236.081,Is this of major contemporary significance as Union Preference Clause?
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1238.814,1243.32,I don't think that there are many industries where it's used today.
1962.404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1302.348,1307.183,"With that preference, a Union Preference Clause would be illegal under the present law, wouldn't it?"
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1307.183,1309.526,It would be illegal but not for the reason --
1962.404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1309.526,1310.452,No.
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1310.452,1311.467,-- not for the reason of General Motors.
1962.404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1311.467,1313.261,For both discriminating and hiring (Voice Overlap).
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1313.261,1314.252,That's right.
1962.404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1611.645,1616.321,What Senator Taft was saying in effect was we've set up in the statute an agency shop --
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1616.321,1616.858,Yes.
1962.404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1616.858,1617.72,-- not a union shop.
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1617.72,1621.454,"Yes, yes, that's true."
1962.404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1743.045,1754.995,Your saying under 14 (b) your position indeed is the -- the Act which permits the State to regulate anything -- any type of union (Voice Overlap)?
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1754.995,1766.458,"No, I was just -- well, I was just about to draw what I think is a very important distinction, would you say any type of union security -- I might --"
1962.404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1766.458,1768.238,The three or four examples that you gave --
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1768.238,1768.293,Yes.
1962.404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1768.293,1769.617,-- in short of union shop.
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1769.617,1781.472,"The three or four examples that I have given, I would say yes to it, but I do want to emphasize and I think it's very important as defining the perimeters of this problem."
1962.404,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1795.658,1797.395,A true what?
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1797.395,1800.29,A true service fee.
1962.404,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1851.939,1852.691,You may.
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,1853.472,1862.766,"It's a payment of that kind that I refer to as a true service fee, something in exchange for considerations rendered."
1962.404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2092.603,2097.036,"Mr. Solicitor General, I have one question."
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2120.19,2122.785,"That is an unsettled question, Justice White."
1962.404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.785,2125.394,But did the Government take any position at this time?
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2125.394,2130.877,"Well, the Board hasn't ruled on it and it hasn't been presented and consequently, I don't feel --"
1962.404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2130.877,2132.909,So you don't (Voice Overlap)
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2132.909,2136.029,-- free to state how the Board would rule.
1962.404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2136.029,2144.343,And nor whether or not the Board feels that it is the one to determine whether or not the state law does or does not stand.
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2144.343,2151.878,Well I assume that the Board would follow any state determination upon that question.
1962.404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2151.878,2154.747,But in the absence of that.
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2154.747,2162.908,"Well, I think that it is very doubtful that the Board -- and I say this rightfully."
1962.404,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2202.279,2205.289,"If you desire, you may have three minutes to close --"
1962.404,0,15704,archibald_cox,,2205.289,2205.655,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1962.404,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2205.655,2213.522,"-- Mr. Solicitor General and you may have five additional minutes to argue, Mr. Wagner."
1962.404,1,26516,harry_s_benjamin_jr,,2213.522,2220.655,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, my name is Harry S. Benjamin, I represent the respondent in this matter, Your Honor."
1962.404,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2220.655,2223.576,"Oh I beg -- I beg your pardon, Mr. Benjamin."
1962.404,1,26516,harry_s_benjamin_jr,,2225.565,2232.99,I think that I am in substantial agreement with the Solicitor General's statement of the facts.
1962.404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2645.586,2656.203,"Is the record clear, Mr. Benjamin that -- that if they want to they can become members of the union and then get all of these things too as many of them as they choose to do?"
1962.404,1,26516,harry_s_benjamin_jr,,2656.203,2666.739,"I believe the record would indicate that they could, but the point is, Mr. Justice Stewart, that the statute does not require them to exercise any such option."
1962.404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2686.09,2699.967,"Are you disputing the -- you really don't agree with the Board in this case, dispute whether or not nonmembers would be deprived of particular rights."
1962.404,1,26516,harry_s_benjamin_jr,,2699.967,2702.627,"Mr. Justice White, I did not hear the first part of your question."
1962.404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2702.627,2710.75,"Well, a while ago you said -- you said that if -- that these employees would be deprive the rights of his members ordinarily would enjoy."
1962.404,1,26516,harry_s_benjamin_jr,,2710.75,2713.221,That is correct.
1962.404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2713.221,2726.254,"What is the significance of this statement that's here on page 61 of the -- of the record, in the footnote -- Footnote 12."
1962.404,1,26516,harry_s_benjamin_jr,,2737.977,2739.467,We disagree with that.
1962.404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2744.252,2746.026,"And this is the finding of the Board, I think."
1962.404,1,26516,harry_s_benjamin_jr,,2746.026,2747.138,"No, no."
1962.404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2749.232,2753.728,What is this -- what is this here on page 61?
1962.404,1,26516,harry_s_benjamin_jr,,2753.728,2761.485,"Well, this appears on page 61 is in the Board so-called supplemental decision and order."
1962.404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2792.337,2796.332,"Woodcock did so testify, didn't he?"
1962.404,1,26516,harry_s_benjamin_jr,,2796.332,2800.007,Woodcock testified in part to that fact but let --
1962.404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2800.007,2805.97,"So at least there is this much basis for the statement namely, Woodcock's testimony."
1962.404,1,26516,harry_s_benjamin_jr,,2805.97,2836.537,"There is some statements made by Woodcock which might prompt such a statement but I respectfully direct your attention to page 90 of the record wherein I -- in examining Mr. Woodcock said, “I think you have already indicated, have you not, just so it is clear that there is no provision in the union's constitution who are nonmembers to vote with respect to the ratification of any agreement that may have been negotiated on behalf of the employees you represent in terms of membership ratification.”"
1962.404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2850.766,2851.032,What is that?
1962.404,1,26516,harry_s_benjamin_jr,,2851.032,2852.066,"And he said, “No.”"
1962.404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2852.066,2855.609,That's no difference in the footnote on 61 really.
1962.404,1,26516,harry_s_benjamin_jr,,2872.106,2874.618,"He did say that, that's correct."
1962.404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2874.618,2878.045,Can you say that's wrong as a matter of fact?
1962.404,1,26516,harry_s_benjamin_jr,,2878.045,2888.347,"I can't say that on the basis of the record but I say that the conclusion that he draw -- drew and answers the question that was put to him, does not appear to be supported in the record."
1962.404,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2919.195,2924.489,"Well, in this instance being a -- the agency shop is more onerous than the --"
1962.404,1,26516,harry_s_benjamin_jr,,2924.489,2925.762,In my -- yes.
1962.404,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2939.756,2942.115,What do you mean by far more onerous?
1962.404,1,26516,harry_s_benjamin_jr,,2942.115,2957.687,It -- in that the nonmembers covered by the agency shop would have to pay the same amount that members had to pay but in return they would not have the same privilege and benefits.
1962.404,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2957.687,2962.254,"Suppose they were accorded that same privilege and benefits, would you still object?"
1962.404,1,26516,harry_s_benjamin_jr,,2962.254,2979.452,"I would still object on the grounds that the contract still does not require -- is not based upon membership, that the agency shop, the proposal here is not one within the terms of the contract, within terms of the statute because it is not based on membership."
1962.404,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2979.452,2983.161,And I don't -- I don't see that the great relevance here --
1962.404,1,26516,harry_s_benjamin_jr,,2983.161,2984.229,Well --
1962.404,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2984.229,2986.224,-- other arguments you're making.
1962.404,1,26516,harry_s_benjamin_jr,,2986.224,2997.803,It's only in answer to the argument that was made in the brief that the agency shop is something less -- is a lesser form of union security.
1962.404,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3019.74,3039.572,"But if they were to get precisely the same service thinking of it as a service agreement as though the Secretary of Labor for instance has been designated to form the bargaining service.If they were to get precisely the same service, you would still have the objection that this was unlawful."
1962.404,1,26516,harry_s_benjamin_jr,,3039.572,3050.655,"We still have the objection that it is unlawful because one is a question whether it's based on membership, the other goes to question of treatment whether it's discriminatory because of treatment."
1962.404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3050.655,3062.163,"The point is that if a person who wants to join a union, he pays this money and gets the benefits of union -- union membership but a person who doesn't want to but has all the burdens and all the benefits."
1962.404,1,26516,harry_s_benjamin_jr,,3071.775,3077.562,Plus the fact that he has the protection of the statute which it didn't require him to come.
1962.404,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3077.562,3080.115,This is not a constitutional objection you're making.
1962.404,1,26516,harry_s_benjamin_jr,,3080.115,3084.269,"No, there is no constitutional question raised in this case."
1962.404,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3086.719,3105.992,"It does not raise the question of whether the Government -- Congress would have the power to require a worker to contribute actual cost, pay the services for collective bargaining agent selected by the Government."
1962.404,1,26516,harry_s_benjamin_jr,,3105.992,3125.079,"I would have to answer that question, Your Honor, that it might form the basis for some constitutional argument that as the pleadings refrained here and as the case was tried, that was not argued and was not presented."
1962.404,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3205.15,3223.347,"Will your pleadings or the issues you have raised bring before, decipher the question whether these people are being or would be required to pay for services that are not rendered by a collective bargaining agent."
1962.404,1,26516,harry_s_benjamin_jr,,3223.347,3231.773,"No, they do not, Mr. Justice."
1962.404,2,15704,archibald_cox,,3432.128,3439.615,"Mr. Chief Justice, if I may take just one moment in the time that you offer me if I may reply."
1962.404,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3498.409,3502.028,"If he doesn't want to see the movie, he is worse off."
1962.404,2,15704,archibald_cox,,3502.028,3508.098,That is not worse off than if he were forced suppose to pay the dollar and sees a movie --
1962.404,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3508.098,3508.765,Well --
1962.404,2,15704,archibald_cox,,3508.765,3514.837,-- which are the two things we are comparing not if whether he's worse off than if they were neither taught.
