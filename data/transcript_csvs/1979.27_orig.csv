1979.27_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.198,"We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 27 Original, State of Ohio v. Commonwealth of Kentucky."
1979.27_orig,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,31.033,35.207,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.27_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,217.233,222.622,"Nebraska v. Iowa came after that case, did it not?"
1979.27_orig,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,224.132,230.554,"Two years later, I believe."
1979.27_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,255.052,264.028,"So you are suggesting that the regular rule is that no one loses title, or a boundary doesn't change with respect to an island?"
1979.27_orig,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,266.94,267.311,Right.
1979.27_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,275.607,276.102,I understand.
1979.27_orig,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,283.12,290.598,"If the island belonged to the state when it was admitted to the Union, then no subsequent change of the river --"
1979.27_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,290.598,292.512,"Whether it's by avulsion, accretion, or otherwise?"
1979.27_orig,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,292.512,296.316,Can divest it of its sovereign territory.
1979.27_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,296.316,312.401,"General Ringo, is it Kentucky's position that the boundary is at the low water mark on the Ohio side on any particular day? Just from day to day that it might change?"
1979.27_orig,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,312.401,318.969,"I think that the best statement of the position would be that it is the prevailing low water mark, wherever it may be."
1979.27_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,318.969,322.137,"Well, would that change? Might that change from day to day?"
1979.27_orig,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,322.137,322.758,Well --
1979.27_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,322.758,325.575,Or from year to year?
1979.27_orig,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,325.575,333.223,"A day to day change probably wouldn't be as perceptible as perhaps over a large number of years, the --"
1979.27_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,333.223,337.554,"Well, perceptible or not, it might change in 24 hours, might it not?"
1979.27_orig,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,337.554,343.105,If there happens to be a flood or precipitation or something of that nature.
1979.27_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,343.105,344.534,So that is Kentucky's position?
1979.27_orig,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,344.534,346.096,Right.
1979.27_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,346.096,359.565,"And you would concede, I take it, that if there had been an avulsive change in the Ohio River such that it wasn't gradual but a sudden shift, that that would change the boundary?"
1979.27_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,359.565,363.94,"No, that is when it doesn't right?"
1979.27_orig,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,366.655,368.332,That's right.
1979.27_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,368.332,369.608,My colleague White is right about --
1979.27_orig,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,369.608,377.338,"A classic example of avulsion would be the Ox Bow situation, where it cuts through the Ox Bow."
1979.27_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,383.021,391.818,Right.
1979.27_orig,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,391.818,401.016,Ohio's position is based upon the misconception of Indiana v. Kentucky which is an important case to this discussion and the island rule.
1979.27_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,537.525,546.38,"Counsel, you say in Handly's Lessee that the principle is that the river, however it may change, continues to be the boundary."
1979.27_orig,0,32696,james_m_ringo,,557.036,559.098,That's true.
1979.27_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,766.043,768.959,"Very well, Mr. Ringo."
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,774.025,777.547,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.27_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,827.645,860.386,"Mr. Szolosi, are you going sometime during your argument to address the language of Justice Brewer in Ohio v. Nebraska on page 143 of 370 which I am about to quote to you, that not only in respect to the rights of individual landowners but also in respect to the boundary lines between the states, the law of accretion controls?"
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,860.386,865.543,"Your Honor, we most assuredly agree with that statement."
1979.27_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,942.341,959.218,"Then we are talking about basically a factual situation and that is whether the course of the Ohio River between Ohio and Kentucky changed, if it did change by avulsion or accretion?"
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,959.218,963.163,"No, Your Honor, most decidedly we are not."
1979.27_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,981.296,990.848,But how can you reconcile that with Justice Brewer's language much later or at least two years later in Nebraska v. Iowa?
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,990.848,1001.425,"It is reconcilable, Your Honor, because this Court in 1890 determined that there was a fixed boundary along the river."
1979.27_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1028.194,1054.444,"But you can have an avulsion at one point in the river, say, between Ohio and Kentucky, and nonetheless any changes in the river between Ohio and Kentucky as opposed to Indiana and Kentucky could be purely accredit and you could have two different results under Nebraska v. Iowa, couldn't you?"
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1054.444,1071.591,"Your Honor, Nebraska v. Iowa was dealing with the middle of the river boundary and unlike the boundary here that is fixed by the cession, a deed and apparently this court in Handly's and in Indiana v. Kentucky construed those matters to have fixed the boundary as of 1972."
1979.27_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1083.89,1121.832,"That is what I thought your point was, Mr. Szolosi, that while you concede the general applicability of the common law rules of accretion and avulsion with respect to a typical boundary, which is the middle of the river, that this is an atypical boundary depending, as it does, upon the origins of the state of Kentucky and the origins of the Northwest Territory part of which became the state of Ohio, and that with respect to this atypical boundary it is the 1792 line that is the line, quite regardless of any subsequent avulsion or accretion, isn't that your point?"
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1121.832,1123.585,"That is exactly, Your Honor."
1979.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1123.585,1127.529,And are you familiar with Texas v. Louisiana?
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1127.529,1129.388,"Just in passing, Your Honor."
1979.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1129.388,1142.629,"Well, that was another atypical boundary between two states, depending on the specific words of some treaties that overrode any ordinary rule about the boundaries between two states."
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1163.053,1168.943,"That's right, Your Honor, and this Court's decisions recognized that in 1890 in Indiana v. Kentucky."
1979.27_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1168.943,1180.777,"Then why did you have to go into Green Island and the abandonment of the channel and that sort of thing if the line was fixed by, in effect, metes and bounds?"
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1180.777,1197.914,"It was most relevant that the Court inquire into exactly what the status of events was in 1792, and the Court points out in that opinion that if we could just look today we might come to a different result because the water is now all south of the island, but we can't do that."
1979.27_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1230.102,1235.166,"So that, you say, was simply a different situation than Nebraska v. Iowa?"
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1235.166,1254.363,"Yes, Your Honor, it most certainly was because of the cession and the interpretation which this Court has placed on what that document did and what boundary it set, whereas in Missouri v. Nebraska or Nebraska v. Iowa the treaties that were involved set the boundary in the middle of the river."
1979.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1271.697,1275.061,What are the practical results of your position?
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1287.457,1295.852,"Your Honor, I think that really brings me to the policy considerations that I indicated I wanted to discuss anyway."
1979.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1295.852,1303.129,"Of course, that would be the rule if the ordinary rule of boundary lines applied, namely the deepest part of the channel."
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1303.129,1307.962,"It would have been, yes, that's right, as always, the navigable channel within the river."
1979.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1403.953,1406.821,Let me go back to my illustration of the fisherman.
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1411.856,1412.529,Absolutely not.
1979.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1412.529,1414.79,Or has he got two licenses?
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1414.79,1436.148,"Your Honor, if there is a 1792 low water mark that is fixed, whether it is by monuments or not, at least he has some idea and it will become generally well known, where you have about 80 to 100 feet on the river, if you are within 80 feet of Ohio's bank, you are safe, you are not going to be arrested by Kentucky for fishing in Kentucky waters."
1979.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1450.942,1458.604,What really is this case all about? What is the value for which each of you is contesting?
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1458.604,1463.049,"Your Honor, I really believe that there are two principal reasons that this case is in court."
1979.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1483.067,1486.713,Do you have saloons out in the middle of the river or --
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1486.713,1499.19,"Your Honor, there are the river boats that at times do attach themselves to the boundary, but those matters are all part of the revenue producing aspects of this case."
1979.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1510.935,1512.67,You just like to litigate.
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1512.67,1520.834,"No, Your Honor, most assuredly Mr. Ringo and I, as much as we enjoy being here today, would have easily passed it up if the matter could have been resolved short of this."
1979.27_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1520.834,1525.801,Do you have dependable evidence as to where the boundary was in 1792?
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1525.801,1527.574,"Your Honor, I submit that we do."
1979.27_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1527.574,1530.937,What is it generally?
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1530.937,1552.359,"In one proceeding already, a Nuclear Regulatory Commission proceeding which is referred to in Ohio's brief, the Public Service Company of Indiana has already proven where the 1792 low water mark lies with respect to a small area that they must -- to which they will discharge their waters from the plant."
1979.27_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1552.359,1557.402,"What is the full length of the river between these two states, roughly?"
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1557.402,1558.798,"I'm really not sure, Your Honor."
1979.27_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1558.798,1570.415,But you are suggesting there is evidence that would enable the definite establishment of a boundary for the full length of the river between the two states 200 years ago?
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1570.415,1571.178,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.27_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1580.297,1589.071,You mentioned a moment ago that it was the Indiana Public Service Company that had produced the evidence.
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1596.548,1610.644,"Concededly, Your Honor, they were working with surveys that related to a portion of the Indiana boundary, but the same surveys can be depended upon, though those surveys exist, the 1806 surveys and the 1896 surveys --"
1979.27_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1610.644,1622.834,"Well, you could have had an avulsion or an accretion where the river runs between Ohio and Kentucky and not one where it runs between Indiana and Kentucky."
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1622.834,1632.363,"Your Honor, your question indicates to me that I have obviously failed in my attempt to convince you that there is a fixed boundary and therefore avulsions don't matter."
1979.27_orig,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1632.363,1633.296,Or accretions.
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1633.296,1634.226,Or accretions.
1979.27_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1639.747,1657.568,"You say then that it doesn't make -- that the principle, the general principle doesn't apply on the Ohio River because of the findings of the earlier court in the Indiana v. Kentucky case?"
1979.27_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1657.568,1659.811,First of all because of the language of the --
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1659.811,1660.495,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.27_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1660.495,1668.081,-- confirmed by two decisions of this Court and embodied today in the Master's report.
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1668.081,1672.109,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.27_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1752.066,1760.702,But that is true with respect to the Arizona-California boundary made by the Colorado River.
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1776.596,1778.406,"Your Honor, is that a middle of the river case?"
1979.27_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1779.143,1780.202,"It is, yes."
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1780.202,1782.684,"Therefore, the distinction is apparent."
1979.27_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1809.211,1825.703,But Nebraska v. Iowa came along a long time before either Bonelli or Corvallis and it simply stated a general rule.
1979.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1825.703,1827.99,"Well, you concede that is the general rule, don't you?"
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1827.99,1828.908,"I do indeed, Your Honor."
1979.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1828.908,1830.74,But you assert that this is a special situation.
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1830.74,1832.397,But for a different set of cases.
1979.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1832.397,1848.358,"Texas v. Louisiana, the case I mentioned to you, came a long time after the Nebraska case and yet it said that a general rule doesn't apply because of the specifics of the creation of the boundary."
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1848.358,1850.002,Which would therefore support --
1979.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1850.002,1853.719,"But you have to cross two bridges, I gather."
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1866.263,1868.136,"That's correct, Your Honor, and that is what the Court held."
1979.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1868.136,1875.429,And that is where you rely on the cases in this Court.
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1875.429,1875.943,That's correct.
1979.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1875.943,1878.252,It is an unchanging low water mark.
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1878.252,1880.199,That's right.
1979.27_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1958.293,1960.069,What page are you reading that from now?
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,1960.069,1983.116,"From page 21 of Kentucky's exceptions, from the passage that is quoted from Indiana v. Kentucky, and it is about half-way down in the passage, the line begins ""They could not be affected,"" and I submit that means these rights that Kentucky had inherited from Virginia -- could not be affected by any subsequent change of the Ohio River."
1979.27_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2184.453,2203.455,And you are making that point to support your argument that the 1792 boundary is the applicable boundary and that that decision in this Court cannot be explained in terms of avulsion but can be explained only in terms of the 1792 boundary?
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,2203.455,2203.863,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.27_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2203.863,2205.444,Do I understand your argument correctly?
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,2205.444,2206.5,"You do indeed, Your Honor."
1979.27_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2206.5,2219.112,Your friend at some point asserted or at least I thought he did that an island can never be subject to these changes.
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,2225.794,2234.83,"Well, Your Honor, in a fixed boundary situation, obviously wherever the island lies on one side or the other of a fixed line, it can't be changed."
1979.27_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2234.83,2235.779,"It remains there, yes."
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,2235.779,2255.198,"With respect to a middle of the river boundary situation, which is the more general case, the Nebraska v. Iowa case, the boundary I submit can and may change; if there is an avulsion it won't, but if there is an accretion it can."
1979.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2255.198,2261.585,Also Indiana v. Kentucky was decided the same day as Plessie v. Ferguson.
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,2261.585,2265.091,"The second case was, Your Honor, the boundary --"
1979.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2265.091,2268.124,"The second case, that is when the decree came down."
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,2268.124,2269.167,Yes.
1979.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2269.167,2271.584,Do you think that -- Plessie has been overruled.
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,2273.991,2276.807,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1979.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2276.807,2278.954,Can I go back to the practical problem for a minute.
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,2289.489,2331.797,"Your Honor, although it is not evidence in the record, we have the benefit of a rather prodigious project by Dean Wallace, the former Dean of the Indiana Law School where at the request of the state of Indiana he has been researching in Great Britain and in all of the archives available in this country, all of the old surveys and many surveys that can be referred to, competent surveyors today so that they can do the same thing that was done in Indiana v. Kentucky, take those surveys and do the best job to come up with the 1792 low water mark, and that is with respect to the river boundary along the entire Ohio, the Ohio-Kentucky boundary as well."
1979.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2331.797,2337.169,"Well, would it be within the scope of this litigation to fight out all the details of that for the whole length of the river?"
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,2337.169,2339.292,"Unfortunately, Your Honor, it is."
1979.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2361.879,2364.785,But it is not within the scope wherefore of any issues now before us?
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,2364.785,2364.987,No.
1979.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2370.045,2372.191,I understand.
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,2372.191,2375.748,"Your Honor, I would submit that -- I notice my time is almost up."
1979.27_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2407.837,2429.643,"Aren't you simply saying that where the granting state says it isn't the middle of the river, all of the river belongs to us, and it is the low water mark on the other side, that the accretion-avulsion rule has nothing to do with it?"
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,2429.643,2431.341,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.27_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2431.341,2433.211,I don't see why that follows at all.
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,2450.783,2461.48,"Your Honor, let me correct my answer in one respect, and that is that not only because it is a low water mark but because that is what was apparently intended when they ceded the land northwest of the Ohio River."
1979.27_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2461.48,2465.316,Your point is that it is a 1792 low mark.
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,2465.316,2466.08,That's right.
1979.27_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2466.08,2467.55,Not just low water mark generally.
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,2467.55,2469.427,But a particular low water mark.
1979.27_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2482.66,2489.614,"And the special master took a look at that and now for us it would go back to the original grant, is that it?"
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,2489.614,2490.058,"Pardon me, Your Honor?"
1979.27_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2490.058,2494.703,It would go back to the original grant to determine this issue?
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,2494.703,2497.373,"Well, you don't have to go back that far to actually fix the boundary."
1979.27_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2497.373,2502.067,"The Louisiana case, we look to the treaty."
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,2502.067,2509.046,This Court only need go back as far as 1890 because the decisions of the Court are already there.
1979.27_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2511.179,2525.226,"Yes, when it goes back to the Master, if we agree with you and if we agree with the Special Master's report, and if this goes back to him, then, as the Chief Justice says, the question will be where was the 1792 low water mark --"
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,2525.226,2525.661,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.27_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2525.661,2526.877,-- and that is your boundary.
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,2526.877,2531.124,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.27_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2554.013,2559.577,Ohio hasn't been entirely confined to its position today either.
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,2559.577,2564.378,"No, Your Honor, and unfortunately we are back to our original position."
1979.27_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2570.091,2570.825,Kentucky's.
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,2570.825,2586.511,"Kentucky's, I'm sorry -- is inconsistent with the answer which they gave in this case initially, and their answer admitted that it was a 1792 low water mark but argued that for practical reasons you can't find it so we ought to have a prevailing low water mark."
1979.27_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2609.843,2611.283,"Your time is expired, counsel."
1979.27_orig,1,36652,michael_r_szolosi,,2611.283,2612.612,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1979.27_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2612.612,2614.381,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Ringo?"
1979.27_orig,2,32696,james_m_ringo,,2614.381,2618.524,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I do."
1979.27_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2712.051,2718.242,"Yes, but in that earlier case it didn't involve the Ohio River, did it?"
1979.27_orig,2,32696,james_m_ringo,,2718.242,2719.849,"Well, the reason we discuss --"
1979.27_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2719.849,2725.876,"And it didn't involve a boundary that concededly now is from the low water mark, the north low water mark?"
1979.27_orig,2,32696,james_m_ringo,,2725.876,2748.182,"But that is the reason I discussed Missouri v. Kentucky, because that principle which we are calling the island principle, rather than avulsion because in looking through all the cases of avulsion it always involves a sudden and perceptible change, but this was a result that was the same, so since it wasn't sudden and perceptible it differs from avulsion."
1979.27_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2766.698,2795.858,"Mr. Ringo, what is your response to this language in the Indiana v. Kentucky case where the court says that if when Kentucky became a state on the first of June 1792, the waters of the Ohio River ran between that tract known as Green River Island and the main body of the state of Indiana, and her right to it falls from the fact that her jurisdiction extended at that time to the low water mark on the northwest side of the river."
1979.27_orig,2,32696,james_m_ringo,,2828.153,2830.958,First you must look at the context of the case.
1979.27_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2844.041,2857.155,"Well, the Court goes on and says her dominion and jurisdiction continue as they existed at the time she was admitted to the union, unaffected by the action of the forces of nature upon the course of the river."
1979.27_orig,2,32696,james_m_ringo,,2857.155,2857.489,Okay.
1979.27_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3022.514,3042.327,"Mr. Ringo, unless you know where the 1792 low water mark is all along the river, unless you know that now and have it in your mind, you really don't know whose ox is going to be gored with this line, do you?"
1979.27_orig,2,32696,james_m_ringo,,3042.327,3054.188,"Well, I don't think it is -- if you are going to follow the traditional rules that have been set forth by this Court and adopted by this Court in its federal common law, whose ox is being gored is not in question."
1979.27_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3054.188,3059.387,"I agree with you, but this is a matter of fact you don't know, do you"
1979.27_orig,2,32696,james_m_ringo,,3059.387,3060.24,"No, Your Honor, I don't."
1979.27_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3060.24,3066.079,"The recommended survey will develop that, will it not?"
1979.27_orig,2,32696,james_m_ringo,,3066.079,3067.407,If it can be determined.
1979.27_orig,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3067.407,3082.914,I thought both parties agreed that the low water mark in 1792 was lower than it now is and that it is now higher as a result of the activities of the Army Corps of Engineers.
1979.27_orig,2,32696,james_m_ringo,,3082.914,3083.897,It is not in evidence.
1979.27_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3088.035,3096.227,"You say it is irrelevant, but I thought it was pretty clear what the result would be in this case."
1979.27_orig,2,32696,james_m_ringo,,3096.227,3097.604,"That is all I have, Your Honor."
1979.27_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3097.604,3098.352,"Thank you, gentlemen."
