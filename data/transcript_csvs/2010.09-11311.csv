2010.09-11311,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.57,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 09-11311, Sykes v. United States."
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,15.01,17.712,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-11311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,61.722,63.24,What's in between?
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,63.24,75.714,"The second tier up is what we refer to as (b)(1)(B), which is fleeing which either causes bodily injury or creates a substantial risk of bodily injury."
2010.09-11311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,87.189,96.228,So we can assume that the conviction here did not involve any risk of bodily injury to anybody?
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,96.228,97.58,"--That's our position, Your Honor."
2010.09-11311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,102.549,103.317,Right.
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,103.317,110.071,--then that conduct does not involve conduct which creates a risk of bodily injury.
2010.09-11311,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,110.071,127.766,"I'm sure you'll do so in the course of your argument, but at some point give us some examples of violations of -- of this, this statute, which from a commonsense standpoint don't involve a serious risk."
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,144.542,146.694,"I would be happy to respond now, Justice Kennedy."
2010.09-11311,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,169.76,170.46,Looking--
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,170.46,171.295,--of merely failing to stop.
2010.09-11311,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,171.295,171.862,--I'm sorry.
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,177.199,180.318,"That was the holding of the Indiana Court of Appeals, yes."
2010.09-11311,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,180.318,183.602,You're supposed to stop dead in your tracks and not pull off on the shoulder?
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,187.304,189.589,"Well, the court didn't--"
2010.09-11311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,189.589,190.273,I don't drive in Indiana.
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,192.541,197.01,"--The court did not elaborate, Your Honor, on where the line is, but--"
2010.09-11311,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,197.01,199.195,--Maybe that's why -- why it's a risk.
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,202.797,206.801,"--That would be more likely to create a risk, but the--"
2010.09-11311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,206.801,209.218,How can you say somebody is fleeing?
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,216.788,236.035,"--Justice Scalia, the holding of the Indiana Court of Appeals was in response to a position taken by the defendant, sort of along the lines of the two lines of questioning, which is surely the statute requires something more than merely failing to stop, but the Indiana Court of Appeals used precisely that language."
2010.09-11311,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,236.035,253.228,I think the problem with your argument is that the prosecution is not under any obligation to charge any offense greater than the offense for which your client was convicted in a case in which there is a very grave risk created by flight.
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,253.997,259.215,"The prosecutor is not under any obligation; was that the question, Justice Alito?"
2010.09-11311,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,259.215,259.751,Yes.
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,259.751,261.484,"Yes, I think that's -- I think that's correct."
2010.09-11311,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,262.217,277.962,So the fact that someone is convicted of this offense does not show that a broad category of offenses within this crime lack the risk that's necessary under the Armed Career Criminal Act.
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,277.962,297.69,"--Well, I suggest that it does, Your Honor, because the -- the James case makes clear that the Court will determine whether the crime creates a serious potential risk of physical injury to another by looking at the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense."
2010.09-11311,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,305.779,311.266,Are you familiar with the case called Hape v. State in the Indiana Court of Appeals 2009?
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,311.266,312.216,Tate versus--
2010.09-11311,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,312.216,312.899,Hape.
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,313.985,314.901,"--I'm not, Your Honor."
2010.09-11311,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,314.901,319.705,During a 45 -- and this involved the offense at issue here.
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,337.583,339.95,"Well, those, of course, aren't the facts here."
2010.09-11311,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,345.07,349.474,I believe he is convicted of the same offense as -- as Mr. Sykes.
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,349.474,359.663,"--But of course, under the categorical approach established by Taylor and followed consistently by this Court since that time, the Court doesn't look at the facts of the individual case."
2010.09-11311,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,362.032,384.195,"But looking at it categorically I've always thought means you look to see, not just what the elements are on paper, but whether the elements as used in reality in the State are applied to cases that do present, in general apply to cases that do present a serious risk of physical injury."
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,421.154,423.022,--If the--
2010.09-11311,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,423.022,424.155,Are you following what I'm doing?
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,427.057,427.974,--Yes.
2010.09-11311,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,427.974,429.509,In the other States they grade it.
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,431.026,432.211,Right.
2010.09-11311,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,435.08,436.546,"Indiana, I'm sorry."
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,436.546,446.536,And it is significant that the second most serious category is where the conduct does present a substantial risk of bodily injury.
2010.09-11311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,446.536,482.727,"And I -- I don't know how we could proceed by looking at, you know, whether in fact a majority of the cases that come into this first relatively harmless category did indeed involve situations that involved physical risk because, as everybody knows, prosecutors plea bargain, and it's probably very often the case that the defendant is charged only under, under category one, you know, where if he went to trial they would charge him under three; isn't that so?"
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,482.727,485.013,"But of course, Your Honor--"
2010.09-11311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,485.013,487.046,"Yes, yes, you want to say yes."
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,487.046,489.315,--Thank you.
2010.09-11311,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,489.881,503.557,"What I'm thinking of, and I need a little explanation, we look to see in (b), and it says it's a class D felony if a vehicle is used."
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,506.342,506.926,Yes.
2010.09-11311,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,506.926,507.492,Okay.
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,519.15,520.15,Yes.
2010.09-11311,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,520.15,526.34,"So a prosecutor looking at that will say, why don't I just charge A; what's the point of charging B?"
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,532.175,539.481,"Justice Breyer, in 2003, when Mr. Sykes was convicted of this offense, what you said is exactly right."
2010.09-11311,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,561.91,564.612,I can deal with it more easily then.
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,573.951,574.551,Yes.
2010.09-11311,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,574.551,578.336,So we're here trying to decide whether the (A) one does.
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,578.336,579.105,Yes.
2010.09-11311,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,579.105,587.192,"And the answer is I don't know, and the reason I don't know is I don't know how that offense language of (A) is applied in Indiana."
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,587.192,588.127,It's--
2010.09-11311,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,588.127,603.221,"Counsel, do you know if Indiana has an enhancement for convictions, sentencing enhancement of any kind, for conviction that have an element of risk of harm to others?"
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,603.221,611.492,"--Your Honor, there are a number of habitual sentencing enhancements, one of which specifically relates to driving."
2010.09-11311,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,614.611,627.669,"So it's possible that there is a -- there's a use of the difference between the two categories that might not be implicated in this case, but may lay the foundation for an enhancement later?"
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,627.669,628.186,--Yes.
2010.09-11311,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,646.75,653.236,"In your brief you take issue with the government's definition of ""aggressive"", but would you give us yours?"
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,653.236,654.319,"Well, Your Honor--"
2010.09-11311,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,654.319,656.355,How would you define it and on what basis?
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,656.355,672.698,"--Your Honor, the best definition of ""aggressive"" that I've seen was in the First Circuit opinion in the Herrick case which is cited in our brief, which the First Circuit refers to as forceful action, especially where intended to dominate or master."
2010.09-11311,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,708.906,716.394,"Mr. Marsh, I take it that you would agree that (b)(1)(B) is a violent felony under -- under ACCA; is that right?"
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,716.394,718.179,"Your Honor, it may very well be."
2010.09-11311,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,731.92,750.233,"Well, if we think that (b)(1)(B) is a violent felony under ACCA and we know that (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) can receive the same punishment, that they're both classed as a class D felony, why should we make the distinction between the two under ACCA?"
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,750.233,766.077,"Your Honor, I would suggest because the Indiana General Assembly has decided in enacting this legislation that some vehicular fleeing presents a substantial risk of bodily injury to another and some doesn't, and they've drawn this distinction."
2010.09-11311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,766.077,766.693,I presume if--
2010.09-11311,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,766.693,768.279,But these are not nested offenses.
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,787.823,793.66,"Your Honor, I would suggest that the State doesn't treat them as equally severe."
2010.09-11311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,808.504,832.804,"--And it may well be that in deciding whether to accept a plea bargain of being guilty of (A) rather than going to trial on B, if your client has two violent felonies already on the book, you might take -- take the plea bargain under (A) lest you run afoul of the Violent Felony Act."
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,832.804,835.756,"Yes, Your Honor, that's of course entirely possible."
2010.09-11311,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,862.406,867.692,Suppose the legislature were to repeal (b)(1)(B).
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,873.596,883.904,"Your Honor, that would be a question that would have to be decided on the basis of whether there's some basis to -- well, first of all, determine whether it's violent and aggressive."
2010.09-11311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,901.198,902.798,I don't understand your answer to that question.
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,924.044,925.461,I'm sorry.
2010.09-11311,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,928.663,929.729,"No, it's the opposite."
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,933.881,934.317,Right.
2010.09-11311,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,934.317,936.417,--in large part as a basis for your argument.
2010.09-11311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,977.894,980.096,That's a good question.
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,980.096,986.35,"Your Honor, the equation would be different because of the significance of the (B) offense."
2010.09-11311,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,995.955,999.24,But you're answering my question by making a totally different argument.
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,1008.779,1010.779,Justice Alito--
2010.09-11311,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1010.779,1014.33,"In other words, you're saying -- maybe I haven't made myself clear."
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,1040.398,1048.404,"--Justice Alito, I think it breaks down to the two parts of the Begay test."
2010.09-11311,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1074.721,1085.66,"Counsel, have you done or looked at -- not every burglary has a risk of harm to another or results in harm to another."
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,1098.134,1098.836,Right.
2010.09-11311,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1098.836,1106.09,Yet ACCA defines burglary as a qualifying crime of violence.
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,1165.362,1180.388,"Your Honor, the inquiry, as the Court said in James, is whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense presents the risk, and that's the -- the determination that the Court has to consider."
2010.09-11311,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1193.464,1197.666,"So if you're not doing that, that's my question: Where do we draw the line?"
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,1197.666,1199.868,You draw it -- I'm sorry?
2010.09-11311,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1199.868,1201.452,Where do we draw the line?
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,1201.452,1202.254,You draw the line--
2010.09-11311,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1202.254,1218.414,"I think that was what Justice Breyer was trying to ask you earlier, which is: When do we say that, as in burglary, that some risk is more likely to follow than not in a particular type of crime?"
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,1218.414,1224.333,--The line is defined by the statute: Serious potential risk of physical injury to another.
2010.09-11311,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1251.837,1265.31,I suppose that if we agreed with you that whether it is a violent crime depends upon what other prosecutions for fleeing could have been drawn.
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,1308.589,1309.922,"Yes, that's correct, Justice Scalia."
2010.09-11311,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1309.922,1314.141,My problem is there is arguably not here a gradation.
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,1382.97,1396.961,"Your Honor, it's not a weird situation because the Indiana definition of the crime of vehicular fleeing is not one all-encompassing crime."
2010.09-11311,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1422.995,1425.464,Isn't it still an empirical question?
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,1460.286,1463.72,"--No, I think you're exactly right, Justice Alito."
2010.09-11311,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1479.932,1482.801,I wouldn't say that they didn't have a rational basis for dividing it.
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,1488.471,1494.625,"--But the important thing here, Your Honor, is there simply is no such data before this Court."
2010.09-11311,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1500.196,1516.188,"There never is really reliable empirical data, almost never, for any of the issues that have to be decided under the -- the catch-all, the residual clause, of ACCA."
2010.09-11311,0,45563,william_e_marsh,,1520.526,1529.465,"Your Honor, I suggest that common sense and experience is not a reliable, predictable way of deciding these cases."
2010.09-11311,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1555.682,1556.949,"Thank you, Mr. Marsh."
2010.09-11311,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1566.121,1567.907,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-11311,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1627.925,1629.527,These were all litigated cases?
2010.09-11311,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1629.527,1636.781,"--Yes, Justice Scalia, these were all litigated to conviction and taken up on appeal, and the Indiana Court of Appeals addressed various legal issues--"
2010.09-11311,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1636.781,1639.566,"Well, but that's not -- 14 isn't very many."
2010.09-11311,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1642.752,1644.954,"--I think that's right, Mr. Chief Justice."

2010.09-11311,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2597.497,2599.149,It's not like he -- it's not like he's aiming for the guy.
