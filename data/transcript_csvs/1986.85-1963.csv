1986.85-1963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,57.753,"You may proceed whenever you're ready, Mr. Young."
1986.85-1963,0,21736,d_michael_young,,57.753,60.539,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-1963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,544.266,545.351,Mr. Young--
1986.85-1963,0,21736,d_michael_young,,545.351,547.151,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1986.85-1963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,547.151,556.09,--the companies like Xerox argue that the Washington tax discriminates against them under this scheme.
1986.85-1963,0,21736,d_michael_young,,556.09,556.875,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,556.875,568.081,"And discourages... or encourages, rather, their manufacturing within the state of Washington and discourages them from manufacturing outside the state of Washington."
1986.85-1963,0,21736,d_michael_young,,568.081,569.449,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,569.449,575.687,"Well, what if Washington simply repealed its manufacturing tax."
1986.85-1963,0,21736,d_michael_young,,580.304,581.323,"Yes, Your Honor, I think if Washington--"
1986.85-1963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,581.323,583.792,"Isn't that perfectly all right, though?"
1986.85-1963,0,21736,d_michael_young,,583.792,589.929,"--Under the discrimination prong of the commerce clause, I think that would be perfectly all right for the future, Justice O'Connor."
1986.85-1963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,590.496,594.564,"It would have the same effect, and you argue--"
1986.85-1963,0,21736,d_michael_young,,594.564,594.881,--Excuse me?
1986.85-1963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,594.881,597.933,--It would have exactly the same effect.
1986.85-1963,0,21736,d_michael_young,,597.933,606.42,"Well, it wouldn't have the same effect, Your Honor, because there would no longer be a benefit to the in-state manufacturers that wasn't given to out of state people."
1986.85-1963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,617.061,632.237,"Well, companies like the Xerox company want as to make out their claim to treat the wholesale tax and the manufacturing tax together and look at how it operates as a unit, right?"
1986.85-1963,0,21736,d_michael_young,,632.237,638.408,--The companies really don't care which way it's treated as long as it's treated consistently.
1986.85-1963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,638.408,649.782,"Well, it seems to me that's the theory, and yet the Appellants like Kalama Appellants want us to look at the taxes as separate activities and consider them separately."
1986.85-1963,0,21736,d_michael_young,,654.02,661.923,"Your Honor, I think from all of these Appellants' standpoint the Court could go which... approach it either way, as long as it does so consistently."
1986.85-1963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,688.657,692.395,Let me try to explain my dilemma a different way.
1986.85-1963,0,21736,d_michael_young,,746.545,768.459,"--Your Honor, I guess the way I'd put it is that, without regard to the exact nature of the benefit, whether it's the forgiveness of a liability for something entirely different from taxes or whatever, if the state gives a benefit of any kind to local commerce that it's not giving to interstate commerce and that's based on some interstate element, it is discrimination."
1986.85-1963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,777.279,783.183,I presume at least some of your clients wouldn't mind the approach that Justice O'Connor just expressed.
1986.85-1963,0,21736,d_michael_young,,788.754,800.977,"Justice Scalia, actually none of our clients would mind having all of the taxes viewed together, because if they're viewed together the apportionment problem is so blatant that I think that some kind of relief would be required for everybody."
1986.85-1963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,800.977,804.929,How does this case differ from the Boston Stock Exchange case?
1986.85-1963,0,21736,d_michael_young,,826.693,833.533,"The New York tax, that the state of Washington has urged is similar to this, was a tax that wasn't before the Court."
1986.85-1963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,862.718,873.824,"But you would say then that, as a general rule, if a state wants to tax one of several incidents, that that's unlawful?"
1986.85-1963,0,21736,d_michael_young,,873.824,884.381,"It does expose interstate commerce to multiple burdens that local commerce isn't exposed to, and if that happens in fact it would be unlawful, yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,884.381,893.987,"Then why wasn't Armco decided the other way, because couldn't you view Armco as that, as essentially the same thing, taxing either the manufacture or the sale?"
1986.85-1963,0,21736,d_michael_young,,895.689,920.138,"I suspect the reason that Armco wasn't decided that way was that the Court focused on the two activities that were claimed to be essentially the same and looked at them and realized that they weren't quite the same, whereas in Boston Stock Exchange you were looking at all things that were part and parcel of a transfer of stock and they were quite closely related, would typically occur in one state."
1986.85-1963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,944.087,946.372,"Mr. Young, your time has expired."
1986.85-1963,1,37234,neil_j_obrien,,950.758,953.293,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1963,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1063.366,1064.949,Is this a due process argument?
1986.85-1963,1,37234,neil_j_obrien,,1064.949,1069.501,"Both, due process and commerce clause."
1986.85-1963,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1069.501,1075.405,All the other companies that Ashe & Jones represents it only represents in Washington and not elsewhere as well?
1986.85-1963,1,37234,neil_j_obrien,,1075.405,1076.923,I can't say about the others.
1986.85-1963,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1076.923,1080.292,"Well, then you can't say that it's any less than half a person, really, if you don't really know."
1986.85-1963,1,37234,neil_j_obrien,,1080.292,1082.744,"Okay, I agree, Your Honor."
1986.85-1963,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1206.606,1219.247,"Well, Mr. O'Brien, in a couple of past cases, particularly I think one of the last ones from Washington, the Standard Steel case, we have said that the burden of proof is on the taxpayer to show multiple taxation."
1986.85-1963,1,37234,neil_j_obrien,,1222.984,1239.743,"Your Honor, the state of Texas uses gross receipts in its formula for taxing the franchise tax, but the state does not have an independent gross receipts tax, although it is in the process right now... one has been proposed for this congressional enactment."
1986.85-1963,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1251.151,1258.241,"Well, is one of your grounds here the danger of multiple taxation?"
1986.85-1963,1,37234,neil_j_obrien,,1258.241,1259.424,"Yes, Your Honor, because--"
1986.85-1963,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1259.424,1265.06,"Well, where else are you being taxed on these activities besides Washington, and in what manner?"
1986.85-1963,1,37234,neil_j_obrien,,1265.06,1283.689,"--We are being taxed in the state of Texas on these activities, because the receipts from... well, we are not... in the state of Texas, the franchise tax is determined by a ratio between the gross receipts in Texas and the gross receipts outside the state of Texas."
1986.85-1963,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1296.949,1300.901,So there was no multiple taxation in fact in your case?
1986.85-1963,1,37234,neil_j_obrien,,1300.901,1304.77,"There was none in fact during the period, that's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1381.484,1388.507,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-1963,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1520.891,1525.229,"Are the taxes, though, imposed on different activities?"
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1528.414,1530.965,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, they are separately taxable activities."
1986.85-1963,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1553.362,1564.17,"Well, if they are on separate activities, a manufacturer within the state of Washington who then exports the product for sale in another state is taxed?"
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1564.17,1565.087,That's correct.
1986.85-1963,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1565.087,1566.039,On the manufacture?
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1566.039,1566.789,That's correct.
1986.85-1963,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1566.789,1575.744,But a manufacturer in Washington who also sells the product in Washington is excused from paying the manufacturing tax?
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1575.744,1577.627,"If he has paid the selling tax, that's correct, Your Honor."
1986.85-1963,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1577.627,1581.215,Why doesn't that amount in effect to a tax on exports?
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1581.215,1581.948,The reason it doesn't--
1986.85-1963,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1581.948,1586.417,"Just if you view them as taxes on separate activities, it looks pretty clear."
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1586.417,1596.106,"--Well, I don't think that... that's not correct, Justice O'Connor, and the reason is because the manufacturing tax is a compensating tax, just like the use tax is a compensating tax."
1986.85-1963,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1603.01,1612.632,But you have a decision in the state of Washington in the Fibreboard case that makes it look very much like those two taxes are not compensating taxes.
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1612.632,1633.648,"Well, Your Honor, the Fibreboard case is a situation, of course, which isn't before this Court, because in that case a manufacturer partially manufactured in Washington, partially finished the manufacturing out of the state, and then sold the product back in Washington, and paid two taxes, both a selling tax and a manufacturing tax."
1986.85-1963,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1667.366,1670.202,What does it take to make something a compensating tax?
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1684.776,1686.692,Justice Scalia--
1986.85-1963,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1686.692,1688.894,Would that be a compensating tax?
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1700.267,1700.584,--No.
1986.85-1963,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1700.584,1701.134,Why not?
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1701.134,1711.975,"One of the fights between the parties in this case is over compensating tax criteria, and the criteria that we have urged and is supported by this Court's decisions is kind of a two-pronged criteria."
1986.85-1963,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1720.33,1720.647,Sure.
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1720.647,1732.638,"And ask two questions: Are the taxes designed to achieve equality, and do they actually result in equal treatment of in-state and out of state taxpayers similarly situated?"
1986.85-1963,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1798.83,1799.499,That's all it takes?
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1802.567,1803.234,--That's right.
1986.85-1963,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1850.748,1856.202,"There is an incentive, there is an incentive to you, isn't there, to sell in Washington rather than sell outside of Washington?"
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1856.202,1858.238,"No, I don't think so, Justice Scalia."
1986.85-1963,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1874.331,1883.353,"You're assuming, quite unrealistically, that there's no sales tax anywhere else, that there's no tax on your selling activity elsewhere, as there is in Washington."
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1883.353,1884.419,Two things about that--
1986.85-1963,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1884.419,1888.257,Assume the state you're selling into has the same law that Washington has.
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1897.696,1898.263,--That's right.
1986.85-1963,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1898.263,1902.517,So doesn't that discriminate against interstate commerce?
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1902.517,1909.087,"I don't think it does, Justice Scalia, but that's a question that this Court has yet to resolve."
1986.85-1963,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1913.456,1916.575,"Well, it has yet to resolve it unless it resolved it in the Armco case."
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1916.575,1917.777,Well--
1986.85-1963,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1917.777,1922.394,"And that's just exactly what that case involved, only it's the other side of the coin."
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1922.394,1925.596,"--Well, I don't think that's accurate, Justice Stevens."
1986.85-1963,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1930.417,1931.786,The taxes were of differing amounts.
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1931.786,1941.225,"--This Court ruled that the manufacturing tax and the wholesaling tax weren't compensating taxes, because they didn't pass the criteria."
1986.85-1963,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1946.546,1953.616,"Mr. Collins, isn't... I don't know where this Exhibit K came from that your opponent's entire argument was based on that."
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,1964.507,1989.373,"--Well, Your Honor, Exhibit K also perfectly describes the situation in Southern Pacific versus Gallagher, because in that case if you bought a product in another state and sold it... I'm sorry, bought a product in another state, used it in California, you would pay hypothetically two taxes, a selling tax in the other state and a use tax in California."
1986.85-1963,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1992.325,1996.729,"What you're saying is that if we apply, if we follow these cases, we have to overrule that case."
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2023.177,2025.879,--It's not the direction--
1986.85-1963,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2025.879,2026.914,"I'm sorry, it's the other way around."
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2026.914,2027.281,--Yes.
1986.85-1963,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2027.281,2028.414,You get excused from the wholesale tax.
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2028.414,2034.402,It's not the direction that determines whether it's constitutional or not.
1986.85-1963,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2052.815,2070.693,"Well, I suppose that's the issue, because here we have... but I know you cited a case to me, but why is it not true that if you had, if Oregon had the same scheme that you have and you have just the same tax, both have these taxes, why is it not true that the local commerce is taxed less, I believe, than the interstate commerce?"
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2073.978,2077.931,This Court has never taken into account the taxes--
1986.85-1963,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2077.931,2078.831,"Well, I'm just asking you if."
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2080.632,2082.417,--They would pay more taxes.
1986.85-1963,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2082.417,2082.934,--Pardon me?
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2082.934,2083.75,They would pay more taxes.
1986.85-1963,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2083.75,2088.571,And they pay more taxes on the interstate transactions than they would pay on the intrastate transactions?
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2088.571,2089.404,That's correct.
1986.85-1963,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2148.46,2156.883,"Yes, but the difference in your hypothetical is that if both states adopted the taxing scheme of the other, they would pay double taxes in both states."
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2156.883,2157.349,--That's true.
1986.85-1963,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2157.349,2159.918,There would be no discrimination between interstate and intrastate taxation.
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2159.918,2174.277,"But the Court refused, though, in that case to speculate about what another state would do, and that's really, I think, a correct decision and one that would be appropriate even if it was a question of first impression."
1986.85-1963,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2212.552,2219.889,"When you say only if the selling tax is paid, I suppose that's the equivalent of saying only if the sales are made within the state."
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2219.889,2221.158,If the sales are made within the state.
1986.85-1963,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2221.158,2223.558,They're the functional equivalent.
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2223.558,2225.193,"Sure, that's right."
1986.85-1963,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2308.846,2319.488,"There certainly is language in Armco that indicates the Court was making some assumptions and not waiting for actual experience, isn't that true?"
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2319.488,2325.475,"Well, I don't think that that's what the language in Armco really says, Justice O'Connor."
1986.85-1963,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2366.7,2376.824,"Well, if you view the manufacturing tax in Washington as not a compensating tax, it also is facially discriminatory."
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2376.824,2378.86,"No question about it, no question about it."
1986.85-1963,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2434.46,2436.046,May I just ask one question?
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2436.046,2436.529,Yes.
1986.85-1963,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2436.529,2441.6,Supposing they did prove that Oregon had the same kind of tax statute that you have?
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2442.616,2450.789,"Well, it's a different case because then they wouldn't then... if the Court said that something was required, they would certainly be entitled to relief."
1986.85-1963,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2456.776,2466.649,"Or put another way, assuming we agreed with your argument up to that point and say that the statute's fine today and then tomorrow Oregon passed such a statute, would that make your statute unconstitutional?"
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2466.649,2472.369,"--Well, I don't think it would make our statute... just the act of having the tax doesn't make the statute unconstitutional."
1986.85-1963,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2481.325,2484.693,What do you think the answer is to that?
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2484.693,2485.279,Well--
1986.85-1963,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2485.279,2489.497,I'm just wondering if the fate of your tax depends on what happens in the Oregon legislature.
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2489.497,2490.614,"--No, it doesn't depend on it."
1986.85-1963,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2495.401,2501.572,"Oregon and Washington would be in the same boat, wouldn't they?"
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2501.572,2503.257,"Yes, that's correct."
1986.85-1963,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2503.257,2506.043,I'm just curious which boat it is.
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2510.245,2519.716,"With regard to the apportionment question, there's really no multiple tax."
1986.85-1963,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2549.37,2557.408,"The manufacturing tax seems to be a curious one, that's almost a form of substitute for income tax."
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2568.116,2573.52,"Well, it would just be taxed once, on the final finished product that was subject to the tax."
1986.85-1963,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2576.972,2581.091,You only tax the little steps if part of it were done out of state.
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2581.091,2584.809,--Are you talking about the Fibreboard situation?
1986.85-1963,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2584.809,2587.928,I'm talking about your manufacturing tax in the state of Washington.
1986.85-1963,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2587.928,2598.968,"Well, if you manufacture something in the state of Washington and then it goes outside the state, partially manufactured, the tax is imposed on the value of that product."
1986.85-1963,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3040.774,3042.357,"Thank you, Mr. Collins."
1986.85-1963,3,37234,neil_j_obrien,,3047.575,3062.319,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, you asked about the activities... or whether the Tyler Pipe was taxed on its gross receipts, and I said no and that is correct, they are not."
1986.85-1963,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3138.402,3142.021,What is the matter with that if someone is an agent for a principal?
1986.85-1963,3,37234,neil_j_obrien,,3150.292,3151.042,I think not.
1986.85-1963,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3159.748,3176.36,"Well, but certainly if the agent is obviously present in the state of Washington for its own activities, and if it's in fact the agent of your client, I just don't see what in our cases prevents that."
1986.85-1963,3,37234,neil_j_obrien,,3176.36,3182.598,"Well, it is there for its own activities, but its own activities are Tyler Pipe's activities."
1986.85-1963,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3195.588,3199.559,"Well, it doesn't strike me as contrary to any principles of agency law I ever knew about."
1986.85-1963,3,37234,neil_j_obrien,,3199.559,3201.175,"No, it's not contrary to agency law."
1986.85-1963,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3203.027,3211.033,"Well, but why should nexus law be any different than agency law in this respect, when you're trying to see whether your company had a presence within the state?"
1986.85-1963,3,37234,neil_j_obrien,,3215.485,3216.954,"Yes, yes, you can have presence."
1986.85-1963,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3503.536,3505.404,"Mr. O'Brien, your time has expired."
1986.85-1963,3,37234,neil_j_obrien,,3505.404,3505.77,Thank you.
1986.85-1963,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3505.77,3508.888,The case is submitted.
