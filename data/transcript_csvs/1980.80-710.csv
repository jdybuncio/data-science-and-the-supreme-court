1980.80-710,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,20.746,We will hear arguments next in United Association of Journeymen of the Plumbing and Pipefitting Industry v. Local 334.
1980.80-710,0,34498,laurence_gold,,67.725,71.679,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-710,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,183.185,201.063,"Mr. Gold, isn't there a certain undesirability in the test advanced by the last six circuits that you mentioned, you don't know when you go into court whether there is jurisdiction or not, depending on a whole bunch of factors?"
1980.80-710,0,34498,laurence_gold,,201.063,218.775,"Our position, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in part for the consideration you just stated, is that national constitutions fit the language of the statute, fit the purposes of Section 301, and are within the section."
1980.80-710,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,249.878,256.615,"Well, there is that other view that the union constitution shouldn't ever be within this."
1980.80-710,0,34498,laurence_gold,,256.615,257.065,Yes.
1980.80-710,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,257.065,258.432,"That would make it simple too, wouldn't it?"
1980.80-710,0,34498,laurence_gold,,258.432,258.9,That's right.
1980.80-710,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,299.724,302.426,"Yes wouldn't preclude a state action, would it?"
1980.80-710,0,34498,laurence_gold,,302.426,312.534,"No, under Dowd Box v. Courtney the jurisdiction under 301 is the jurisdiction both in the federal courts and in the state courts."
1980.80-710,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,321.973,327.21,But the state is obligated to apply federal substantive law?
1980.80-710,0,34498,laurence_gold,,327.21,330.746,"That's correct, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1980.80-710,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,330.746,333.03,"In that case or in Lucas Flour, I've forgotten which."
1980.80-710,0,34498,laurence_gold,,333.03,341.553,"Yes, under Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills, the Section 301 law is federal."
1980.80-710,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,341.553,345.505,What kind of law will govern this dispute?
1980.80-710,0,34498,laurence_gold,,351.342,371.739,"That's right, Your Honor, it would be the task, and our view would be the same as the task the Court outlined in a case like Carbon Fuel in 444 U.S. where you dealt with the question of how to interpret a collective agreement."
1980.80-710,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,371.739,372.239,I understand.
1980.80-710,0,34498,laurence_gold,,390.034,394.954,Insofar as the contract is between the organizations.
1980.80-710,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,394.954,403.192,"Well, say, we'll say one labor union rented office space in New Jersey to another labor union, entered into a contract, and one of them breached the contract."
1980.80-710,0,34498,laurence_gold,,407.596,410.198,I think that that would be.
1980.80-710,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,410.198,412.982,And federal law would govern the dispute?
1980.80-710,0,34498,laurence_gold,,412.982,413.382,That's right.
1980.80-710,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,413.882,418.553,"Mr. Gold, if there isn't any present federal law we have to fashion it for you."
1980.80-710,0,34498,laurence_gold,,418.553,420.503,"--That would be right, Your Honor, and I would--"
1980.80-710,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,420.503,422.505,"I mean, isn't that what Lincoln Mills held?"
1980.80-710,0,34498,laurence_gold,,422.505,441.15,"--And Lincoln Mills, as I remember it... I don't have the quotation before me... suggested that one source of federal law, even in the collective bargaining area, would be the law that had been developed in the states."
1980.80-710,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,441.15,442.669,"Mr. Gold, let me take you... a little more extreme example."
1980.80-710,0,34498,laurence_gold,,456.576,479.342,"I would think that in most cases the federal law would adopt the state law, but there is no dispute, unless we're going to throw the statute entirely over our shoulder, that it covers contracts between labor organizations."
1980.80-710,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,597.518,605.874,"But Section 301(a) by its terms has simply conferred jurisdiction, it doesn't say what body of law shall be applied."
1980.80-710,0,34498,laurence_gold,,605.874,627.454,"Yes, but as Mr. Justice Brennan pointed out, the Court in the Lincoln Mills decision, it construed Section 301 to call for the creation not only of jurisdiction but of federal law."
1980.80-710,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,627.454,640.595,"Well, do you think that we're bound by Lincoln Mills to construe the example Justice Stevens gave you as governed by federal law?"
1980.80-710,0,34498,laurence_gold,,640.595,666.762,"I would say, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that it would be, that you would reenter the very difficult dispute which the Court confronted first in the Westinghouse case and then in Lincoln Mills as to constitutional questions, whether you can simply provide jurisdiction without substantive law."
1980.80-710,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,685.909,691.53,Certainly in diversity cases we provide jurisdiction without providing substantive law.
1980.80-710,0,34498,laurence_gold,,691.53,696.265,"Well, that is provided for in the Constitution."
1980.80-710,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,778.169,792.512,"Mr. Gold, do you have any examples in 301 cases of borrowing state law with the result that you do not have uniform rule?"
1980.80-710,0,34498,laurence_gold,,792.512,809.372,"--On statutes of limitation, at least, outside of the area which we hope the Court will reach on duty of, hybrid duty of fair representation, Section 301 cases."
1980.80-710,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,814.276,830.035,So you would suggest... you don't suggest that as an ironclad rule that one of the purposes of 301 and of Lincoln Mills was to end up with a uniform federal rule in every contracts case?
1980.80-710,0,34498,laurence_gold,,830.035,832.051,"--No, I think the Court--"
1980.80-710,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,832.051,838.372,That it would be consistent with its history to say that in the proper cases you could borrow?
1980.80-710,0,34498,laurence_gold,,838.372,841.843,--Yes.
1980.80-710,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1269.936,1291.765,"Mr. Gold, are you arguing in effect that in constitutional terms, going back to Article III, that every time... this statute having been enacted, every time one union sues another it's a case arising under the laws of the United States, within the meaning of the Constitution, regardless of what... even if they say that they're suing them for some kind of a state tort or whatever it might be?"
1980.80-710,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1291.765,1343.465,"--No, it has to be a suit on a contract between two labor organizations and Congress decided that in preference to the variation, complexity, and difficulty of determining when such suits will be entertained, that it was going to state a federal law which again, as the Court said in Carbon Fuel and was presaged by the Coronado case in which the entities, the national union... the national unions, if there are two; the local unions if there are two; the national and the local, if that is the situation; are to be treated as entities very much like corporations, that's the model."
1980.80-710,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1367.081,1375.436,"Of course, here you have rather comprehensive regulation by statute of the relationship between the collective bargaining agent on the one hand and the employer on the other."
1980.80-710,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1405.725,1420.315,"Well, I'm not contending anything concerning the relations, the contractual relations between unaffiliated labor organizations."
1980.80-710,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1423.436,1430.173,"But in terms of statute or the Constitution, what difference does it make whether the unions are affiliated?"
1980.80-710,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1430.173,1438.446,"--Oh, I agree that I don't see how there could be dispute about the point you just raised."
1980.80-710,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1531.116,1537.522,But you also are contending then that there is some federal rule of law that answers this dispute?
1980.80-710,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1537.522,1553.965,"I think we say that the federal, the question of how to interpret this section, just as the question of how the courts act in interpreting a collective agreement, is to be determined as a matter of federal law rather than state law."
1980.80-710,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1567.292,1579.366,"Well, now, in Lucas Flour we said we hold that in case such as this, incompatible doctrines of local law must give way to principles of federal law."
1980.80-710,0,34498,laurence_gold,,1584.753,1594.276,"Yes, I would think that... and that was why I answered Mr. Justice White's question the way I did."
1980.80-710,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1633.501,1636.286,Very well.
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,1640.673,1643.625,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-710,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1858.046,1875.156,"Well, that wouldn't be covered by the language of 301 because we're talking here about language of 301 that confers jurisdiction upon the federal courts of lawsuits between any labor organizations; in your case it's an individual."
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,1875.156,1880.725,"The statute does not say lawsuits between labor organizations, it says suits on contracts between labor organizations."
1980.80-710,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1880.725,1881.259,I see.
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,1881.259,1888.315,"In Smith v. Evening News this Court said that the word ""between"" modifies suits rather than contracts."
1980.80-710,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1888.315,1888.765,I see.
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,1888.765,1897.854,"And since Smith v. Evening News, individual employees have been permitted to sue alleging violation of collective bargaining agreements."
1980.80-710,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1897.854,1908.745,"But then your... you make that point, I suppose, or would make that point if a suit for an accounting were brought, which would be an equity action, and that would not be covered by the statutes."
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,1916.066,1917.085,Not necessarily.
1980.80-710,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1917.435,1921.969,Unless the equity action for an accounting were based upon a contract.
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,1929.742,1938.498,"--Under the Landrum-Griffin Act, Your Honor, a member has the right to examine the books and a right to have an accountant examine the books of the local union."
1980.80-710,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1938.498,1942.3,--301 confers jurisdiction only over suits for violations of contracts.
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,1942.3,1943.383,That's correct.
1980.80-710,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1943.918,1944.785,I see.
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,1944.785,1949.972,"--the suit would not, arising under the contract or under the construction, then 301--"
1980.80-710,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1949.972,1952.924,"If they wanted an accounting suit, they'd operate under Landrum-Griffin."
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,1952.924,1954.474,--I presume so.
1980.80-710,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1954.474,1960.944,"Mr. Axelrod, would you state once more what you just said about the holding in Smith v. Evening News?"
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,1960.944,1984.992,"In Smith v. Evening News, this Court stated that the word 301 related to suits between... related to contracts between employer and labor organization rather than suits between employer and labor organization."
1980.80-710,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2037.694,2055.406,"Can a union member, as the law presently stands, bring an individual suit, not against the union for failure to represent him correctly, but simply against the employer for breach of a collective bargaining contract under Section 301?"
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2055.406,2061.141,He can sue the employer individually but he must also allege a breach of duty of fair representation.
1980.80-710,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2061.141,2068.129,"If there's no grievance procedure provided in the contract, he can certainly sue."
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2068.129,2070.248,That was the situation in Smith.
1980.80-710,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2070.248,2071.281,"Yes, yes."
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2074.467,2080.371,"He must follow it, but he can sue the employer if he will allege a breach of the duty of fair representation."
1980.80-710,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2080.371,2081.554,But not without that allegation.
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2081.554,2082.573,That's correct.
1980.80-710,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2082.573,2089.31,"But if there is no grievance procedure he may sue the employer directly, as the second step."
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2089.31,2092.862,That's Smith.
1980.80-710,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2259.985,2264.287,Just what effect does that have on this case?
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2264.287,2271.374,It suggests that the constitution is controlled by the membership rather than by local unions.
1980.80-710,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2271.374,2273.826,Is that involved in this case?
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2273.826,2282.915,It is when you are asked to hold that the constitution is a contract between national and local unions.
1980.80-710,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2282.915,2285.617,Do you deny that it's a contract.
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2285.617,2287.234,I'm arguing that it is a contract.
1980.80-710,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2287.234,2293.038,Is it a contract within the word 301?
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2293.038,2297.759,It is a contract between member and national union or member and local union.
1980.80-710,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2297.759,2302.31,"Is it a contract within the meaning of the word ""contract""?"
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2302.31,2304.045,It is a contract.
1980.80-710,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2306.864,2310.166,You might wait till the end; you might not agree.
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2314.218,2319.438,Within the meaning of state law it has always been interpreted to be a contract.
1980.80-710,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2319.438,2325.592,"My question was, within 301, which you and I both understand is not state law?"
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2325.592,2326.192,That's correct.
1980.80-710,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2339.197,2342.066,What kind of contract do you think they meant?
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2342.066,2351.524,"--I think they meant no raiding agreements, jurisdictional dispute resolution agreements between unrelated labor organizations."
1980.80-710,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2356.259,2360.379,Any legislative history to help you that you haven't mentioned?
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2362.345,2383.393,"The legislative history of the Taft-Hartley Act, of which Section 301 is a significant portion, is replete with examples in which the Congress said we are not attempting to interfere in the day to day organization of a labor organization."
1980.80-710,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2393.884,2398.719,What says that this is not a contract?
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2398.719,2399.788,--It suggests--
1980.80-710,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2399.788,2402.654,"A little jump there, isn't it?"
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2402.654,2411.327,--It's clear that in Section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act Congress was not attempting to work to--
1980.80-710,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2411.327,2413.429,"Well, if it's not a contract, what is it?"
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2414.897,2415.73,--It is a contract--
1980.80-710,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2415.73,2416.58,"Oh, it is."
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2416.58,2419.849,--but not a contract between labor organizations.
1980.80-710,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2419.849,2420.701,What is a contract--
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2420.701,2433.259,"It's a contract under state law between member and union, a contract which also governs how the subsidiaries or how the membership organizes into small groups."
1980.80-710,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2433.259,2439.846,"--In other words, your whole position is it should be governed by state law in a state court and not the federal courts?"
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2439.846,2440.413,That's correct.
1980.80-710,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2440.413,2441.448,That's your problem.
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2441.448,2443.431,That's my position; yes.
1980.80-710,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2740.708,2754.667,"Well, maybe the federal law would be that in every case of this type the federal law incorporates the law of whatever state the controversy arose in."
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2761.154,2764.356,"--The only area... that's correct, but then there would be no uniformity which seems to be the goal--"
1980.80-710,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2764.356,2773.712,"Well, but maybe the federal law would be that in this or that or the other area there need not be uniformity."
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2773.712,2775.395,--That's contrary to the thrust--
1980.80-710,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2775.395,2778.247,It's not contrary to a case like Hoosier-Cardinal.
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2778.247,2786.119,--That's the sole exception to the general proposition that uniformity is the goal of Section 301 cases.
1980.80-710,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2786.119,2798.26,"Well, would you argue that uniformity was the pervasive concept of the labor laws, the federal labor laws?"
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2798.26,2809.782,"No, because this Court in Boeing accepted the proposition that state courts were the proper forum for determining certain types of labor disputes."
1980.80-710,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2821.876,2837.568,"Well, isn't that just saying that attaching the word ""labor"" to any number of kind of disputes that may involve a labor organization does not automatically make it a federal labor law question?"
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2837.568,2839.837,--That's correct.
1980.80-710,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2845.991,2853.311,"Mr. Axelrod, what law does apply to this case in your view?"
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2853.311,2854.763,The law of the State of New Jersey.
1980.80-710,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2854.763,2857.299,New Jersey.
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2873.574,2874.041,Yes?
1980.80-710,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2874.041,2875.76,You take the position of no jurisdiction.
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2882.764,2889.501,"Well, I'd first like to state that I disagree with Mr. Gold's interpretation of the state laws."
1980.80-710,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2972.757,2978.744,But then you don't know until after the lawsuit is over whether the court had jurisdiction or not.
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,2978.744,2982.346,All of those cases deal with inspection of the complaint.
1980.80-710,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3175.105,3190.031,"Well, would you say that allegations in the complaint are not traversable by the union on remand, or on a removal to federal court?"
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,3190.031,3196.784,This Court has always said that the allegations in the complaint govern removability.
1980.80-710,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3206.556,3215.246,But at any rate there could be no hearing or factual determination as to whether or not it affected commerce or--
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,3215.246,3216.796,Not in a removal case.
1980.80-710,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3216.796,3220.833,"--Yes, but it can be after it gets in the federal court."
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,3239.711,3251.869,"After removal, the motion to remand in a removal case is determined solely on the basis of the complaint and there is not an evidentiary hearing."
1980.80-710,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3252.954,3254.121,All right.
1980.80-710,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3259.108,3261.508,"You can answer that at 1 o'clock, counsel."
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,3356.522,3366.294,"The pending question, I believe, is whether there would be an evidentiary hearing if the Court adopts the substantial impact test."
1980.80-710,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3397.68,3409.237,"But if this suit had been filed in the federal court in the first instance and there had been a motion to dismiss on the grounds that Section 301 did not provide jurisdiction in this case, there would have been an argument on the law."
1980.80-710,1,28829,john_axelrod,,3412.939,3414.224,That's correct.
1980.80-710,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3755.696,3757.065,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.80-710,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3895.869,3920.154,"Mr. Gold, I thought Mr. Axelrod argued that a union international constitution is not a kind of contract with its constituent locals, but it is a contract with the union members, and therefore not a contract between labor organizations, which is the language of 301."
1980.80-710,2,34498,laurence_gold,,3920.154,3920.437,Right.
1980.80-710,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4033.241,4043.949,Why wouldn't he be able to sue on the theory that the constitution is a contract between the international and the local and one of the provisions in that contract is for the benefit of the individual who might be disciplined?
1980.80-710,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4043.949,4046.335,He may able to sue in a case like this.
1980.80-710,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4050.603,4057.357,"No, on their own right but they're saying that if there was a breach of a contractual provision between the international and the local, it was made for his benefit."
1980.80-710,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4057.357,4062.01,--But the union constitution is two contracts or two types of contracts.
1980.80-710,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4069.331,4082.574,"Well, no, supposing the local and the international enter into a side agreement saying, we hereby agree between us that there shall be no discipline of any member of our local except under the following circumstances; if it's that clear?"
1980.80-710,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4082.574,4101.219,"If there were a clear case of that kind then the situation would be equivalent to the situation of Smith v. Evening News, but if it is not that clear, the historic understanding is that you have a series of contracts intermixed."
1980.80-710,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4123.251,4124.351,Your time has expired now.
1980.80-710,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4124.351,4128.639,"Mr. Gold, let me ask you a question, if I may; before you sit down."
1980.80-710,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4137.143,4139.877,This is truly a hypothetical.
1980.80-710,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4139.877,4142.712,--It is truly a hypothetical.
1980.80-710,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4154.204,4172.918,"Unless the view of the circuits which have said that there has to be an effect on labor relations is excepted, the answer to that question would be, yes."
1980.80-710,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4172.918,4175.468,"And your position is, it should be yes?"
1980.80-710,2,34498,laurence_gold,,4175.468,4175.87,Yes.
1980.80-710,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4269.362,4269.962,"Thank you, gentlemen."
