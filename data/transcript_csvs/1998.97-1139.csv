1998.97-1139,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,64.34,66.692,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1139,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,85.32,87.539,What's the English meaning of actus reus?
1998.97-1139,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,87.539,107.185,"The English... it can be the... it can be interpreted as the act of the crime, or the act of the thing, and it does not have a universal meaning, but generally speaking the courts have looked at... have isolated actus reus as the conduct that must be performed by the defendant to make him punishable for a crime."
1998.97-1139,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,134.42,138.741,"Is conduct an equally satisfactory word, do you think, as actus reus?"
1998.97-1139,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,138.741,150.548,"I think conduct is not an equally satisfactory term, because actus reus refers specifically to conduct undertaken by the defendant which society has an interest in punishing."
1998.97-1139,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,150.548,154.666,"You could translate it as the criminal, the criminal act."
1998.97-1139,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,154.666,156.952,"The criminal act, or the criminal conduct."
1998.97-1139,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,176.164,177.366,You're right.
1998.97-1139,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,186.137,190.523,"Well, I'm... I'll do my best, thank you."
1998.97-1139,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,228.631,232.25,Is that the criminal act that is being punished by this statute?
1998.97-1139,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,232.25,235.218,It is part of the criminal act that is being punished by this statute.
1998.97-1139,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,245.76,247.26,"No, the use during--"
1998.97-1139,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,247.26,274.16,"--The use during, that's correct, but that is... that is our point, which is that it's not just during, it is during and in relation to the underlying crime of violence for which this defendant may be prosecuted, and to obtain a conviction under section 924(c), the Government must prove that the defendant did commit that underlying crime of violence, or was punishable for it under some principle such as Pinkerton liability, or aiding and abetting liability."
1998.97-1139,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,343.107,356.831,"--What do you think that those who revolted against King George would have thought if... you know, one of their objections was that he would transport us across the seas to be tried for crimes."
1998.97-1139,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,384.017,384.851,"Well, if the--"
1998.97-1139,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,384.851,388.468,--in London for this firearm that he possessed in Boston?
1998.97-1139,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,388.468,404.228,"--If they assoc... if the people who used the firearm associated themselves with a kidnapping that takes place in a variety of jurisdictions, the Constitution's venue provisions do recognize that it is proper to bring a defendant to trial in the place where he has committed a criminal activity."
1998.97-1139,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,452.728,455.18,"There's another statute that punishes kidnapping, isn't there?"
1998.97-1139,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,456.83,457.632,--That is correct.
1998.97-1139,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,457.632,462.267,"And this statute says, if during kidnapping you possess a firearm--"
1998.97-1139,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,462.267,464.286,Use and carry.
1998.97-1139,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,464.286,466.921,"--you get an additional penalty, right?"
1998.97-1139,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,466.921,470.689,"If during that... if during your kidnapping, the kidnapping which you carry out--"
1998.97-1139,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,470.689,471.272,Uh-huh.
1998.97-1139,0,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,471.272,477.776,"--you use and possess a firearm, uses or... use or carry a firearm, you get an additional penalty, but the penalty--"
1998.97-1139,1,32147,john_p_mcdonald,,1456.178,1462.598,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1139,2,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,2555.873,2558.425,"Unless there are any questions, I have nothing further."
1998.97-1139,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2559.292,2559.825,Very well.
