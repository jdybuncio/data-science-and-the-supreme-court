1982.81-1889,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.996,We'll hear arguments next in Public Service Commission of New York against Mid-Louisiana Gas.
1982.81-1889,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,14.871,17.821,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1982.81-1889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,625.624,641.883,"Before you leave that interpretation, am I correct in recalling that if the pipeline had a subsidiary instead of a single corporate entity that transferred from its wholly-owned production subsidiary to its transmission subsidiary, that you would regard that as a sale?"
1982.81-1889,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,641.883,642.711,I would regard that as a sale.
1982.81-1889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,644.351,647.241,Unless they do exactly the same bookkeeping for a division.
1982.81-1889,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,647.241,648.677,"--No, but there's a difference."
1982.81-1889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,648.677,649.989,What is the difference?
1982.81-1889,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,649.989,652.942,The difference is that the affiliate has been on cost.
1982.81-1889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,720.196,725.224,"Well, wouldn't it be possible to organize a division so that economically it was the exact equivalent of--"
1982.81-1889,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,725.224,728.285,"I think it... no, only in the sense of--"
1982.81-1889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,728.285,739.812,"--I can understand the statutory difference, but as a matter of economics or ordinary business and investment and all the rest, why couldn't you have your division doing the same kind of operating that a subsidiary would."
1982.81-1889,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,739.812,743.295,"--I guess you could have that, but two answers."
1982.81-1889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,800.725,808.346,Would you say the statutory language is so clear that if the commission had adopted the same construction as the Fifth Circuit had adopted that would have been impermissible--
1982.81-1889,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,808.346,809.378,"No, on the contrary."
1982.81-1889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,834.336,837.586,--So you would say that the commission rationally could have read it either way?
1982.81-1889,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,837.586,842.037,"Yes, and I say that the Court of Appeals didn't give us deference."
1982.81-1889,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,842.037,842.537,I understand.
1982.81-1889,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,842.537,846.221,Because it said that we had no input into the first sale definition.
1982.81-1889,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1014.591,1026.321,Is it your submission that an interstate pipeline company that also produces gas but does not do so through a subsidiary is not entitled to the benefits of the Act of '78.
1982.81-1889,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1026.321,1029.194,"Is not entitled to the first sale, yes."
1982.81-1889,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1029.194,1031.179,So there's never a first sale--
1982.81-1889,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1031.179,1038.301,"It's not first sale, first, because as... the statute language doesn't compel it."
1982.81-1889,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1042.769,1046.485,"--But, is the purpose of the Acts served by your position?"
1982.81-1889,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1046.485,1048.922,That's precisely our point.
1982.81-1889,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1116.879,1120.034,May I follow that up a little bit?
1982.81-1889,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1128.779,1136.167,--I would have to see how that gas is sold and how the impact is--
1982.81-1889,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1136.167,1139.322,If it were sold the same way as the gas before the bill--
1982.81-1889,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1139.322,1158.175,--I think the logic of my position would be that the basic purpose of the statute was to overrule Phillips and that we would read the statute as not covering that gas unless it could be shown that that gas production has a very substantial impact on the bifurcated market.
1982.81-1889,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1158.175,1164.282,--But would it not... would it not have a substantial impact on the extent to which gas is produced in the United States?
1982.81-1889,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1164.282,1164.954,"Yes, it would."
1982.81-1889,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1187.741,1193.066,"But if the country has a shortage of natural gas, it seems to me, your position is awfully technical."
1982.81-1889,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1193.066,1194.144,Awfully... I'm sorry.
1982.81-1889,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1194.144,1195.487,Awfully technical.
1982.81-1889,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1195.487,1196.409,It wasn't--
1982.81-1889,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1196.409,1197.143,If they had a contract--
1982.81-1889,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1197.143,1200.58,--I don't think the contract revisions is technical.
1982.81-1889,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1201.984,1203.562,--Or whether or not you have a subsidiary.
1982.81-1889,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1203.562,1206.466,"--The statute is a technical statute, undeniably."
1982.81-1889,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1261.288,1279.047,"Mr. Feit, is your argument a little bit inconsistent with FERC's own findings in connection with its Order 98, that extending the NGPA pricing to this production would encourage production and help eliminate the dual market."
1982.81-1889,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1279.047,1280.953,"I think that it's not an inconsistency, I think."
1982.81-1889,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1328.746,1335.994,It does seem there is a little tension between the articulations of FERC's findings and your argument.
1982.81-1889,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1335.994,1342.258,--I would say there is a tension and perhaps FERC could have done it somewhat differently.
1982.81-1889,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1352.252,1360.795,Was any of the gas production by affiliates of interstate pipelines formerly subject to the cost-of-service treatment?
1982.81-1889,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1360.795,1363.186,It's hard to say.
1982.81-1889,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1452.057,1459.257,"May I ask one more question, which is, do you agree with the petitioner, Arizonia Electric Coop."
1982.81-1889,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1467.489,1470.862,Of course my position is that 58 was--
1982.81-1889,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1470.862,1471.377,"Yes, I know."
1982.81-1889,0,30390,jerome_m_feit,,1471.377,1472.018,--Was valid.
1982.81-1889,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1484.059,1493.29,Mr. McKinney.
1982.81-1889,1,31739,james_d_mckinney_jr,,1493.29,1495.008,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1982.81-1889,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1774.614,1777.426,"Mr. McKinney, where in the briefs do we find these sections that you're quoting?"
1982.81-1889,1,31739,james_d_mckinney_jr,,1777.426,1788.75,--They are... throughout the briefs you will find the... Section 2(21).
1982.81-1889,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1789.811,1796.919,I think page two and three of the government's briefs is where it should be.
1982.81-1889,1,31739,james_d_mckinney_jr,,1796.919,1803.898,--It's at page two of the brief of the mid-law respondents.
1982.81-1889,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2499.805,2513.127,"Mr. McKinney, your argument seems to have concentrated, just as I believed Mr. Feit's did, on this section of the Act that defines first sale, and I realize the Court of Appeals concentrated on that too."
1982.81-1889,1,31739,james_d_mckinney_jr,,2518.859,2533.368,"Well, there's only one definition section for the entire Act, so any definition that's set forth at the beginning of the Act is encompassed and is used for all of the titles of the Act so that the other--"
1982.81-1889,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2533.368,2537.977,What's the practical consequence of the commission's definition of first sale?
1982.81-1889,1,31739,james_d_mckinney_jr,,2546.942,2574.213,--Well the commission has... I think the commission is relying upon Section 2(21) which is in the definition section at the outset of the Act and they are saying that that section does not authorize them to regulate under the Natural Gas Policy Act intracorporate transactions by pipeline companies where they transferred their own production into their systems.
1982.81-1889,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2595.923,2607.386,"Well, what has the commission done insofar as regulating or not regulating by virtue of its definition of first sale, particularly the one that's in contest here?"
1982.81-1889,1,31739,james_d_mckinney_jr,,2607.386,2619.116,--They simply have failed to recognize that the definition of first sale does indeed include a sale by a pipeline of its own production.
1982.81-1889,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2619.116,2622.661,"Well, how is that hurting your clients?"
1982.81-1889,1,31739,james_d_mckinney_jr,,2622.661,2635.422,"Well, because I represent the pipelines that have their own production and who are not therefore being given the incentive prices that Congress intended by the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978."
1982.81-1889,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2644.309,2653.306,"Well, I guess your clients would receive substantial amounts of additional money if they were given first sale pricing on these intracorporate transfers."
1982.81-1889,1,31739,james_d_mckinney_jr,,2653.306,2654.382,"That's true, Justice O'Connor."
1982.81-1889,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2655.82,2661.521,And now that gets to the windfall argument and I would be interested to know how much of a windfall that would be.
1982.81-1889,1,31739,james_d_mckinney_jr,,2671.157,2673.625,--I'd like to address the windfall argument right now.
1982.81-1889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2717.217,2718.499,May I interrupt right there.
1982.81-1889,1,31739,james_d_mckinney_jr,,2729.479,2730.448,--Absolutely wrong.
1982.81-1889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2747.754,2751.814,Confine yourself to the period in which there was cost-of-service pricing.
1982.81-1889,1,31739,james_d_mckinney_jr,,2751.814,2764.153,--Even during that period the question of whether or not a pipeline was returned the revenues required for it to be encouraged to go on with production was dependent upon a myriad of factors.
1982.81-1889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2764.153,2764.934,"Well, but wait a minute."
1982.81-1889,1,31739,james_d_mckinney_jr,,2772.555,2777.445,"Well, there was first of all... there was no difference at all between pipelines and pipeline affiliates."
1982.81-1889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2777.445,2779.632,"Well, I understand that, but take a totally independent producer--"
1982.81-1889,1,31739,james_d_mckinney_jr,,2779.632,2792.97,But between the independent producers... when Congress first embarked upon regulation of independent producers in 1954 up until 1960 they tried to regulate independent producers on a cost-of-service basis.
1982.81-1889,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2883.918,2899.146,"--Well, Mr. McKinney, they... it did apply, did it not, the cost-of-service pricing, but your point is just that it was done on an area basis so it didn't focus on individual companies?"
1982.81-1889,1,31739,james_d_mckinney_jr,,2899.146,2911.078,"With respect to independent producers, between 1960 and 1969, there was a difference between independent producers and pipelines and pipeline affiliates."
1982.81-1889,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2920.075,2923.043,"But we're talking about the pipelines, of course, here."
1982.81-1889,1,31739,james_d_mckinney_jr,,2938.676,2940.863,--But it simply is not a windfall.
1982.81-1889,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2950.484,2951.969,"Well, call it what you will."
1982.81-1889,1,31739,james_d_mckinney_jr,,2953.545,2962.979,"They would get more money than if the commission were allowed to continue regulation they don't have power under the Natural Gas Policy Act to administer, yes."
1982.81-1889,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3028.782,3037.059,Weren't pipeline affiliate producers getting cost-of-service pricing before?
1982.81-1889,1,31739,james_d_mckinney_jr,,3037.059,3049.615,"--If there were... if I understand your question, Justice O'Connor, if there were a windfall, that windfall would be just as applicable to pipeline affiliate producers as it would be to pipeline producers."
1982.81-1889,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3049.615,3051.006,"Well, that's the point of the question."
1982.81-1889,1,31739,james_d_mckinney_jr,,3051.006,3053.052,"Yes, and it would be."
1982.81-1889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3155.949,3158.354,May I ask one other question.
1982.81-1889,1,31739,james_d_mckinney_jr,,3179.735,3181.219,I'm very glad you asked that.
1982.81-1889,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3200.618,3205.023,How typical was that situation?
1982.81-1889,1,31739,james_d_mckinney_jr,,3205.023,3213.628,"I think it probably would have been more typical than not typical, although that would be quite a judgment to try to make."
1982.81-1889,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3213.628,3224.624,Mr. Feit.
1982.81-1889,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3224.624,3225.686,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1982.81-1889,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3258.344,3269.387,"On their wellhead sales, but insofar as a pipeline affiliate production went into the pipeline transmission system, was that priced on a cost-of-service basis?"
1982.81-1889,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3269.387,3271.323,In the '70's it was not.
1982.81-1889,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3271.323,3273.573,"It was not, so the two of you disagree--"
1982.81-1889,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3273.573,3277.571,"Unless it was... unless I'm... in general, it was not."
1982.81-1889,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3298.093,3304.466,--Well this is quite important to me because it's a rather dramatic difference between what the Court is being told by the two adversaries here.
1982.81-1889,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3306.607,3308.356,Not... never a hundred percent sure I'm right.
1982.81-1889,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3313.713,3316.414,"Well I understand, though, the wellheads--"
1982.81-1889,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3316.414,3320.867,"--The history is not, back here in the '50's."
1982.81-1889,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3337.078,3340.795,--No it's... your whole argument is that all they want to do is overrule Phillips.
1982.81-1889,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3345.356,3346.544,--Well I don't--
1982.81-1889,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3346.544,3358.679,"Because if that was cost-of-service pricing for this body of production, however significant it may be, the commission has changed and maybe that's because the statutory language is clear."
1982.81-1889,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3358.679,3369.144,"--As my understanding is, by the '70's whether it was sold to the pipeline or to a third party, it was on area national rates."
1982.81-1889,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3431.275,3432.728,Let me just ask this one question.
1982.81-1889,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3450.488,3454.875,"If, in fact... if, in fact, that was a first sale, right."
1982.81-1889,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3454.875,3456.921,--But it would be under the plain language of the statute.
1982.81-1889,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3456.921,3460.202,Well if... if--
1982.81-1889,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3460.202,3463.357,Which would probably explain why the commission now draws that distinction.
1982.81-1889,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3463.357,3466.324,--Well it draws the distinction since the early '70's.
1982.81-1889,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3469.276,3473.353,"How significant, on the increase that we're talking about--"
1982.81-1889,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3473.353,3474.571,"Yes, I wanted to mention that."
1982.81-1889,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3558.506,3560.254,--May I ask this question?
1982.81-1889,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3573.422,3575.5,Congress did but--
1982.81-1889,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3575.5,3583.435,"At least initially, the theory was that over time as more gas was produced, the economics of it would bring the price back down."
1982.81-1889,2,30390,jerome_m_feit,,3583.435,3594.009,"--Yes, but I think in terms of a response to you, there was nothing in the Congressional debates that one of the incentive pricing schemes would apply to any other than independent producers and those that function like independent producers."
