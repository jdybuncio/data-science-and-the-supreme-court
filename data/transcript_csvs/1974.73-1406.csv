1974.73-1406,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.693,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in number 73-1406, Chapman and others against Meier."
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,17.634,21.58,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-1406,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,106.458,116.213,Now let me make sure I have one thing clear here in what differences may derive from it.
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,133.306,149.611,That is correct Mr. Chief Justice except that the plan that we are asking for a review of today is a plan that was established as a permanent plan by a judgment that was entered in January of 1974.
1974.73-1406,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,149.611,153.089,But it is a judgment of a court not of state legislature?
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,153.089,158.422,This is not a review of a plan that has been adopted by the North Dakota Legislature.
1974.73-1406,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,217.648,221.4,"Is this all you are complaining about, senatorial districts?"
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,224.953,230.954,We have had a tradition that is basically been one Senator and two house district members.
1974.73-1406,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,266.38,273.31,"All I am saying is, that your concern is on the Senate side, and you have always had on a house side a multimember districts?"
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,273.31,277.568,Our concern is on the -- basically on the senate side.
1974.73-1406,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,292.809,296.097,Wasn't there a constitutional amendment that was defeated?
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,296.097,302.56,There was a constitutional amendment that was defeated which established basically a --
1974.73-1406,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,302.56,303.372,Single District.
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,303.372,325.353,"Well, no the basic thrust of the amendment was not to establish single districts, it was to establish a constitutional apportionment commission and it was presented to the people of North Dakota as this was a -- going to provide a way of apportioning the state legislature taking this power from the state legislature."
1974.73-1406,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,357.886,361.809,"Incidentally Mr. Kelly, this is the so called Dobson plan, isn't it?"
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,361.809,362.6,That's correct.
1974.73-1406,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,362.6,367.133,"And I gather he was chairman, was he, of a commission appointed by the court?"
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,367.133,371.25,He was one of three members of the commission that was appointed by the court.
1974.73-1406,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,371.25,373.888,"But that's what it is, the court appointed the commission, isn't it?"
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,373.888,375.462,"Yes, that's correct."
1974.73-1406,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,375.462,379.82,And was this -- is this -- that commission's plan or just Mr. Dobson's plan?
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,379.82,381.474,It's just Mr. Dobson plan.
1974.73-1406,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,401.111,410.757,And there was some expression was there if a perhaps constitutionally adopt some plan even as interim plan was perhaps constitutionally deficit?
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,410.757,423.918,"Well, there were some reservations, majority of the court at that time said well we recognize some deficiencies, the substantial population variances, the fact that the plan does not provide for Single Member Senate Districts."
1974.73-1406,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,438.765,441.016,But now it has been adopted as permanent plan?
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,441.016,444.797,The reconstitute majority of the District Court adopted it as a permanent plan.
1974.73-1406,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,444.797,446.524,What do you mean by a reconstituted majority?
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,446.524,465.25,"Well, originally two members of the three-member court, Judge Van Sickle decided that adopted it only as an interim plan, saying after the 1972 elections the special masters were referred on a permanent plan."
1974.73-1406,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,523.294,534.928,"If we were to reverse the judgment, as you ask us to do, well what sort of instructions are you suggesting that we give to the district or you wouldn't want us to draw a plan here, I take it?"
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,534.928,538.281,We're not asking for that all Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1974.73-1406,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,571.49,574.741,But of course that wasn't an inexorable rule in either of those cases?
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,574.741,584.095,"Right, it is not -- we're not submitting this issue on the basis that it is a constitutional requirement, but it is the general rule."
1974.73-1406,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,709.986,724.586,"Well, do you say that the fact that the legislature adopted a plan that encompassed multimember districts even though it was ultimately defeated in a referendum, can't be used by the district court as any indication of a state policy?"
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,724.586,725.148,I think not.
1974.73-1406,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,873.269,880.781,What was the largest number of senators in anyone district in the states?
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,880.781,882.837,There were five senators.
1974.73-1406,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,892.37,893.719,"The illustration that you are using the people, the voters had to make --"
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,893.719,896.218,"That's right, there are two other --"
1974.73-1406,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,896.218,900.172,-- have formed on 15 different people?
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,900.172,901.443,30 different people if they are going to have a kind of --
1974.73-1406,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,901.443,904.727,30 but they had the right to perform on 15 they were going to vote for?
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,904.727,905.516,Right.
1974.73-1406,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,911.558,915.593,"Mr. Kelly, this maybe an unfair question."
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,922.146,923.471,They are meeting in January.
1974.73-1406,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,923.471,928.4,Is there any serious attempt to talk about reapportionment?
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,928.4,944.133,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, this is not a veto-proof legislature this time and there is an executive branch and the majority party in the legislature are opposite sides of the fence."
1974.73-1406,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,977.252,985.968,Is this legislative assembly it was elected under this plan and presumably has a vested interest in the status quo.
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,987.687,1005.403,"I think that that's the reason that history has not borne out the observation by, I think Judge Vogel in 1965 case when he established multimember districting, that if there was a problem, the legislature would take care of it."
1974.73-1406,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1026.615,1026.854,Well --
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,1026.854,1032.586,There is also a substantial question as to whether the legislature really has the authority to reapportion itself.
1974.73-1406,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1032.586,1039.057,"But really your troubles all stem from the federal courts having gotten into the thing in the first place, don't they?"
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,1039.057,1049.427,"They stem from -- right, from changing the traditions of our state and imposing this kind of legislative districting."
1974.73-1406,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1069.925,1074.345,Tell me what's the change in the plan from the â€“ ordered?
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,1074.345,1080.176,"Well, Judge Benson originally wanted to just adopt the Dobson plan permanently, that was back in 1972."
1974.73-1406,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1097.231,1101.126,Which of these judges is from the state of North Dakota?
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,1101.126,1104.383,All three judges reside in North Dakota.
1974.73-1406,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1111.829,1118.974,"Mr. Kelly, may I tend for minute to the question asked to you earlier by Justice Blackmun."
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,1128.122,1177.707,"Insofar as we're complaining if it means that we're going to have a district, a House district with 10 members, but we're willing to concede that in accordance with the traditions of North Dakota that a district that would be comprised of one senator and two house members which is what the original decision of Judge Benson or Judge Bright and Judge Van Sickle was back in 1972, we're willing to accept that because that is not a large multimember district and it is historically in accordance with our traditions and it would seem to me not confronts the people of North Dakota with the type of problems that they are involved with now in terms of large districts, involving large numbers of people so --"
1974.73-1406,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1177.707,1181.516,So two representatives would be alright in your view?
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,1181.516,1182.546,That's our position.
1974.73-1406,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1214.72,1234.897,Mr. Kelly you think there are -- apparently think there is no difference our reviewing or being asked to review the action of the state legislature on the reapportionment and the action of the district court on reapportionment independent of any legislative enactment?
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,1234.897,1240.841,This is a -- we're talking about the jurisdiction of the court now -- I think that this --
1974.73-1406,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1240.841,1247.104,"In anyways, right now I am asking what you think the difference is or whether you think there is no difference?"
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,1247.104,1278.973,"Well, I think that if you are called upon to review a state plan that is adopted by a state legislative body and that plan has multimember districting, that in the absence of some showing that this was discriminatory or objectionable on constitutional grounds that you'd have to say them that, that is a state policy which we will respect, if it's not attacked on constitutional grounds."
1974.73-1406,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1301.664,1306.642,And here the state is defending the plan isn't it?
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,1306.642,1345.875,"Well, the Attorney General of the State of North Dakota appears as the attorney for the Secretary of State of North Dakota because he is the state officer that's charged with enforcing the election laws and we sought an injunction against him and I don't know that the Attorney General's office has any more -- provides any more basis for saying this reflects state policy, then the legislature, that the people were ultimately in North Dakota decide what policy is and --"
1974.73-1406,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1345.875,1358.509,"But in Mahan, for example, it was the state that came to us and challenged the ruling of the three-judge district court which had revived the legislative reapportionment plan."
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,1365.318,1367.26,The Attorney General is defending --
1974.73-1406,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1367.26,1368.348,The Attorney General --
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,1368.348,1404.365,"Right, but there is a distinction because it would not be a fair conclusion to say that after all the Chief Executive Officer of the State of North Dakota is the Governor, and he has and this is referred to particularly in Judge Bight's dissent, a veto message which he refers to and as the Chief Executive Officer, he states in that veto message to this legislative plan that was adopted and then defeated on referral his opposition to the legislative plan based on the establishment of large multimember districts."
1974.73-1406,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1439.508,1441.975,"But the State didn't appeal, did it?"
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,1441.975,1447.461,"The state was not a party to this case, it's just the Secretary of the State."
1974.73-1406,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1447.461,1450.13,"Well, did the Secretary of State appeal?"
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,1450.13,1451.161,No he --
1974.73-1406,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1451.161,1453.153,So he is satisfied with the judgment?
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,1453.153,1459.462,"Right, the Secretary of State is presumably, and presumably the Attorney General of North Dakota is satisfied."
1974.73-1406,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1459.462,1460.77,But he didn't appeal?
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,1460.77,1464.204,"Right, but the Governor is not satisfied nor are the people satisfied."
1974.73-1406,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1464.204,1465.571,"But, who is representing the Governor here?"
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,1465.571,1471.731,"The Governor has got a party, but the Governor couldn't be a party because he doesn't enforce the election law."
1974.73-1406,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1471.731,1485.174,Now are you suggesting that your friends who will argue on opposition to you is not speaking for the State of North Dakota through it's Secretary of State?
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,1485.174,1488.794,"He is speaking for the Secretary of State, if --"
1974.73-1406,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1488.794,1491.699,Are you suggesting he is speaking for him as an individual or as a State Officer?
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,1491.699,1495.321,"He is speaking for him as a State Officer, right?"
1974.73-1406,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1495.321,1501.92,"Well, then what's the difference between that and just being here for the state, you have me lost a little bit?"
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,1501.92,1522.34,"My only point is that if in fact, this is to suggest that there is a state policy favoring multimember districts that, that is not a bare conclusion to be drawn by a reason of the fact that the Secretary of State and the Attorney General are attempting to support and justify this court imposed plan."
1974.73-1406,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1522.34,1538.014,"Well, maybe one speculation is reasonable as that or as reasonable as any other is, that the Secretary of State and the Attorney General merely want to let this plan stay in effect until the legislature can come to grips with it in a few months from now?"
1974.73-1406,0,31299,john_d_kelly,,1538.014,1546.716,"Well, we have been waiting for ten years and more and as I say in all candor there is no reasonable prospect that they are going to."
1974.73-1406,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1660.162,1666.464,Thank your Mr. Kelly.
1974.73-1406,1,38363,paul_m_sand,,1670.428,1674.793,Mr. Chief Justice and may please the Court.
1974.73-1406,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1754.144,1755.72,How many counties are there in your state?
1974.73-1406,1,38363,paul_m_sand,,1755.72,1758.558,"53, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1974.73-1406,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1758.558,1766.619,"And under the old system before the Court got into it, how many senators were there?"
1974.73-1406,1,38363,paul_m_sand,,1766.619,1769.696,49.
1974.73-1406,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1769.696,1771.519,And twice as many representatives?
1974.73-1406,1,38363,paul_m_sand,,1771.519,1777.03,"No sir, there we had no 1:2 ratio."
1974.73-1406,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1793.47,1794.903,Per County?
1974.73-1406,1,38363,paul_m_sand,,1794.903,1795.723,Per District.
1974.73-1406,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1795.723,1797.691,"Per District, right."
1974.73-1406,1,38363,paul_m_sand,,1797.691,1806.593,"Even though the ordinary reference was to the county, but in some counties we had more than one senatorial district."
1974.73-1406,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2129.135,2134.431,"It's only as result of the court intervention, is it right?"
1974.73-1406,1,38363,paul_m_sand,,2134.431,2134.827,Right.
1974.73-1406,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2174.683,2180.041,General Sand let me get straightened out.
1974.73-1406,1,38363,paul_m_sand,,2184.975,2188.043,No they were Justice Blackmun.
1974.73-1406,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2192.481,2199.622,"So that the two to one isn't a very long tradition at all, it's only a decade?"
1974.73-1406,1,38363,paul_m_sand,,2199.622,2201.053,Since 1965.
1974.73-1406,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2201.053,2205.308,And its a court imposed tradition then?
1974.73-1406,1,38363,paul_m_sand,,2205.308,2207.221,Correct Your Honor.
1974.73-1406,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2207.221,2220.48,"Did you have any -- you say one to five before 1965, did you have many multimember house districts?"
1974.73-1406,1,38363,paul_m_sand,,2226.414,2229.826,I think we had quite a few.
1974.73-1406,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2243.989,2245.57,Large in the Larger cities?
1974.73-1406,1,38363,paul_m_sand,,2245.57,2268.482,"In the larger counties like Cass, Grand Forks, Barnes, Richland, Ward and the larger counties or the counties that had the larger cities."
1974.73-1406,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2538.875,2551.335,"Of course, General the fact that this is satisfactory to the people of your state, under the decisions of this Court, rightly or wrongly, this doesn't cut any ice at all."
1974.73-1406,1,38363,paul_m_sand,,2575.289,2577.924,I would agree with that Justice Stewart.
1974.73-1406,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2577.924,2585.162,"So it doesn't -- doesn't rightly or wrongly as I say under the precedence of this Court, that doesn't cut any ice whatsoever?"
1974.73-1406,1,38363,paul_m_sand,,2585.162,2611.664,"What I shouldn't have said and really had in mind was that within the constitutional limits, the people are satisfied with the state, with this system as they have now and we think that a 20% variance is not unconstitutional under these conditions and if the people are satisfied with it and if it meets the constitutional requirements, then there should be no change made."
1974.73-1406,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2611.664,2616.928,"Mr. Attorney General, you have just mentioned again the 20% variance."
1974.73-1406,1,38363,paul_m_sand,,2697.191,2720.474,"Chief Justice Burger, in that respect, in the small number, I mean these percentages really can be in a sense frightening because you have a change of 100 or 200 and the percentage goes way out whereas, if you have larger numbers you can have this --"
1974.73-1406,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2720.474,2722.304,You mean it cuts both ways?
1974.73-1406,1,38363,paul_m_sand,,2722.304,2726.21,"Yes, it cuts in both directions."
1974.73-1406,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2778.339,2782.137,"Thank you, do you have anything further Mr. Kelly?"
1974.73-1406,2,31299,john_d_kelly,,2782.137,2786.471,Just two points.
1974.73-1406,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2885.31,2885.672,Where is that?
1974.73-1406,2,31299,john_d_kelly,,2885.672,2897.003,There is an appendix on page A-6 and A-7 of the appendix to the jurisdictional statement.
1974.73-1406,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2898.45,2902.933,6 and 7 of the jurisdictional --
1974.73-1406,2,31299,john_d_kelly,,2902.933,2909.691,But in any event the small population and each vote is important.
1974.73-1406,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2909.691,2914.035,Population difference is 2400 to 2500?
1974.73-1406,3,38363,paul_m_sand,,2914.035,2915.82,That's correct Mr. Justice White.
1974.73-1406,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2915.82,2920.665,"1064 in district four, 1384 in district 11 A and --"

1974.73-1406,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2922.162,2923.48,-- they had those 2400?
1974.73-1406,3,38363,paul_m_sand,,2923.48,2923.879,Right.
1974.73-1406,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2923.879,2924.925,That's 700.
1974.73-1406,3,38363,paul_m_sand,,2924.925,2925.205,Right.
1974.73-1406,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2925.205,2931.844,"But when you allocate that percentage, you get a slightly different figure?"
1974.73-1406,3,38363,paul_m_sand,,2931.844,2933.218,Now well that's --
1974.73-1406,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2933.218,2934.246,Both single-member districts --
1974.73-1406,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2934.246,2934.971,Very well.
1974.73-1406,3,38363,paul_m_sand,,2934.971,2935.835,Right.
1974.73-1406,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2935.835,2947.574,"Now what -- do you how, do you know what percentage of the senate in --"
