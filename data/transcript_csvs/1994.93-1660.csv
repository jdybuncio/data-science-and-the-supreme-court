1994.93-1660,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.154,"We'll hear argument next in Number 93-1660, Arizona v. Isaac Evans."
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,39.375,43.26,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.93-1660,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,97.712,116.875,"Now, Mr. Grant, do you take the position that the law enforcement agency, the police or the law enforcement agency have no duty or responsibility to keep computer records up to date?"
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,116.875,119.41,"--No, I don't take that position, Your Honor."
1994.93-1660,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,119.41,131.551,"In this instance, do we know whether the police had any obligation to update their computer records?"
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,131.551,135.086,We had an evidentiary hearing on the motion to suppress.
1994.93-1660,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,141.89,146.811,"I guess the courts below never actually made a determination, did they--"
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,146.811,147.727,--The trial judge--
1994.93-1660,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,147.727,148.444,--as to whose error it was?
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,148.444,149.027,--did not.
1994.93-1660,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,158.618,169.057,Would it be a different case if this listing had continued for several months and had not been corrected?
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,180.715,184.333,"I believe it would be a different case, yes."
1994.93-1660,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,193.356,195.641,Although we actually don't know that here?
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,195.641,202.294,"Well, I think the evidence is clear that that's... that's why the warrant was still in the computer system here."
1994.93-1660,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,202.294,202.994,Mm-hmm.
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,231.314,262.183,"I think... I think the... I'm drawing a blank on the name of the case for the moment, but I do not... I think the result would have been the same under Leon, because in Whiting, I... or Whiteley, what the officer presented to the judge in order to obtain the warrant was simply a bare bones affidavit, and in Leon this Court noted that that sort of situation would not be the sort that would be justifiable for the good faith exclusion to the... exception to the exclusionary rule."
1994.93-1660,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,326.792,352.09,"What do you make of the argument which is suggested at... toward the end of the respondent's brief, based upon, in effect the peculiar risks that computers bring... I think the argument essentially runs that because of the great currency which computerized information has, the risk of crime is greater than it used to be when we were just dealing with pieces of paper in local police departments?"
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,365.833,370.219,I would disagree that this Court ought to fashion a rule that the police ought to be strictly responsible.
1994.93-1660,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,378.289,382.443,How do we... how do we translate the consideration of that risk into a practical rule?
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,386.729,400.803,"I think in a case unlike this, where I think the error is clearly based on judicial error, not police error, I think that what the Court ought to look at is the objective reasonableness of the arresting officers... of the arresting officers and whether--"
1994.93-1660,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,400.803,416.498,"What about the position of the Arizona supreme court, that seemed to say in this modern age to try to assign fault to a particular piece of the Government doesn't quite work, because it's manipulable where you lodge the computer."
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,460.091,480.405,"--I don't... I think that goes beyond what the Arizona supreme court said, and I think what the Arizona supreme court said is inconsistent with what this Court has said in its recent decisions over the last several years interpreting the exclusionary rule, which is, it doesn't apply whenever there's a Fourth Amendment violation, it only applies when the purpose of it is most effectively served."
1994.93-1660,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,480.405,480.839,Well--
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,507.072,509.108,That may well be a powerful deterrent.
1994.93-1660,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,511.543,517.03,"Well, certainly Sheppard and Leon were... it's not as if they were decided 50 years ago."
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,521.899,525.018,"They didn't involve computers, but yes, computers were available."
1994.93-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,525.018,527.02,"They were available, but not as widely used."
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,540.395,543.181,"Well, I think that goes a little beyond my position."
1994.93-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,547.883,548.216,Well if--
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,548.216,549.835,"--of judicial personnel, not police personnel."
1994.93-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,549.835,558.691,"--If you describe it broadly, as I did, you would have to agree it would really not matter whether the error was committed by a police officer in the home office or by a judicial officer in the home office--"
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,558.691,559.341,If the--
1994.93-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,559.341,562.476,--because in either case the officer acted reasonably.
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,562.476,574.55,"--I think if you get beyond the situation we have in this case, I think what the Court ought to focus on is the arresting officer and any other officers involved in the investigative team, for lack of a better word."
1994.93-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,574.55,591.845,"But if you don't acknowledge that there's any reason... if the deterrence focuses on the arresting officer, there's no difference between the cases, and on the other hand, if the deterrence focuses on trying to be sure people keep their records up to date, again there's no difference between the two cases."
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,597.649,609.624,"I think... I think the deterrence... if you look at what happened in this case, an officer was presented with a situation where he witnesses one violation of a traffic law."
1994.93-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,609.624,609.99,Right.
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,609.99,614.027,He then had a person who admitted a second violation of a Class 1 misdemeanor.
1994.93-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,625.233,631.822,"So his information would be exactly the same whether the misinformation about the warrant, regardless of who was responsible for that misin--"
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,631.822,633.389,"I agree, and I think his conduct--"
1994.93-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,633.389,636.041,"--Well then, my question is, why do you draw a distinction?"
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,636.041,643.713,"--Well, I think the distinction I draw here between judicial and police is that it's... there's no need to go beyond that in the facts of this case."
1994.93-1660,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,653.235,675.732,"Well, Mr. Grant, I thought in U.S. v. Hensley, decided in 1985, that we specifically said the rule is what the police department as a whole knows or doesn't know that counts in determining the Fourth Amendment violation."
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,675.732,676.101,I don't--
1994.93-1660,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,676.101,682.422,We expressly said it doesn't rest on what the arresting officer knew or didn't know.
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,682.422,683.172,--True.
1994.93-1660,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,683.172,685.54,"And you're asking us to alter that, I gather."
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,685.54,686.024,"No, I'm not."
1994.93-1660,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,688.509,695.645,"Well, I don't think what you say... at least what you have been saying is consistent with that at all."
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,695.645,703.935,"I think in Hensley the Court was faced with a situation where the officer who made the stop did not have the personal knowledge, which is similar to this case."
1994.93-1660,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,726.367,743.726,"Yes, but you have a system that the police department has invoked to enable it to function that involves using a computer system so that they can punch out the information right there in their vehicles and find out if there's an outstanding arrest warrant."
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,753.934,754.384,--I agree--
1994.93-1660,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,754.384,755.084,You would agree with that.
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,755.084,756.819,"--I agree they have some responsibility, yes."
1994.93-1660,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,756.819,771.146,"Well, would you lose your case if you said that the responsibility is not just that of the investigating officer but also of the entire police department, but not for mistakes on the judicial side?"
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,771.146,774.53,"In this case, no, I would not lose my case."
1994.93-1660,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,774.53,778.382,"--Arizona supreme court, though, to have taken a different line."
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,797.213,804.467,"I think that's what the Arizona supreme court said, and I think that's inconsistent with what this Court said in Leon and other cases, that there are--"
1994.93-1660,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,804.467,806.735,But maybe they were right and we were wrong.
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,839.421,849.294,--Because I don't think applying that broad brush with the exclusionary rule is going to change reasonable actions by officers in the street.
1994.93-1660,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,852.044,853.162,"Well, then you're right back--"
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,853.162,853.612,--other than what he did.
1994.93-1660,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,853.612,859.314,--to the problem that you admit that your rule cannot be that narrow.
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,899.991,905.128,I don't think Whiteley and Hensley go as broad as Your Honor is drawing them.
1994.93-1660,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,913.067,929.91,"Well, you in any event, leaving the question of where the line is drawn, you accept the view that the mind of someone other than the one officer doing the search or making the arrest may be relevant to the determination of what is reasonable."
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,929.91,930.176,Yes.
1994.93-1660,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,930.176,930.626,You accept that.
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,930.626,930.91,Yes.
1994.93-1660,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,930.91,931.426,All right.
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,939.932,945.586,"Because, as this Court has said, the exclusionary rule exists to deter police misconduct."
1994.93-1660,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,945.586,963.797,"Well, I realize that, but the Arizona argument said there's somebody else whom you'd better deter, because if you don't include the Government more broadly within your deterrent objective, you have no way, as a practical matter, of inducing care in the use of these computers."
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,963.797,980.093,"I think, first of all, we're beyond far what the facts of this case are, but I think if what you want to deter is officers acting unreasonably, you're not going to accomplish that by--"
1994.93-1660,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,980.093,985.211,But that's the... that is the very denial of the premise upon which I think Arizona was arguing.
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,997.018,1002.22,"--I don't think Arizona could go beyond what this Court has said, which is I feel what they have in this...."
1994.93-1660,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1002.22,1004.588,"Well, this Court perhaps can, and why shouldn't it?"
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1004.588,1007.207,I think it... I do not think it's wise to go beyond it.
1994.93-1660,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1007.207,1007.607,Why?
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1007.607,1008.074,I think the--
1994.93-1660,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1008.074,1008.457,Why?
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1008.457,1010.207,--exclusionary rule is a narrow--
1994.93-1660,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1010.207,1010.607,Why?
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1010.607,1011.207,--procedural remedy--
1994.93-1660,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1011.207,1012.109,Why should it be kept that way?
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1028.669,1028.935,--I think--
1994.93-1660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1028.935,1059.89,"Mr. Grant, it's not just a problem of what you want to deter, it's also a problem of how effective the deterrent will be, and I would think that part of your argument is that it is very effective when it's applied to the arresting officer, it's a little less effective when it's applied to the entire investigating team, but it is infinitely less effective when you trace it all the way back to somebody who's not even on the police force but in a court who's punching in something in a computer."
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1061.89,1067.544,"--I agree the weighing process, the farther away... the weighing process that is engaged in between deterrence--"
1994.93-1660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1067.544,1071.329,"In all of these cases, the price we're paying is letting the criminal off, isn't it?"
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1071.329,1071.698,--Yes.
1994.93-1660,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1071.698,1077.685,"And sometimes it's worth a deterrent where the deterrent is likely to be very effective, but it's not worth it when it isn't."
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1077.685,1078.052,I agree.
1994.93-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1078.052,1079.552,Why do you say it would not be effective?
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1099.265,1099.765,"Well, I think--"
1994.93-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1099.765,1102.383,Why doesn't it have a deterrent effect on the system as a whole?
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1102.383,1119.512,"--I think the system here, if you look at what actually happened in this case, once the system, in this case the justice court personnel, found out that there was a problem with the warrant, that Mr. Evans had been arrested pursuant to a warrant that had been quashed, the justice court personnel immediately took steps to remedy it."
1994.93-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1137.14,1140.858,So incidents that happen on the street do have an impact on what's done with this computer information--
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1140.858,1143.144,"--Well, I think... I think what the evidence in this--"
1994.93-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1143.144,1155.602,"--And the rule that we've been... that the Arizona court applied would support making sure they took action of that kind, whereas your view would tolerate saying, well, it's just too bad this fellow got arrested, but we don't really care about those things."
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1155.602,1164.707,"--No, I think my... I think my view shows is the deterrent, and based on the record in this case, is that the deterrence of the sort of personnel involved here is not necessary."
1994.93-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1164.707,1165.557,"Well, if it's not necessary--"
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1165.557,1166.592,Justice court personnel are not--
1994.93-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1166.592,1176.015,"--it would be totally costless to the State if you lose, because you have already taken steps to avoid the recurrence of this kind of mistake, so what are we fighting about?"
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1176.015,1176.298,--Well--
1994.93-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1176.298,1179.217,That's what you're telling me.
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1179.217,1180.1,--I'm--
1994.93-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1180.1,1186.823,"Isn't that what you're saying, that you've now made sure this will never happen again, which seems to me to suggest that maybe it shouldn't have happened in the first place."
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1193.56,1195.093,--Correct.
1994.93-1660,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1195.093,1197.845,What is... I guess I'm not clear on one thing.
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1206.367,1208.402,"Well, I'm not saying it's not necessary."
1994.93-1660,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1209.002,1209.552,"I'm sorry, I thought you--"
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1209.552,1229.9,"--the effectiveness of it becomes less the further away you move from the arresting officer and the people involved in the investigative team, and in those cases the balancing that is required, the cost that is incurred by suppressing relevant and reliable evidence, becomes greater, and the deterrence value becomes less."
1994.93-1660,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1229.9,1249.063,"--If we say that there's a difference between judicial personnel and police personnel, if that's the line we draw, is it plausible that we might also remand this case because it's not clear what the Arizona court would have done based on that hypothesis, or based on that principle?"
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1249.063,1250.396,I think that's plausible.
1994.93-1660,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1256.233,1265.156,"Well, but then it's plausible and perhaps possible that you would not get the reversal that you seek if we establish that principle."
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1267.441,1268.741,"That's possible, yes."
1994.93-1660,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1268.741,1276.981,"I don't see why, then, you're not addressing whether or not police clerical error might also be excused."
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1279.349,1282.968,"Well, I think I... I think I have addressed that in part of the answers to the questions."
1994.93-1660,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1295.258,1295.608,Well--
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1295.608,1297.91,--and here you don't have that.
1994.93-1660,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1301.496,1315.439,--If you have a warrant division in a large metropolitan police department and the investigation officers are routinely checking with them is the warrant division involved in the arrest or in the investigation?
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1315.439,1321.093,--I don't think that sort of involvement suffices to justify application of the exclusionary rule.
1994.93-1660,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1323.612,1324.012,How do you--
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1324.012,1329.515,--from the strong deterrence value of the actual arresting officer and those closely involved in the investigation.
1994.93-1660,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1329.515,1338.037,"--How do you deal with the Hensley case that Justice O'Connor mentioned, if you say it doesn't go all the way back through the police department?"
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1338.037,1364.621,"Well, I think it goes back... first of all, Hensley, we didn't get to an exclusionary determination because there was no finding of a Fourth Amendment violation in Hensley, and what Hensley did was go back to the initiating officer, the officer who felt there was reason to stop the defendant, and examined what he knew, the officer who started the whole procedure by asking... by putting the flier, the stop flier into the system."
1994.93-1660,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1374.727,1379.781,Is there anything else you'd like to say about the problem of the computer?
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1429.381,1429.797,As far--
1994.93-1660,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1429.797,1456.364,"That seems to be what people are driving at, and I just wondered, you're familiar with the operations of these things, and is there any light you can shed on whether the pressure that would be put on computer operators and all those associated with it to be careful not to arrest people where there is no arrest warrant, why that pressure wouldn't be meaningful, or significant, or the same as normal in an exclusionary rule case, or maybe the opposite?"
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1456.364,1465.554,"--I think the need to keep information current, and correct, is demonstrated in this case by what the justice court personnel did when they found out about the error."
1994.93-1660,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1474.326,1480.563,But that was in an environment where the Arizona supreme court excluded the evidence.

1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1497.821,1507.677,They did it because of their professional responsibilities as part of the judicial system to make sure that the system they... the information they put into the police computer system was accurate as possible.
1994.93-1660,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1507.677,1508.463,--They did not have it wrong--
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1508.463,1508.963,Correct.
1994.93-1660,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1508.963,1512.081,--but they had slipped--
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1512.081,1512.381,Yes.
1994.93-1660,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1512.381,1528.391,"--and my question, Mr. Grant, is that the Arizona supreme court is going off on something new, and they're very candid about it, so I'm... I listen to your argument, and it's true that you are putting this case in the Leon frame."
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1579.506,1586.512,"Well, I disagree with the characterization of the Arizona supreme court opinion as saying Leon is not helpful."
1994.93-1660,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1600.986,1604.224,"Well, that's pretty powerful language, and I don't think it's at all ambiguous."
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1604.724,1615.429,"--I don't... I don't think Leon is limited in the manner that the Arizona supreme court suggested, that it was limited to searches with warrants authorized by a judge."

1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1656.923,1657.542,--I don't think--
1994.93-1660,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1657.542,1659.425,Computers that have misinformation.
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1659.425,1663.262,--I don't think this situation is as far removed from Leon as that.
1994.93-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1673.451,1677.67,May I ask you one other question about the curative steps that the county took?
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1683.926,1684.459,Yes.
1994.93-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1684.459,1685.126,They were.
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1685.126,1688.544,They were... the arrest was on January 5th.
1994.93-1660,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1703.637,1703.87,I see.
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1703.87,1709.808,"--that had not been quashed... that had not been removed from the system, excuse me."
1994.93-1660,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1709.808,1717.313,"What was the curative action, that they just checked the computer entries for that one day, or they completely changed their system?"
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1720.265,1734.589,"It was that they took... well, first of all, they took the curative action of calling the police department, or the sheriff's office, and telling them to remove that warrant from the system, and also to release any hold on Mr. Evans based on that warrant."
1994.93-1660,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1743.631,1744.431,On that one day?
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1744.431,1744.947,--Yes.
1994.93-1660,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1744.947,1748.916,But there were no other systemic changes made in the--
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1748.916,1749.535,"No, there were no other--"
1994.93-1660,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1749.535,1752.987,--basic routine where one person calls the other and tells them to remove it from the warrant list?
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1752.987,1753.337,--No.
1994.93-1660,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1754.587,1757.038,So that's the curative action you rely on?
1994.93-1660,0,25384,gerald_r_grant,,1757.038,1759.656,Yes.
1994.93-1660,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1759.656,1760.973,"Thank you, Mr. Grant."
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,1766.477,1769.829,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1660,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1778.202,1794.814,"Well, may I ask you a preliminary question, Ms. Carrigan, and that is this: do we take this case on the assumption that the error that occurred here occurred within the justice court and its personnel?"
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,1795.197,1795.814,"No, Your Honor."
1994.93-1660,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1795.814,1797.664,--Is that the assumption?
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,1797.664,1812.074,"No, Your Honor, I don't think that is at all clear from the record, and if... and the joint appendix has the entire suppression hearing in it, in which the Government had the burden of proving that the police were blameless."
1994.93-1660,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1829.785,1834.939,"The supreme court of Arizona decided the case on the basis that it didn't matter, didn't it--"
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,1834.939,1835.472,That's correct.
1994.93-1660,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1835.472,1838.891,--whether it was the police employees or the justice court employees?
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,1838.891,1839.491,That's correct.
1994.93-1660,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1839.491,1849.449,"So if we were to accept the State's submission here, presumably the supreme court of Arizona or some other Arizona court would have to make a factual determination?"
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,1849.449,1853.734,"I believe so, Your Honor."
1994.93-1660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1886.205,1889.324,"No, go on, finish your thought, what you were--"
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,1889.324,1890.859,I'd like to hear your question.
1994.93-1660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1894.311,1898.513,"--My problem, Ms. Carrigan, is more fundamental than that."
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,1945.494,1946.594,That's correct.
1994.93-1660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1946.594,1956.384,"If this person is picked up wrongfully for this misdemeanor violation, anything found on him will not be admissible in evidence."
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,1968.776,1969.076,I--
1994.93-1660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1969.076,1980.167,"--and if somebody wagged a finger at me and said, if you punch in an arrest that shouldn't be in there, anything that's found in the course of that arrest will not be admissible in court."
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,1984.202,1987.154,--I think the answer is found in Leon itself.
1994.93-1660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2013.555,2019.642,"You're not relying... you're not answering my... I mean, my question goes to deterrence, and you're not answering that."
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2044.692,2061.987,"I believe that in our brief, Your Honor, on pages 24 and 25, we suggest what... some alternatives to what should have been done in order to have this be a cleaner computer procedure."
1994.93-1660,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2066.273,2067.891,"Ms. Carrigan, maybe you can clarify this."
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2081.614,2081.965,--That's--
1994.93-1660,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2081.965,2083.65,--do I understand you correctly?
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2083.65,2098.761,"--That's correct, Your Honor, and what we're saying is that the ordinary citizen who is arrested, has his liberty deprived by a wrongful arrest, doesn't know or care which Government employee is responsible."
1994.93-1660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2144.123,2145.808,"Deterrence, Ms. Carrigan."
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2172.708,2173.241,"Well, I--"
1994.93-1660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2173.241,2193.039,"If the political process doesn't cause the system to be careful, if people in the municipality don't get enraged against their Government that allows these things to happen, I don't see how the Government is going to be any more careful if it says, you know, people who shouldn't be arrested, if they are arrested, it'll do no good to arrest them."
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2195.672,2208.381,"--I think the problem is in the word deter, then, because whether you say, deterring negligent maintenance, or encouraging housekeeping, that is what we are asking for."
1994.93-1660,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2235.199,2247.94,"Well, that addresses the evil that you wish to cure, but Justice Scalia, and I think perhaps some others of us, would like to hear your comments on why the remedy you propose will cure that evil."
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2263.283,2264.033,What I am--
1994.93-1660,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2264.033,2273.222,Why would the computer operator be deterred by imposing the exclusionary rule for the computer operator's mistake?
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2280.643,2294.902,"--What I'm saying, Your Honor, is, we're not asking that the sheriff's clerks work faster, and we're not saying that somehow justice court employees should make their phone calls in the morning."
1994.93-1660,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2320.203,2328.975,"Well, then, as the record of the argument stands now, you do not contend that any deterrence will be achieved by the exclusionary rule."
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2330.675,2333.01,"Oh, we do indeed, Your Honor, because--"
1994.93-1660,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2333.01,2335.729,"Well, can we finally get to that, you can tell us why?"
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2335.729,2362.947,"--Because what we're arguing is that if the police are aware that they are relying on inaccurate information in their systems, then they're going to do something about the procedure for maintaining, housekeeping, cleaning, however you want to put it, to make their systems, and they are their systems--"
1994.93-1660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2362.947,2363.38,Why?
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2363.38,2365.064,--and they have responsibility to make them more accurate.
1994.93-1660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2365.064,2368.516,"Why would they do that, because then they won't be able to arrest the person at all?"
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2368.516,2370.635,"Well, I think that--"
1994.93-1660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2370.635,2373.254,They still will not get the bad guy.
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2373.254,2382.11,"--that if the police could put more in the computer and they could get away with it, why, then they would have access to all of us and all of our homes, so let's do away with--"
1994.93-1660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2382.11,2382.543,They wouldn't be able--
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2383.076,2383.51,--Yes.
1994.93-1660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2383.51,2389.197,"And maybe you want to say, two wrongs make a right."
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2413.277,2413.729,Your Honor--
1994.93-1660,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2413.729,2433.873,"No, but isn't it true that you impose a cost on society every time you let a person free, and in order to avoid... just like when you have negligence, there's costs involved, and that if the cost is imposed on the entire society, the entire society will take steps to hire computer operators who are efficient and honest and so forth."
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2446.783,2447.75,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1660,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2447.75,2460.71,"Isn't that the most obvious, elementary kind of deterrence that's all through the tort system, where you impose costs by making people respond... liable for the negligence of their agents if they harm somebody?"
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2460.71,2473.95,I recall the words that Justice Scalia wrote in Arizona v. Hicks when he said that the criminality of the few sometimes must be insulated to protect the privacy of us all.
1994.93-1660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2473.95,2475.885,I agree with that.
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2508.47,2509.087,If we are doing--
1994.93-1660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2509.087,2509.787,None.
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2509.787,2530.484,"--If we are doing a cost analysis, Your Honor, what we are comparing is the cost of having Mr. Evans tried on a possession of marijuana case and the cost to the rest of us of very real possibility of wrongful arrest without probable cause."
1994.93-1660,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2548.195,2551.73,But in fact he had narcotics on his possession.
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2551.73,2552.03,--That's correct.
1994.93-1660,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2552.03,2555.682,It's not as though you're dealing with somebody who hadn't committed an offense.
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2555.682,2564.038,"But the implication for the rest of us, Your Honor, is that we could be arrested without probable cause and we could be incarcerated for hours."
1994.93-1660,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2564.038,2591.355,"Let me ask you this: suppose a police officer relies on an informant to obtain the facts to go get an arrest warrant, and the policeman reasonably believes and reasonably relies on this informant and gets an arrest warrant, makes the arrest, and it turns out later that the informant was lying."
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2591.355,2591.972,I think--
1994.93-1660,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2591.972,2597.692,"Now, that evidence would not be suppressed, I assume, under Leon, at all."
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2597.692,2602.58,--The court would look... you were referring earlier to Hensley.
1994.93-1660,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2607.983,2623.259,"No, the court would look to see whether objectively the policeman made... took reasonable action, and if it's determined that he did, we wouldn't keep the evidence out of court, would we?"
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2623.259,2624.343,"--No, Your Honor, you would not."
1994.93-1660,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2624.343,2628.397,"No, and I don't see how this is materially different."
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2642.138,2645.923,I... perhaps I didn't understand your example.
1994.93-1660,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2651.81,2652.845,"Yes, right."
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2652.845,2657.38,"But it was a confidential, reliable informant and that is why it passed muster?"
1994.93-1660,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2657.38,2659.499,Uh-huh.
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2659.499,2693.755,"That would, indeed, be terrible, and it would be one of the things that happens all too often, unfortunately, but the problem here is, we're not just arguing for exclusion to correct the Fourth Amendment invasion of Mr. Evans, because we know from Leon and Calandra that exclusion is directed, through deterrence, at protecting the rights of other citizens in future encounters with the police, and that's really what this argument is all about."
1994.93-1660,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2693.755,2695.939,"All right, but then what is the... let me go back to that."
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2745.188,2767.721,"Well, I don't think in the example that we are deterring informants, Your Honor, but what we do have here is a very shoddy procedure, if you will, that was set up by the police themselves in order to maintain their control of their own computer, and that's fine, but if they have sole control, then they have sole responsibility."
1994.93-1660,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2767.721,2769.137,Okay.
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2791.317,2804.041,"Well, in Leon... Leon was decided, I believe, because there was a preference for warrants, and in Leon, the exception was created."
1994.93-1660,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2868.483,2873.971,"I'm not sure, because I mean, in here, all the people who went to apply for a warrant did go to apply for a warrant."
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2893.015,2893.982,Precisely.
1994.93-1660,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2896.082,2897.017,Is it a different kind of mistake?
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2897.017,2899.017,--this kind of procedure--
1994.93-1660,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2899.017,2899.75,What's the difference?
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2905.354,2912.61,--The police action in Leon was directed by a magistrate who issued a search warrant.
1994.93-1660,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2921.298,2934.69,"Well, if it's determined by the courts below that it resulted from an error made by the justice court, then how do you answer the question?"
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2945.331,2960.84,"If I made that assumption, Your Honor, I would try to sit where the trial court judge was sitting, and he said it made no difference, it was still the Government, and the Government had caused this person to be arrested without probable cause."
1994.93-1660,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2960.84,2979.921,"Well, that's the issue, of course, and Leon spoke in different terms, and so we have to ask why that doesn't control, because we have said that where the error arises in the judicial branch, we don't think the deterrence is such that it justifies excluding the evidence."
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,2979.921,2992.579,"And what we are saying, Your Honor, is that there... that this arrest was not based upon any exercise of judicial discretion, because after all, the judge quashed the warrant."
1994.93-1660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3007.321,3039.142,"Ms. Carrigan, suppose the negligence here was not on the part of the judicial department, but rather the Arizona Department of Public Works, and let's assume the contraband was discovered not in the course of a mistaken arrest, but rather in the course of providing ambulance assistance to this individual after his car has fallen into a pothole that has been left on the street by the Department of Public Works."
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,3061.389,3064.155,"Well, I'm not sure I understand your hypothetical."
1994.93-1660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3065.338,3065.771,Big pothole--
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,3065.771,3066.305,--in the trunk?
1994.93-1660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3066.305,3068.357,"--which was left there by the city, negligently, okay."
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,3077.479,3078.296,And it was something--
1994.93-1660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3078.296,3080.581,Is it fair to put him in jail for the cocaine?
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,3080.581,3086.985,--It was something that was clearly recognizable to a street worker as cocaine and therefore was evidence in plain view?
1994.93-1660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3086.985,3087.185,Yes.
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,3091.853,3094.436,[Laughter]
1994.93-1660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3094.436,3096.888,"Oh, yes, it was a product of... there wasn't an arrest."
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,3103.575,3103.944,And this--
1994.93-1660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3103.944,3105.594,"Now, you wouldn't try to keep him out of jail, would you?"
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,3105.594,3112.081,"--And this was a person who had the authority to arrest, or who made a citizen's arrest because he knew it was cocaine?"
1994.93-1660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3112.081,3123.622,"Once they saw the cocaine, they certainly had authority to arrest him, assuming it was okay for them to be there, but it wasn't okay for them to be there if it was the product of the city's negligence, right, and it was, because the city had left the pothole."
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,3123.622,3129.959,"Well, I think probably there might be both a civil and a criminal action following--"
1994.93-1660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3129.959,3138.982,"I guess, but I really don't... I don't see a whole lot of difference in the essentials between that situation and what is occurring here."
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,3138.982,3157.628,"--If I'm understanding your question, You're Honor, you're saying, if it is someone other than the police, if it is a justice employee or perhaps a Motor Vehicle Department employee who has something to do with the computer, then where should we draw the line?"
1994.93-1660,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3157.628,3162.613,"Yes, who has something to do with the fact that this person has been discovered to be a criminal."
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,3162.613,3184.879,"And I think that you have identified a very real problem with what the State is proposing here, because in every case there would then have to be a determination as to who was responsible, and how much involvement that person had in law enforcement under Leon, so as to--"
1994.93-1660,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3184.879,3200.372,That's why the Arizona supreme court said as far as they were concerned it's Government carelessness and that you shouldn't have to have a trial over about whether it's the clerk in the police station or the... but let me ask you a question about what you argued in your brief in opposition.
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,3247.585,3253.12,"--We have not abandoned our jurisdictional argument, Your Honor."
1994.93-1660,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3306.272,3316.229,"Well, I suppose what the Court would say, if it accepted the State's submission, was that, proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion."
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,3357.556,3361.841,I think there are two parts to that answer.
1994.93-1660,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3382.92,3383.42,May I ask--
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,3383.42,3383.92,--Yes.
1994.93-1660,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3383.92,3384.87,--just one question?
1994.93-1660,1,18592,carol_a_carrigan,,3438.941,3473.645,"No, indeed, Your Honor, because what Leon says is that we will rest on the assurance that some magistrate or judge doing his job made an assessment on probable cause, but if you look in the Leon decision at page 923, you'll find there are four exceptions to the exception, if you will, and one of those exceptions is if the magistrate abandons his job, or his responsibilities."
1994.93-1660,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3499.646,3501.332,"Thank you, Ms. Carrigan."
