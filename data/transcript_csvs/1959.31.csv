1959.31,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,18.232,"Number 31, United States of America, Appellant, versus Bernard Mersky, et al."
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,20.687,25.709,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,273.845,274.852,May I ask whether --
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,274.852,275.92,"Yes, sir."
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,275.92,287.627,"-- whether the Government construes -- construed out order of bringing this case here, following for the consideration here on the merits."
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,296.414,296.838,"That's right, Your Honor."
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,296.838,308.727,"What I want to know is why, assuming jurisdiction point, goes to you want this Court to pass on to substantive issue."
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,308.727,309.235,We do not --
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,309.235,317.22,Is it because we postponed the jurisdictional question to the hearing of the case on the merit and the Government thought that meant that we will consider the merit?
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,317.22,319.42,"Oh, no Your Honor, oh, no."
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,329.076,332.295,And I suppose -- I suppose that disposed of --
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,332.295,334.689,"Well, if we succeed -- if we succeed there."
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,334.689,344.722,I want to know why the Government thinks as it's evident there that we should decide the merits of that and having been note decision below on that?
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,344.722,349.694,"Well, Sir, then I have -- I have misled you, Your Honor because we do not expect you to pass upon the merits."
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,349.694,350.052,You do not --
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,350.052,352.777,-- if we prevail upon the jurisdictional issue.
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,352.777,353.596,Yes.
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,353.596,359.048,"But if -- if you -- if we lose on the jurisdictional issue, then, this Court will have to pass on the merit."
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,359.411,361.033,-- you argue -- that's why you ask?
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,361.033,361.746,"Yes, sir."
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,361.746,370.466,But then you -- I want to know in case we're with you on the -- the case -- Court of Appeals was wrong on the jurisdictional question.
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,370.466,371.227,"Yes, sir."
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,371.227,380.264,"Then, is the Government position that we should -- we should send the case back or dispose of the merits here as we could jurisdictionally, couldn't we?"
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,380.264,381.179,"That's right, Your Honor."
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,381.179,382.622,"Now, what is the Government's position on that?"
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,382.622,393.761,"Well, the Government's position is that, under the literal language of Criminal Appeals Act, the case should properly be disposed of by returning it to the Court of Appeals for the decision on the merit."
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,393.761,398.746,Yes (Inaudible) I just wonder what's that the Government position.
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,398.746,399.408,"Yes, sir."
1959.31,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,476.062,479.311,"Mr. Grimm before you that regulation, may I ask you?"
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,491.771,498.081,"Well, sir, treasury -- Treasury Decisions are published separately in bound volumes."
1959.31,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,498.081,499.47,Is this a Treasury Decision?
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,499.47,500.306,"Yes, Your Honor."
1959.31,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,500.306,501.305,I see.
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,501.305,506.447,"It's called by that name, but it is nonetheless an administrative regulation of the Treasury Department."
1959.31,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,524.181,526.828,And this has not been published as a Treasury Decision?
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,526.828,528.694,"That's right, Your Honor."
1959.31,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,528.694,531.992,"Well, what is the significance of filing it with the division of Federal Register?"
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,531.992,540.939,"Well, that is its effective moment of the date of the actual minute upon which it is filed with the division of Federal Register."
1959.31,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,540.939,545.513,It wasn't published in the Federal Registry?
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,545.513,552.616,"No, publishment in the Federal Register is not essential to its binding effect."
1959.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,552.616,552.986,I understand that.
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,555.597,556.034,"No, sir."
1959.31,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,558.339,560.481,Along with the other so called TDs?
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,560.481,561.131,That's right.
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,926.691,949.126,"But, am I wrong in thinking that such narrow constructions, that one was to generalize the instances or related to the question whether the District Court passed on the statute whatever the statute means or decided the matter of criminal pleading in procedure -- pleading to take this?"
1959.31,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,973.787,977.7,That wasn't the case (Inaudible)
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,977.7,980.137,"No, Your Honor."
1959.31,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,988.595,993.086,"I mean, the issue -- the issue hasn't always been whether it's pleading or whether it's a statute."
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1000.691,1001.888,"That's right, Your Honor."
1959.31,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1001.888,1002.929,Is that right?
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1002.929,1003.614,"That's right, Your Honor."
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1016.091,1017.909,And that was passed on its present --
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1017.909,1018.141,"No Your Honor, no Your Honor."
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1018.141,1018.878,As I understood --
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1018.878,1019.979,"No, Your Honor."
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1021.678,1022.166,What?
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1022.166,1033.469,The Court of Appeals thought so and thought that the Foster case cited in our brief and discussed in our brief --
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1033.469,1034.257,It's not in my mind.
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1034.913,1036.538,At page 233 U.S. 515.
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1036.538,1044.869,"Put that case aside all the cases in the 20 years decided here, have been cases of pleading, questions of pleading, haven't they?"
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1044.869,1046.592,"Generally, that's true."
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1046.739,1050.221,It was in general?
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1050.221,1050.879,"Well, yes."
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1054.553,1054.721,No.
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1068.478,1069.438,"Well, it is -- it is true."
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1069.438,1069.492,Not --
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1069.492,1091.73,It is true that it's been restricted strictly to the case where the District Court has gone to the question of the validity or construction of the statute and that alone put on what -- the basis upon which the Court has narrowed its review has been upon this provision of the Criminal Appeals Act.
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1091.73,1113.924,"Doesn't shed any light from me at all in this statute and for many differences, statute includes any pronouncement that has the force of the law, take the cases that come here under the three-judge court statute, the case in which Mr. Justice Brandeis quotes, I think it was a need (Inaudible) opinion but is not been the law of this Court, has it?"
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1113.924,1115.196,"No, sir."
1959.31,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1115.196,1118.98,That question has already been decided (Inaudible)
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1118.98,1119.818,"No, sir."
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1121.639,1122.463,It hasn't been.
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1148.553,1149.478,"Yes, sir."
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1202.919,1206.418,"Well, we've also considered the fact when we couldn't tell."
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1206.418,1206.936,"Oh, Yes."
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1207.771,1208.709,We couldn't tell.
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1208.709,1213.001,Or when views were intertwined or when he was so vague that you couldn't be sure.
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1213.001,1236.208,"And I am very sympathetic, really sympathetic with your provision that this -- this Court should construe legislation could have not (Inaudible) but it doesn't help me if you invoke that and in Court constantly review direct -- on direct appeals constructions of regulation under the old (Inaudible)"
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1236.208,1242.855,"Well, sir, the fact that you require -- that you're called upon to review under one statute is not necessarily an argument to review under the other."
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1242.855,1243.071,No.
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1266.558,1270.7,"Well, sir, I -- I once again --"
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1270.7,1272.705,(Voice overlap)
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1272.705,1278.277,And -- and it's not been that -- of course I must begin with the proposition that hasn't been decided.
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1304.567,1317.691,"But the Court's -- the Court (Inaudible) looks the other way, fight the other way and it looks to be the other way on -- and now is it of the enforceability, the criminal enforceability of the of regulation."
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1330.381,1331.771,"Oh, dear."
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1331.771,1336.614,"Here is a well know, Primo -- Primo."
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1338.028,1339.13,"That's right, Primo."
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1339.13,1358.5,"Primo (Inaudible) all those cases beginning with this, there would be (Inaudible) each is particular indicted because Ethan said, unless the Congress specifically said violation of a regulation shall be (Inaudible) there is no empowering authority to regulate regulations."
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1358.5,1359.703,And provide -- and provide some --
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1359.703,1362.187,So that there was a statute behind the regulation.
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1362.187,1365.401,And provide some penalty for the -- violation of the regulation.
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1365.401,1371.032,In that moment that there -- that there must be a specific statutory provision --
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1371.032,1371.484,Precisely at all.
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1371.484,1374.661,-- on he basis of which and penally enforce the regulation.
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1374.661,1376.062,That's precisely looked so.
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1377.388,1379.363,Of what (Inaudible)
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1379.363,1384.491,That concludes neither all is that this is a distinction between a regulation and a statute.
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1387.262,1392.45,"But statute is the foundation of the regulation otherwise, you couldn't -- you couldn't prosecute."
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1392.45,1398.604,"Nonetheless, it is the statute alone which establishes the penalty for violation of the regulation."
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1425.038,1432.247,You haven't said a word about any light of degree from the enactment of the original Act of 1907.
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1432.247,1433.394,Well --
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1433.394,1435.467,Can we get any light at all?
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1435.805,1436.763,"First, -- first of all --"
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1436.763,1438.909,-- existent then but there are good many.
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1438.909,1448.603,"Well, I've -- I've searched very carefully through the legislative history of the 1907 Act and I have not been able to find any reference to administrate a regulation."
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1457.042,1457.899,The Armour case.
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1457.899,1472.015,-- the Armour case where a District Court have sustained a special plea in bar and the Criminal Appeals Act of course made that a separate basis for direct appeal here.
1959.31,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1508.279,1513.938,I simply bet that (Inaudible)
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1513.938,1527.908,"Second, it all -- it also should be said too in that respect that the Criminal Appeals Act has been considered by this Court many, many times since 1907."
1959.31,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1551.206,1552.94,(Inaudible) part of the merits at all?
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1552.94,1554.761,I like to spend a few minutes on the merits sir.
1959.31,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1554.761,1555.056,"No, no."
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1557.825,1562.549,I would like to say I couldn't deal about special plea in bar.
1959.31,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1562.549,1563.149,If you have to.
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1563.149,1567.952,To say just as -- to talk just briefly about a special plea in bar.
1959.31,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1629.703,1635.477,Is it possibly that there has been a little time when (Inaudible) in bar.
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1637.395,1638.196,"That's right, Your Honor."
1959.31,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1688.848,1696.838,"Why not the motion considered in a patent or in bar, (Inaudible)"
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1696.838,1699.242,No.
1959.31,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1863.487,1867.132,And your the conclusion from that is what?
1959.31,0,22340,eugene_l_grimm,,1867.132,1877.1,"My conclusion from that Your Honor is that paragraph two and three deal with different things, value and marking to inform the public."
1959.31,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1938.6,1940.174,Mr. Schapira.
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,1940.174,1945.225,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1959.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2077.109,2116.852,"I don't -- I don't understand because if this Court -- if no direct appeal could be taken to it from the construction, from the decision by the District Court construing the regulation one way of that in another, if direct appeal couldn't be taken to this Court because it did not constitute a construction of the statute, both statute, the approval of appeal that then, the general appealability of final decision by the District Court to the Court of Appeals come into operation."
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2116.852,2131.425,May I respectfully direct to Your Honor's attention to the footnote of the opinion of the Court of Appeals on page 18 of the record?
1959.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2131.425,2132.295,Yes.
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2132.295,2149.899,"It says that an Appeal such as this would ever have been within in the Supreme Court's exclusive jurisdiction, it is not, since that Court's jurisdiction remain undiminished when jurisdiction of the matters not appealable to it, was first vested in the Courts of Appeals in 1942."
1959.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2163.608,2167.011,"I don't understand that, I don't understand that."
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2167.011,2169.381,I simply submit this to Your Honor as part of the opinion --
1959.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2169.381,2193.888,"I don't think that 1942 statute -- assuming this Court, assuming this is not within the term statute of the 1907 Act and it's just to inform, (Inaudible), I do not know of anything that wiped out the appealability of to the Court of Appeals of any find decision of the District Court."
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2198.36,2213.068,"Well, I don't know off hand the authority, but my impression is that the Court of Appeals had in mind the provisions of 3731 which confers jurisdiction on this Court in these specific cases --"
1959.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2213.068,2218.738,"But if it -- if it doesn't confer, then it isn't -- then it isn't in this Court it therefore remains a law."
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2218.738,2230.127,And that same section if Your Honor please also stated that the cases which are not appealable directly to United States Supreme Court shall be appealable to the Court of Appeals.
1959.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2247.124,2247.383,But it's not (Inaudible)
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2247.383,2251.41,That was the footnote says.
1959.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2259.347,2259.979,I understand that.
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2271.14,2275.175,"I don't say that, that's true now nor of the Court of Appeals said that it was true or not."
1959.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2280.345,2281.96,-- 1959
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2281.96,2292.506,"Precisely, that's why I wasn't particularly concerned anymore than I was concern whether this -- whether the learned discussion of this situation between common law demurrer and a special plea at bar."
1959.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2325.214,2329.92,We agree -- disagree with the Court of Appeals.
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2329.92,2332.454,"Well, it shouldn't be any place and neither the fact --"
1959.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2332.454,2334.219,It has to be at some place that --
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2334.219,2340.389,"Well, may I -- may I respectfully answer that directly and that's this."
1959.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2370.044,2373.036,Neither you or I can (Inaudible)
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2373.036,2373.786,"Well, that's true."
1959.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2377.429,2383.091,"In the rational world, that was really happening.[Laughter]"
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2383.091,2386.829,I hope to be irrational for a little while.
1959.31,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2580.326,2581.493,This problem may I --
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2581.493,2582.39,"Yes, sir."
1959.31,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2582.39,2594.987,Is there any contest between you and the Government over the statute proper or are you merely disputing the proper interpretation of Treasury Regulation 5321?
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2594.987,2595.855,It's the latter.
1959.31,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2595.855,2596.715,Just the latter?
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2596.715,2597.942,"Yes, Your Honor."
1959.31,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2613.486,2618.593,"So then -- so then, no statute has been held unconstitutional?"
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2618.593,2621.061,"No, sir the statute has not been held unconstitutional."
1959.31,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2621.061,2629.374,"It is only been held that the regulation purporting to have been issued under the statute was void, under your view?"
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2629.374,2641.165,"Yes, Your Honor except this for purposes of jurisdiction again if that's what we're -- we are thinking of now is that you cannot construe the regulation without construing the statute."
1959.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2663.763,2674.526,"Yes, but unlike the Foster case where you have the (Inaudible) of the statute in order to determine the ultra or intra varies of the regulation?"
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2674.526,2675.116,"Yes, Your Honor."
1959.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2675.116,2676.244,There is no such question about it around --
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2676.244,2676.777,"No, sir."
1959.31,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2679.187,2684.494,"(Inaudible) the statute as the authorizing, penalizing state."
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2684.494,2685.51,Precisely.
1959.31,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2696.778,2697.781,The regulation?
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2697.781,2707.968,I mean the statute because the statute simply says that what we need is an indication of the country of origin but there is no definition in the statute of the country of origin.
1959.31,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2713.807,2714.932,"Go ahead, pardon me."
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2714.932,2719.013,Before 1953 the country of origin was Germany.
1959.31,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2728.117,2733.249,Well then doesn't that present a question of the validity of regulation whether it is in the statute?
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2733.249,2734.509,"Yes, Your Honor."
1959.31,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2746.224,2764.109,"You mean then that under Criminal Appeals Act, a regulation purporting to have been adopted under the statute, even though voids the mark and unauthorized presents a matter directly appealable to this Court and not to Court of Appeals?"
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2764.109,2766.954,"Well, I -- I'm not quite sure?"
1959.31,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2766.954,2768.359,Do you understand what I mean?
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2768.359,2770.311,I am not sure that I do.
1959.31,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2770.311,2793.142,"Well, is it your position that a regulation which is broader than and not authorized by the statute which purports to impose some duty and results in the controversy that that fact alone makes that matter appealable directly to this Court under the Criminal Appeals Act?"
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2793.142,2793.741,"Yes, Your Honor."
1959.31,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2800.481,2808.107,"Not for that -- not for that reasons, but that you couldn't tell whether it was a (Inaudible) statute without construing the statute."
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2808.107,2809.183,Precisely.
1959.31,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2810.46,2817.115,"Here, you have (Inaudible) a different one concededly making the regulation (Inaudible) permissible –"
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2817.115,2817.401,"Yes, sir."
1959.31,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2817.401,2821.721,"(Inaudible) we have nearly the problem construing the regulation, is that right?"
1959.31,1,32833,julius_l_schapira,,2821.721,2823.952,"Yes, sir."
