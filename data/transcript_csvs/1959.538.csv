1959.538,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3407.322,3409.062,That itself was after the (Voice Overlap) --
1959.538,1,43857,william_c_beatty,,3409.062,3413.737,"Oh, and -- and much over a year after the expiration of the contract."

1959.538,1,43857,william_c_beatty,,3424.785,3428.299,"That question was raised, I think, in an indirect question."
1959.538,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3464.837,3470.346,"Well, I noticed in paragraph nine of the company's answer, at page 10 of the second, is it, that --"
1959.538,1,43857,william_c_beatty,,3470.346,3471.31,"I -- I believe that's right, sir."

1959.538,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3471.651,3483.878,"This -- this apparently contends for mootness on the ground that the decision of the arbitrator would be binding only during the life of the contract which expired at midnight, April 4."

1959.538,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3895.447,3914.436,What is your understanding of the basis apart which the Court of Appeals concluded that there could be no back pay after the expiration date of the contract or any reinstatement after that date?

1959.538,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3950.943,3966.296,"Well now, what was the -- what -- where in the arbitration provision itself or what in the arbitration provision itself do you think the Court of Appeals relied on as indicating a limited scope for this?"
1959.538,1,43857,william_c_beatty,,3966.296,3970.467,I don't think that they relied upon any specific -- I -- I can't say that.
1959.538,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3975.536,3982.68,"But -- but there isn't anything, is there, in the arbitration provision itself which indicates that the parties agreed upon such a limitation?"
1959.538,1,43857,william_c_beatty,,3982.68,3989.166,"Well, the only thing that I would say is that you remember the language that I pointed out, meaning and applications of the provisions --"
1959.538,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3989.166,3989.576,Yes.

1959.538,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5873.273,5874.567,Where is Article IV?

1959.538,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6254.08,6259.499,"Mr. Feller, at the risk of importing more confusion, may I ask you this."
1959.538,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6274.592,6275.224,"Well, I --"
1959.538,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6275.224,6277.101,-- by a court when asked to submit a (Voice Overlap) --
1959.538,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6277.101,6284.96,"I -- I frankly vested the question of parole evidence, rule in the rules of evidence, I do not pretend to give an answer one way or another."
1959.538,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6284.96,6285.17,"Well, put that to one --"
1959.538,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6285.17,6297.544,"It would be relevant, it would clearly be relevant if you sought to arbitrate something which clearly -- well, let -- let me -- I can -- I don't like to give abstract answer."
1959.538,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6377.712,6383.539,"Let me put as -- put as unusual cases, you've dealt with it a while ago."
1959.538,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6433.328,6435.489,The arbitration clause didn't mean what it said it meant.
1959.538,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6435.489,6436.379,Yes.
1959.538,2,20827,david_e_feller,,6436.379,6438.895,"Well, I think and I confess I pushed hard."
