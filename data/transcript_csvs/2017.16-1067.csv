2017.16-1067,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.04,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 16-1067, Murphy versus Smith. Mr. Banner."
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,7.04,24.92,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a prisoner wins a civil rights case and he's awarded damages and he's awarded attorney's fees, the prisoner himself has to pay part of the fees out of the damages judgment."
2017.16-1067,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,110.72,127.0,"Your adversary points to a number of statutes that use the verb ""to satisfy"" -- or I guess not the verb, but the proposition ""to satisfy"" -- to refer to the complete fulfillment of an obligation."
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,130.36,143.68,"The word ""satisfy"" often means the complete fulfillment of an obligation, but in this statute, it can't mean that because the statute makes clear that the plaintiff doesn't have to completely fulfill the obligation to pay attorney's fees."
2017.16-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,146.16,147.76,"Well, it's sensible to have a cap."
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,149.28,149.76,"Well, exactly."
2017.16-1067,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,161.24,165.64,"Well, but you start with the notion of satisfaction; in other words, satisfying a debt."
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,171.64,172.16,"No, that's right."
2017.16-1067,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,187.04,188.08,"No, no, I understand the point."
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,188.08,188.2,Yeah.
2017.16-1067,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,188.2,193.92,But I'm just suggesting that that's not certainly a total response.
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,210.8,220.0,"Well, you know, there was a provision like that in some of the precursor bills, right, but this -- that sentence was omitted from the final legislation."
2017.16-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,252.88,253.08,Why --
2017.16-1067,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,253.08,253.36,Well --
2017.16-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,253.36,262.8,Why would the Congress have required that a portion of the judgment be applied to satisfy the award but then given the district courts discretion to award a trivial amount?
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,262.8,263.2,Yeah.
2017.16-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,264.12,264.88,A penny?
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,264.88,265.24,Right.
2017.16-1067,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,335.68,382.0,"Counsel, what do you think -- I know in your brief you seem to suggest that the purpose for giving district court judges discretion was to ensure that the district courts could balance the fault of the defendant -- defendant vis-a-vis the plaintiff, but I don't see anything in this statute that speaks to fault. I am more moved, and I don't know why -- or if you have disavowed it, that since the district court is intended in this judgment to compensate for injury, that it should be given some discretion to determine how much of that injury a plaintiff should actually be forced to bear --"
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,382.0,382.48,"Well, no -- well --"
2017.16-1067,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,382.48,384.08,-- when he or she was not at fault.
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,384.08,384.64,"Right, exactly."
2017.16-1067,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,416.12,416.96,Let's assume --
2017.16-1067,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,416.96,424.36,"You don't think that it's -- you don't think that it's -- it would be odd to say -- I mean, this -- this language can be read either way, and it's -- it's very difficult."
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,441.88,445.4,"You're -- you're never going to have satisfaction of the -- of the attorney's fees, the --"
2017.16-1067,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,445.4,447.64,But that's the -- that's the word that's used in the statute.
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,447.64,477.36,"And what I -- what I -- when I say there's never going to be satisfaction, the -- the -- the -- the attorney -- the -- the plaintiff's share is never going to literally satisfy the attorney's fee award. And the -- the reason I say that is that the -- the typical judgment in prisoner cases is very, very small. I mean, it's an extraordinarily rare case in which even the maximum 25 percent would literally satisfy the attorney's fee award."
2017.16-1067,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,477.36,485.08,"Yeah, but you could say that the fee -- that the award has to satisfy the attorney's fees up to the cap. There wouldn't be anything odd about that."
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,491.84,492.16,I don't -- I don't --
2017.16-1067,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,492.16,499.96,-- suppose a teacher said to the parent: Your -- your child can't -- can't function at school because the child is hungry.
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,513.0,520.28,"Right, but -- but ""satisfy"" is often used in other contexts where it's clear that there won't be complete satisfaction of the relevant obligation."
2017.16-1067,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,539.48,565.28,"You know, you mention that the district courts have overwhelmingly understood 25 to be the most that can come out of the plaintiff's recovery, and you were asked a question about, well, suppose, nominal, a nominal amount is taken from the plaintiff. Do you know what the practice has been in these 20 years in the district court? Here we have 10 percent."
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,567.04,578.4,The spread is 25 percent at the top and nominal amounts at the bottom. The -- the district courts have actually been implementing the statute in a -- in a sensible way.
2017.16-1067,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,599.52,601.84,So some district courts have gone down to a minimal amount.
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,601.84,603.16,"Yeah, there have been some cases."
2017.16-1067,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,645.84,653.6,How would you write this if you wanted -- if you were Congress and wanted to get their --
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,653.6,653.84,Yeah.
2017.16-1067,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,653.84,657.12,-- version of the bill in one sentence?
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,657.12,657.56,Yeah.
2017.16-1067,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,657.56,658.64,How would you have written it?
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,658.64,661.56,We actually know that because the precursor bill that --
2017.16-1067,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,661.56,662.48,"No, I said in one sentence."
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,662.48,663.36,"Yeah, I'm going to give you the one --"
2017.16-1067,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,663.36,665.24,The precursor bill was in two sentences.
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,665.24,669.64,The precursor -- but the precursor bill included the one sentence that you're -- you're looking for.
2017.16-1067,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,720.28,729.92,"You say that the -- one way that the discretion of the district court would be guided would be by the seriousness of the offense, and you gave a couple of examples."
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,729.92,730.36,Yeah.
2017.16-1067,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,730.36,741.12,"I think it's pretty unusual to compensate for seriousness of the defense, or bad faith, I guess, of the -- of the defendant through the -- manipulating the attorney's fees."
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,741.12,741.28,Yeah.
2017.16-1067,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,741.28,745.56,Wouldn't it normally in those cases result in a higher award of damages?
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,745.56,746.48,It is unusual.
2017.16-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,758.56,766.88,"Well, but apportionment doesn't mean that the egregiousness of the conduct should be taken into account in fixing the size of the attorney's fees."
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,766.88,767.96,"No, that's right, but the -- the --"
2017.16-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,767.96,769.2,"I mean, that just doesn't follow."
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,769.2,794.4,"The question -- if -- if the question is why is it that we see the consideration of egregiousness with this statute but not with other fee-shifting statutes, what I'm trying to say is this is, so far as we know, the only fee-shifting statute in which responsibility for attorney's fees is apportioned between the plaintiff and the defendant. Once you're going to apportion responsibility for fees between the plaintiff and the defendant, you need a basis for apportioning those fees."
2017.16-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,794.4,796.88,But I -- I was talking about the amount of the fee.
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,802.16,805.84,"No, no, the amount of the fee will be calculated by the lodestar method, right."
2017.16-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,805.84,815.84,"But in this case, it was -- it was odd that the district judge remitted a substantial part and put the punitive damages down almost $93,000."
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,815.84,816.24,Right.
2017.16-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,816.24,823.68,"But then, in order to soften the blow, he reduces the amount of -- of attorney's fees."
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,823.88,824.2,Right.
2017.16-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,824.2,830.24,This -- this is a double exercise of discretion that it seems to me quite puzzling.
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,830.24,837.4,"Well, but that sort of discretion I have to say is -- is -- that's a standard feature of fee-shifting statutes."
2017.16-1067,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,846.36,856.88,Could you -- could you explain to me why the sentence you read would do the trick? It says what -- what must be done if the award of attorney's fees is greater than 25 percent.
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,866.4,869.08,Okay.
2017.16-1067,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,884.84,893.24,You think it goes without saying that the plaintiff would have to pay the full 20 percent? Because it doesn't say it.
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,894.0,896.08,All it says is the defendant wouldn't have to pay it.
2017.16-1067,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,896.08,896.44,Right.
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,896.44,896.6,Right.
2017.16-1067,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,900.72,902.08,And that's the -- and that's the point.
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,902.08,902.44,"Right, right."
2017.16-1067,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,902.44,905.68,So that really doesn't -- you have to read something into it.
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,905.68,905.76,"No, no, no."
2017.16-1067,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,905.76,909.68,That doesn't literally say who pays if it's under 25 percent.
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,909.68,910.16,Right.
2017.16-1067,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,930.16,938.24,"Can I ask, Mr. Banner, in -- in various kinds of ways this statute tries to reduce district courts' discretion over fees."
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,975.52,980.48,I -- I don't -- I don't know that that's an accurate -- I don't think that's an accurate description of the aim of Congress.
2017.16-1067,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1023.72,1034.64,"Was -- was the intent to reduce discretion, or I thought the intent was to deter non-meritorious lawsuits?"
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1034.64,1051.8,"Well, the -- if you -- if you ask about the Prison Litigation Reform Act as a whole, certainly the -- the intent was to deter frivolous lawsuits in order to facilitate the consideration of the stronger ones. This provision has nothing to do with frivolous lawsuits."
2017.16-1067,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1059.12,1064.0,"Well, there are meritorious lawsuits on a scale --"
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1064.0,1064.56,Right.
2017.16-1067,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1064.56,1064.96,-- of merit --
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1064.96,1065.92,Right.
2017.16-1067,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1065.92,1081.2,"-- some that are serious, some that are not so serious, where there can be an award. So I can see Congress giving discretion based on the nature of the claim. That is more supportive of your position, which is --"
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1081.2,1087.2,"Yeah, and that's -- and that's exactly how the district courts have been applying the statute for -- for more than 20 years now."
2017.16-1067,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1087.2,1089.08,"Well, this is -- it's -- it's a little different."
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1125.68,1143.16,"Yeah, that's -- that's simply an incorrect view of the statute to say that Congress intended to replicate anything close to a contingent fee regime for prisoners. That could very easily have been accomplished simply by making prisoners completely ineligible for fees under Section 1988."
2017.16-1067,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1147.72,1148.36,"Yeah, but they could --"
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1148.36,1149.56,-- members of the general public.
2017.16-1067,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1149.56,1171.92,"But you can determine that if you're on a straight contingent basis, that that -- I mean, you have to have enough of an incentive to get lawyers to take the cases and, at the same time, discourage prisoners from saying, you know, I think this is a serious case, while an objective review, which is what plaintiffs' lawyers do, would suggest that it's not."
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1171.92,1172.12,Okay.
2017.16-1067,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1192.8,1198.96,"Well, I would say that the plaintiff has to pay some share of the attorney's fees does sound an awful lot like a contingent fee arrangement."
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1198.96,1206.12,"Except that it's -- it would be an unusual contingent fee arrangement that would range from -- from 25 percent down to nominal, which is why -- I say it's not --"
2017.16-1067,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1206.12,1207.08,"Well, that's why I don't think --"
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1207.08,1207.24,Yeah.
2017.16-1067,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1207.24,1208.24,-- your position is -- is accurate.
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1220.72,1229.08,"Right, but that's why I'm saying that what Congress did in this statute doesn't even closely -- doesn't remotely resemble a contingent fee regime."
2017.16-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1235.8,1236.2,"Well, I -- I'm --"
2017.16-1067,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1236.2,1237.44,"Well, but the other -- I'm sorry."
2017.16-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1237.44,1237.84,Go ahead.
2017.16-1067,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1237.84,1244.48,But your adversary is saying that's what they did under his reading of the statute -- under his reading of the statute.
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1244.48,1246.64,"Right, but that -- I think we're going in circles."
2017.16-1067,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1250.88,1251.0,But I think --
2017.16-1067,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1251.0,1251.96,"Well, but you're just going back to saying --"
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1251.96,1254.2,The statute says a portion not exceeding 25 percent.
2017.16-1067,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1254.2,1259.72,"That -- that argument doesn't make any sense because, if you read the statute the way I do, it doesn't make any sense."
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1259.72,1274.56,"Look, the -- the -- the -- the interpretation that Respondents favor was in the precursor bill that got taken out. What we're left with is a -- a ceiling but -- but no floor."
2017.16-1067,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1277.64,1285.52,"You have the language, but -- but the -- the -- it depends, I guess, a lot on the background that this is being passed against."
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1294.6,1294.68,Right.
2017.16-1067,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1294.68,1310.88,"Now, you say that because I knew you would agree with me on that, but what's the basis for it? I see one thing for the basis -- because if it's a -- 1988 is the background, then normally the prevailing party in an appropriate case gets all the fee. He doesn't have to pay a dime."
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1310.88,1311.32,Right.
2017.16-1067,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1311.32,1311.96,Okay?
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1311.96,1312.2,Right.
2017.16-1067,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1312.2,1314.84,So if -- but now -- so it's important.
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1321.12,1321.4,The --
2017.16-1067,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1321.4,1326.64,"And the only answer you've given so far is -- is, well, look at -- read the language."
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1326.64,1327.48,I'm going to give you the second --
2017.16-1067,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1327.48,1328.68,I'm not sure about the language.
2017.16-1067,0,62791,stuart_banner,,1332.32,1358.76,"Yes, indeed, there is. The -- the -- before this statute was enacted, the fee-shifting rule governing prisoner cases was Section 1988, where the prisoner received the -- the prisoner was just like any other litigant prevailing on a civil rights case. The -- the prisoner got -- rather, the defendant paid the full 100 percent of the -- of the attorney's fees. This statute was enacted against that background."

2017.16-1067,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1409.44,1422.16,"Why? Where do you get that from? Where in the -- anywhere is that said, is that discussed, is that indicated in the -- in this section at all?"
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,1422.16,1423.12,"Sure, Your Honor."
2017.16-1067,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1431.88,1434.48,Can I -- can I just ask you something about the statute?
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,1434.48,1434.64,Sure.
2017.16-1067,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1434.64,1454.32,"Let's assume the statute read, without the parenthetical, when it said a portion of the judgment shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney's fees awarded against the defendant. Would that mean 25 percent absent that 25 percent?"
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,1454.32,1455.52,Absent the parenthetical?
2017.16-1067,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1455.52,1457.32,Absent the parenthetical.
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,1457.32,1467.88,"If the parenthetical was not in there, then the -- then the provision would mean that the attorney's fees award shall be fulfilled by the judgment."
2017.16-1067,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1467.88,1471.88,"No, it says a portion of the judgment."
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,1495.88,1497.6,"No, Your Honor."
2017.16-1067,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1497.6,1500.24,It's a -- no? It's a portion of the judgment.

2017.16-1067,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1508.64,1509.84,Why? A portion is a portion.
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,1510.2,1514.28,"A portion is a portion, but what that does is it recognizes --"
2017.16-1067,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1514.28,1517.24,It doesn't say all of the judgment; it says a portion.
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,1517.24,1518.04,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2017.16-1067,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1518.04,1527.64,"So why didn't Congress say a portion of the judgment, 25 percent, instead of not to exceed 25 percent?"
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,1527.64,1528.52,The not to exceed --
2017.16-1067,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1528.52,1536.56,"Why doesn't it just say a portion of the judgment, 25 percent, shall be applied to satisfy the amount?"

2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,1540.96,1541.0,Right.
2017.16-1067,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1541.0,1546.04,-- what's the difference between the two things?
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,1546.04,1569.84,"The difference between the two things is that, in the statute as written, Congress recognized that there will be circumstances in which the entire fee award will be satisfied by less than 25 percent. In the hypothetical, without that parenthetical, it -- it provides that a portion will be used but for the purpose of satisfying or fulfilling the award."
2017.16-1067,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1569.84,1570.44,I'm sorry.

2017.16-1067,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1589.56,1592.68,And the defendant pays nothing?
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,1592.68,1593.76,"In that circumstance, that's right, Your Honor."
2017.16-1067,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1593.76,1594.08,All right.
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,1614.2,1621.24,"No, Your Honor, because there's circumstances in which, say, 17 percent of the judgment will be sufficient to fulfill the fee award."

2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,1631.28,1633.24,-- Congress didn't say a portion --
2017.16-1067,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1633.24,1643.56,"Then you're doing away with the ""shall apply."" No one ever speaks of that ""shall apply"" as meaning that you give more than 25 percent."
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,1643.56,1644.2,We --
2017.16-1067,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1644.2,1649.6,You don't award him attorney's fees of 25 percent of the judgment.
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,1649.6,1662.56,"They do not apportion -- this statute does not apportion -- allow for the apportionment of more than 25 percent of the judgment to fees, but there are circumstances in which the fee award is 25 percent or less than the judgment."

2017.16-1067,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1665.92,1676.4,"Please -- please correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is that if you talk about contingent fees and you talk about apportionment, you're talking about apples and oranges."
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,1693.44,1693.72,That's --
2017.16-1067,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1693.72,1694.72,Am I correct?
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,1694.72,1696.2,"You're correct, Your Honor, that the statute says --"
2017.16-1067,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1696.2,1697.56,From -- from the award?
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,1697.56,1698.08,From the award.
2017.16-1067,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1714.76,1735.24,"But it says ""not to exceed."" It sounds like it's imagining an award that does exceed, and it says ""not to exceed."" What happens when it does exceed? Then the defendant picks up the tab."
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,1752.04,1770.32,"Well, Your Honor, the reason they use ""not to exceed"" is that there are cases where the plaintiff won't pay 25 percent; for instance, where the fee award is equal to 17 percent of the judgment. So, in that circumstance, the -- the fee award will be fulfilled, satisfied, with less than 25 percent of the judgment."
2017.16-1067,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1770.32,1817.72,"Mr. Legner, you put a lot of emphasis on the word ""satisfy"" and I think in -- in most cases you're right as to what ""satisfy"" means. I guess the question I have is whether in this context one should think that the word ""satisfy"" says anything. And -- and my question goes basically that in many cases, and probably in the vast majority of cases, no part of the judgment, including the full judgment, could possibly satisfy the fee award. So given that we're talking about a circumstance in which in the vast majority of cases the fee award is not going to be satisfied, why should we understand the word ""satisfy"" in the way that you think we should?"
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,1817.72,1826.0,"Well, Justice Kagan, because, under our interpretation, there will be some circumstances in which the fee award will be completely satisfied."
2017.16-1067,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1827.96,1830.12,"Well, I agree with you that there might be some."
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,1853.24,1907.6,"I understand, Your Honor, but -- but a couple points on -- on that. First, the fact that the fee -- that the judgment may not be sufficient to fulfill the award, with the 25 percent cap or otherwise, does not change the definition of the word ""satisfy."" That, our -- under our reading, the district court is required to use the judgment for the purpose of fulfilling the fee award. The district court may be stopped in circumstances, but that's by virtue of the operation of the 25 percent cap, which is a separate intervening force that impacts the -- the -- the apportionment in -- in that situation. But, furthermore, under -- under Petitioner's reading, which would permit a nominal amount, you know, Petitioner indicated that today, that a one dollar apportionment would be sufficient, that in no way intends to satisfy under any definition --"
2017.16-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1907.6,1908.68,"Well, you're -- you're using --"
2017.16-1067,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1908.68,1909.88,"Well, I think --"
2017.16-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1909.88,1910.08,Finish.
2017.16-1067,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1910.36,1911.76,"I mean, I think that that's wrong."
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,1931.28,1936.2,"Well, Your Honor, under -- under that reading, ""satisfy"" need not even be in the statute."
2017.16-1067,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1993.92,2011.6,"You previously started to explain what evidence there is that Congress wanted to put prisoners in a situation similar to -- to a plaintiff in an ordinary tort case, but I don't think you finished your -- your explanation."
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2013.72,2035.16,"Well, Your Honor, in terms of the discussion in -- in the Senate, for instance, there were statements -- we cite one of them at page 24 of our brief -- a statement by Senator Dole that said that prisoners need to -- prisoners do not bear the same types of opportunity costs as non-incarcerated prisoners."
2017.16-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2052.76,2053.36,"Well, that's true."
2017.16-1067,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2053.36,2059.4,"I'm sorry, the non -- the non-incarcerated plaintiffs are under 1988."
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2064.68,2066.6,"Your Honor, Congress made a compromise."
2017.16-1067,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2073.28,2075.16,But it didn't say civil tort plaintiffs.
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2080.56,2092.84,"That's true, Your Honor, but by -- with the discretion limiting provisions of Section e(d), Congress clearly moved away from Section 1988's operation."
2017.16-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2092.84,2093.96,"Well, it did, you're right."
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2257.96,2258.32,"I am, Your Honor."
2017.16-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2258.32,2258.8,Okay.
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2300.44,2301.0,"A lot, Your Honor."
2017.16-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2301.0,2301.72,All right. (Laughter.)
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2301.72,2332.6,"The -- you're right that the first sentence of Section (d)(1) states that in any situation in where fees would be authorized under Section 1988, but it then continues, that sentence continues, ""such fees shall not be awarded, except,"" and then the provision goes on to restrain the court's discretion in awarding a fee under Section 1988. So, in this provision, Congress moved away -- Congress started with Section 1988 because these are claims under Section 1988 --"
2017.16-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2332.6,2333.08,Yeah.
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2333.08,2341.72,"-- but for this specific class of litigant, Congress moved away from the normal operation of Section 1988."
2017.16-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2341.72,2345.84,"Well, that inclusion -- now -- but, remember, if you follow this complicated argument --"
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2345.84,2346.12,Sure.
2017.16-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2346.12,2350.32,"-- sorry to be so complicated, but the -- really I've the choice down in my mind."
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2405.04,2406.88,"Sure, Your Honor."
2017.16-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2420.84,2421.32,Mm-hmm.
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2421.32,2425.6,So Congress took away discretion and limited the amount of attorney's fees --
2017.16-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2425.6,2425.92,Yeah.
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2425.92,2427.04,-- in -- in that way.
2017.16-1067,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2427.04,2432.44,"Well, that seems right, that -- that Congress limited discretion in certain ways."
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2435.64,2437.24,"Yes, Your Honor, that's exactly right."
2017.16-1067,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2451.08,2456.36,"But that sounds as though we're just going to interpret the statute in a general direction, no matter what."
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2456.36,2479.88,"Your Honor, I think that that contextual argument supports our reading of ""satisfy."" I think that, you know, first and foremost, our interpretation is grounded in, and gives effect to, the word ""to satisfy."" The fact that we read it as non-discretionary or not discretion-conferring is supported by the surrounding provisions of Section 1988."
2017.16-1067,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2479.88,2493.24,"Do you have -- this is the same question that was asked of Mr. Banner. Do you have a way that Congress could have written this statute to clearly state what Mr. Banner thinks it means? You know, that's better than this?"
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2493.24,2526.16,"If Congress wanted to state -- Congress could have used language that it always uses in fee-shifting statutes when it intends to confer discretion on district courts. In those fee-shifting statutes, Congress uses ""may"" instead of ""shall"" and states ""the court, in its discretion."" And so, for instance, the court could have said the district court -- whenever a monetary judgment is entered, the court may, in its discretion, apply -- apply a portion of it to the fee award."
2017.16-1067,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2529.0,2562.36,"Mr. Legner, if, as this discussion has gone on, we conclude that this statute is ambiguous -- it could be read your way, it could be read their way -- then, as Justice Breyer suggested, why shouldn't we take 1988 as the closest, rather than, I think you suggested that, well, then look to the American rule? Under the American rule, each party bears his or own -- her own counsel fees."
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2562.36,2571.56,"Your -- Your -- Your Honor, in that situation, it's important to understand that Congress explicitly moved away from the operation of Section 1988."
2017.16-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2624.44,2637.48,"But here's another -- here's another -- I don't know, looking at the dictionary here, and on ""satisfy,"" isn't it the case that the government pays the rest of the reasonable fee, right?"
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2637.48,2638.2,"Yes, Your Honor."
2017.16-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2638.2,2638.8,Okay.
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2641.68,2642.0,"Yes, Your --"
2017.16-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2642.0,2642.32,Okay.
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2661.88,2662.2,You --
2017.16-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2662.2,2663.12,Think of a settlement.
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2676.52,2677.96,And I understand that.
2017.16-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2679.36,2679.76,Okay.
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2680.68,2680.8,But --
2017.16-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2680.8,2681.64,Then the whole statute's --
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2681.64,2681.84,But -- but --
2017.16-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2681.84,2683.36,-- linguistically satisfied or whatever.
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2683.36,2684.72,"But, no, I -- but we disagree."
2017.16-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2686.84,2687.12,Yeah.
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2687.12,2688.72,-- it means to fulfill the obligation.
2017.16-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2688.72,2688.96,Yeah.
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2689.24,2689.96,And we --
2017.16-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2689.96,2696.48,"And the obligation is to pay that portion of the debt that isn't going to be paid by the defendant, and by the time you're finished, the debt is satisfied."
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2696.48,2721.44,"In -- in the first sentence of e(d)(2), the obligation is to pay -- to fulfill the fee award from the judgment with a capped amount, but this is no different than circumstances in which Congress specifies a primary source to be used to fulfill an obligation and then realizes that sometimes that primary source may not be sufficient to fulfill that obligation and then specifies a secondary source."
2017.16-1067,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2721.44,2728.24,"I mean, if my -- if my wife gives me a carrot for dinner to satisfy my hunger -- (Laughter.)"

2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2742.24,2742.4,"No, Your Honor."
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2743.12,2745.08,In that situation --

2017.16-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2749.12,2756.32,Suppose she knows -- suppose she knows that he is going to eat that delicious turkey sandwich in the refrigerator. (Laughter.)
2017.16-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2756.32,2761.96,Now -- now the carrots are just enough to fill up that little hole that will remain. (Laughter.)
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2761.96,2769.08,"But -- but -- true, but in that circumstance -- (Laughter.)"
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2769.08,2778.96,"-- if -- if the first source of satisfying Justice Alito's hunger was what his wife provides him, then, you know, if that is ultimately not sufficient, they can --"
2017.16-1067,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2778.96,2781.2,But that's not. It's up to 25 percent.
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2784.32,2785.16,"Well, for instance --"
2017.16-1067,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2785.16,2788.76,Twenty-five percent of what she cooks. (Laughter.)
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2788.76,2800.04,"Because that -- that recognizes that when Justice Alito's wife makes a casserole, 17 percent of that casserole may satisfy his hunger."
2017.16-1067,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2808.32,2840.68,"Can I ask about something else, which is we've made the American rule the presumption, but I come at it, why aren't we looking at the discretionary rule of 1988? In fee-shifting statutes that are clear -- and this is clear, they're shifting some fees -- we tend to give district courts maximum discretion."
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2869.2,2891.6,"Because, Your Honor, in those circumstances where the Congress does confer on the district court absolute or broad discretion, it uses discretion-conferring language such as ""may"" and ""in its discretion."" Section 1988(b) itself uses the words ""in its discretion"" and there's other examples under Section 505 of the Copyright Act or Section 1132(g)(1) of ERISA."
2017.16-1067,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2938.96,2939.84,But that's exactly right.
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2942.32,2946.4,"Not under 1988, you know, that --"
2017.16-1067,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2946.4,2948.56,"But that's the point, isn't it?"
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2948.56,2974.8,"Well, Your -- Your Honor, the point is that Congress meant to -- Congress clearly departed from the operation of Section 1988 in the other provisions of (d)(1), for instance, when it capped the reasonable hourly rate, put in the requirement -- capped the overall amount of the fee award, and put in the requirement that the fees be proportionally related, Congress signaled -- signaled its intent that the wide discretion under 1988 is not at play here anymore."
2017.16-1067,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2975.72,2981.36,"Well, these plaintiffs cannot receive punitive damages against the state, correct?"
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2981.36,2983.2,These plaintiffs did receive punitive damages.
2017.16-1067,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2983.2,2983.36,They did.
2017.16-1067,1,62929,brett_e_legner,,2986.2,3012.76,"It was -- it was remitted, some of it, but they -- these plaintiffs still received over $270,000 in punitive damage award in this case. Your Honors, our interpretation best serves the plain language of -- that Congress used and best serves the statute's context, as well as serves the purposes underlying the Thank you very much, Your Honors."
2017.16-1067,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3012.76,3022.88,"Thank you, counsel. Seven minutes, Mr. Banner."
2017.16-1067,2,62791,stuart_banner,,3022.88,3057.16,"Well, the crux of this is the word ""satisfy."" The question is whether the word ""satisfy"" can bear the weight that Respondents put on it. And so all I want to do is emphasize how common it is to use the phrase ""applied to satisfy"" in the way that Justice Kagan suggested to mean not -- not -- not applied to pay completely, but applied in that direction, applied toward satisfying. So, for example, the rental payments on a violin can be applied to satisfy the purchase price if the -- if the student persists in taking lessons."
2017.16-1067,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3122.16,3130.64,Do you have any sense of how many cases up to 25 percent of the judgment actually will be able to satisfy?
2017.16-1067,2,62791,stuart_banner,,3130.64,3135.8,How often it is that the attorney's fees are less than -- than 25 percent?
2017.16-1067,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3135.8,3148.44,"No, how -- how often it is that the amount, you know, whether it's 25 percent of the judgment or some lesser amount, will actually satisfy the amount of fees awarded?"
2017.16-1067,2,62791,stuart_banner,,3148.44,3160.4,"Oh, it's extraordinarily rare because -- because, you know, these cases might take hundreds of hours to litigate and the average monetary award is a bit more than $4,000."
2017.16-1067,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3180.56,3181.56,"Thank you, counsel."
