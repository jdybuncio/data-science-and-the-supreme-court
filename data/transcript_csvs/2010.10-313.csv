2010.10-313,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.706,"We will hear argument next this morning in Case 10-313, Talk America v. Michigan Bell, and the consolidated case."
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,12.308,15.01,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-313,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,50.849,52.933,Did you get -- you get (c)(2) at TELRIC rates?
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,52.933,54.401,"--Yes, you do, Your Honor."
2010.10-313,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,198.279,199.812,I have just one small question on that.
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,199.812,200.212,Yes.
2010.10-313,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,200.212,209.753,"Suppose that there are two competitors and each of them wants to connect, but each of them wants to connect at a different point and in a different way."
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,213.289,215.222,"Justice Kennedy, the answer is yes."
2010.10-313,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,221.561,223.378,Doesn't it say something about feasible?
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,247.86,260.186,"Justice Ginsburg, the statute and the regulations make clear that it must be technically feasible, but there's an almost irrebuttable presumption that when there are already facilities in place performing that function, that is technically feasible."
2010.10-313,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,260.186,270.891,But you -- you want the incumbent here to -- to build the -- the orange cord and extend it to wherever you have your switching equipment.
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,323.426,325.895,"Three responses to that argument, Your Honor."
2010.10-313,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,345.673,352.843,"Well, but the logic of your case as you described it would also require AT&T to build out the orange cord."
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,352.843,355.695,"Right; and -- and two additional points, Your Honor, on that."
2010.10-313,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,386.298,387.048,"Excuse me, excuse me."
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,387.048,387.448,--Yes?
2010.10-313,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,387.448,391.433,Extant entrance facilities I assume they were referring to.
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,391.433,392.968,Yes.
2010.10-313,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,395.42,395.887,Okay.
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,399.189,400.723,"Well, not necessarily."
2010.10-313,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,400.723,401.639,And charge you TELRIC rates.
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,401.639,402.006,Right.
2010.10-313,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,480.425,482.125,Where would I read this?
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,498.97,499.62,Yes.
2010.10-313,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,499.62,500.253,Okay.
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,506.723,507.075,Correct.
2010.10-313,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,507.075,520.3,"Now, somebody is going to have to decide whether if Pacific Tel and Tel is being tried to forced to connect with Maine, you know, they have to pay for a wire across country to get the interconnection or not?"
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,551.854,562.31,"Justice Breyer, if you look at paragraph 553 of the local competition order, which appears at page 27a of the Michigan blue brief--"
2010.10-313,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,562.31,565.595,Michigan blue--
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,565.595,566.864,--At least that's where it begins.
2010.10-313,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,571.666,576.653,"--Where -- where -- 28a, okay."
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,576.653,580.089,Very good.
2010.10-313,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,604.906,605.422,Okay.
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,606.789,607.306,Exactly.
2010.10-313,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,607.306,608.306,This is the FCC speaking?
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,608.306,608.472,Exactly.
2010.10-313,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,609.222,609.538,All right.
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,613.624,619.178,"--Well, here, the State commission didn't say anything, because we're talking about existing facilities."
2010.10-313,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,627.984,637.305,"Mr. Bursch, the -- the key to your case is -- is that an entrance facility is interconnection, right?"
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,637.305,637.905,Correct.
2010.10-313,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,637.905,641.44,You have to equate those two -- those two terms.
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,641.44,641.757,I do.
2010.10-313,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,641.757,644.725,What do you rely upon to equate them?
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,652.665,662.286,"Regulation 51.5 defines ""interconnection"" as the mutual -- or, I'm sorry -- as the linking of two networks for the mutual exchange of traffic."
2010.10-313,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,677.963,688.588,Doesn't -- doesn't the interconnection -- doesn't it have to be part of the internal system of the incumbent carrier?
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,688.588,690.404,It has to be part of their network.
2010.10-313,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,702.428,707.549,"You say that this is a link, and your -- the opposition says that it's transport."
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,708.065,709.601,--It is transport.
2010.10-313,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,716.488,719.457,But the -- but the rate says interconnection does not include transport.
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,719.457,729.046,"Well, we address that point at length in our reply brief, because AT&T advances that argument, and it's really a fundamental misconception or misunderstanding of the regulation."
2010.10-313,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,730.931,732.533,I have got it in front of me.
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,735.985,736.485,--Yes.
2010.10-313,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,741.472,742.822,"No, I'm talking about interconnection."
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,742.822,743.122,--Right.
2010.10-313,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,746.007,746.44,Yes.
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,746.44,752.344,"That -- that goes to a term of art or a phrase of art, ""transport and termination of traffic""."
2010.10-313,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,811.862,818.099,Is there a mutual exchange of traffic when you're talking about backhauling?
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,818.099,820.634,"No, there is not, and we don't take that position."
2010.10-313,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,832.858,834.043,Can I go back to my question?
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,835.36,835.927,Yes.
2010.10-313,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,835.927,839.262,"I would think -- you said, well, this is an existing facility."
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,839.262,839.595,Yes.
2010.10-313,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,839.595,842.983,"But my intuition would be, that makes no difference whatsoever."
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,879.989,883.541,"Are you talking about the distance, or what bells and whistles--"
2010.10-313,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,883.541,884.06,I don't know what it is.
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,902.188,903.622,"--Well, as far as--"
2010.10-313,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,903.622,906.49,"If I'm so far off base you can't get the question, forget it."
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,906.49,908.341,"--No, not at all, Justice Breyer."
2010.10-313,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,908.341,908.758,"I mean, I might not be able to get an answer."
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,908.758,909.574,I think it's a very good question.
2010.10-313,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,910.341,910.658,You don't have to--
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,910.658,911.543,--I'll take it in two parts.
2010.10-313,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,952.501,953.253,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.10-313,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,953.253,953.853,Thank you.
2010.10-313,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,953.853,963.809,Mr. Miller.
2010.10-313,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,963.809,966.844,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-313,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1022.945,1031.351,"Counsel, underlying that question is an issue that I think Justices Ginsburg and Scalia were asking."
2010.10-313,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1067.772,1077.795,"--In terms of the definition of technical feasibility, that's a defined term in section 51.5 of the regulations, and it does not include economic considerations."
2010.10-313,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1111.218,1120.757,"That's why it's only technically feasible, because the economic burden is -- is not on the company?"
2010.10-313,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1128.228,1129.013,--That -- that's right.
2010.10-313,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1129.013,1133.632,"Mr. Miller, you began by saying there were two regulations that disposed of the case."
2010.10-313,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1135.317,1154.728,"The -- the second is the commission's determination in the Triennial Review Remand Order in response to the D.C. Circuit's remand of its previous order, that entrance facilities are indeed part of the incumbent's network, because the statutory obligation, of course, is to allow interconnection at any technically feasible point within the incumbent carrier's network."
2010.10-313,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1154.728,1155.58,Where do I find that?
2010.10-313,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1155.58,1163.834,"That's in paragraph 137 of the Triennial Review Remand Order, which appears at page 10a of Michigan's brief."
2010.10-313,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1183.864,1185.949,Which section are you referring to on page 10a?
2010.10-313,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1186.916,1206.43,"Well, I've -- I've just gone back to the previous two pages, but it -- 10a is paragraph 137, where the Court says in response -- excuse me -- where the commission says, in response to the Court's remand, that's the D.C. Circuit's remand in the USTA case, we reinstate the local competition order of dedicated -- order definition of dedicated transport."
2010.10-313,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1217.988,1225.824,"You -- you do not need to provide unbundled access under (c)(3) to entrance facilities, right?"
2010.10-313,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1225.824,1239.334,"--That -- that's correct, and the court of appeals, I think, perceived a contradiction between saying that this isn't something to which you have to provide unbundled access under (c)(3), but it is something that has to be made available for interconnection under (c)(2)."
2010.10-313,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1268.52,1273.574,So what's the definition difference between entrance facility and interconnection facility?
2010.10-313,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1274.74,1279.978,If you're referring to the -- what the -- in the way the commission used those terms in the--
2010.10-313,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1279.978,1280.611,"No, no, I'm not."
2010.10-313,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1284.046,1285.482,--An entrance facility--
2010.10-313,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1285.482,1285.865,"No, no."
2010.10-313,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1290.1,1302.075,"--An entrance facility, as the commission explained in the TRRO, is just the link between the incumbent's office and the competitor's office."
2010.10-313,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1310.18,1314.199,It's a genus and -- and the entrance facility is the species--
2010.10-313,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1314.199,1315.234,It can be.
2010.10-313,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1315.234,1316.451,--in your estimation?
2010.10-313,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1316.451,1318.519,It -- it can be when it is used for interconnection.
2010.10-313,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1328.225,1329.994,I'm sorry.
2010.10-313,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1331.527,1338.617,"The -- the entrance facility is just the link between the two offices, the incumbent's and the competitor."
2010.10-313,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1338.617,1339.083,"Okay, got it."
2010.10-313,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1339.083,1345.003,"That can be used for a couple of different purposes, but one of the purposes for which it can be used is interconnection."
2010.10-313,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1351.74,1361.113,"Mr. Miller, would you, before you sit down, explain what is the government's position when an agency is asked to file a brief?"
2010.10-313,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1383.896,1400.257,"We -- we agree with the view expressed by Judge Sutton in his dissenting opinion below that there really is no reason to distinguish between amicus briefs, particularly those filed at the invitation of a court, in the court of appeals, from those file -- filed here."
2010.10-313,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1402.523,1410.113,But there may be a -- a reason to give less weight to briefs in this Court different from the briefs filed with the court of appeals.
2010.10-313,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1422.504,1424.587,--No.
2010.10-313,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1424.587,1434.478,"I do not think you made that distinction below about, you know, oh, it is part where there is back -- where there is not backhauling, but where there is it isn't."
2010.10-313,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1434.478,1438.43,I think our briefs in -- in the two cases are consistent.
2010.10-313,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1467.033,1469.366,"Wait, they have to be as unbundled elements?"
2010.10-313,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1470.199,1471.182,"--No, they -- they--"
2010.10-313,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1471.182,1472.318,--as unbundled elements.
2010.10-313,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1473.051,1473.484,--That's right.
2010.10-313,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1473.484,1477.27,Your argument here is that only have to be made available under (c)(2)?
2010.10-313,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1477.27,1477.753,Exactly.
2010.10-313,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1477.753,1478.805,Which is not unbundled?
2010.10-313,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1478.805,1479.522,Right.
2010.10-313,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1498.533,1501.735,"It certainly encourages us to throw up our hands, there's no doubt about it."
2010.10-313,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1502.237,1518.197,"--Another way of saying that would be that it's appropriate to recognize the commission's not only policy-making discretion, but technical expertise in the industry that's being regulated."
2010.10-313,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1533.456,1534.908,"Well, I don't know why -- why it's so hard."
2010.10-313,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1545.93,1553.87,"--Well, I guess I would say maybe we need to put the difference between interconnection and transport in concrete terms."
2010.10-313,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1566.511,1567.945,Continue.
2010.10-313,1,22857,eric_d_miller,,1567.945,1569.981,Thank you.
2010.10-313,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1588.609,1589.826,"Thank you, Mr. Miller."
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,1596.715,1600.267,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-313,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1642.861,1654.551,"Counsel, I know you're saying that, but everybody's arguing about what the TRO and the TRRO say or don't say."
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,1678.851,1686.188,"--Well, Your Honor, I actually read their brief differently, and I note that in the Sixth Circuit they didn't rely on any regulations at all."
2010.10-313,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1700.43,1703.982,So how do you address their point that there are two different charges at issue?
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,1703.982,1704.716,--There are--
2010.10-313,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1704.716,1708.37,--that one -- that interconnection by definition includes transport.
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,1712.988,1718.226,"--Your Honor, when the FCC explained this to the Eighth Circuit, what it said is there are really three things going on."
2010.10-313,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1760.819,1761.505,The Sixth Circuit?
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,1761.505,1763.055,--The Eighth Circuit.
2010.10-313,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1892.138,1894.672,--Now you're reading limitation into the statute.
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,1912.551,1913.319,"--I understand this, Your Honor."
2010.10-313,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1968.768,1983.813,"In that regard, in all of these years, are -- you mean to tell me there is no other incumbent that has provided interconnection services at an entrance facility and charged TELRIC rates?"
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,1983.813,2002.025,"Prior to 2003 and 2005, when there was an unbundling rule in place -- and the commission had always recognized when it established that unbundling rule in 1996 that competitors would use unbundled transport facilities to connect to incumbent switches, so to connect to those interconnection points."
2010.10-313,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2026.556,2028.275,What happened to the unbundling rule?
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2028.275,2029.858,It got -- it was gotten rid of.
2010.10-313,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2064.296,2066.581,Why was the unbundling rule abandoned?
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2066.581,2073.735,It was abandoned because the record evidence showed unambiguously that competitors don't need these things from incumbents.
2010.10-313,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2073.735,2074.502,It's not a bottleneck?
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2074.502,2076.604,"It's not in any way, shape or form a bottleneck."
2010.10-313,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2131.358,2131.89,Which is (c)(3).
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2131.89,2148.617,"Well, I think the point is what they -- this is why we think the right reading of those statements is that the facilities they're referring to are things they actually do require and need, which are the things inside AT&T buildings that they can't replicate, that it's strange for them to have said"
2010.10-313,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2191.062,2193.246,But that's -- that's (c)(3).
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2193.246,2194.398,But that's what--
2010.10-313,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2194.398,2197.466,(C)(2) says you just -- you have to.
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2204.47,2210.858,"--Well, it imposes an obligation, Your Honor, to provide interconnection at a point -- it's at a point within our network."
2010.10-313,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2210.858,2212.61,"Excuse me, that's your point, I thought."
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2218.379,2224.717,"Well that's -- my point is, yes; if there is a facilities leasing obligation it has to exist under (c)(3), that's absolutely right, Justice Scalia."

2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2253.053,2253.753,Your Honor--
2010.10-313,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2253.753,2255.003,What part is doing something else?

2010.10-313,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2256.088,2257.004,There's no way to do that?
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2257.004,2258.104,--No.
2010.10-313,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2258.104,2268.312,"Okay, so a judge has to say, on the basis of what, on the basis -- the judge has to say on the basis of the statute, which just uses the word interconnection?"
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2268.312,2274.233,"Well, the Michigan commission decided that the FCC in that paragraph 140 created this obligation."
2010.10-313,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2274.233,2274.783,Yes.
2010.10-313,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2274.783,2275.55,But the -- the--
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2275.55,2276.502,That's wrong.
2010.10-313,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2276.502,2283.489,--I -- I thought it was conceded that -- that none of this is -- is necessary under (c)(3).
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2290.845,2291.945,"That's -- that's absolutely right, Your Honor."
2010.10-313,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2291.945,2296.998,"So it is accepted by both sides, I think, that this is not necessary."
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2296.998,2309.973,"That's right, and because it's not necessary, you can't read, as the government tries to, belatedly, years after the fact, those statements in their orders from 2003 and 2005, those few statements in these--"
2010.10-313,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2309.973,2317.329,"It doesn't help because it's a network element, if it's in (3) and what this is, is something that's going to be needed to -- to interconnect."
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2320.029,2320.447,--But--

2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2336.14,2336.89,--We don't--
2010.10-313,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2336.89,2338.408,Now why don't we have to follow the brief?
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2338.408,2354.518,"--Because the brief here doesn't do what a decision on a primary jurisdiction referral would do, which is square what the agency is doing with the text and structure of the statute with prior statements that contradict--"
2010.10-313,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2354.518,2358.12,Do you agree that it has to be needed to interconnect?
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2358.12,2359.572,--Your Honor--
2010.10-313,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2359.572,2362.691,The whole problem here is it doesn't have to be needed to interconnect.
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2362.691,2363.558,--Our--
2010.10-313,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2363.558,2377.533,"It has to be needed under (c)(3), but under (c)(2) it's -- it's up to the -- to the new company to say I want to interconnect here; and -- and the incumbent cannot say, oh, no, you -- you don't have interconnect here; you can interconnect somewhere else."
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2377.533,2379.319,"--That -- Your Honor, that's absolutely right, Justice Scalia."
2010.10-313,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2394.245,2394.712,But wait a minute.
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2404.651,2406.47,--We do disagree.
2010.10-313,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2410.255,2410.938,It's now--
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2410.938,2413.207,And that's when they also supposedly adopted this rule.

2010.10-313,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2486.669,2488.352,That's not what the statute says.
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2493.823,2494.273,Right.
2010.10-313,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2494.273,2505.897,"Now, in carrying out a duty to provide, you say that's just picking the point, that somebody could equally well say, no, it's a duty to provide means to get to the point."
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2510.099,2513.986,"Your Honor, there's more language that I think forecloses those interpretations."
2010.10-313,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2529.162,2546.124,"No, it doesn't say that, but it doesn't say the opposite, and therefore, you might have an agency reasonably deciding that to -- to fulfill that duty, you must provide equipment reasonably necessary to allow the competitor to connect."
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2547.658,2550.593,"--And Justice Breyer, you might have an agency that did that."
2010.10-313,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2552.944,2555.163,"Apparently, you have an agency that never really said one way or the other."
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2555.163,2562.3,"And that means that Michigan was wrong when it thought that the agency had said it, and the Sixth Circuit was right when it--"
2010.10-313,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2562.3,2563.283,"Well, it used to say the other."
2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2572.139,2572.872,--That's correct.

2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2734.472,2735.022,But I point--
2010.10-313,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2735.022,2736.158,"Well, maybe this is the case for it."

2010.10-313,2,40910,scott_h_angstreich,,2944.376,2946.395,"Exactly, Justice Scalia."
2010.10-313,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2962.405,2965.975,Maybe the commission didn't like the Eighth Circuit's decision.

2010.10-313,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3019.709,3020.626,So who cared.
