1985.85-117,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,57.879,"Mr. Rossen, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.85-117,0,32690,jordan_rossen,,57.879,61.653,"Thank you, Mr. Chief, Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-117,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,352.44,359.526,"Mr. Rossen, did any workers refuse to pay the increased dues?"
1985.85-117,0,32690,jordan_rossen,,359.526,377.519,"It is stipulated, Justice O'Connor, at page 173 of the record that all claimants paid these dues, these emergency dues in accordance with the UAW Constitution."
1985.85-117,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,385.543,396.339,What would the union do with a member who refused to pay the increased dues for the purposes of financing the strike?
1985.85-117,0,32690,jordan_rossen,,396.339,413.671,There is no evidence that the union took any action against any of the members in terms of trying to get someone's job or anything else under Section 8(a)(3).
1985.85-117,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,438.948,451.858,Do you concede that the state can disqualify non-strikers who finance a strike by means of payments other than in the form of union dues?
1985.85-117,0,32690,jordan_rossen,,451.858,466.696,Below and in this Court we have not ask that the Michigan financing disqualificational provision be stricken.
1985.85-117,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,466.696,469.867,On its face.
1985.85-117,0,32690,jordan_rossen,,469.867,470.368,Pardon?
1985.85-117,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,470.368,471.249,On its face you mean.
1985.85-117,0,32690,jordan_rossen,,471.249,472.398,"On its face, that is right."
1985.85-117,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,472.398,479.734,So you concede then that it can apply if it is payment other than union dues?
1985.85-117,0,32690,jordan_rossen,,479.734,490.033,We concede that it can apply and be used as a disqualification when it is not based on the exercise of someone's Section 7 rights.
1985.85-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,490.033,495.116,I don't think that answers the question.
1985.85-117,0,32690,jordan_rossen,,502.168,508.082,"Well, it may or may not, Justice Stevens."
1985.85-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,539.825,546.297,What if you did not... I am still not sure of your answer to Justice O'Connor's question is why I am following up.
1985.85-117,0,32690,jordan_rossen,,558.224,562.909,"Well, our position first of all is that is not what happened here."
1985.85-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,562.909,564.459,"It is a different case, I understand."
1985.85-117,0,32690,jordan_rossen,,564.459,569.233,"But, I didn't want to leave any misunderstanding on that score."
1985.85-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,580.471,584.862,"Well, it goes into a large fund and the fund in turn is used to support the--"
1985.85-117,0,32690,jordan_rossen,,584.862,603.184,"--I was going to say if the money was going to the strikers and the union is a mere collection agent, I am not sure if it makes a difference if it is labelled dues or not and I am not sure that would really involve assisting the union, even though the union is a collection agent, any more than if the union collects money for the United Fund and sends it to someone."
1985.85-117,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,704.051,709.835,--Close.
1985.85-117,0,32690,jordan_rossen,,709.835,725.965,"In terms of the legislative history, the National Labor Relations Act does not provide any guidance as to congressional intent in this case."
1985.85-117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1107.719,1120.708,"They are withholding some state benefits, I suppose, that they would otherwise have been qualified for."
1985.85-117,0,32690,jordan_rossen,,1120.708,1121.219,Yes.
1985.85-117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1132.815,1135.837,And you say that burdens their Section 7 rights?
1985.85-117,0,32690,jordan_rossen,,1135.837,1139.09,We do and Michigan did too.
1985.85-117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1217.109,1220.141,"Well, employers can walk strikers out to."
1985.85-117,0,32690,jordan_rossen,,1222.204,1223.935,Yes.
1985.85-117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1229.298,1232.831,Without committing an unfair labor practice too.
1985.85-117,0,32690,jordan_rossen,,1232.831,1233.462,--That is right.
1985.85-117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1249.841,1257.547,"So, you wouldn't think the strikers... That the state must pay unemployment benefits to strikers."
1985.85-117,0,32690,jordan_rossen,,1257.547,1258.777,"--No, no."
1985.85-117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1259.518,1262.49,Isn't that burdening Section 7 rights?
1985.85-117,0,32690,jordan_rossen,,1262.49,1268.283,"--Yes, it does burden Section 7 rights to deny benefits to strikers."
1985.85-117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1268.283,1269.884,"Well, why may the state do it?"
1985.85-117,0,32690,jordan_rossen,,1269.884,1283.524,The state may do it because as Your Honor said in New York Telephone Congress intended to permit them to do it.
1985.85-117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1283.524,1286.355,To either grant or deny them.
1985.85-117,0,32690,jordan_rossen,,1286.355,1288.346,"Exactly, to strikers."
1985.85-117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1288.346,1289.067,Yes.
1985.85-117,0,32690,jordan_rossen,,1289.067,1294.911,"And, strikers have not been treated the same or synonymously with dues payers--"
1985.85-117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1294.911,1317.175,"But, the strikers' claims when they are strikers... the claim still is that their Section 7 rights are being burdened by a refusal to pay unemployment benefits, just like the claim is here that these people who finance strikes are exercising their Section 7 rights."
1985.85-117,0,32690,jordan_rossen,,1317.175,1325.872,"--And but for Congress' awareness, as indicated in New York Telephone, that might be considered improper too."
1985.85-117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1360.745,1365.417,How did these people lose their jobs?
1985.85-117,0,32690,jordan_rossen,,1365.417,1378.977,They were the low seniority people at their plants who were laid off by General Motors when they wanted to continue working because there was a shortage of materials.
1985.85-117,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1378.977,1382.778,They weren't out of their jobs because they were on strike.
1985.85-117,0,32690,jordan_rossen,,1384.521,1385.339,"Yes, that is right."
1985.85-117,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1428.699,1430.891,"We will resume at 1:00, counsel."
1985.85-117,1,38195,peter_g_nash,,1440.227,1442.448,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-117,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1571.12,1581.108,"Mr. Nash, could the state treat the payment of regular union dues as financing the strike?"
1985.85-117,1,38195,peter_g_nash,,1581.108,1582.43,--That is not the case we have here.
1985.85-117,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1582.43,1583.128,I know that.
1985.85-117,1,38195,peter_g_nash,,1583.128,1589.023,"That is a tougher case, but I think analytically and at least arguably, yes, they could."
1985.85-117,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1641.959,1656.956,"Well, in your view, I take it any local strike supported by a national union strike fund that leads to some lay-offs of non-strikers will justify denying the benefits to the non-strikers."
1985.85-117,1,38195,peter_g_nash,,1656.956,1662.811,"Whether it justifies it or not, in terms of how the state interprets its unemployment compensation statute is one matter."
1985.85-117,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1670.697,1675.82,"Well, maybe the question is whether Congress authorized that result."
1985.85-117,1,38195,peter_g_nash,,1675.82,1676.681,Yes.
1985.85-117,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1686.566,1695.662,What is the evidence that leads you to think that Congress intended to go so far as the circumstances I have described with regular dues?
1985.85-117,1,38195,peter_g_nash,,1695.662,1699.054,"--As I say, that is a tougher case than ours."
1985.85-117,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1849.263,1857.059,Were the strikes here at the foundry plants over purely local issues?
1985.85-117,1,38195,peter_g_nash,,1857.059,1860.79,"I don't know that, but I am assuming that they were, yes."
1985.85-117,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1860.79,1864.342,Because the national issue had already been resolved.
1985.85-117,1,38195,peter_g_nash,,1864.342,1874.801,"That is correct, although that is not necessarily true in local strikes and it was not true in later... Or at least from GM's perspective it was not true in later strikes at local plants."
1985.85-117,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1874.801,1882.535,"So, the non-striking workers we are concerned about really didn't have any interest in those local issues, I take it."
1985.85-117,1,38195,peter_g_nash,,1882.535,1885.316,That is correct in this sense.
1985.85-117,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2050.194,2062.001,"When members strike and a state denies unemployment compensation, there is the same burden, I suppose, on Section 7 rights."
1985.85-117,1,38195,peter_g_nash,,2062.001,2063.002,That is correct.
1985.85-117,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2063.002,2075.9,"But, the reason it isn't an unfair labor practice or the reason it isn't preempted is because of the neutrality argument, I suppose."
1985.85-117,1,38195,peter_g_nash,,2075.9,2076.441,Correct.
1985.85-117,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2083.687,2087.009,What do you call it in this case?
1985.85-117,1,38195,peter_g_nash,,2089.4,2091.612,--You bear the economic consequences of your actions.
1985.85-117,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2104.61,2109.913,"--Well, you are interfering here at least with your right to contribute to the support of a union."
1985.85-117,1,38195,peter_g_nash,,2109.913,2115.386,"--That is correct, but that is all part and parcel of the union bearing the natural economic consequences of the strike."
1985.85-117,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2152.88,2157.345,Did these people lose their jobs on account of the strike?
1985.85-117,1,38195,peter_g_nash,,2157.345,2157.906,Yes.
1985.85-117,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2157.906,2159.075,There is no question about that?
1985.85-117,1,38195,peter_g_nash,,2159.075,2159.596,No question.
1985.85-117,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2176.367,2188.914,"Well, I suppose if the foundry workers had struck and then the employer locked everybody out, what about the people who didn't strike but who were locked out, but who had been contributing to the union?"
1985.85-117,1,38195,peter_g_nash,,2188.914,2197.2,"The State of Michigan, under its unemployment compensation statute, says that if an employer locks out employees that does not disqualify them from unemployment comp.--"
1985.85-117,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2205.778,2209.017,"But, all they did though, instead of locking out, they laid them off."
1985.85-117,1,38195,peter_g_nash,,2209.017,2212.361,They laid them off as a result of no work.
1985.85-117,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2212.361,2213.011,Of the strike.
1985.85-117,1,38195,peter_g_nash,,2215.012,2216.764,That is correct.
1985.85-117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2248.714,2256.959,"Counsel, I assume that you join those who say these are voluntary contributions that the union members made."
1985.85-117,1,38195,peter_g_nash,,2263.714,2266.936,"Well, in this particular case they would not have lost their job."
1985.85-117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2267.755,2270.269,Would they have lost their union membership?
1985.85-117,1,38195,peter_g_nash,,2270.269,2273.081,--They might have lost their union membership.
1985.85-117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2273.081,2274.14,"Well, didn't the constitution say so?"
1985.85-117,1,38195,peter_g_nash,,2274.14,2276.761,The UAW's constitution?
1985.85-117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2276.761,2277.332,Yes.
1985.85-117,1,38195,peter_g_nash,,2277.332,2280.945,"I am not an expert on the UAW's constitution, but I would assume, yes, they could have lost their membership."
1985.85-117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2280.945,2282.387,"So, you consider that voluntary?"
1985.85-117,1,38195,peter_g_nash,,2282.387,2282.936,No.
1985.85-117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2286.328,2288.91,You just said a little while ago.
1985.85-117,1,38195,peter_g_nash,,2290.001,2294.913,"No, I don't need it to be voluntary and if I said that I spoke too fast."
1985.85-117,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2317.12,2318.111,"And, the difference is?"
1985.85-117,1,38195,peter_g_nash,,2318.111,2319.31,They contributed to their own unemployment.
1985.85-117,2,32690,jordan_rossen,,3197.795,3199.546,"A few things, Your Honor, if I may."
1985.85-117,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3220.089,3224.743,Was that a construction of the Michigan law or a description of what Congress had permitted?
1985.85-117,2,32690,jordan_rossen,,3224.743,3246.266,"It was a construction of the Michigan law, not what Congress meant, and the reason I am making the point, Justice Rehnquist, is that in order to find voluntariness of these Appellants, Justice Ryan said they will be presumed to have done this voluntarily if they paid these dues in accordance with the union's rules and constitution."
1985.85-117,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3264.938,3276.766,"But, in order to make it a proper part of the federal question that you have brought here, you have to show that Congress' tolerance of them, or whatever you want to say, would depend to some extent on their voluntariness."
1985.85-117,2,32690,jordan_rossen,,3283.952,3288.133,"--I definitely am not rearguing Hodory, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.85-117,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3547.533,3553.405,But they can pay it.
1985.85-117,2,32690,jordan_rossen,,3553.405,3554.176,They could pay strikers?
1985.85-117,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3554.176,3554.677,Couldn't they?
1985.85-117,2,32690,jordan_rossen,,3554.677,3556.568,I am not sure.
1985.85-117,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3588.509,3592.151,"So, you think the policy of so-called neutrality is pretty strong?"
1985.85-117,2,32690,jordan_rossen,,3592.151,3604.67,"Well, I don't think this case involves affecting neutrality certainly in any way that hurts General Motors regardless of what you do."
1985.85-117,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3630.737,3638.423,What if the state just denies payments to strikers from the very first day?
1985.85-117,2,32690,jordan_rossen,,3638.423,3642.344,--That would be permitted because--
1985.85-117,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3642.344,3645.957,"Well, it certainly reads on Section 7 rights."
1985.85-117,2,32690,jordan_rossen,,3645.957,3648.779,"--It does, Your Honor, and--"
1985.85-117,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3648.779,3650.482,Why can they do it?
1985.85-117,2,32690,jordan_rossen,,3650.482,3654.272,--They can do that because you held--
1985.85-117,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3654.272,3656.374,Because of this strong policy of neutrality.
1985.85-117,2,32690,jordan_rossen,,3656.374,3658.206,"--No, that is not why they can do it."
1985.85-117,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3658.206,3658.807,What is it?
1985.85-117,2,32690,jordan_rossen,,3658.807,3664.07,They can do it because this Court held that Congress intended to permit it--
1985.85-117,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3664.07,3664.791,Yes.
1985.85-117,2,32690,jordan_rossen,,3664.791,3669.994,--because Congress was aware in 1935 of statutes that did that expressly.
1985.85-117,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3678.408,3687.154,"Where was the evidence found in New York, both in the NLRA and the Social Security Act?"
1985.85-117,2,32690,jordan_rossen,,3687.154,3711.972,"--Well, this Court held that the NLRA didn't indicate that you could affect these rights one way or the other, but this Court looked to the Social Security Act, I believe, and the fact that the New York statute in question was on the books at the time that Congress passed the Social Security Act in 1935."
1985.85-117,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3716.934,3718.666,"Your time has expired, counsel."
1985.85-117,2,32690,jordan_rossen,,3718.666,3720.907,I did the same thing last week.
1985.85-117,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3723.097,3724.509,"Thank you, gentlemen."
