1980.79-700,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.404,Immediately at 1 o'clock counsel may be ready to take up Fleischer v. County of Los Angeles.
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,30.581,35.798,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-700,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,80.671,86.247,"Mr. Manpearl, let me ask you, did you argue the Sears case when it was here?"
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,86.247,86.997,"--No, I did not."
1980.79-700,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,86.997,90.98,I'd like to ask the same question I asked of counsel there.
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,97.711,99.508,That is correct.
1980.79-700,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,99.508,104.208,And I'm impressed by the utter absence of the Attorney General of California.
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,104.208,115.017,In California there is no requirement that the Attorney General appear in cases in which a state statute is under consideration or under attack.
1980.79-700,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,116.094,119.718,Is it not his general duty to defend the statutes of the State?
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,119.718,121.06,--We know of no such duty.
1980.79-700,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,147.785,149.892,"Well, it isn't your responsibility, in any event."
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,149.892,150.611,No.
1980.79-700,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,150.611,158.421,But it does seem strange when he is the principal legal officer of the State and he's not here.
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,158.421,161.857,"Well, I know there are many states which have procedures requiring notification."
1980.79-700,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,164.372,171.775,"It isn't likely that he's unaware, as Mr. Justice Blackmun has suggested."
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,171.775,187.206,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I have to make the assumption that the Attorney General's Office does read the advance sheets in California and at least is fully aware of the Sears case, although he may not be aware of this case because it is unrecorded."
1980.79-700,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,259.879,295.818,"Is the material involved here in the same relationship in terms of the movement in commerce as material coming from... let me put it another way: is the material that's moving into California or originating in California, destined for interstate commerce, different in some respects from the material coming from Korea or Japan, coming to rest temporarily in warehouses in California, and then going into interstate commerce?"
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,295.818,306.767,"Well, economics would dictate that there are different types of materials, there's different products and commodities that are manufactured in Korea than are manufactured in California."
1980.79-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,332.928,337.114,"And the exemption was enacted by the California Legislature, wasn't it?"
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,337.114,338.52,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,338.52,352.045,So that whether the Attorney General of California is here or not presumably it's entitled to the benefit of constitutional presumption of validity unless your opponent can show some constitutional defect.
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,352.045,353.404,Yes; we would agree with that.
1980.79-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,354.857,359.309,And how are California's counties created?
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,360.682,361.51,Yes.
1980.79-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,364.541,368.07,So Los Angeles County is nothing more than a creature of the State?
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,368.07,370.523,--That is correct; yes.
1980.79-700,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,447.991,478.432,"Well, Mr. Manpearl, I take it that as far as the courts of California are concerned, they could permit Los Angeles to challenge this statute if they wanted to, and we have no authority to tell the California courts not to entertain a challenge to this statute by Los Angeles County, do we?"
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,478.432,481.868,"Mr. Justice, I think that that question was exactly--"
1980.79-700,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,481.868,493.317,"You may be quite right in saying that we have no... you could be quite right in saying that there is no standing, that Los Angeles would have no standing in this Court, as a constitutional matter."
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,501.923,510.262,"--Well, Mr. Justice, I would contend that standing to raise a federal question is itself a federal question."
1980.79-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,510.262,512.231,A Case or Controversy type of thing?
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,512.231,513.323,Yes.
1980.79-700,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,513.323,515.136,But not in the state courts.
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,516.557,532.91,"That's correct, but the question of whether a subdivision of the State has standing to raise a federal constitutional question, I believe, must be a constitutional question in and of itself."
1980.79-700,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,532.91,540.719,You mean you're asking us not only to... what you're really asking us to do is to vacate the judgments of the California courts?
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,542.702,551.729,On the ground that the County of Los Angeles does not have standing to raise a federal constitutional objection.
1980.79-700,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,552.87,554.041,"In a state court, even?"
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,554.041,556.713,--In a state court or a federal court; yes.
1980.79-700,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,556.713,559.867,Even though you have named the County as a defendant?
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,559.867,563.646,"Well, we sued the County for a refund of taxes."
1980.79-700,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,584.717,593.681,"If we can segregate these issues, as Justice Blackmun has implied, how can you say they're a party for one purpose but not for other purposes?"
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,593.681,596.524,"Well, we're not saying that they're not a party."
1980.79-700,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,617.0,618.016,"Well, isn't that a question of state law?"
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,663.779,668.292,I don't know whether they could or not pass a statute.
1980.79-700,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,671.649,676.382,"Well, in effect, the California courts rejected your standing claim and they said--"
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,676.382,676.867,Yes.
1980.79-700,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,676.867,684.88,"--as a matter of California or any other law, at least as a matter of California law, Los Angeles County has standing."
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,710.996,712.278,Mr. Justice--
1980.79-700,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,712.278,713.776,And many states do recognize taxpayer suits.
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,716.04,718.852,--But I believe they do under state law.
1980.79-700,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,719.539,726.599,But a taxpayer can raise under state law that recognizes taxpayer suits any sort of federal constitutional claims.
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,726.599,729.363,--I believe that they cannot.
1980.79-700,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,743.061,756.961,"Mr. Manpearl, it seems to me that that you may be arguing against your client's interest, because if there is no federal jurisdiction to entertain a federal claim, maybe we have a duty to dismiss the appeal, and maybe we should look at your adversary's argument for that."
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,759.774,764.724,"No, let me very briefly address that question, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-700,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,784.747,789.573,"Well, you're arguing there is no proper federal question presented in this case--"
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,789.573,790.229,--Right.
1980.79-700,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,790.589,793.713,"--which a federal court has power to decide, isn't that correct?"
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,793.713,805.254,"--I believe there is a federal question and that federal question is the issue, the very issue of whether a county has standing to raise a federal question."
1980.79-700,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,805.254,808.675,Who presents the federal question to us?
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,808.675,811.737,The County of Los Angeles.
1980.79-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,861.81,863.388,But that goes to the merits.
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,863.388,864.45,That goes... yes.
1980.79-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,880.506,901.06,"If the standing question is resolved in your favor and, as Justice Stevens has suggested, we find that the County has no standing to challenge a state statute, we don't then go further and decide the merits of the case."
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,901.06,902.45,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-700,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,912.181,913.54,How would we do that?
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,920.647,934.672,I would submit that that would leave a plaintiff an appellant in the position of Walter Fleisher Company without relief to an improperly raised federal question.
1980.79-700,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,937.889,942.403,You're really saying one party to the controversy has a forum and the other party doesn't.
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,944.917,946.245,"--No, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,981.2,994.742,"But in our other cases regarding standing such as Arlington v. Village of Metropolitan Heights, and the one we decided the year before, we haven't gotten to the merits of the claims."
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,999.349,1008.516,"--Well, I believe, Mr. Justice, you could do the same in this case, but the form of relief would then have to take a reversal."
1980.79-700,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1008.516,1009.626,It could be a vacation.
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,1019.184,1020.965,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-700,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1020.965,1035.756,--despite the fact that under state law the County would have power to challenge the statute.
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,1035.756,1041.878,"Well, I think the state court has ruled on a question of federal constitutional law."
1980.79-700,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1041.878,1043.706,And a question of standing?
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,1043.706,1044.955,Yes.
1980.79-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1044.955,1052.701,But we are not bound under federal law by their rulings as to standing.
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,1052.701,1056.652,"I would agree with that, Mr. Justice; yes, sir."
1980.79-700,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1139.963,1141.244,You think they're not doing both?
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,1141.244,1148.975,"I don't believe they are saying, we are a victim of the Commerce Clause violation."
1980.79-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1197.941,1203.501,What if the trucking company had simply been a subsidiary and a creature of the State of Wisconsin?
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,1203.501,1205.89,"You mean, involved in a--"
1980.79-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1205.89,1225.164,"Supposing Wisconsin decided, we're going to socialize our trucking industry, and the trucking company was simply an arm or a creature of the State of Wisconsin, and it didn't like what... it lost the fight in the Wisconsin Legislature and so it came here?"
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,1225.164,1232.301,"--I think you would have... similarly, you would have a case where somebody is injured, somebody is fighting."
1980.79-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1254.635,1264.694,But in my hypothetical the person who would be saying it is a creature of the state just like the Baltimore case in 1933.
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,1264.694,1270.145,"Mr. Justice, I agree that that would certainly go to the standing question again."
1980.79-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1318.141,1321.172,"But that's the meaning of standing, what you have just said."
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,1321.172,1345.49,"I totally agree, but I also would submit that such considerations go equally to the merits of the Commerce Clause question, because ultimately, assuming that this Court finds against me on the standing question, that simply gets us to the merits of the case."
1980.79-700,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1435.328,1458.398,"Mr. Manpearl, are you saying that if this case had been brought by a competing importer of personal property... I don't know just what your client warehouses... that all the goods came from Arizona instead of from across the Pacific Ocean somewhere, and that person said, well, I can't make as much money, because he gets his tax exemption and therefore there's no profit margin left for me, that he would prevail?"
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,1458.398,1463.004,"Mr. Justice, I'm not saying he'd prevail, but I'm saying--"
1980.79-700,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1463.004,1464.208,Then what's the point of your argument that the--
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,1464.208,1477.499,"--Well, I'm saying that at least at that point he'd have someone before this Court that was saying, I am injured, and the Court would be in a position to make the judgment as to whether there's a burden on interstate commerce."
1980.79-700,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1479.639,1482.762,"--You're really arguing standing again, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist just indicated, then."
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,1482.762,1484.043,--I don't believe so.
1980.79-700,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1488.011,1489.775,But do the merits depend on who was raising the claim?
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,1489.775,1493.259,"--Well, no, the merits may not."
1980.79-700,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1505.659,1513.781,"Well, supposing we're talking about automobiles being imported from Japan, and all the competing automobile companies said, well, they get a tax exemption."
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,1519.951,1521.121,I certainly think they would have standing.
1980.79-700,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1540.692,1545.908,"In other words, you're saying, the only relief is not to take away the exemption but to grant the exemption to everybody?"
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,1545.908,1549.579,"Well, it would be one alternative the California court had."
1980.79-700,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1588.548,1597.107,"Mr. Manpearl, supposing the exemption instead of being for goods of foreign source, said, for all goods of foreign source and from all states east of the Mississippi River."
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,1599.074,1605.446,"--I don't know whether there would or not, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-700,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1616.083,1617.379,That's what they say we've got here.
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,1617.379,1620.176,"--No, Mr. Justice, they do not."
1980.79-700,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1626.252,1626.515,"Oh, I see."
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,1626.515,1629.936,"--a classification, they conceded it was a reasonable classification."
1980.79-700,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1637.043,1641.651,"Well, then instead of all goods east of the Mississippi River, all goods that don't have their origin in the State of California."
1980.79-700,0,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,1654.442,1660.69,--I think we would be getting back to a very classic equal protection argument as we had in Allied Stores v. Bowers.
1980.79-700,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1711.951,1715.104,"Very well, Mr. Manpearl."
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,1717.761,1720.54,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1812.206,1845.161,"Counsel, what if the State of California permitted friendly bondholder suits to establish the validity of bonds so that someone who was simply a person with no intention of buying a particular water bond issue but simply said he was a plaintiff and wanted to find out whether these bonds were valid or not, he could sue the district and the California courts would permit that case to be litigated up through them?"
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,1849.191,1853.971,If the plaintiff in that case suffered actual or injury in fact; yes.
1980.79-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1883.568,1887.332,How do you distinguish the Baltimore case that your opponent relies on?
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,1887.332,1891.971,"Williams v. the City of Baltimore... first of all, I think it's 50 years old."
1980.79-700,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1932.939,1938.562,"Counsel, at that point, are members, individual members of the Board also defendants here?"
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,1938.562,1939.671,"No, they are not, Your Honor."
1980.79-700,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1952.494,1957.727,"Well, who are these ""Does"" that are mentioned in the complaint?"
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,1957.727,1964.208,"They were never identified and I believe that if normal practice was followed, they were dismissed... at the time of trial."
1980.79-700,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1964.208,1966.956,So that the only defendants are the City and the County?
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,1966.956,1967.41,That is correct.
1980.79-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1973.19,1980.39,"Then they are both attacking a statute passed by the State Legislature, the same legislature which created them?"
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,1980.39,1981.077,No.
1980.79-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1983.03,1988.215,"Well, it may be a different legislature in time, but the same body which created them."
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,1988.215,1993.932,"--The County of Los Angeles was established by the California Constitution, not the California Legislature."
1980.79-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2026.606,2040.037,"Well, didn't we reject that distinction several years ago in a civil rights case involving 1988, where the State was claiming its counties were different than the--"
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2042.115,2052.033,An analogy under the Civil Rights Act is also an excellent reason why the County has to be allowed to have this prudential standing.
1980.79-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2076.335,2080.365,And argue that my duty is to obey the Federal Constitution and that that's what it means.
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2080.365,2081.504,--Federal and state.
1980.79-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2132.344,2138.733,But the reason for the lawsuits is a statute passed by your own legislature.
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2138.733,2139.28,That is correct.
1980.79-700,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2145.807,2151.524,Was a declaratory judgment open to either Los Angeles or the taxpayers?
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2151.524,2152.18,"At that time, no."
1980.79-700,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2172.015,2182.184,"Mr. Hickok, at one time there was some legislation pending in Sacramento which would have provided refunds of this type."
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2183.168,2185.229,"--It is still pending, Your Honor."
1980.79-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2232.07,2236.646,"Well, no litigant in guaranteed a forum."
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2236.646,2240.644,"That would be fine from the County standpoint, Your Honor."
1980.79-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2260.246,2265.291,"Well, the Baltimore case has stood on the books for 50 years, as you've said."
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2265.291,2265.885,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2351.82,2353.756,"Well, you say it's untenable."
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2364.329,2366.422,"That would be fine in this case, Your Honor."
1980.79-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2367.25,2368.859,Probably by some other litigation.
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2368.859,2370.718,--Yeah; I would be worried about future litigation myself.
1980.79-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2400.611,2408.577,"Well, wouldn't the standing issue be resolved in your favor if we just dismissed this action?"
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2408.577,2410.796,In this case?
1980.79-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2412.654,2418.293,Leaving the judgment below upholding your standing intact.
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2418.293,2420.714,--Probably if the Court said that--
1980.79-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2420.714,2436.801,"If we just dismissed this appeal for want of jurisdiction, because we didn't think you had standing as a federal matter in this Court, and we just dismissed the appeal, but did nothing to the judgment of the California Court of Appeal, you would win the case."
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2436.801,2438.301,--We would win the case and lose the war.
1980.79-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2438.301,2439.207,Why?
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2439.207,2444.829,Because if the Court goes on to say that public entities cannot defend the actions of its employees--
1980.79-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2444.829,2446.047,"No, we didn't say that."
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2446.86,2446.907,--Okay.
1980.79-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2447.579,2460.058,"We'd just say, if the California courts, if they want to, could still continue to entertain judgments like this, cases like this, defenses like this, as a matter of California law they would let their courts do that."
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2460.058,2463.042,"--In that situation we would win, Your Honor."
1980.79-700,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2463.042,2464.947,You'd be just where you were before an appeal--
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2464.947,2466.275,Was brought to this Court.
1980.79-700,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2466.275,2467.978,--Before your friend brought you up here.
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2467.978,2474.553,"We should point out, we are not the litigating party."
1980.79-700,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2479.693,2481.941,You are contending to be litigating.
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2483.456,2483.847,That is correct.
1980.79-700,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2496.091,2507.118,"Under the new statute if that occurred, could your... could the taxpayer bring a declaratory judgment suit and perhaps wind up in the Supreme Court of California and perhaps with a different result?"
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2507.118,2508.931,"It's conceivable, Your Honor."
1980.79-700,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2588.882,2593.942,Do you think that statement is consistent with the underlying tone of Japan Lines?
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2593.942,2601.798,"Yes, because in Japan Lines you had the complete auto test, which was the underlying Commerce Clause question."
1980.79-700,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2785.068,2786.568,Is that new statute presently effective?
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2786.568,2787.177,"--Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1980.79-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2860.601,2862.412,Unless they're going overseas.
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2862.412,2863.725,Unless they're exporting it.
1980.79-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2863.725,2875.439,So the exception does apply to goods going through California that are bound for export?
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2875.439,2876.517,"Yes it does, Your Honor."
1980.79-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2888.777,2892.572,Or goods coming through Los Angeles bound for Hawaii?
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2892.572,2893.477,--That's correct.
1980.79-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2915.438,2923.529,Do you think before Michelin Tire that California constitutionally could have levied this kind of a tax on these imported goods?
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2923.529,2926.965,The goods were not in transit; we had agreed to that.
1980.79-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2929.058,2938.46,Do you think the rule before Michelin was just bound to transit goods?
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2938.914,2939.101,--No.
1980.79-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2941.054,2942.959,"It was bound in original packages, wasn't it?"
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2942.959,2946.302,"--That was the original package concept, overruling of Lowe v. Austin."
1980.79-700,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2946.302,2948.427,And the Export-Import Clause of the Constitution?
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2948.427,2948.646,Correct.
1980.79-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2949.848,2954.065,And then Michelin tire held what?
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2954.065,2967.029,"Michelin held that the states and the local counties can levy an ad valorem property tax on goods coming in, that are in the mass of property within the State."
1980.79-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2967.029,2969.387,But it didn't rule that it couldn't exempt them.
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,2969.387,2971.871,"No, it did not."
1980.79-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2994.955,3014.743,"Well, do you think, before Michelin, if California had just exempted imported goods from the tax, that they would have had to have taxed... they would have had to have exempted all other goods too, from other states, for example?"
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,3014.743,3015.649,"Well, you get into--"
1980.79-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3015.649,3021.913,Before Michelin they would have had to exempt goods in their original packages coming from abroad.
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,3021.913,3022.6,--That's correct.
1980.79-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3022.6,3029.237,Do you think they would also have had to exempt goods in their original packages from other states bound for other states?
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,3029.237,3030.237,"No, Your Honor, we don't because--"
1980.79-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3030.237,3032.112,"Well, that would be a burden on commerce."
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,3032.112,3042.39,"--However, we were governed at that point in time by decisional law saying that these foreign commerce goods had to be exempted."
1980.79-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3050.652,3059.291,"Yes, but before Michelin you could have enforced them both by saying, you can't tax the foreign goods, and live up the Export-Import Clause."
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,3068.319,3068.71,That's right.
1980.79-700,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3122.953,3132.434,"It would seem to me that even if before Michelin, the Export-Import Clause, had required the exemption, you'd still have the same burden on interstate commerce, wouldn't you?"
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,3146.912,3147.974,That's correct.
1980.79-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3147.974,3152.472,What if the State of California had brought this action?
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,3154.831,3156.018,Against the County?
1980.79-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3156.018,3158.532,"--No, against Walter Fleisher."
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,3172.356,3179.228,I'm not sure from a practical procedural standpoint how the State would bring the statute against Walter Fleisher.
1980.79-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3182.148,3184.648,"Well, supposing there was an application for refund--"
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,3184.648,3185.568,--with the State.
1980.79-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3185.568,3186.428,--With the State.
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,3186.428,3187.521,Which was denied by the State.
1980.79-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3187.521,3188.817,Which was denied by the State.
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,3188.817,3190.941,"Well, the State would then be in a defendant's posture."
1980.79-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3190.941,3191.628,Right.
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,3191.628,3195.018,It would be a very similar argument.
1980.79-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3207.529,3222.259,"Well, if the tax collection people have had an opinion from the Attorney General that their exemption was unconstitutional and the State then, because the tax collection people are supposed to listen to the Attorney General, they don't give the exemption."
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,3222.259,3222.789,That's true.
1980.79-700,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3236.941,3241.829,Why is the State in a different position from the County in the context of this case?
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,3241.829,3244.327,I'm talking about the State's authority.
1980.79-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3333.573,3338.179,Even though we're public officials who are presumably bound by the statute?
1980.79-700,1,37963,philip_h_hickok,,3338.179,3342.257,That's true because they can always justify their actions on a defense of the state statute.
1980.79-700,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3388.488,3394.049,"You have two minutes left, Mr. Manpearl."
1980.79-700,2,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,3394.049,3396.314,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-700,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3465.363,3475.454,"Well, now, isn't it true, though, that this exemption discriminates between interstate commerce and foreign commerce?"
1980.79-700,2,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,3475.454,3476.844,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-700,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3476.844,3481.982,And don't you have to just say that the State is empowered to make that kind of a discrimination?
1980.79-700,2,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,3481.982,3488.589,"Yes, I agree, Mr. Justice, and I submit that the Court is empowered to make such discrimination--"
1980.79-700,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3488.589,3488.854,The State is.
1980.79-700,2,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,3488.854,3494.695,"--the State is, unless it violates equal protection standards, is an unreasonable classification."
1980.79-700,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3519.78,3538.116,"Well, suppose California, though, taxed the goods that are bound from Oregon to Utah but didn't tax goods that are bound from Washington for Utah, and both of them came through."
1980.79-700,2,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,3545.254,3559.889,"--Well, I strongly suspect that somebody would be before the courts complaining that they had been injured, and they would be arguing that it's an illogical classification and no good under equal protection laws."
1980.79-700,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3571.322,3577.241,"Well, that's true of almost every event that happens, every day, in human life."
1980.79-700,2,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,3580.162,3608.043,"Yes, Mr. Justice, I agree that in virtually every case decided by this Court in the last five years, more, there have been protectionist overtones, a State attempt to isolate itself in some economic manner to benefit its citizens, its industry vis-a-vis out-of-state industry."
1980.79-700,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3624.566,3625.847,Your time has expired.
1980.79-700,2,25772,gerald_t_manpearl,,3625.847,3627.924,Thank you for your attention.
1980.79-700,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3627.924,3628.471,"Thank you, gentlemen."
