1991.90-1947,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.599,"We'll hear argument next in No. 90-1947, John K. Yee v. City of Escondido."
1991.90-1947,0,39610,robert_j_jagiello,,42.278,45.17,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1947,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,96.074,104.759,Do you think the ordinance requires the owner of the property to rent in perpetuity?
1991.90-1947,0,39610,robert_j_jagiello,,104.759,106.071,"Yes, it--"
1991.90-1947,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,106.071,112.243,Can't the landlord decide just not to use the property for this purpose anymore?
1991.90-1947,0,39610,robert_j_jagiello,,112.243,113.645,"--No, not effectively."
1991.90-1947,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,116.407,121.71,"Well, is that what the ordinance says, or you say it's just impractical?"
1991.90-1947,0,39610,robert_j_jagiello,,121.71,130.526,"--No, what happens is that there's a State system for going out of business that, in conjunction with local ordinances, precludes that alternative as a practical reality."
1991.90-1947,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,155.183,158.485,"Anyway, that's the State law that--"
1991.90-1947,0,39610,robert_j_jagiello,,158.485,160.125,"Well, it happens--"
1991.90-1947,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1848.561,1854.005,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1947,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1893.208,1900.504,"I understood him to say that the same... essentially the same provision was in the rent control ordinance, and that's why he didn't challenge the statute."
1991.90-1947,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1902.074,1903.096,He did say that.
1991.90-1947,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1931.726,1936.619,"He told me the case would be just as strong if they repealed the statute, and you're saying that he just hasn't read the whole ordinance."
1991.90-1947,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1936.619,1946.056,"--Well, the problem if they repeal the statute is then you have a statutory interpretation question of what it means to say that where the protections of the State law do not apply."
1991.90-1947,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1950.337,1952.478,"Well, it's one thing to talk about someone... your opponent's concessions."
1991.90-1947,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1965.547,1966.729,Fair enough.
1991.90-1947,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2092.032,2097.575,"Well, I thought he said it was the right to exclude others from his property--"
1991.90-1947,1,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2097.575,2098.487,"--But, he has--"
