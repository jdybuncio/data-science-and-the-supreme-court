1978.77-1553,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,42.336,We'll hear arguments next in County of Los Angeles against Van Davis.
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,44.617,48.306,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court."
1978.77-1553,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,388.447,402.264,"Mr. Stewart, you have undoubtedly seen the Solicitor General's amicus brief in this case suggesting that the case boils down to a lot less than it seem to after the revised opinion of the Ninth Circuit."
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,405.302,408.169,"Yes I will, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1978.77-1553,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,473.699,481.519,But am I right in thinking that you concede that you are governed by Title VII from March 1972 on?
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,481.519,482.411,We do.
1978.77-1553,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,482.411,503.234,"And that the Court of Appeals concedes that the only gap in this period was between January and March 1972, that is that the last time there was any effort to administer the test was in January 1972?"
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,503.234,510.187,The test was given in January 1972.
1978.77-1553,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,548.665,570.159,"Well, wouldn't it be possible for this Court to vacate the decree of the Court of Appeals and -- on a standing basis and simply send it back to the District Court or the Court of Appeals for re-framing of an appropriate remedy, considering what a small tail is left of the case?"
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,570.159,579.368,"Well, there is still the question of the appropriateness of remedy under any presumed Title VII violation that may have occurred."
1978.77-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,592.873,595.822,The Court of Appeals did not know that?
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,595.822,597.08,"No, they did not."
1978.77-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,597.08,599.127,They haven't reached and dealt with Title VII?
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,599.127,607.17,"Well, the Court of Appeals quite frankly Mr. Justice White is quite confusing."
1978.77-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,624.348,637.677,"I would think that if that -- you would suggest that if there were Title VII -- if there are some claims on the other side about Title VII, the Court of Appeals should first address Title VII?"
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,637.677,640.864,"Well, the Court of Appeals did addressed that subject."
1978.77-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,640.864,647.019,"Yes, but it rested its final holding on 1981 you just said, as the way -- as you read it?"
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,647.019,659.466,As I read it but the Title VII question was also before them and I imply that they found no Title VII violation.
1978.77-1553,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,659.466,667.795,"Let me ask, what do you understand the 1981 violation to have been and when it occurred and who were effected?"
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,667.795,690.171,I understood from the reading of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal's decision that the 1981 violation consisted of the utilization of the 1969 written exam and presumably the height standard that had an adverse or disproportionate effect on minorities without showing that it was validated.
1978.77-1553,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,690.171,696.668,"Now with respect to the 1969 test, it's correct, is it not that there are no plaintiffs who were affected by that test?"
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,696.668,697.59,That is correct.
1978.77-1553,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,697.59,699.476,How can that be before us?
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,699.476,699.958,Pardon sir.
1978.77-1553,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,699.958,704.497,Then how can we have a 1981 issue arising out of the 1969 test?
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,704.497,715.822,"We have the 1981 issue because the quota order, which the court approved, it's predicated on the 1981 violation since the --"
1978.77-1553,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,715.822,726.511,Do you argue that the order should be set aside because there is no plaintiff entitled to that relief before the Court?
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,726.511,739.542,I think the quota hiring order could be vacated on the basis that it was excessive in that it seeks to remedy discrimination for which plaintiffs have no standing to represent the parties.
1978.77-1553,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,739.542,742.595,"Then we do not have to reach this 1981 issue, do we?"
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,742.595,746.489,"Well, I think it is a significant perhaps on a technical basis."
1978.77-1553,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,746.489,748.711,In which you write a law review article about it.
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,748.711,765.057,"It is a [Laughter] – there have many written about it sir, but I think it is a critical issue that is really before the Court because the quota hiring order is predicated upon the finding of a 1981 violation."
1978.77-1553,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1346.675,1355.234,This plan was given in 1972 – given in 1969 and had been given periodically back over the years?
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,1355.234,1356.629,"That is right, Your Honor."
1978.77-1553,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1356.629,1359.717,Is it an identical exam or just the same type of exam?
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,1359.717,1361.023,It was the same type of exam.
1978.77-1553,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1383.569,1392.797,"And no evidence in years prior to 1969 as to even who were taken the exam, in terms of ethnic?"
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,1392.797,1393.397,That is correct.
1978.77-1553,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1412.473,1416.953,And only applicants would have taken the examination?
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,1416.953,1418.331,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-1553,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1428.858,1465.282,"Because part of the claim, the original claim in this case was that the discrimination led to very few applicants because of the practice of present members of the Fire Department to tell their friends and brothers and cousins about it and let them in the Fire House to get some practical experience and to prepare for the exam and so on, that there was no such recruiting or even knowledge of the availability in among Negro and Spanish American groups, isn't that correct?"
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,1465.282,1467.497,"That was one of the allegations, but it was unproven and there was --"
1978.77-1553,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1467.497,1474.137,And that -- the fate of that allegation was that it was District Court do not rely on it nor do the Court of Appeals?
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,1474.137,1479.412,That is correct and there was no finding that they had engaged in discrimination.
1978.77-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1496.538,1524.148,"While you are interrupted, perhaps you could explain to me if you can, what the basis was for the Court of Appeals' statement in its footnote 6, right after it had held that the 1969 test was irrelevant in this case because the applicant list had been exhausted before any of these present plaintiffs or applicants."
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,1566.028,1566.189,Oh!
1978.77-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1569.147,1576.714,So your claim is that the 1972 test has not had an adverse effect on any of these plaintiffs?
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,1576.714,1579.768,That is correct and I think they concede that in their answer.
1978.77-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1579.768,1582.696,So what is the basis for this second paragraph of this footnote 6?
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,1582.696,1595.315,"I believe that it is an implication that the court felt – that the Ninth Circuit felt that the mere threat to utilize the test by interviewing the top 544, goes to the level of the Title VII violation."
1978.77-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1595.315,1601.718,Is there some finding one way or another with respect to the 1972 test in the District Court's opinion?
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,1601.718,1608.534,"Yes, the District Court found that the 1972 test violated 1981 and Title VII."
1978.77-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1608.534,1617.243,"Well I know it, just looking at it as a test, but did it find that these particular plaintiffs had been adversely affected by the test?"
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,1617.243,1620.245,"No, it did not find that they had been adversely affected by the test."
1978.77-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1620.647,1623.354,Was it they find it that they had one?
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,1623.354,1637.409,"Well, I think that it was unnecessary for the court to do that because the plaintiffs themselves in their second amended complaint alleged that we had stopped using discriminatory hiring practices."
1978.77-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1637.409,1637.571,"Well, then again --"
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,1637.571,1640.685,And conceded that they were not adversely affected.
1978.77-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1640.685,1650.085,"Because if the Court of Appeals is wrong, what they say in the second paragraph, is not the case over?"
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,1650.085,1651.413,Well –
1978.77-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1651.413,1661.704,Because they have already said that the 1969 test did not involve any illegality because it hasn't affected anybody.
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,1661.704,1672.147,"The case, the Ninth Circuit decision Mr. Justice White is to my view inexplicable but the case is not over because the county approved the quota hiring order."
1978.77-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1672.147,1673.293,I don't mean the quote hiring order.
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,1676.856,1679.819,Yes I think we should win sir and that is exactly my position.[Laughter]
1978.77-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1679.819,1680.609,I know you --
1978.77-1553,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1680.609,1682.382,Without going to 1981.
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,1682.382,1682.833,Pardon?
1978.77-1553,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1682.833,1684.353,Without going to 1981?
1978.77-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1684.353,1686.982,Or 19 -- or Title VII or anything else?
1978.77-1553,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1686.982,1688.418,Just standing.
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,1688.418,1691.511,Just standing alone I think could win the case forth.
1978.77-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1691.511,1702.473,"Well, your suggestion is that there is no basis in the District Court's findings for that statement?"
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,1702.473,1709.967,The District Court did find that the County had violated Sections 1981 and Title VII now.
1978.77-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1709.967,1714.825,I know but they did not find that these plaintiffs have been affected by them?
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,1714.825,1722.71,"No, they did not, but there is no question that these plaintiffs had not been affected you know by the 1972 exam."
1978.77-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1722.71,1737.765,"You see that the Court of Appeals not only said the 1972 test was an unlawful employment practice, but it said it had an adverse impact on these plaintiffs."
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,1737.765,1739.846,The footnote 6.
1978.77-1553,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1739.846,1742.256,Second paragraph of footnote 6.
1978.77-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1742.256,1746.334,Appendix 83.
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,1747.732,1761.871,"Well, the court must have been implying that the threat to utilize the 1972 test in a method that would have had an adverse impact if implemented, adversely affected them and gave them standing to challenge the 1972 test."
1978.77-1553,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1761.871,1769.541,"But in any event, you do not know of anything in the District Court's findings which supported that part of this statement?"
1978.77-1553,0,46265,william_f_stewart,,1769.541,1772.467,Not at the moment sir.
1978.77-1553,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1780.642,1782.375,Mr. Hunt.
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,1782.375,1787.363,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1553,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1833.8,1838.364,"You would lost me counsel, I do not find the page 13-34."
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,1838.364,1848.309,I was reading from the Fed Second cite Your Honor.
1978.77-1553,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1848.309,1850.036,"That is the first opinion, isn't it?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,1850.036,1852.043,"No, that is the second opinion."
1978.77-1553,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1852.043,1855.503,The second opinion comes before the first one in that.
1978.77-1553,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1855.503,1872.922,"Can you give us the page in the appendix, do you have the page in the appendix?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,1872.922,1898.151,The second opinion begins on page 79 and it is at the second sentence on page 83 Your Honor.
1978.77-1553,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1898.151,1901.177,I am looking at the appendix to the petition for the certiorari.
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,1901.177,1903.234,That is what I was looking at originally.
1978.77-1553,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1903.234,1905.065,And there is no 13-34 in there.
1978.77-1553,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1905.065,1910.652,"There is no page 13-34, it goes from the first page of the opinion to page 13-37."
1978.77-1553,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1910.652,1915.5,Right.
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,1915.5,1918.706,"Alright Your Honor, I meant to say 13-37, yeah."
1978.77-1553,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1918.706,1919.585,13-37.
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,1919.585,1922.484,13-37 in the lower right hand corner.
1978.77-1553,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1922.484,1924.013,Right.
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,1924.013,1926.012,And on page 83 of the appendix.
1978.77-1553,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1926.012,1928.513,"Okay, you are getting to defendants of challenge."
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,1928.513,1934.734,"Yeah, the next sentence after that sentence."
1978.77-1553,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1979.86,1986.184,"Don't get to the relief yet, do not get to the relief, what about standing?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,1986.184,1988.241,That is what I am discussing.
1978.77-1553,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2014.358,2019.825,Well this case when it was -- the Court of Appeals wrote twice on the case?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2019.825,2021.007,Yes.
1978.77-1553,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2021.007,2024.275,And you are suggesting they misunderstood the case?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2024.275,2025.896,Your honor in the original brief --
1978.77-1553,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2025.896,2036.257,"Let us assume they were right though, let us just assume for the moment that they were absolutely correct in everything they said in the text where you read, what about the case then?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2037.718,2046.162,The case should be remanded to the District Court in order to correct the oversight of the fact that the scope of the class did not include past applicants.
1978.77-1553,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2046.162,2061.129,"Let me go on one part, now what about the – let us assume they are right that the 1969 test is not implicated here because these people just were not affected by the 1969 tests?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2061.129,2062.168,Or the class.
1978.77-1553,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2062.168,2065.543,"Or the class, now how about the 1972 test?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2065.543,2066.891,They were Your Honor.
1978.77-1553,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2066.891,2068.625,How were they?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2068.625,2075.893,"The defendant was about to take an all white class, excluding the plaintiffs and the present class."
1978.77-1553,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2081.737,2095.545,"Well, I know but they were not -- but I take it you do not claim that this class, that any of them were ever rejected on the basis of this test?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2095.545,2096.677,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1553,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2096.677,2108.704,"Well then, what is the basis for the Court of Appeals' statement in the footnote that this 1972 test had an adverse impact on the racial class of plaintiffs?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2108.704,2122.328,My interpretation is the same as my opponents that the defendants were about to discriminate and rebut the lawsuit and that --
1978.77-1553,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.328,2133.742,Do you think that is enough to get some relief if you concede that none of your class members was ever rejected because of his performance on this test?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2133.742,2139.687,We do not think that Your Honor and that is why we think that this case should be remanded to the District Court to correct the oversight.
1978.77-1553,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2139.687,2145.492,"Well, is it true that none of them was ever rejected based on his performance on this test?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2145.492,2146.349,That is correct.
1978.77-1553,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2146.349,2165.404,"And counsel, if you disagree with the Court of Appeals in this language we have been going over and over, in light of the fact that plaintiffs class did not include any prior unsuccessful appraisal -- plaintiffs neither suffered nor were threatened with any injury."
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2170.118,2180.739,"Your Honor, we have decided not to cross petition because record is clear to us that it was a mere oversight by the District Court that past applicants were not included."
1978.77-1553,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2187.896,2190.899,But the Court of Appeals just would -- turned that around?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2190.899,2204.723,"They turned that around Your Honor and it was our intention to correct it on the remand and we are suggesting that this Curt should, as the government does, should vacate the granting of certiorari and correct this mere oversight."
1978.77-1553,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2204.723,2207.941,Did you go to Court of Appeals on that theory after the decision?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2207.941,2208.272,Yes we did.
1978.77-1553,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2208.272,2209.561,On that precise ground?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2209.561,2210.637,Yes we did Your Honor.
1978.77-1553,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2210.637,2214.072,Are there any named plaintiffs who took the 1969 test?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2214.072,2215.172,"No, there are not Your Honor, but --"
1978.77-1553,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2215.172,2217.864,But then who can represent the class of those people?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2217.864,2232.766,"The case as cited in our brief of pages 43 and 44, establish that plaintiffs can represent present applicants, for example, can represent past applicants and vice versa."
1978.77-1553,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2232.766,2234.861,That wasn't the definition of class?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2234.861,2241.171,That is correct Your Honor and that is why we believe it should be remanded to the District Court for a correction of the oversight?
1978.77-1553,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2241.171,2244.665,"Well, may be you should find some new clients and start a new lawsuit?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2244.665,2256.659,"Your Honor, the record in this case shows beyond question that it was a mere oversight and the oversight should be corrected and I would like to reiterate the reasons the record is clear."
1978.77-1553,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2277.663,2282.87,"But Mr. Hunt, before you get to the evidence, what does the order certifying the class provide, there was such an order I take it?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2282.87,2293.2,"The order certifying the class provides -- excuse me, there was no formal order, the order was included in the judgment."
1978.77-1553,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2294.359,2297.486,Does that comply with the federal rules?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2297.486,2300.759,"Your Honor, I am not sure whether that is the case."
1978.77-1553,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2309.234,2313.603,"Is that provided the government suggest that we just get rid of it, but there is nothing --"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2313.603,2315.525,I think that is their basic ground and we agree with them.
1978.77-1553,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2315.525,2319.176,"But do not you think that is good, now you do not know what is going on?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2319.176,2321.384,We do not know what is going to happen.
1978.77-1553,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2326.805,2330.501,"[Voice Overlap] make some very bad law, couldn't they?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2330.501,2339.958,"Your Honor, I feel very strongly that it is important to realize that this case was tried on behalf of past applicants."
1978.77-1553,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2364.812,2368.244,Let us take first of all with the litigant side before we talk about the merits.
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2374.949,2380.922,"Your Honor, I would refer you to the cases cited on pages 43 and 44 of our brief that is --"
1978.77-1553,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2380.922,2382.684,"No, no, I do not want to get to the law."
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2389.25,2393.47,It was put in issue on behalf of the class of past applicants.
1978.77-1553,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2393.47,2402.691,[Voice Overlap] define back to 1868 or when is the date on which application became significant?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2402.691,2412.683,"The class -- we believe we were litigating the case, the court believed we were litigating the case, it is my impression, everybody believed we are litigating the case on behalf of past applicants."
1978.77-1553,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2412.683,2422.399,"When you say past applicants, but how do I know that includes 1969 applicants and people took the test in 1969, what in the record shows that?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2422.399,2424.359,"Your Honor, none of the named plaintiffs, we do not --"
1978.77-1553,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2424.359,2433.428,"I understand it, where does the record show that anybody thought they were litigating on behalf of someone who took the test in 1969, certainly you are complaint does not?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2433.428,2445.154,"Alright, Your honor the stipulations in the pretrial order have great detail as to the 1969 test and the findings of the court included the 1969 test."
1978.77-1553,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2459.34,2461.171,Where is the class certification order?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2461.171,2462.101,It is in the judgment.
1978.77-1553,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2462.101,2465.39,"It is on page 45 of the appendix, is not it?"
1978.77-1553,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2465.39,2469.191,And that you drafted and submitted the judgment?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2469.191,2471.873,The judgment was jointly drafted by both counsels Your Honor.
1978.77-1553,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2471.873,2475.858,Well and it says all present and future applicants.
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2475.858,2478.026,Yes Your Honor and that was an oversight.
1978.77-1553,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2478.026,2480.697,You mean you wanted to have added something to it or what?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2480.697,2487.898,"On remand, we would want to show to the District Court that this case that there was a mere oversight and that --"
1978.77-1553,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2487.898,2489.91,I know but how do you want to change?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2489.91,2491.39,"Past, present, and future applicants."
1978.77-1553,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2491.39,2493.664,"Past, present, add the word past."
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2493.664,2494.446,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1553,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2494.446,2496.041,Oversight on whose part?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2496.041,2500.301,It was oversight in our opinion on all counsel and the court.
1978.77-1553,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2528.082,2544.806,"But you said a minute ago in response to my question, which I asked you in a very leading form, the Court of Appeals just turned it around and then you said, yes, but when you read the class certification in the judgment, the Court of Appeals did not turn it around, they were just following what the District Court had done?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2544.806,2550.422,It followed the oversight and that is why we believe it should be remanded to correct the oversight.
1978.77-1553,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2550.422,2562.311,"Here is a case involving Fire Department in about the third or fourth most populous County in United States, very significant issues in it and you are talking about an oversight?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2562.311,2565.609,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1553,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2588.329,2593.014,"How can you have an oversight when on your side, you have got 12 lawyers?"

1978.77-1553,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2605.055,2612.821,"Well, you said on page 51, page 51 of the appendix, or may be I counted a little --"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2612.821,2618.213,"Your Honor, that includes our counsel besides the plaintiffs' attorneys."
1978.77-1553,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2619.756,2622.839,"I said on your side, intervened on your side?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2622.839,2628.69,"Your Honor, the two lawyers tried this case for the plaintiffs."
1978.77-1553,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2628.69,2631.156,"We really do not know what we don't know, do we?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2631.156,2633.582,"Your Honor, I could not agree more with that."
1978.77-1553,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2633.582,2645.812,How can we dismiss this as improvidently granted and let stand a judgment which you say that everybody agrees is an error?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2645.812,2649.291,I think the District Court should be given the opportunity to correct the oversight.
1978.77-1553,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2649.291,2651.544,But didn't you ask them to?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2651.544,2666.664,"I asked the Court of Appeals to instruct the -- on a petition for rehearing, when this oversight first came to my intention, I asked the Court of Appeals to instruct the District Court to investigate whether it was an oversight."
1978.77-1553,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2666.664,2670.142,But did not come to your intent until after the appeal?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2670.142,2671.585,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1553,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2671.585,2673.353,Where were you all the time?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2673.353,2676.937,"Your Honor, all I can say is that --"
1978.77-1553,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2676.937,2677.965,Oversight.
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2677.965,2682.612,"That it is an oversight past, present, future applicant, the case was fully tried."
1978.77-1553,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2682.612,2692.939,"But do you know any saying in the statutes, the constitution or rules of this court that require us to correct your oversight?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2692.939,2698.686,"Your Honor, I think the District Court should be given the opportunity to correct the oversight and that is why it should be remanded."
1978.77-1553,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2698.686,2703.774,But why did not you ask the Court of Appeals to do that for you and it refused apparently?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2703.774,2705.493,I have no explanation for that.
1978.77-1553,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2708.488,2710.344,But they did remand it?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2710.344,2711.544,They remanded --
1978.77-1553,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2711.544,2716.877,They did remand it because it disagreed with the District Court on the height requirement?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2716.877,2720.516,And because of their finding on [Voice Overlap]
1978.77-1553,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2720.516,2722.321,-- with your position.
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2728.173,2732.136,"Your Honor, I really do not consider it to be my mistake."
1978.77-1553,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2740.742,2745.458,But did not the court ask you to submit a judgment I suppose?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2745.458,2747.242,"Yes, the court asked both parties."
1978.77-1553,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2747.242,2749.999,"And the winners usually start off with it, do not they?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2749.999,2754.622,"In this case Your Honor, the court asked both parties to prepare the judgment."
1978.77-1553,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2754.622,2756.857,"Who drafted it, who submitted the initial draft?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2756.857,2759.561,We drafted it together Your Honor.
1978.77-1553,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2759.561,2763.612,"Mr. Hunt, did you ask for monitory relief on behalf of the past applicants?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2763.612,2771.563,"We did not Your Honor because in this case, they were beyond of the statute of limitations period."
1978.77-1553,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2780.725,2791.025,"Well, but if they are beyond the statute limitation for monetary relief, what possible advantage can there be to sending it back and asking that the judgment be equitably for the benefit of past applicants?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2791.025,2801.577,So that those past applicants will have the opportunity to be hired prospectively in order to give them the best -- relief we can under the circumstances of this case.
1978.77-1553,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2801.577,2811.335,"Well the judgment says word for word exactly as it is, it does not make a bit of difference whether a past applicant is part of the case or not, they are just all apply in the certain same way, do not they?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2811.335,2823.318,"Yes Your Honor, the difference it makes is that in that case, the hiring order, the 40% hiring order based on past discrimination is appropriate."
1978.77-1553,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2875.668,2879.461,"And the Teamsters case was a government pattern or practice case, was not it?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2879.461,2880.224,Yes.
1978.77-1553,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2880.224,2881.297,Under Title VII?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2881.297,2882.86,Yes.
1978.77-1553,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2882.86,2889.036,"And I suppose that the opinion should be read in the realization that, that is what the case was?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2889.036,2913.119,"Yes and this case was a class action, which we all believe was brought on behalf of the past, present, and future applicants and we were attempting to establish the prima facie case by the same way as the government did in that case and our statistics did show, the District Court specifically recognized those statistics."
1978.77-1553,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2991.296,2993.682,Are there cases from this Court?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,2993.682,2998.401,"Your Honor, those cases are all employing -- the answer to your question is no."
1978.77-1553,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3119.794,3141.105,"Well, about the oversight issue that you just mentioned, I notice in the appendix at page 3, on paragraph 5 of your compliant that you asked for relief of behalf of a class composed of all persons who are either black or Mexican and American and who presently are or will become employed as firemen?"

1978.77-1553,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3181.5,3193.151,"You have a complaint here, you have a District Court opinion and you have a Court of Appeals' opinion and they are all unanimous to the effect that past applicants are not represented."
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,3208.001,3221.161,"Your Honor, there are great many other things such as that the past evidence was admitted without objection as to the past discriminates, it was stipulated to in the pretrial order."
1978.77-1553,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3227.933,3233.516,Wasn't that a time for a motion to amend the pleadings to confirm with the facts and the evidence?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,3233.516,3240.554,"Yes Your Honor, I would agree with that except that it was brought to no one's intention until the second opinion of --"
1978.77-1553,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3240.554,3242.655,We do not do such things.
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,3243.69,3244.189,I agree Your Honor.

1978.77-1553,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3248.003,3251.679,Are you telling us that the compliant is out of this case?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,3251.679,3257.166,The pretrial order provides that it is to govern the future proceedings in the case Your Honor.
1978.77-1553,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3257.166,3261.617,"And the answer to my question is, yes or no?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,3261.617,3264.141,The answer to your question Your Honor is yes.
1978.77-1553,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3265.866,3267.576,The complaint is out?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,3267.576,3269.832,"Now, Your Honor I am not asking this Court --"
1978.77-1553,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3269.832,3273.522,"I am not my brother Rehnquist, I just do not want to say that we are being cool now."
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,3273.522,3279.903,"Your Honor, I agree that this case -- that this Court should not correct the oversight."
1978.77-1553,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3282.614,3292.807,What if the reason is [Inaudible] part of the [Inaudible] you do not pay any attention to complaints or any other things that would set meats and bounds.
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,3292.807,3293.287,The pretrial order --
1978.77-1553,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3293.287,3295.195,Is that part of the trouble?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,3295.195,3312.111,"Your Honor, the pretrial order specifically -- my recollection is the pretrial order specifically states that it is to set the meats and bounds and the pretrial order includes all the stipulations as to past discrimination and the case was tried."
1978.77-1553,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3336.101,3338.984,"Excuse me, I worked with the pretrial order."
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,3346.398,3347.593,"Your Honor, I --"
1978.77-1553,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3347.593,3356.531,"I do not think that is uncommon in pretrial orders, but this one here?[Inaudible]"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,3356.531,3361.03,"Your Honor on page 18, there is a statement of the issues to be tried."
1978.77-1553,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3361.03,3369.972,"I appreciate that, but what I asked is, is there any express provision that the pretrial orders have displaced the pleadings?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,3369.972,3378.983,"As far as I can say right now Your Honor, no except that I would interpret the joint statement of the issues to be tried to supersede the pleadings."
1978.77-1553,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3378.983,3380.07,I see.
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,3380.07,3391.543,And I would not the very first sentence is whether or not as a question of fact and my defendants have engaged to that past tense.
1978.77-1553,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3391.543,3411.368,"Mr. Hunt, your argument been interrupted, you and your colleague have used the phrase “the oversight,” I do not know how many times during the course of the this argument, what do you understand the coverage of that phrase to be, the oversight?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,3411.368,3416.581,Merely that the word past was left out of the definition of the scope of the class.
1978.77-1553,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3416.581,3419.815,"Where, in the complaint or in the class certification, where?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,3419.815,3422.889,In the clause certification order that is found in the judgment.
1978.77-1553,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3422.889,3441.967,"And are we to assume on recall of an oversight, this is something that you said your brother on the other side and you worked this out together that he would freely and quite willingly do and say, oh, yes, this was just an oversight and that the District Court would freely and quite willingly do saying, oh, yes, this was just an oversight."
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,3441.967,3446.503,I think it should be remanded to the District Court to determine that.
1978.77-1553,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3448.89,3450.269,To say nothing at the Court of Appeal?
1978.77-1553,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3450.269,3454.616,"Well, I did not understand the answer to mine so far."
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,3454.616,3463.762,I think Your Honor that the question should be remanded to the District Court to determine whether it was an oversight and to straighten out this difficult situation.
1978.77-1553,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3463.762,3480.82,"Well, I notice on paragraph one on page 18, you did not read all the way to its conclusion, whether or not it was a question of fact and law defendants have engaged in employment practices violated so the called as concerns past and present black and Mexican American applicants."
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,3480.82,3481.122,"Yes, that is correct."
1978.77-1553,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3481.122,3482.715,That's paragraph 5.
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,3482.715,3483.606,"Yes, that is correct."
1978.77-1553,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3483.606,3493.553,"Isn't it also true that in paragraph 10 on page 31, the defendants reserved their position that evidence of discrimination before the effective date of Title VII was inadmissible?"
1978.77-1553,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3493.553,3494.174,Yeah.
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,3494.174,3496.97,"Yes, they were arguing the 1981 point."
1978.77-1553,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3496.97,3503.704,So they were apparently not agreeing that past discrimination was relevant or even past applicants?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,3503.704,3512.671,They were arguing the 1981 point at that point and that is what we have all conceive to be the substantive issue before this Court.
1978.77-1553,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3512.671,3525.249,"I notice also that we have talked about monetary relief earlier, there was an agreement that the monetary claims, the claim of back pay, would not be tried and that would not prejudice the right of those, any of those who had back pay claim to assert it elsewhere?"
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,3525.249,3526.072,"Yes, we were afraid --"
1978.77-1553,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3526.072,3530.109,It sounds like the back pay claims were being included in the claim -- in the class?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,3530.109,3541.225,"Alright Your Honor, we had determined as best we could that there were statute of limitations problems, not with the equitable relief, but with the monetary relief under 1981."
1978.77-1553,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3541.225,3548.519,But you are careful of preserve the rights of past applicants who might has such claims to litigate the statute limitation questions?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,3548.519,3549.644,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.77-1553,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3552.867,3557.494,And because apparently none of the named plaintiffs were in that position I suppose?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,3557.494,3559.366,"Not, we were lawyers --"
1978.77-1553,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3559.366,3570.526,That adequately demonstrates how there can be a conflict of interest between a named plaintiff who is a current applicant and a member of class who is the past applicant who might have a damage point?
1978.77-1553,1,16133,a_thomas_hunt,,3570.526,3573.678,"Your Honor, we were doing our best we could for the past applicants."
1978.77-1553,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3620.565,3623.536,You have any further Mr. Stewart.
1978.77-1553,2,46265,william_f_stewart,,3623.536,3625.726,Yes Your Honor.
1978.77-1553,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3656.526,3665.445,But did you agree with that paragraph one of the pretrial order?
1978.77-1553,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3665.445,3670.255,"You have said, you reserved your position with respect at that time, is that what you said?"
1978.77-1553,2,46265,william_f_stewart,,3670.255,3679.863,"Yes, on the pretrial order on page 19, I stated defendants are in no way prejudiced as to their assertion, but this action may not be maintained as the class action."
1978.77-1553,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3679.863,3682.741,"Well, I can get -- what about paragraph one, did you agree with that?"
1978.77-1553,2,46265,william_f_stewart,,3682.741,3686.812,Paragraph one was merely a statement as to what they have represented.
1978.77-1553,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3686.812,3692.574,"Was it not a – it says a joint statement of issues to be tried, a joint statements --"
1978.77-1553,2,46265,william_f_stewart,,3692.574,3694.254,"Yes, I agree to everything that is in the pretrial order."
1978.77-1553,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3694.254,3703.681,So you agree to that part of the paragraph one which said that that shall be tried as concerns past and present black and Mexican American applicants?
1978.77-1553,2,46265,william_f_stewart,,3703.681,3708.855,Reserving my objection that they had no standing to represent those past applicants and --
1978.77-1553,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3708.855,3709.907,Did you agree to that?
1978.77-1553,2,46265,william_f_stewart,,3709.907,3710.84,"Yes, I did agree to that."
1978.77-1553,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3710.84,3711.47,Right.
1978.77-1553,2,46265,william_f_stewart,,3711.47,3726.701,"But I have continued throughout this trail including briefs filed with the Ninth Circuit both times, objecting to the standing of the plaintiffs to represent the class and it is not merely a question of pleading, because there is no past applicants that are named defendants in the case."
1978.77-1553,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3726.701,3731.505,"The Court did not manipulate the rules in waiting till a judgment to certify a class either, did they?"
1978.77-1553,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3731.505,3732.422,No.
1978.77-1553,2,46265,william_f_stewart,,3732.422,3734.67,Well that is right sure sir.
1978.77-1553,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3764.188,3764.91,Thank you gentlemen.
