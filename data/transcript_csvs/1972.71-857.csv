1972.71-857,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,430.01,454.107,"As I understand what you have told us and as I understood it in reading the briefs and understood it, that when the case was last here you and the State of New Mexico are in agreement, are you not that if the sales are on personal property the tax cannot be imposed?"
1972.71-857,0,33986,kendall_o_schlenker,,454.107,455.568,"Yes, Your Honor, we are."
1972.71-857,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,455.568,466.902,And the -- what the State says that if these are services then the tax can be imposed and what do you say about that if these are services?

1972.71-857,0,33986,kendall_o_schlenker,,492.318,492.795,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-857,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,500.217,504.461,So then isn’t the issue whether or not these are services or tangible personal property?
1972.71-857,0,33986,kendall_o_schlenker,,504.461,506.399,"Well, Your Honor no."
1972.71-857,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,511.641,518.977,I have read its opinion to say we don’t need to decide on the remand from this Court when it went back the second time.
1972.71-857,0,33986,kendall_o_schlenker,,527.603,529.55,I think that’s what they say.

1972.71-857,0,33986,kendall_o_schlenker,,536.513,537.535,Yes.
