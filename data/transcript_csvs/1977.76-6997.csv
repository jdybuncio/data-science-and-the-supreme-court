1977.76-6997,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,42.299,We will hear arguments next in 6997 Lockett v. Ohio.
1977.76-6997,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,46.284,51.379,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1977.76-6997,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,185.931,193.975,"You are saying totally outside of the plan, and I am not sure what do you mean by that -- stands of death and they had bullets in the gun, did they not?"
1977.76-6997,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,193.975,200.301,I refer Your Honor simply to Mr. Parker’s own testimony.
1977.76-6997,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,219.831,237.341,"And of course, I suppose on that theory the perpetrators would not need any bullets in the gun, if they had no intention or whatever making using of, would they?"
1977.76-6997,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,242.074,243.861,"Well, Your Honor the --"
1977.76-6997,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,243.861,245.362,They loaded it there I had recall --
1977.76-6997,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,245.362,252.819,"There was a plan to, they did not enter the pawnshop with gun even if with bullets and they certainly did arm a gun which was in there."
1977.76-6997,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,515.791,522.01,"But what do you do when you have as counsel, uncontradicted evidence?"
1977.76-6997,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,524.939,526.242,I mean Mr. Justice Marshall --
1977.76-6997,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,526.242,532.229,Let us just state one point of course you can always say it is uncontradicted?
1977.76-6997,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,532.229,541.998,If you say on one occasion that the evidence is uncontradicted that would be a very different thing and if you say it seven times uncontradicted and unrefuted.
1977.76-6997,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,555.022,568.482,"If the defendant does not testify and puts on no defense, then the prosecutor cannot say that his testimony that he has produced is uncontradicted?"
1977.76-6997,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,568.482,575.284,"I would not say that Your Honor, I would say that prosecutor may not amass such a repeated --"
1977.76-6997,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,575.284,578.396,Can he say it three or four times?
1977.76-6997,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,578.396,580.563,Depends on the nature of the case.
1977.76-6997,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,580.563,583.519,I just do not see how you can do that?
1977.76-6997,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,583.519,583.993,"Well, Your Honor --"
1977.76-6997,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,583.993,594.903,I do not see how you can muzzle the prosecutor by your trial tactics?
1977.76-6997,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,594.903,599.933,"Mr. Justice Marshall, it is one thing to affirmatively argue the credibility of prosecution witness."
1977.76-6997,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,601.006,611.867,"I know many cases I have tried, if you were to let me say, uncontradicted I would not have argued because I was so happy to have them contradicted."
1977.76-6997,0,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,618.618,629.162,"Well, if the prosecutor does make an argument which invites the jury to say to itself."
1977.76-6997,1,19387,carl_m_layman_iii,,1365.251,1367.975,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-6997,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1402.77,1412.796,"What verdict should the jury have returned if they were persuaded that it was unintended, accidental killing?"
1977.76-6997,1,19387,carl_m_layman_iii,,1412.796,1416.043,It was accidental would have to be not guilty.
1977.76-6997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1436.833,1444.606,"Can you have accidental homicide in a felony, in a commission of a felony?"
1977.76-6997,1,19387,carl_m_layman_iii,,1444.606,1446.511,"No, that is the point I am trying to make that it was not an accident --"
1977.76-6997,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1446.511,1449.358,"And you said it could be an accidental, did not?"
1977.76-6997,1,19387,carl_m_layman_iii,,1452.281,1453.361,"No, I did not."
1977.76-6997,2,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,1472.7,1476.395,I do not believe under our state of law that is not the law.
1977.76-6997,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1476.395,1483.328,"But anyway the jury could have returned to verdict of less than the degree they did, had they believed the testimony?"
1977.76-6997,2,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,1483.328,1484.156,Absolutely.
1977.76-6997,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1484.156,1486.249,Thanks.
1977.76-6997,3,19387,carl_m_layman_iii,,1486.249,1504.735,"And the testimony was not just Al Parker’s, Joanne Baxter testified concerning the planning and the use of a weapon by this group on two different occasions and the petitioner in this case dreamed up the idea of robbery."
1977.76-6997,4,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,3117.949,3120.23,I disagree entirely.
1977.76-6997,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3197.658,3201.807,"Let me take that last point you made, I am a little confused."
1977.76-6997,4,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,3218.417,3222.081,"Absolutely, it would have nothing."
1977.76-6997,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3222.081,3228.309,"What if the record showed that on one another occasion she had been charged with the same offense, but found not guilty by a jury?"
1977.76-6997,4,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,3228.309,3229.81,It has nothing to do with it?
1977.76-6997,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3230.77,3232.239,Does it not show her state of mind?
1977.76-6997,4,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,3232.239,3250.936,"Except if that is defined as being provocation, but Justice Steven's analysis of the Ohio statute is exactly right, unless one of those three factors is found the death penalty is mandatory and what that means is that every factor that does not go in to one of those three considerations can not even be weighed."
1977.76-6997,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3423.485,3429.554,Then they have a felony murder doctrine when the felony is committed with a deadly weapon?
1977.76-6997,4,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,3429.554,3436.163,"It is equivalent of that Justice Rehnquist, that what it is that they have a different logic but it reaches the same result."
1977.76-6997,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3476.118,3493.699,"But these are questions that courts in one opinion, you will find misstate or confuse presumption in the inference and I would not be willing to take a face value of anyone single statement in a charge to a jury has been conclusive on a state’s law?"
1977.76-6997,4,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,3493.699,3524.669,"I would totally agree, but the point is that every judge who has considered this case below has taken the position the Sandra Lockett was convicted not because in fact she intended Sydney Cohen’s death, not because the jury could have inferred that but because Ohio law says that if you engage in an armed felony, you are presumed; language in the Court of Appeals’ opinion, that liability is attached to the defendant, ascribe to the defendant, this is not language of inference."
1977.76-6997,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3558.338,3562.618,That is a law of a felony murder that you have just stated is it not?
1977.76-6997,4,15391,anthony_g_amsterdam,,3562.618,3571.509,"It is the Ohio version if you will of a felony murder rule, although the trappings of it are different, the result is exactly the same."
