1972.72-490,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.939,We’ll hear arguments next in 72-490 McDonnell Douglas Corporation against Green.
1972.72-490,0,43664,veryl_l_riddle,,13.063,20.136,Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-490,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,248.306,249.452,It was 1963?
1972.72-490,0,43664,veryl_l_riddle,,249.452,252.267,It was at 1963.
1972.72-490,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,407.805,408.073,How?
1972.72-490,0,43664,veryl_l_riddle,,410.002,418.669,"It’s on the volume 1 of the appendix and at page 507, 508 and 509."
1972.72-490,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,500.022,505.319,Is the plant of the company right out there near the regular St. Louis Airport?
1972.72-490,0,43664,veryl_l_riddle,,505.319,505.776,"Yes, it is."
1972.72-490,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,505.776,506.348,That’s what I know.
1972.72-490,0,43664,veryl_l_riddle,,506.348,516.21,"It’s right near the runways and in fact, the manufacturing facilities are principally on the runway itself, or on the airport itself."
1972.72-490,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,516.21,517.013,On the airport?
1972.72-490,0,43664,veryl_l_riddle,,517.013,519.441,Yes.
1972.72-490,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,675.592,683.996,Does the record show whether or not he was employed during this period after his original layoff from your company?
1972.72-490,0,43664,veryl_l_riddle,,683.996,695.772,"Later record indicates that he was employed of and on, but I don’t believe the employment was steady or with one employer throughout that period of time."
1972.72-490,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,940.261,950.65,But doesn’t that language sound like the District Court dealing only with the alleged 704 violation?
1972.72-490,0,43664,veryl_l_riddle,,957.585,958.831,Under 703.
1972.72-490,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,958.831,960.018,Under 703.
1972.72-490,0,43664,veryl_l_riddle,,960.018,971.967,"But the conclusion of the court there, Your Honor was, plaintiff has not shown the defendant was motivated by racial prejudice or because of the plaintiff’s legitimate civil rights activities."
1972.72-490,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,977.976,991.793,But your submission I think that although the amendment to the complaint was not allowed that nonetheless in the course of the trial it was by agreement the implicit agreement that issue was tried?
1972.72-490,0,43664,veryl_l_riddle,,991.793,994.519,It was tried and it was tried fairly.
1972.72-490,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1021.457,1035.218,"Although he had so far as the record goes and so far as the formal record goes, he had stricken and not permitted that issue to be tried in this lawsuit, and it’s correct isn’t it?"
1972.72-490,0,43664,veryl_l_riddle,,1035.218,1052.269,"If the lawsuit had been tried consistent with what that ruling striking race, if it been tried consistent with that theory, yes I don’t think there’d be any validity in our position at all, but in fact it wasn’t."
1972.72-490,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1067.671,1078.331,"Mr. Riddle, I understand I find it to contend even if it was tried by consent that he was handicapped by the trial court’s failure to allow discovery on that count."
1972.72-490,0,43664,veryl_l_riddle,,1080.769,1090.535,"Position to that Your Honor is this, that there was adequate discovery and there was enough discovery here to allow that issue to be tried."
1972.72-490,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1527.345,1529.935,You could also say you could put him in jail.
1972.72-490,0,43664,veryl_l_riddle,,1529.935,1556.324,"Yes, and if a black man were to throw, by this opinion is it’s been interpreted and as we interpret a rock through his window, yes if I could -- he could discharge him, I would have to say following the mandate of this opinion we’ll have to look to see how this might adversely influenced his ability to perform a job."
1972.72-490,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1556.324,1557.892,But you could still put him in jail.
1972.72-490,0,43664,veryl_l_riddle,,1557.892,1559.568,Still put him in jail.
1972.72-490,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1576.754,1582.305,"Or either this was a -- the question would be must we hire him rather than can we discharge him, isn’t it?"
1972.72-490,0,43664,veryl_l_riddle,,1582.305,1584.825,"I think the rule would be the same, Your Honor."
1972.72-490,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1592.103,1593.861,Yes.
1972.72-490,0,43664,veryl_l_riddle,,1593.861,1599.38,"What remaining time I have I’d like to reserve for rebuttal, Mr. Chief Justice."
1972.72-490,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1599.38,1604.799,Very well.
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,1604.863,1608.428,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.72-490,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1624.157,1624.878,Where are you reading from?
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,1624.878,1632.266,I’m reading from page A45 of the petition for writ of certiorari.
1972.72-490,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1646.753,1648.084,Bottom of page two?
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,1648.084,1650.409,That’s on the bottom of page A45.
1972.72-490,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1784.093,1787.642,I take it though you do not dispute the fact that it took place both?
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,1787.642,1789.904,"The “lock-in” did take place, that’s correct."
1972.72-490,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1834.167,1843.824,So do you -- is it your position that that includes the right to use unlawful means and that those unlawful means may never be then taken into account?
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,1843.824,1846.456,"No, Your Honor, I don’t submit that."
1972.72-490,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1888.085,1890.196,I thought that issue wasn’t before us here at all?
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,1890.196,1890.675,"No, I’m that’s the response --"
1972.72-490,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1890.675,1892.385,That everybody had based the statute to be different?
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,1892.385,1900.914,"Well, I think Your Honor, I think it’s important in terms of what the courts tell a prima facie case would be in this -- in the opinion of the Eighth Circuit."
1972.72-490,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1915.319,1917.348,You’re not saying the Court of Appeals prejudged the case --
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,1917.348,1917.547,Oh!
1972.72-490,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1917.864,1919.484,-- and remanded the case to the District Court.
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,1919.484,1924.607,"That’s correct, but only on those facts Mr. Justice Stewart, only on those facts."
1972.72-490,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1927.926,1929.265,"Well, the respondent indicates that --"
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,1929.265,1929.862,That’s right.
1972.72-490,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1929.862,1932.203,-- he was a satisfactory mechanic that too is not an issue.
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,1932.203,1940.288,"Yes, but the court said that he could -- that Green could show that the reasons given were protectoral, and that would go to the race situation."
1972.72-490,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1940.288,1940.981,Right.
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,1940.981,1946.145,And that he could show that the real reason like Green wasn’t hired was because the way they treated him before.
1972.72-490,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1946.76,1947.161,"No, no."
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,1950.509,1951.599,That’s correct.
1972.72-490,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1971.87,1975.392,"If there was one good reason the fact that there were 14 others, would you think no difference would make?"
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,1975.392,1978.996,"Well, that would be a matter for the trial on the race case before the District Courts, Your Honor."
1972.72-490,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1978.996,1986.999,"Yes, but when the Court of Appeals remanded it, they undertook to try to allocate the burden of proof."
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,1986.999,1987.99,"No, they didn’t Your Honor."
1972.72-490,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1991.803,1993.491,Did they not direct?
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,2000.321,2000.627,"No, no."
1972.72-490,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2002.053,2003.933,"Give very little weight, if any?"
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,2003.933,2004.149,Oh!
1972.72-490,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2024.701,2029.253,What do you find in the statute that supports what the Court of Appeals said?
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,2029.253,2032.092,In the statute in terms of subjective evidence?
1972.72-490,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2052.754,2063.449,What is your answer to the Chief Justice’s question that what do you find in the statute that supports the Court of Appeals decision on the burden of proof and on prima facie case?
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,2063.449,2071.699,There’s nothing specifically in the statute relating to what the burden of proof would be in a case involving an application for employment.
1972.72-490,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2134.018,2148.359,"What’s your response to Mr. Riddle’s contention that in the congressional debates preceding the enactment of this, the question of the prima facie case was considered and the congressional conclusion was that the burden of proof should be on the plaintiff in all state?"
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,2148.359,2151.755,"There’s no question that the burden of proof is on the plaintiff, Your Honor."
1972.72-490,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2241.761,2251.329,"Suppose instead of having just engaged in the blocking of the highway, “stall-in” I guess that’s called here?"
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,2270.957,2276.196,"Well, Your Honor the dynamiting -- Mr. Chief Justice, the dynamiting certainly would be objective evidence."
1972.72-490,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2277.864,2282.98,"Well, is there anything subjective about blocking a public highway?"
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,2282.98,2286.603,"The court never said, Mr. Chief Justice that they couldn’t introduce that."
1972.72-490,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2292.727,2300.35,"The court instructed the trial court in effect, you don’t have to pay any attention to that and really said “You’d better not pay any attention to it.”"
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,2300.35,2302.49,"Your Honor, I don’t really read the opinion that way."
1972.72-490,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2302.68,2304.011,"Well, that’s the way I read it."
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,2304.011,2305.864,"Well, it doesn’t say that specifically."
1972.72-490,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2306.59,2307.813,I don’t know how you could read it any other way?
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,2307.813,2314.365,"Well, it says that employment decisions based upon subjective criteria carry little weight."
1972.72-490,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2334.59,2338.37,"Well, in that evidence was before the District Court, wasn’t it?"
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,2338.37,2339.026,The “stall-in?”
1972.72-490,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2339.026,2339.281,Yes.
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,2339.281,2340.519,"Yes, it was."
1972.72-490,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2340.519,2345.534,"And the District Court decided the case on that basis, did they not?"
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,2345.534,2354.779,"On the 704 (a) issue Your Honor, on the 704 (a) issue they decided on that basis, because the court was very specific about how they’re trying this case."
1972.72-490,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2399.561,2417.918,"Mr. Gilden, what do you understand the court to have meant by this, if McDonnell can demonstrate the Green’s participation in the “stall-in” in some objective way reflects adversely upon job performance, McDonnell’s refusal to rehire Green will be justified."
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,2417.918,2418.592,What page is that?
1972.72-490,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2418.748,2425.037,"This is in page A13, bottom of the page."
1972.72-490,1,34519,louis_gilden,,2425.037,2426.976,"Your Honor, that was excised from the opinion."
1972.72-490,2,43664,veryl_l_riddle,,2846.634,2861.343,"Mr. Chief Justice, I’m pained to have to correct my brother counsel here on the F15 contract which he mentioned to the Court to acknowledge that it was not on the record."
1972.72-490,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3040.897,3042.068,Thank you Mr. Riddle.
