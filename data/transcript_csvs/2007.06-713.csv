2007.06-713,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,15.025,"We'll hear argument first today in case 06-713, Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party et al., consolidated with 06-730, Washington v. Washington State Republican Party et al.."
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,16.056,26.491,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In adopting Initiative 872, Washington's voters followed this Court's guidance in California Democratic Party v. Jones."
2007.06-713,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,70.567,72.706,Can you give us assurance that they will not?
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,77.299,78.266,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-713,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,129.151,144.522,"But you say that the purpose of allowing a candidate to declare a preference is simply to convey useful information to voters, but once you decided, once the State decided, that the ballot was not going to indicate party affiliation, why do you limit candidates to the names of parties?"
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,159.219,165.497,"Your Honor, the voters could have chosen to allow candidates to include other information."
2007.06-713,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,184.52,196.157,"What is that and wasn't the purpose that was offered by the proponent of the initiative to try to get around the decision in Jones, to change the system as little as possible?"
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,196.157,203.559,"No, Your Honor, because there is an immense difference between the top-two system and the system that replaces the old blanket nominating primary."
2007.06-713,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,215.618,221.912,"Justice Alito can defend his own question, but he asked whether or not the Grange stated that this was the purpose."
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,221.912,223.147,"--Well, the Grange was--"
2007.06-713,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,223.147,225.364,And then you... you didn't quite answer that question.
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,229.989,230.925,--Yes.
2007.06-713,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,230.925,235.549,"--Justice Alito's question was accurate with respect to the proponent's position, was it not?"
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,235.549,240.499,"Yes, Your Honor, but the Grange also said in the voters' pamphlet statement, quote,"
2007.06-713,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,264.599,274.362,"Well, if it's your position that the parties are not really injured or affected by this, and the parties' position is that they are, who should we believe?"
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,278.155,280.124,"Your Honor, this is a facial challenge."
2007.06-713,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,293.838,295.29,We know what... what it's going to be like.
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,333.869,343.271,"Justice Scalia, there may be an association in the dictionary sense, in the same way that a candidate who expressed a preference for one public policy versus another may be associated."
2007.06-713,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,351.813,354.282,I'm not talking about a First Amendment forced association.
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,380.536,392.594,"--Your Honor, I would refer the Justices to pages 2 and 3 of the Grange yellow brief where two sample ballots are laid out that incorporate the language from the declaration of candidacy regulations."
2007.06-713,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,392.594,394.688,Are you telling us that that's what the ballots are going to look like?
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,394.688,395.327,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-713,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,398.42,403.34,"You have two choices and I think there's another one on page 12, is there not?"
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,419.49,431.938,"--Justice Ginsburg, these are two examples of what the ballot is likely to look like, although it's frankly also likely to have even more information stating the difference between expressing a preference and expressing a formal association."
2007.06-713,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,431.938,441.278,"Will, will it say whether the party that is preferred likes this candidate?"
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,441.278,443.887,"It will say, Your Honor, if you would look to the sample--"
2007.06-713,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,443.887,445.324,I think you can say yes or no to that.
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,451.805,456.007,--It will stay that it is not a statement by the political party identifying that candidate.
2007.06-713,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,456.007,457.147,Please answer yes or no.
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,464.161,465.627,"It will not, Your Honor."
2007.06-713,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,465.627,466.22,All right.
2007.06-713,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,466.22,474.576,"General, as I understand it the parties are now free to come up with any scheme they want to for selecting an official candidate."
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,474.576,474.998,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-713,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,474.998,479.841,Let's assume the Democratic Party decides to have a State convention.
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,499.474,500.474,"Yes, Your Honor, it would."
2007.06-713,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,500.474,500.926,Okay.
2007.06-713,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,500.926,503.098,Let me ask this question.
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,512.655,514.64,"There would not be, Justice Stevens, no."
2007.06-713,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,514.64,520.793,"And under the... under the court's, holding it would be equally unconstitutional if he did that, I suppose."
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,520.793,528.9,"Your Honor, it would be equally constitutional if we prevented someone, yes, sir, from expressing a party preference or affiliation."
2007.06-713,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,528.9,532.04,"Indeed, there's... I'm sorry."
2007.06-713,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,532.321,535.023,Will the ballots necessarily be the same in every county?
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,535.023,540.365,"Yes, Your Honor, because they will be promulgated under regulations established by the State secretary of state."
2007.06-713,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,540.365,543.894,"Some of the counties have paper ballots, some of the counties have... is that correct?"
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,543.894,545.019,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-713,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,560.419,570.742,"Is... Iis there any, what should I say, truth investigation by the State of Washington?"
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,585.409,587.675,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-713,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,610.18,613.226,I guess... how can you say it's false?
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,613.226,614.492,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2007.06-713,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,614.492,619.099,"If he thinks he prefers it, I guess he prefers it, even though it's contrary to his entire life."
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,619.099,621.629,"Yes, Justice Scalia, it is expression of preference."
2007.06-713,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,656.021,662.206,"Is there any evidence, any historical evidence, that any candidate has ever done what Justice Scalia suggests?"
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,662.206,662.925,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-713,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,664.846,667.658,"There just hasn't been an election under this, under this law, right?"
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,667.658,669.125,Correct Mr. Chief Justice.
2007.06-713,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,671.061,683.681,"Well, there is evidence that, in other States, those who preached racial hatred have tried to associate themselves with a particular party, much to the concern of that party, and I see nothing in your position that would prevent that."
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,683.681,691.553,"Justice Kennedy, the candidates will be expressing a preference, this is true if they wish to."
2007.06-713,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,715.386,723.009,"And is the remedy for the party, you said, to have more speech for the party, to say that this is not their candidate, etcetera?"
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,723.009,724.633,"Yes, Your Honor, that is exactly what--"
2007.06-713,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,724.633,731.678,But this Court has said that parties could be strictly limited in the amount of moneys they spend to endorse a particular candidate.
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,731.678,732.911,--But there will be many opportunities--
2007.06-713,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,732.911,735.629,I don't think the law can have it both ways.
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,735.629,740.502,"--Your Honor, if I can use an example that might help illustrate our point."
2007.06-713,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,767.023,777.674,"Nobody is voting for Mr. Dale perhaps on the misimpression that he is affiliated with the Boy Scouts, and that's what undermines the Boy Scouts' associational rights."
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,784.141,794.278,"--Allowing... Mr. Chief Justice, allowing Mr. Dale to say he has a preference for the Boy Scouts I don't think can reasonably be confused with him claiming that he is a member, particularly when as applied--"
2007.06-713,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,794.278,803.586,"Do you agree that if it were that way, in other words if the ballot looked like the ballot on page 1 of the Grange reply brief, that that would be unconstitutional?"
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,803.586,807.975,"--Yes, Your Honor, it would be harder to argue from our side."
2007.06-713,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,820.095,823.329,Do these preference statements continue under the general election?
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,823.329,824.468,"Yes, Your Honor, they do."
2007.06-713,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,824.468,827.17,Can you change between the primary and the general election?
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,839.383,840.477,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-713,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,841.727,847.116,"Well, why can't you do that, if the purpose is to provide accurate information about a candidate's position."
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,873.324,877.79,"Justice Alito, the State could have chosen to allow people to change their preference expression."
2007.06-713,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,881.085,890.067,"You're saying... your argument is that they have a First Amendment right to put their preference on the ballot, but somehow when the general election comes along that First Amendment right evaporates."
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,890.067,894.348,"There is also... Mr. Chief Justice, there is also an important practical consideration here."
2007.06-713,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,897.627,899.642,"General McKenna, may I ask you at that point--"
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,899.642,900.502,--Yes.
2007.06-713,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,900.502,901.627,--if that's a correct statement of your position.
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,924.867,925.96,"You're correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-713,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,951.763,968.008,"But you did say that it is unlikely voters will be mistaken, that they will mistakenly consider a statement of party preference to be the equivalent of a party endorsement."
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,978.066,979.673,"On two bases, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-713,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1011.692,1018.127,I don't think it's enough that... that there's no claim of party endorsement.
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1033.2,1035.589,"No, Justice Scalia, I respectfully disagree."
2007.06-713,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1047.771,1058.079,Do you know any Democrats who go around saying I prefer the Democratic Party who do not regard themselves and register themselves as Democrats?
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1068.013,1076.557,"Your Honor, I think it's helpful to think of the expression of party preference as a subset of party affiliation."
2007.06-713,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1079.243,1086.834,"It's helpful to your case, but, going back to my question, do you know any people who go around saying, well, you know, I really prefer the Democrats; I'm a Republican myself?"
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1091.083,1097.219,"--Well, the example of Senator Lieberman comes to mind, where he said I really prefer the Democrats and I'm running as an independent."
2007.06-713,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1097.422,1097.876,There's always one.
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1107.107,1111.37,I think that we are permitted to allow people to express their preference.
2007.06-713,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1114.604,1115.463,"No, but that isn't responsive to my question."
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1122.117,1122.32,Yes.
2007.06-713,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1122.975,1123.24,You really do?
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1123.24,1129.005,"In Washington State over 40 percent of the voters, for example, identify themselves by... as independents."
2007.06-713,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1142.546,1151.261,"But it means that they... they will prefer the candidate of one party or another, assuming they vote and there's no independent candidate running."
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1164.287,1171.206,"Justice Souter, it may also mean that I choose not to formally affiliate with the party, even though I prefer that party's policies, goals."
2007.06-713,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1172.471,1173.251,It could.
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1179.202,1181.811,"--We have no registration in Washington State, Justice Souter."
2007.06-713,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1181.811,1184.779,"Well, however the statement is made."
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1184.779,1194.711,"There have been a number of cases where individuals have run... have run for office as independents and then have chosen to, you know, attend the caucus meetings of the Democratic Party, for example."
2007.06-713,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1199.226,1213.299,"General McKenna, I'm interested in how this new system meshes with the otherwise quite partisan nature of Washington's election laws."
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1248.737,1264.996,"Your Honor, as legal counsel for the State we've analyzed that question, and have concluded that unless and until the legislature chooses to alter the statute to harmonize at a practical level, the way that we will apply that statute is to count the votes of the party cast for the party's official nominee."
2007.06-713,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1282.021,1295.171,"I was going to ask the counsel for the Respondents, and you can answer as well, can you explain to me briefly the existing structure for the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, to say Mr. Smith is our nominee?"
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1295.171,1306.088,"Well, the Initiative 872, Justice Kennedy, repealed the old State law which required the parties to use the State primary to select their nominees."
2007.06-713,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1316.444,1319.974,And they have not devised a structure that we know of?
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1319.974,1320.474,No.
2007.06-713,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1372.14,1374.854,But may not claim that on the ballot itself?
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1374.854,1375.966,"Correct, Justice Souter."
2007.06-713,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1375.966,1384.853,"They're not allowed to split the ballot in their preference, are they, say I prefer one party on domestic issues, I prefer the other party's position on foreign affairs?"
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1384.853,1385.774,"No, Mr. Chief Justice, they are not."
2007.06-713,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1385.774,1404.533,"One of the briefs says that the Republicans... I think the Republicans or the Democrats checked with the, with the State election officials who said that there's no provision for convention, for nomination by convention."
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1404.533,1409.11,"Justice Scalia, they did not check with the State officials."
2007.06-713,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1417.294,1420.2,So they can... they can conduct conventions if they wish?
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1420.2,1421.401,"Yes, sir, Justice Scalia, they may."
2007.06-713,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1479.346,1481.486,"But clearly, it's just like a trademark case."
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1490.28,1493.934,"--Mr. Chief Justice, they make that claim without the benefit of any evidence."
2007.06-713,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1510.349,1514.082,I didn't suggest it would be a trademark violation.
2007.06-713,0,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,1522.188,1526.171,"They deserve protection, of course, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-713,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1537.667,1538.135,"Thank you, General."
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,1542.366,1554.346,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: Candidates are the party's messengers to win over the public on the important issues of the day.
2007.06-713,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1562.579,1571.247,What do you... what do you say about the fact that you have a right to select and designate an official candidate and it's independent of this ballot procedures?
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,1571.247,1588.099,As the secretary of state pointed out... and this is at JA-363... the secretary of state indicated the State would pay no attention to the party's nominating conventions and instead would continue to allow candidates to use party labels just as they had in the primary before.
2007.06-713,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1588.099,1588.286,Okay.
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,1608.935,1611.512,"It does, it does, Your Honor."
2007.06-713,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1622.241,1629.723,"You're saying in practical terms, this is a nomination, even though there may be a separate official nomination that nobody pays attention to?"
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,1629.723,1631.612,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2007.06-713,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1631.612,1636.75,Then why is one party going to the trouble of establishing a convention system to make nominations?
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,1636.75,1645.608,"We adopted... the Republican Party, the Democratic Party and the Libertarian Party all adopted rules governing nomination of our candidates by convention."
2007.06-713,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1677.048,1683.873,"Well, they will pay no attention, I take it, in the sense that there will be nothing indicating an official nomination on the ballot itself."
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,1710.628,1722.779,"They are, Your Honor, but that converts the right to nominate to a mere right to endorse, and this Court has recognized that the ability to endorse a candidate is no substitute--"
2007.06-713,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1722.779,1731.822,"You're saying that a right to nominate has to be a right to exclude everyone from the ballot except the nominee... everyone from the ballot under that banner, from the nominee."
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,1731.822,1734.102,"--To be... to be a meaningful right to nominate, yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-713,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1734.415,1736.993,Where does that right come from?
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,1755.327,1770.838,"--I'm not suggesting that the parties have a constitutional right to place their party name on a truly nonpartisan ballot, and I think what the Jones Court was hypothesizing was the true nonpartisan primary where there are no party identifications."
2007.06-713,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1783.52,1790.439,"So you would have no objection if this... everything was the same, except no party affiliation were shown."
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,1790.439,1791.079,--That--
2007.06-713,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1791.079,1793.156,That would be constitutional?
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,1793.156,1795.906,"--That would not violate our First Amendment rights, Your Honor."
2007.06-713,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1796.921,1798.686,May I ask this question?
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,1814.507,1826.846,"--No, Your Honor, because the State is still then resolving what is an internal factional fight between real Republicans using a blanket ballot where voters from rival parties are able to determine--"
2007.06-713,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1826.846,1829.548,In my hypothesis the person is a real Republican.
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,1832.562,1839.935,"--That's correct, Your Honor, but then the blanket is still selecting which Republican advances to the general election."
2007.06-713,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1839.935,1843.62,"Well then, it's not just a rhetorical flourish."
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,1859.364,1860.802,I'm... I'm not--
2007.06-713,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1860.802,1863.645,Or is that just somewhat hyperbolic?
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,1868.422,1876.857,--The political parties have the right to nominate their candidate and restrict the use of the party name to candidates who have been authorized to use that.
2007.06-713,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1876.857,1885.932,I didn't understand you to say that you have a right to a partisan process in which your... only your nominee is shown.
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,1897.239,1901.283,"That, that... that is our... is our position, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-713,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1921.87,1930.508,"Even if the information is by statute true, in my hypothetical he must be a member, but still you make the same objections."
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,1930.508,1931.412,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-713,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1945.36,1947.547,You're stating to suppress information.
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,1964.322,1967.164,"--Perhaps I misunderstood your question, Justice Stevens."
2007.06-713,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1974.364,1977.832,It would prevent him from running and saying he is a Republican.
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,1977.832,1993.622,"--On... having him listed on the ballot where the State is indicating that that is the most important information to consider, the partisan affiliation, and the State has hypothesized through the Grange reply brief that there are all these other possible formulations to ballot."
2007.06-713,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2023.078,2040.119,"Suppose there were an empirical study that Washington voters know about this system, and that 80 percent of the Washington voters know that the party has not endorsed any one of these... all of these candidates."
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2046.335,2047.351,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-713,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2071.402,2077.322,"But... but my submission, or my hypothetical and it's just a hypothetical, is that no one is misled by this."
2007.06-713,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2077.322,2080.743,--Do we know--
2007.06-713,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2080.743,2082.32,Accept the hypothetical as true.
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2083.507,2096.844,"--The interest then is that you still have two Republican-identified candidates who are purporting to carry the party's message to the voters, and the voters are resolving that intra-party competition."
2007.06-713,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2096.844,2105.951,"If you have, for example, a disclaimer, it seems to me that undermines your argument that they are successfully, anyway, purporting to carry the party's message."
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2105.951,2124.663,"Well, if you have the disclaimer, Your Honor, and the statements that this doesn't really mean anything, then you would come to the question of what legitimate State interest is being advanced by having someone put Republican on the ballot as their party preference, when it in fact means nothing; it does not mean they are associated with the party."
2007.06-713,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2125.398,2145.716,"How does one associate... this one... I think General McKenna told us that in the State of Washington people do not register membership in one party or the other, so how does the Republican Party determine who is a Republican?"
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2145.716,2150.618,--At... do you mean a legitimate Republican candidate?
2007.06-713,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2151.242,2154.026,"No, who do you consider a member of the party?"
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2166.709,2174.909,--The three political parties each have different definitions and ways to become... ways to become affiliated with the party.
2007.06-713,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2188.87,2191.557,"Any one of those, contributing funds is enough?"
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2193.478,2200.694,"--You don't have to go to the convention, but there is also a difference there between being a rank-and-file member and being a spokesman of the party."
2007.06-713,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2215.187,2218.186,Libertarians have a lot more rules than the other parties.
2007.06-713,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2224.152,2233.68,"You... you have identified... in the course of your argument, you've identified two separate problems with the... with the scheme as you see it."
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2250.392,2251.048,Yes.
2007.06-713,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2257.639,2258.124,Right.
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2258.124,2261.997,--any candidate to appropriate the name and compete against our nominee.
2007.06-713,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2261.997,2286.798,"I... I... no, I understand that to be your position, but my question is, and I realize there is a certain awkwardness to this, but we... we've got to face it: If the masking of the identity of the candidate is the real flaw, then the... the hypothetical that was included in the... in Jones, in the dictum, of the... of the party that... of the ballot that has no party identification whatsoever, that would equally be bad, wouldn't it?"
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2286.798,2297.389,"No, Your Honor, because what it is, in this instance, Initiative 872 is a partisan primary that would mask the identity of the party nominee."
2007.06-713,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2297.389,2309.088,"But if it's the masking that's the problem, the... the nominee is going to be just as well masked on the ballot or better masked on the ballot that allows no statement of preference at all."
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2309.088,2310.367,"No, Justice--"
2007.06-713,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2310.367,2317.975,"And... and I'm not saying that that's fatally your case, but I mean it's... it's something we need to be careful about when we're doing our thinking, and that's why I'm pressing you on it."
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2317.975,2322.799,--Well... and I think it's... it's the masking in the context of a partisan system.
2007.06-713,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2329.345,2350.212,"But if... but if it's just masking in a partisan system, then it seems to me you're making the same argument that you make when you say, by allowing statements of preference, we obscure the character of the official nominee and in effect allow somebody to have a... a second shot at... at getting Republican support as a Republican."
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2369.984,2374.825,"I... I think, Justice Souter, that it... that it is two separate inquiries."
2007.06-713,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2396.724,2398.769,"Well, but don't you think it's relevant information?"
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2403.08,2407.952,"--Well, it's... it's relevant information, Justice Stevens, only to the extent that it connects the candidate."
2007.06-713,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2407.952,2408.374,Only if true.
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2408.374,2414.185,To... to the extent it connects the candidate to the political party and its positions on the issues.
2007.06-713,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2417.105,2419.87,"Let me ask this question: This is a facial challenge, is it not?"
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2419.87,2420.73,"--Yes, it is, Your Honor."
2007.06-713,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2420.73,2424.213,And what exactly... what relief did the district court grant?
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2430.273,2443.001,The district court enjoined the entirety of Initiative 872 because it determined that the party preference provisions of Initiative 872 were not severable under Washington State's test for severability.
2007.06-713,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2443.001,2449.811,Do you think that was the narrowest relief he could have granted to avoid the constitutional difficulty that you see?
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2449.811,2454.59,"I... I think that was the... I think that was the appropriate, and it is a narrow relief."
2007.06-713,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2468.523,2476.66,"Do you think it would be administerable if it was severed, if the preference provision was just deleted?"
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2476.66,2480.066,"I'm not... I'm not sure that it would, Your Honor."
2007.06-713,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2498.728,2502.853,I'm confused about the difference between a facial challenge and an as-applied challenge.
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2514.832,2525.39,"Well, the Court asked General McKenna a question during his argument about whether the problem had ever occurred with a false-flag candidate capturing a party's name on the ballot."
2007.06-713,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2533.45,2548.959,"Yes, but it also seems highly improbable if you have a nominee as a result of a convention, everybody reads the newspapers, they know who the Republican nominee is, that there's going to be such confusion that everybody thinks it's one or two of the other people who also put an R after their name."
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2570.605,2584.615,"--Your Honor, it's... the State has indicated that our nominee, the unsuccessful nominee and the false-flag candidate would all be listed on the ballot identically."
2007.06-713,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2587.303,2591.223,"But, again, the ballot's not the only information available to voters when they go into the polls."
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2591.223,2610.824,"--No, but it's the only information presented to the... the voters at the critical moment when they're casting their ballot, and as this Court has noted in... with respect to term limits or provision of truthful information regarding race on a ballot, a State cannot put its thumbs on the electoral scales by favoring one group of candidates over another."
2007.06-713,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2610.824,2614.994,I suppose you could say the same thing about the candidates' party preferences.
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2619.649,2622.631,"That's... that's exactly the case, Justice--"
2007.06-713,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2622.631,2626.411,"I don't have the Republican Party endorsement, but I prefer the Republican Party."
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2626.411,2646.295,"--And with respect to the importance of party designations and party information on the ballot, last term the Chief Justice, in Wisconsin Right to Life, ordered a study that showed that 85 percent of voters couldn't name a single candidate for the United States House of Representatives in their own district, but the... the voters know the political parties."
2007.06-713,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2658.601,2676.891,"What would be the validity or the invalidity, in your view, of a scheme which said that the ballot has one candidate who says, Smith, Republican nominee, and the other candidates... other candidates say, Republican preference?"
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2676.891,2683.561,"--I think the question there, Your Honor, is what is the legitimate interest of the State in putting that information on the ballot?"
2007.06-713,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2709.396,2710.129,You... you can't answer my question?
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2713.674,2735.306,"--I... I cannot, Your Honor, because either... if there is legitimate State interest, the interest is in providing information about that candidate's positions and linkages to the Republican Party by saying, my preference is Republican because I believe what the Republicans are, whether that candidate is David Duke, in the Republican case, or in the case of the Democrats, a Lyndon LaRouche candidate."
2007.06-713,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2735.306,2746.177,"Well, when the Court writes this opinion, what's the fairest statement of the State's interest in this requirement?"
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2751.393,2767.23,I think the fairest... the fairest statement of the State interest would be that the State has no interest in creating the impression of false associations or allowing opportunistic candidates to appropriate the political party--
2007.06-713,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2767.23,2768.76,You think there's no legitimate interest?
2007.06-713,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2771.743,2780.85,I thought you said the State's interest was to... to do what we disapproved in Jones without seeming to do what we disapproved in Jones.
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2780.85,2786.032,"--That... that would be an acceptable phrasing of the State's interest as well, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-713,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2786.754,2788.035,"Well, I'm going to ask the State the same question."
2007.06-713,1,33676,john_j_white_jr,,2788.035,2796.688,"If there are no further questions, Initiative 872 is unconstitutional and the judgment of the lower court should be affirmed."
2007.06-713,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2796.688,2798.06,"Thank you, Mr. White."
2007.06-713,2,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2800.873,2802.45,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-713,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2830.611,2833.547,Can I ask you to clarify something you said during your initial argument?
2007.06-713,2,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2841.153,2843.121,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-713,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2854.398,2855.773,Maybe I'm wrong.
2007.06-713,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2857.944,2858.241,"I did, too."
2007.06-713,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2858.241,2859.569,And could you--
2007.06-713,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2859.569,2860.146,You should have said that.
2007.06-713,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2860.146,2863.691,--I mean how would you defend that?
2007.06-713,2,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2864.034,2867.237,"Well, I would defend it, Your Honor, by saying that this is a facial challenge."
2007.06-713,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2870.236,2874.126,"--Well, we are assuming it is applied in the way that is shown on the Grange reply brief at page 1."

2007.06-713,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2909.111,2914.718,"Isn't it also true that, by hypothesis, there will be other candidates beside the one R and the one D?"
2007.06-713,2,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2917.967,2926.681,"In the scenario or the ballot on page 1, Justice Stevens, I believe that what would happen is the Secretary of State would still provide the additional language."
2007.06-713,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2936.771,2947.22,"But my point is there could never be a ballot just like this, what your opponents are talking about, because there are always going to be at least two or three R's and two or three D's."
2007.06-713,2,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,2955.014,2964.946,"But the key here, Your Honor, is that even under the ballot on page one, what is not happening under top-two is that the nominee of the party is not being selected."
2007.06-713,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2989.25,2994.464,Does the State have a legitimate interest in weakening the influence of political parties?

2007.06-713,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2996.09,3003.228,"If we found that that was the necessary effect of this ballot measure, then would it be invalid?"
2007.06-713,2,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3003.228,3014.864,I think Your Honor you would have to find there is a severe burden on the parties and subject the provision to party presence to strict scrutiny.
2007.06-713,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3020.924,3027.281,If the state has no legitimate interest it's going to fail any level of scrutiny.
2007.06-713,2,39894,robert_m_mckenna,,3027.281,3034.575,It has legitimate interest indicating something about party on the ballot.
