1984.84-510,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,43.443,"Mr. Cooper, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,43.443,46.129,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-510,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,160.154,166.491,"Well, the joint marketing arrangement would involve price-fixing, too, I suppose?"
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,166.491,169.026,Price-fixing would be per se unlawful.
1984.84-510,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,169.026,174.68,"Well, I know, but isn't that part of the kind of a joint marketing arrangement you're talking about?"
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,174.68,180.151,"Well, some joint market... I said in some circumstances a joint marketing arrangement would be examined under the rule of reason."
1984.84-510,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,185.971,191.473,But this joint marketing arrangement involved here does involve an agreement on prices?
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,191.473,197.177,--It does indeed.
1984.84-510,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,428.279,446.924,"Mr. Cooper, did counsel for Petitioner object to the instructions given by the court that appear on pages 181 and 182 of the joint appendix relating to the Section 2 claim?"
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,446.924,447.857,"No, counsel did not."
1984.84-510,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,447.857,448.859,"Did not, okay."
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,455.613,457.313,We contend the evidence was insufficient.
1984.84-510,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,463.453,476.593,Was there some evidence that Aspen Ski Company refused to accept the Adventure Pack coupons that were equivalent to cash simply because they were issued by a competitor?
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,476.593,478.06,Yes.
1984.84-510,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,478.06,483.18,"And would that be enough evidence, then, to get to the jury on the Section 2 issue?"
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,483.18,484.199,I would submit not.
1984.84-510,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,484.199,484.916,Why not?
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,484.916,495.838,Because the premise on which that evidence would go to the jury is that there is a duty under Section 2 to engage in horizontal joint marketing arrangements with a competitor.
1984.84-510,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,508.432,519.353,"Well, I had thought the Adventure Pack coupon proposal was different from the joint ticket, that it was a substitute offered by Highlights; is that correct?"
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,519.353,519.855,That's correct.
1984.84-510,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,533.613,535.232,Regardless of intent?
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,535.232,536.315,That's correct.
1984.84-510,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,536.315,538.351,Although it's the same as cash?
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,538.351,541.636,"Even if it's the same as cash, although in this case--"
1984.84-510,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,541.636,547.373,So Highlands could just as well have given their people the money and sent them over there.
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,547.373,549.89,"--In fact, when they did that Ski Company accepted it."
1984.84-510,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,551.442,552.692,"Well, good, good."
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,553.944,555.144,--They don't turn down money.
1984.84-510,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,555.144,562.232,"Well, Mr. Cooper, did Highlands try to buy some tickets at the retail price?"
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,562.232,564.432,They tried to buy some tickets from Ski Company.
1984.84-510,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,564.432,566.601,At the regular retail price?
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,566.601,571.322,"I think that's a fair inference, although it's not absolutely clear what price they were offering."
1984.84-510,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,573.088,577.992,"But in any event, Ski Company would not sell Highlands any retail tickets?"
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,577.992,578.626,That's correct.
1984.84-510,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,578.626,579.861,At the retail price?
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,579.861,581.761,That's correct.
1984.84-510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,597.054,602.691,"May I ask, Mr. Cooper, because you rely on the motion for directed verdict, I guess, as the basis for the error--"
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,602.691,603.893,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
1984.84-510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,603.893,611.63,"--And I notice right in front of the instructions the argument that's quoted in the joint appendix, at least, was that the relevant market was incorrectly defined."
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,612.915,614.049,That was one of the arguments.
1984.84-510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,614.049,617.284,And did you make another argument in support of it?
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,619.386,627.075,"The duty to cooperate point was raised by counsel in those very terms, and counsel cited the relevant cases."
1984.84-510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,627.075,629.009,In support of the motion for directed verdict?
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,629.009,629.725,Yes.
1984.84-510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,629.725,632.694,Because it doesn't appear in this part of the joint appendix.
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,632.694,634.763,It does not appear in the joint appendix.
1984.84-510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,637.615,638.531,I see.
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,656.908,658.608,"Let's analyze them, if we may."
1984.84-510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,674.387,677.156,"Were there separate verdicts on each of the six, is that what it was?"
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,677.156,682.241,"No, but there was a separate Section 2 verdict and a Section 1 verdict, and that allegation related to both."
1984.84-510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,682.241,689.546,But I thought the argument on that was that the exclusive contract with the tour operator was one form of exclusionary conduct.
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,689.546,692.431,But the jury held that it was not a Section 1 violation.
1984.84-510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,692.431,698.835,But does that necessarily foreclose the possibility that they relied on that evidence as evidence of exclusionary conduct?
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,698.835,699.819,I would think so in this case.
1984.84-510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,705.006,707.525,"You know, we have inconsistent verdicts in the criminal law."
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,710.377,712.495,I don't think you have an inconsistent verdict here.
1984.84-510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,754.239,755.689,Why would this last one be?
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,761.143,769.048,It was simply that they raised the single ticket price in such a way as to make Highlands' Adventure Pack prospectively uneconomical.
1984.84-510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,778.037,779.937,Let me just be sure I have the facts right.
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,787.727,794.381,"--Well, that's the argument made in it was presented... and I'll address both."
1984.84-510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,830.686,842.043,"Well, but supposing you did the opposite and left the single ticket price alone and dropped the six-day coupon, cut it in half, and said, if you don't go anyplace else during these six days you can get a real cheap rate at our three mountains."
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,842.043,842.927,"Well, then you might have--"
1984.84-510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,842.927,844.162,Could that possibly create a problem?
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,844.162,846.129,--You might have a predatory pricing question.
1984.84-510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,853.101,858.589,"The mere fact that it was a discount in order to induce people just to patronize your own business wouldn't be enough, you'd say?"
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,858.589,859.322,I would submit not.
1984.84-510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,908.838,909.522,I'm not sure that's right.
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,920.579,930.368,"Well, even in the range we're talking about, the discount between the single day ticket and the six-day ticket is very small."
1984.84-510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,936.939,939.724,"Well, whatever it is, you raised the single ticket more than you raised the six day."
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,939.724,940.291,Right.
1984.84-510,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,962.139,979.018,"Mr. Cooper, to go back just a moment, is it your position that the Petitioner could refuse to sell to the Highlands Corporation lift tickets for cash?"
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,979.018,985.422,"Yes, that a firm has no duty to deal with a horizontal competitor."
1984.84-510,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,985.422,990.574,Even if the refusal were for the purpose of harming your competitor?
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,990.574,995.21,"If all that you have is the refusal, then it wouldn't matter what the purpose is."
1984.84-510,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1024.563,1031.301,"Well, that's the inquiry, whether there isn't some evidence here that would support the Section 2 violation."
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,1031.301,1032.653,--Our submission is there is not.
1984.84-510,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1049.947,1059.486,"Well, what if the lift tickets had freely been made available say in drug stores and grocery stores in the village."
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,1066.057,1066.607,Yes.
1984.84-510,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1086.987,1091.941,"It surely couldn't say, we won't sell tickets to you if you ever buy any tickets from the Highlands."
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,1091.941,1092.641,--Correct.
1984.84-510,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1341.685,1349.606,"Well, even if you're right on that issue, then where does that leave you on the Section 2 issue?"
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,1374.323,1377.192,--Aspen Ski Corp. would not accept the coupons.
1984.84-510,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1378.575,1391.868,"And no evidence that that conduct had the effect of coercing unfairly the customers, to get them away from the Highlands?"
1984.84-510,0,38896,richard_melvyn_cooper,,1391.868,1393.368,Not to get them away from the Highlands.
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,1826.901,1829.603,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1984.84-510,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1902.132,1903.049,Could I just ask--
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,1903.049,1903.532,--Sure.
1984.84-510,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1903.532,1910.905,"--just in brief, so that I can listen to you better, what is your theory of monopolization?"
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,1910.905,1912.038,The theory of monopolization--
1984.84-510,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1912.038,1914.523,Can you state what monopolization is just briefly?
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,1914.523,1915.459,--Yes.
1984.84-510,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2044.341,2045.107,Mr. Trautman--
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2045.107,2045.426,Yes.
1984.84-510,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2045.426,2053.097,--I take it you support the Court of Appeals' theory on the essential facilities doctrine?
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2053.097,2060.353,"Let me just mention briefly, that issue came up when Petitioner filed its brief in that case."
1984.84-510,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2064.688,2066.273,Do you defend that--
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2066.273,2077.046,"--It's our position that that was a proper analogy for the court to use in analyzing the case, that specifically in this case there was vertical conduct, as I will get to."
1984.84-510,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2083.382,2085.318,--What was the facility--
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2085.318,2086.001,"--Well, the facility--"
1984.84-510,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2086.001,2088.103,--to which Highlands was denied access?
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2088.103,2092.74,"--""Facility"" is probably a poor choice of words by the commentators that have set it up."
1984.84-510,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2108.6,2110.702,"Well, do you think it's the joint lift ticket or something?"
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2110.702,2121.158,"--We think that the ability to be involved in a multi-mountain, convenient multi-mountain package of skiing in a multi-mountain resort like Aspen is crucial."
1984.84-510,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2121.158,2124.11,"Well, the joint lift ticket, in other words, you think is the facility?"
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2124.11,2126.295,The components of that ticket are the facility.
1984.84-510,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2126.295,2143.006,Are there any other cases that you know of involving the so-called essential facilities concept where the court has held that a monopolist has to provide access to the final product to the competitor?
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2143.006,2160.718,"Well, it seems to us, Your Honor, that there are cases where... for example, Associated Press is one I can think of, where newspapers that were excluded from Associated Press, wanted to take Associated Press news, package it with the news that they had gathered and sell their newspapers."
1984.84-510,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2196.424,2201.11,"Counsel, why do you really bother with this essential facilities doctrine?"
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2203.045,2204.012,"--We sure didn't, Your Honor."
1984.84-510,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2204.012,2211.417,"The Court of Appeals imposed it on you, and I take it it's your position that you would prevail utterly apart from--"
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2211.417,2212.9,"That is exactly our position, Your Honor."
1984.84-510,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2286.731,2288.583,--This was a colloquy on jury instructions?
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2288.583,2293.468,"This was a colloquy in the directed verdict motion, Your Honor."
1984.84-510,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2357.827,2360.279,"That isn't, of course, the basis on which the Tenth Circuit--"
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2360.279,2365.333,"That is not the basis, and we don't think that it expands anything that we received by the Tenth Circuit."
1984.84-510,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2431.442,2432.709,"--Mr. Trautman, forgive me."
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2436.696,2437.162,Yes.
1984.84-510,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2437.162,2446.635,"I was just looking at 14(a) of the petition for certiorari, which is part of the Court of Appeals' opinion, and it says there, the Court of Appeals says:"
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2452.755,2453.189,Okay.
1984.84-510,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2467.796,2473.9,"Well, the Court of Appeals went on to say that this preserved Defendant's opportunity to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence on that issue."
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2473.9,2474.35,That's right.
1984.84-510,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2474.35,2486.276,"So you're really asking, if you ask us to affirm on the basis of the insufficiency of the argument as part of a motion for directed verdict, you're asking us to take a different view of the sufficiency of that motion than the Court of Appeals took."
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2486.276,2488.459,That's correct.
1984.84-510,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2488.459,2490.428,May I ask one other question about that.
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2492.596,2503.136,"We contend that the law in terms of a monopolist is that you can refuse to deal, that is you can refuse to cooperate, if you have a legitimate business reason."
1984.84-510,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2503.136,2510.308,Because the judge instructed the jury that a corporation which possesses monopoly power is not under a duty to cooperate.
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2512.058,2516.212,Everybody agrees with the general proposition there is no general duty to cooperate.
1984.84-510,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2561.007,2563.109,Weren't you asking to buy them at a discount?
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2563.109,2563.626,No.
1984.84-510,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2578.036,2579.602,May I ask what may be a stupid question.
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2585.54,2586.273,No.
1984.84-510,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2586.273,2587.908,It must be bought day by day?
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2587.908,2603.918,"But you see, the point, what Highlands wanted to do was essentially to buy a three-day ticket, which they sold in advance to tour operators, a three-area three-day ticket or a three-area four-day ticket, and package that with their ticket and create a four-mountain ticket, which had been demanded over the last 16 years."
1984.84-510,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2603.918,2609.071,"But an individual consumer could not have gone to their window and said, on Monday and said, I'd like tickets I can use on Thursday, Friday and Saturday?"
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2609.071,2610.84,Not daily tickets.
1984.84-510,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2616.661,2637.658,"Mr. Cooper, I understand that their refusing to honor your coupons and things like that wouldn't have involved price-fixing at all, but the joint ticket, the joint ticket does involve fixing the same price for the two areas."
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2637.658,2638.591,That's correct.
1984.84-510,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2638.591,2644.828,And you now have an injunction requiring this monopolist to price-fix with Highlands.
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2644.828,2653.1,We have an injunction which exists now only because the Petitioner wanted it to exist for another year while this case was appealed.
1984.84-510,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2653.65,2654.3,"Well, nevertheless--"
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2654.3,2655.869,--particular injunction is going to run out.
1984.84-510,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2655.869,2657.654,"--Nevertheless, you have that injunction."
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2670.546,2671.246,No.
1984.84-510,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2672.248,2683.22,"Well, you say that part of your claim is that the monopolist refused to sell a joint ticket."
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2683.22,2685.988,"As part of our claim, taken with all of the other conduct."
1984.84-510,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2705.135,2709.687,"You mean the court in entering the injunction just thought it up on its own, or did you ask for it?"
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2709.687,2720.429,"No, the reason the court did it, Your Honor, I think quite clearly is that it was a model that was being used by Petitioner itself in another county in Colorado, in Summit County, Colorado."
1984.84-510,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2720.429,2721.862,"Yes, but you must have asked for it."
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2721.862,2723.431,"We asked for an injunction, Your Honor."
1984.84-510,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2723.431,2723.914,Yes.
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2723.914,2727.665,We tried at trial to put on evidence of damages--
1984.84-510,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2727.665,2734.488,But you asked for an injunction to make Aspen Ski Corporation cooperate in the joint ticket.
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2734.488,2735.554,"--That's correct, that's correct."
1984.84-510,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2735.554,2737.523,Which involved a price fix.
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2737.523,2739.423,That's correct.
1984.84-510,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2786.954,2793.627,"Well, didn't the Colorado Attorney General think that this joint ticket was a price fix, illegal price fix?"
1984.84-510,1,43402,tucker_karl_trautman,,2793.627,2798.695,The Colorado Attorney General filed a lawsuit alleging that there was price-fixing.
1984.84-510,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3188.615,3189.399,"Thank you, gentlemen."
