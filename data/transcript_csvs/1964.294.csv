1964.294,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,41.109,Number 294 [Inaudible] Mr. Shmukler.
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,41.109,44.838,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1964.294,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,219.688,235.765,"Well that's a question that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court did not get to because they cite a standard wrong, because that court held that even if there was a probable cause, still a disciplinary rule did not apply to a forfeiture proceeding, is that correct?"
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,235.765,236.406,That's correct sir.
1964.294,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,236.406,247.848,"So if we should agree with the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, we would -- wouldn't get to this question although you had properly refer to the first question in your argument, is that right?"
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,247.848,250.624,That's correct Justice Stewart.
1964.294,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,275.178,278.923,You mean Mr. Shmukler they had to make you change around the order of your argument at all?
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,280.079,281.144,That's quite right sir.
1964.294,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,319.19,321.815,[Inaudible] contraband?
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,321.815,339.258,"Sir, the Pennsylvania statute provides that the possession of unstamped liquor is a crime and that the liquor itself would be forfeit as could the vehicle used in transportation."
1964.294,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,341.543,345.544,"In this case, I gathered 375 bottles of liquor --"
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,345.544,346.002,Yes sir.
1964.294,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,346.002,348.789,Were they contraband as you make the statement?
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,348.789,355.799,"Well Justice Brennan, in this case, the liquor was forfeit without a -- an answer being filed to the petition and it was contraband --"
1964.294,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,355.799,361.383,"-- distinction to say the car in which they were is not contraband, is that right?"
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,361.383,361.923,Yes sir.
1964.294,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,449.806,453.573,This is the way you distinguish Jeffers and Trupiano?
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,453.573,457.772,"Well sir, Jeffers and Trupiano were not forfeiture proceedings."
1964.294,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,527.245,545.989,But you wouldn't -- I suppose if the officer didn't had a search warrant or if they had followed the car and have seen liquor being taken out of it and then the – there would be no question about the car being forfeit I guess.
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,545.989,549.774,"Sir, on the statute I believe there would be no question because under those circumstances --"
1964.294,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,549.774,555.292,Just would -- just the evidence that they used here to prove that it was a car --
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,555.292,556.017,That's right sir.
1964.294,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,564.796,568.884,Even though the government could keep it even though they illegally seized –
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,568.884,572.158,"Well, if the government can illegally keep the -- I mean, can keep the --"
1964.294,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,572.158,574.779,They can destroy it but they could not introduce it into evidence?
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,574.779,591.094,"They could destroy the liquor if -- at least, that's what the facts in this case far, that they did seize and it was not contested and they could destroy the liquor but they cannot introduce it into a courtroom to prove that the car was being improperly used."
1964.294,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1022.041,1043.569,"Looking back for a moment Mr. Shmukler to your basic question of whether or not there was probable cause and assuming that you're correct that in the ordinary kind of a situation within the State of Pennsylvania, you would have a situation here even less probable cause, you could say that Beck against – there was Beck against Ohio."
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,1043.569,1045.436,Yes sir.
1964.294,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1045.436,1092.108,"But what is involved here of course is the search of a vehicle for -- to find out whether or not it was importing -- illegally importing into Pennsylvania, alcoholic, intoxicating liquors and while it may very well be true that there's no general power on part of the state officers to search all or even any vehicles coming into the state for the general matter that after all was one of the United States has created in the Constitution to prevent the balkanization of the newly independent colonies and see to it that there were not be failures and that kind of thing directed one state against the other."
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,1135.586,1140.378,"Sir, I believe that there are two answers to that."
1964.294,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1238.769,1251.232,"Could state under the Twenty-first Amendment acquire every car coming into the state to file an affidavit to the state law that he has no untaxed with it, in your opinion?"
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,1251.232,1253.462,"Justice Goldberg, I wouldn't think so."
1964.294,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1282.677,1289.98,"Well Mr. Shmukler, I have the experience of being stopped when I cross from one state to another."
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,1317.264,1324.381,"Justice Brennan, I think again that this -- we are questioning the remedy that is left to the states, I --"
1964.294,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1324.381,1325.92,Well they take it and destroy it?
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,1325.92,1326.346,I think in those --
1964.294,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1326.346,1327.262,(Voice Overlap) -- before?
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,1327.262,1349.885,"In those instances, the health of the community may require, this would be equivalent to something which is contraband per se and no matter how they find it as in the Frank versus Maryland case or as in that hypothetical Your Honor has suggested once they find it, it might be contraband per se or contrary to public health and safety and therefore could be forfeit."
1964.294,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1349.885,1354.025,But the tax stamp -- you mean this unstamped liquor involved only a revenue problem?
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,1354.025,1356.438,"That's right sir, this is a revenue problem."
1964.294,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1370.196,1371.634,They don't take my automobile --
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,1371.634,1381.203,And in the -- I've got to go Your Honor I suppose certainly they do not take the automobile for transporting corn with -- or whatever may be.
1964.294,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1381.203,1391.207,Well is there any thing in the record indicating any amount of -- any significant amount of traffic in the non-tax paid liquor between New Jersey and Pennsylvania?
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,1391.207,1402.221,"Sir, there's absolutely nothing in the record except the statement in the Superior Court that they are taking judicial knowledge that around the holiday season, this traffic increases."
1964.294,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1402.221,1402.368,Do you --
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,1402.368,1402.819,Sir --
1964.294,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1402.819,1404.702,Did you accept to that?
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,1404.702,1424.208,"I would also -- I would like to add to it if not accept to it that at the same time of the year, traffic in legitimate gifts and the bicycles being transported in the back of automobiles also increases so the mere fact that an automobile is riding low in the rear does not lead ineluctably to the --"
1964.294,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1424.208,1441.809,"Well I'm suggesting -- I'm just wondering whether they couldn't stop all cars, not just one blow in the rear but forget that fact, why couldn't they stop all cars coming in New Jersey to Pennsylvania at that time of the year if it's likely that people coming from New Jersey have non-taxed liquor?"
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,1441.809,1452.603,"Justice White, if that were possible then they could extend that through all times of the year because it is not only a holiday times that people in Pennsylvania drink liquor which had been obtained from New Jersey."
1964.294,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1452.603,1455.757,So you do say that there is a significant amount of traffic --
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,1455.757,1459.412,I would say that there is not a significant increase in that period of time.
1964.294,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1476.06,1479.09,[Inaudible]
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,1479.09,1479.821,Thank you sir.
1964.294,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1479.821,1497.41,"Is there at any event would you not say Mr. Shmukler that Carroll pretty much settled this problem because at that time if I remember the case, they had a national prohibition of law and the court said that that didn't warrant stopping all cars to enforce the national prohibition law, is that correct?"
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,1497.41,1497.613,That's correctly --
1964.294,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1497.613,1498.957,Am I correct in that?
1964.294,0,42012,stanford_shmukler,,1498.957,1500.385,That's absolutely correct Your Honor.
1964.294,1,43282,thomas_j_shannon,,1529.916,1532.631,If it please the Court.
1964.294,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1573.558,1584.044,I -- I don't want to detain you but I don't see why that should be taken into consideration because what we're concern with here is the probable cause for stopping and not for what happened afterwards.
1964.294,1,43282,thomas_j_shannon,,1584.044,1595.649,"Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, the contention of the Commonwealth is and I think this Court has reiterated many times, we are in a forfeiture proceeding here --"
1964.294,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1595.649,1595.87,Yes.
1964.294,1,43282,thomas_j_shannon,,1595.87,1597.182,-- not in a criminal proceeding.
1964.294,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1597.182,1598.38,I understand that.
1964.294,1,43282,thomas_j_shannon,,1598.38,1618.787,"And the basic question before this Court is only defining of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and that question is, does the exclusionary rule which apply to search and seizure in criminal prosecutions apply in the proceedings in rem for the contraband."
1964.294,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1620.263,1620.656,Yes.
1964.294,1,43282,thomas_j_shannon,,1620.656,1625.22,We do not have anything that is not contraband.
1964.294,2,42012,stanford_shmukler,,3170.883,3181.0,"I don't wish to over state my welcome here by exceeding the recess time but I have just several short points I would like to make, if I may."
