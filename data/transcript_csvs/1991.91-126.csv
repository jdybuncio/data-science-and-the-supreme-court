1991.91-126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.689,"We'll hear argument now in 91-126, Howard Wyatt v. Bill Cole and John Robbins."
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,10.822,14.308,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,32.887,34.637,To say the least.
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,34.637,36.506,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,156.749,158.867,"Yes, but when you run them enough they become very gentle."
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,159.651,177.929,"--Anyway, Your Honor, Brahma cattle are probably not that important to most of us, even though Mississippians probably have more appreciation than some of us that live in Washington, D.C., but to my client, Mr. Wyatt, these animals were very important to him."
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,182.3,184.769,"Well, does that really bear on the constitutional issue?"
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,184.769,193.355,"--No, sir, it probably doesn't, except that the defendants are claiming good faith and innocence and I think it might have some bearing on that, that they would have known what they were going to do to him."
1991.91-126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,193.355,203.146,"But the good faith and innocence claim goes to their knowledge about the unconstitutionality of the statute, not to the disposition of the cattle."
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,203.146,205.598,"Yes, sir, that's correct, Your Honor."
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,229.963,234.332,"So it's not a preseizure hearing, it's a postseizure hearing."
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,234.332,235.367,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,282.265,286.717,"Well, you had a postseizure hearing."
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,286.717,287.267,That's correct.
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,287.267,287.884,What happened at the hearing?
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,287.884,288.769,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,303.262,303.846,So what did he order?
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,303.846,306.346,"He ordered him... I might point this out, Your Honor."
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,315.653,316.519,And then what happened?
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,316.519,329.627,"Let me finish my answer, if I might... and also, Your Honor, my client, who's never had any history of psychiatric problems, suffered a mental breakdown and was hospitalized, and the remedy of bringing the cattle back which a State judge ordered wouldn't have cured that."
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,348.724,350.724,And then what happened?
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,350.724,366.085,"Your Honor, the next thing that happened was we decided for strategic reasons and because we believed, erroneously as it turned out, we'd be better off in the United States District Court, we took a nonsuit of our pending proceeding."
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,409.994,410.827,Absolutely.
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,410.827,415.129,"Yes, sir, and very little question about it, most of it we abandoned in the district court."
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,419.6,421.968,"Was this absolute immunity, or qualified?"
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,421.968,425.254,In this case they're claiming qualified immunity for a private defendant.
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,425.254,427.187,That's what the district judge ruled.
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,427.187,427.706,"Yes, sir."
1991.91-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,632.933,647.174,"Mr. Waide, that may be true with respect to official immunity, but we adopted official immunity for 1983 actions because it was in existence in 1870."
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,693.533,700.456,"Your Honor, first, it's... I think it's probably not quite accurate to characterize that as an immunity."
1991.91-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,712.728,713.761,"No, it was not a defense."
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,716.965,717.482,"All right, sir."
1991.91-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,717.482,718.532,--But it would have been your burden to show it.
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,718.532,719.165,"All right, sir."
1991.91-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,732.357,733.79,"Well, no, you would have to plead it."
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,741.563,743.896,"Well, Your Honor, I certainly don't mean to argue with the Court."
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,791.255,792.755,That's what you should have taken to the State court.
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,792.755,816.002,"Justice White, ironically we should have, because... and I think this is an another important facet about this case... if this Court is going to adopt a policy, and that's what it has to do, Your Honor; Justice White in the Burns case very recently said this Court has no authority to just judicially create policies, and Justice Scalia, that's why, of course, the Court looks to the common law background."
1991.91-126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,883.079,890.585,"Do you think then, Mr. Waide, that the outcome here should depend on what the policy is in each of the 50 States?"
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,890.585,892.819,"--No, Your Honor, I don't."
1991.91-126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,938.68,942.316,So is the answer to the question that I asked you yes or no?
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,942.316,946.084,"Your Honor, my answer to this question is it would be uniform across the States."
1991.91-126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,977.019,991.879,Because you say the policy of all 50 States is to allow an action against someone who wrongfully brings a replevin action without any requirement of malice?
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,991.879,999.719,"Yes, Your... well, Your Honor, the statutes, I think the language of the statutes just simply says if you wrongly sue out a writ of replevin you can be sued."
1991.91-126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,999.719,1002.837,"Well, of course, that leaves the whole question up in the air."
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1004.554,1005.571,"Yes, sir, I understand."
1991.91-126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1016.562,1028.017,"No, but you don't answer the question of whether there might be States in which there would be some showing of malice required, if you're talking about just State causes of action."
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1028.017,1028.267,All right.
1991.91-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1059.072,1062.174,"Excuse me, Mr. Waide, I'm not sure that... I think it's one and the same thing."
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1091.86,1096.912,"--Excuse me, Your Honor, but I would differ with the Court just in this respect."
1991.91-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1199.592,1200.708,What about Cole?
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1215.351,1235.015,"Your Honor, my opinion of how the Court should decide the case as to Cole is that first, disagreeing perhaps with Justice Scalia, that there is no common law background sufficiently close to this to justify this Court giving any immunity at all, so immunity, which is a legal defense, is just out."
1991.91-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1264.534,1269.486,"--Well, I want to know what the standard is, because he would say well, my attorney told me there was a statute on the books."
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1279.877,1285.781,"All right, I think the jury in that case would probably decide in Mr. Cole's favor if it thinks the lawyer never told him."
1991.91-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1285.781,1292.101,"Well, is the jury entitled to an instruction under 1983 that subjective good faith is a defense?"
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1292.101,1294.637,"No, sir, that's... no, they're not, Your Honor, and what I'm saying is it's--"
1991.91-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1294.637,1307.694,"Well, it seemed to me that earlier you conceded, and I think perhaps that there may be some good reasons for that, that there should be a subjective good faith defense."
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1322.037,1333.178,"--Your Honor, the appropriate course in this case, in my opinion, is to decide the case before the Court, which is that the qualified immunity doctrine as this Court has announced it is not to be applied to private defense."
1991.91-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1338.396,1339.963,Let's assume that we think that's before us.
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1339.963,1343.581,"--All right, sir... such as, I didn't think I was doing anything wrong."
1991.91-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1355.806,1357.84,And we get that as a matter of Federal law under 1983.
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1357.84,1369.482,"--Your Honor, the State law standards are incorporated into 1983, as I understand it, by 1988 and generally in a malicious prosecution or abuse of process type suit that is an element of the case."
1991.91-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1369.482,1371.998,So we do this tort by tort.
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1371.998,1383.806,"Well, Your Honor, the fact that we have 1988 indicates to some extent there's going to be variance among the States, but I don't think there's any great disparity."
1991.91-126,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1392.143,1394.411,"Well, but your cause of action is under 1983."
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1394.411,1427.966,"That's correct, Your Honor, but when 1983 doesn't provide the appropriate rules of decision and there's nothing in the statute, it's just general that you look to the common law or the to State law, and we think that... Your Honor, we think that even if the jury's instructed on malice, that we had to prove that as an element of the case, assuming that such an instruction is given, we think that we had evidence that we could have proved that with, but the trouble was the district judge ruled that this was a matter of law, and that's consistent with Your Honor's decisions, and that we were not going to be able to submit the case to the jury."
1991.91-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1427.966,1432.287,Why would we apply these defenses as a matter of State law?
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1458.584,1468.541,"Well, Your Honors do apply State law and have frequently applied State law on various defenses that might come up such as the statute of limitations, or such as survivorship rules."
1991.91-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1483.718,1490.205,Do you know any other case where we look to State law for defenses to a Federal cause of action?
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1490.205,1493.757,"Yes, Your Honor, Wilson v. Garcia on the statute of limitations, which is an affirmative--"
1991.91-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1493.757,1499.227,"No, I'm not talking about statutes of limitations, I'm talking about substantive defenses to the cause of action."
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1499.227,1499.994,--Well--
1991.91-126,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1499.994,1507.916,"It seems very strange to create a Federal cause of action and say however, what defenses exist to this Federal cause of action ought to be a matter of State law."
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1508.499,1533.031,"--Well, Your Honor, all that I can say is it's always my assumption in trying 1983 cases, and it appears to be universally done, if there's no rule, there's no Federal rule... you know, if we're talking about a cause of action and there's nothing in any statute that says what the elements are for this cause of action, you've got to look somewhere for the rule of law, so to me the logical place to look and dictate it by 1988 is State law or the common law."
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1540.72,1547.874,"Mr. Waide, why wasn't the bond valid in this case?"
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1549.407,1555.361,"Justice White, the bondsman was attorney Robbins' son and Mr. Cole's wife."
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1558.932,1561.716,What was the condition of the bond?
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1561.716,1567.703,Just pay any damages that might accrue because of the wrongful suing out of the writ of replevin was the condition of the bond.
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1567.703,1575.957,"So if the bondsman had been good the bondsman could recover against his principal, I suppose."
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1575.957,1587.663,"Your Honor, had the bond been good, Mississippi replevin law... we're just talking about State law now for wrongful replevin... had very limited damages rules, which was part of the reason why we came to Federal court."
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1595.167,1599.887,"Well, anyway, whatever you could have collected on the bond, the bondsman could have collected from his principal."
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1599.887,1601.404,"Yes, sir, that would be correct, Your Honor."
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1601.404,1615.313,And it wouldn't... and the principal wouldn't have been able to plead any kind of immunity or any defense against that kind of action.
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1615.313,1622.817,"That's an interesting point, Your Honor, and the way the statute is written it's an absolute liability."
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1630.637,1643.112,So the risk of an illegal replevin is on the person who replevies.
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1643.112,1643.395,--Yes.
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1646.598,1650.384,"And that goes for, you think... and I suppose it goes for--"
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1650.384,1652.586,--Constitutional tort.
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1652.586,1653.402,--Yes.
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1653.402,1654.836,"Your Honor, what I would like--"
1991.91-126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1654.836,1655.586,"Mr. Waide, just a minute."
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1669.41,1674.714,"--Just failing to comply with the statute, Your Honor, is essentially what it would amount to, that it was not justified."
1991.91-126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1674.714,1677.249,Is that what the Mississippi supreme court has said?
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1677.249,1680.367,"I don't know that that language is there, but that's the situation."
1991.91-126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1681.201,1681.851,"Well, just a minute--"
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1681.851,1682.267,--I'm sorry.
1991.91-126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1682.267,1690.873,"--I didn't ask you what the situation was, I asked you what the supreme court of Mississippi has held with respect to the meaning of wrongful replevin."
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1690.873,1691.857,"All right, sir."
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1700.729,1701.913,Under the State law.
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1701.913,1702.514,Under the State law.
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1711.953,1714.186,Where the replevin statute has been held unconstitutional.
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1714.186,1718.471,"The Mississippi supreme court, Your Honor... this is the case that I was referring to."
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1723.756,1731.795,"Well, I... well, was it a case in which the replevin statute was held unconstitutional?"
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1731.795,1732.878,"Yes, sir, it was."
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1735.163,1742.834,But you don't know whether you could have collected under the bond in that case.
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1742.834,1745.203,"In that case, could you have collected on the bond?"
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1747.436,1748.405,"Well, you don't... let's not assume it--"
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1748.405,1748.821,"All right, sir."
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1748.821,1763.081,"--because the bond may just be conditioned on a rightful replevin under State law, and not on the possible unconstitutionality of the statute."
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1763.081,1768.032,"Your Honor, the case I consider to be all fours with this case."
1991.91-126,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1777.638,1780.19,What's that cite for the supreme court of Mississippi?
1991.91-126,0,33604,jim_waide,,1780.19,1782.958,563 Southern 2nd 1387.
1991.91-126,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1785.91,1786.727,Thank you.
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,1801.587,1804.889,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-126,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1849.651,1851.686,What if they should?
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,1851.686,1855.471,If they should?
1991.91-126,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1855.471,1858.44,"What if, objectively, they should suspect it?"
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,1858.44,1863.994,"If they fail to meet the objective standard... in other words, I think--"
1991.91-126,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1863.994,1866.196,"Oh, so it's an objective test you're talking about?"
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,1866.196,1873.85,"--Your Honor, I would want this Court to approve the objective standard which was applied in this case--"
1991.91-126,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1873.85,1874.302,All right.
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,1874.302,1878.754,"--by the district court and approved by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, but I would also state--"
1991.91-126,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1878.754,1881.039,But not just a subjective good faith test.
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,1881.039,1881.889,"--No, Your Honor."
1991.91-126,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1881.889,1882.472,Okay.
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,1882.939,1930.287,"There are reasons why the objective case, and that contrary to what the general argument of counsel for the petitioner seems to be that the extension of any immunity... and this is said in his brief... the extension of any immunity under these circumstances is going to make it practically impossible for there ever to be a recovery against private party defendants, and Your Honor, for instance, in the case which is before the Court, Mr. Cole and Mr. Robbins were granted the extension of immunity by the district court, approved by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, as to the actions which were taken up to the district court judge's April opinion which said that the statute in question is unconstitutional."
1991.91-126,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1975.148,1976.948,That's a new cause of action?
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,1976.948,1978.933,"--No, Your Honor."
1991.91-126,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1982.469,1996.062,"I mean, when he fails to obey a ruling of the district court that was made in this 1983 suit, I assume you say that's a new and independent violation for which there must be some other 1983 action--"
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,1996.062,1996.912,"--No, Your Honor."
1991.91-126,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1996.912,1997.995,--or was this just a contempt of court?
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,1997.995,1998.681,"No, Your Honor."
1991.91-126,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2143.825,2155.799,"But one of the people here for whom you're seeking immunity is a lawyer, I gather, and that person would certainly have law training, one assumes."
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,2155.799,2191.406,"That's right, Your Honor, and in Harlow v. Fitzgerald in the majority opinion when it's discussing the objective standard which would be applied, that this Court says that we're going to look at it as whether or not a reasonable person would know that the action taken would be a clear violation of the constitutional rights of the defendant, and further on in that opinion it clarifies... the opinion is clarified where the Court says we're going to look at the reasonable Government official."
1991.91-126,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2220.325,2237.835,"Mr. McNamara, as I recollect, one reason we have adopted the objective standard for official immunity, which I as recollect was not the common law approach, was that officials are subject to suit all the time."
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,2258.914,2282.197,"Obviously, even the Citibank example that I gave is not going to have the potential exposure that the public officer would, but it seems to me that there's an important public policy in encouraging people such as Mr. Cole and Mr. Robbins to utilize procedures that are presumptively valid at the time they use them."
1991.91-126,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2282.197,2291.386,"Well, but sure there is, but we could take account of that by giving a good faith immunity... subjective good faith immunity, not just the objective standard."
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,2291.386,2334.047,"Your Honor, and in this case, that the issue which petitioner raised in the brief was the question of whether or not there should be an extension of immunity, and the petitioner did not argue some alternative to the objective standard of immunity which was applied by the Fifth Circuit and by the district court, and we would say under these circumstances, since there happened to have been in the case before the Court extensive discovery, this is not a situation coming before the Court where there were simply pleadings and where my clients moved for summary judgment on the basis of Harlow Fitzgerald immunity."
1991.91-126,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2374.79,2390.983,Do you think this defendant who is a lawyer should have been aware of any decisions in this Court that might raise a question about the validity of the replevin statute in Mississippi?
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,2390.983,2409.297,"--Your Honor, I would rely upon what the district judge stated, and that is that at the time of the execution or use of the statute by John Robbins, that there was not complete agreement about the law."
1991.91-126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2476.989,2480.642,May I ask you one question?
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,2490.831,2496.652,"I'm not, Your Honor, and Mr. Waide erroneously stated that I cited it."
1991.91-126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2496.652,2499.287,I didn't see it cited in anybody's brief.
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,2499.287,2503.389,"I don't believe that I did, and I checked my table of contents to see if I'd just forgotten it."
1991.91-126,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2544.883,2548.287,"How about the damage to the cattle, if there was some?"
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,2548.287,2549.47,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-126,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2549.47,2550.737,"Yes, what?"
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,2550.737,2553.339,The damages for the--
1991.91-126,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2553.339,2558.374,Mental suffering of the cattle.
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,2558.374,2559.243,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1991.91-126,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2566.563,2567.729,Even Brahmas.
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,2567.729,2583.489,"Your Honor, Mr. Waide knows a lot more about Brahmas than I do, but those damages would be available if there had been a decrease in the market value of those cattle as a result of the change in their behavior, then that could be recovered under Mississippi law."
1991.91-126,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2583.489,2604.236,"Do you concede that under Lugar against Edmondson Oil there can be a cause of action under section 1983 against a private defendant for use of a statute, State statute that is later determined to be unconstitutional?"
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,2604.236,2615.794,"Certainly, Your Honor, no question about that, and what we say is... we do not challenge that point."
1991.91-126,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2656.121,2667.345,"Mr. McNamara, when you said that there would be a remedy under Mississippi law for the suing out of a wrongful attachment, what do you mean by the suing out of a wrongful attachment?"
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,2671.546,2726.633,"No, Your Honor, in the joint appendix which was submitted where Judge Barbour, the district judge in this case, was citing to circuit court Judge Jerry Yeager's opinion, after dismissing the attachment that Judge Yeager said that Mr. Wyatt would be able to recover damages for wrongful attachment, that in the initial suit in circuit court is that Judge Yeager said the replevin statute was not what should have been utilized because these gentlemen were partners and they should not have resorted to the replevin statute, so my understanding of the record is that Judge Yeager was prepared to award some damages but it wasn't all the damages Mr. Wyatt felt that he was entitled."
1991.91-126,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2726.633,2732.454,"Not on the basis that the replevin statute was unconstitutional, but that it didn't cover that particular situation."
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,2732.454,2733.437,"Right, Your Honor."
1991.91-126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2758.771,2766.692,Let me ask another case about Mississippi authorities.
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,2775.179,2777.881,"Your Honor, I believe that is the earlier edition."
1991.91-126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2777.881,2780.6,You're not--
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,2780.6,2782.885,"I don't know, Your Honor."
1991.91-126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2797.211,2799.263,--Where is that cited again?
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,2799.263,2805.567,It was in the brief of respondents in opposition to the petition for certiorari at page 3.
1991.91-126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2805.567,2807.433,What did it hold?
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,2807.433,2820.243,"Your Honor, the supreme court of Mississippi was examining the application of good faith immunity to private defendants under color of State law."
1991.91-126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2820.243,2822.493,That's the case we talked about earlier.
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,2822.493,2823.093,"That's right, Your Honor."
1991.91-126,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2823.093,2823.978,I see.
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,2827.813,2828.347,"No, Your Honor, I was not."
1991.91-126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3028.628,3042.804,Had the Mitchell case and Georgia Finishing and Quintus and Snyerback been decided at the time that this replevin was instituted?
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,3042.804,3046.339,"Oh, yes, Your Honor, they had, all of those had been."
1991.91-126,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3046.339,3053.528,And you think that they don't make it pretty clear that a prejudgment hearing is necessary?
1991.91-126,1,32058,joseph_l_mcnamara,,3053.528,3105.711,"No, Your Honor, because the Mississippi replevin statute says... or provides for a person to be able to come in and challenge the taking of the property, and I believe it gives it a hearing within 3 days to seek to set aside the writ of replevin, and it would seem at least under what this Court said in the Mitchell case that there were sufficient constitutional safeguards, but the important issue perhaps for the purposes of this case is in judging the conduct of the defendants under the objective reasonable standard, that the trial court said that objectively it could be determined that the statute was not one which was clearly unconstitutional at the time."
1991.91-126,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3217.301,3219.419,"Thank you, Mr. McNamara."
