1992.91-1826,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.36,"We'll hear argument next in number 91-1826, William P. Barr, Attorney General, v. Catholic Social Services."
1992.91-1826,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,24.657,28.579,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1826,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,170.084,185.245,"Well, now did the... did INS, in your view, have authority to determine that the regulations were invalid in a... in an ordinary proceeding brought by an alien?"
1992.91-1826,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,185.245,186.176,--No.
1992.91-1826,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,188.816,189.417,Right.
1992.91-1826,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,189.417,205.099,"And so if an alien had filed an application for relief, and many aliens in this situation did, the application would have been denied and undoubtedly the denial would have been affirmed by the legalization appeals unit if the regulation remained valid at the time the appeal was taken."
1992.91-1826,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,243.414,249.806,"Well, didn't we have a virtually identical provision before us in McNary against the Haitian refugees?"
1992.91-1826,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,249.806,258.783,"Yes, in... in... in the relevant respects we believe the jurisdictional provisions in McNary were the same as these, and the difference is that this case involves a different type of claim."
1992.91-1826,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,323.306,334.973,"Well, I guess the operative language in section 1255 (a)(f) is a determination respecting an application."
1992.91-1826,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,334.973,335.392,"Yes, ma'am."
1992.91-1826,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,335.392,344.29,"And it certainly is arguable, anyway, that that means a determination that the INS itself could make."
1992.91-1826,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,344.29,353.694,"That's correct, and in our view the determination in this... the determination in this case is the regulation which INS made."
1992.91-1826,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,384.846,399.816,"Mr. Mann, is there a... is there a different problem with impossibility as a result of the INS's practice... I think it was called front desking, that is to say simply not accepting the applications of those that they were satisfied under the regs would fail?"
1992.91-1826,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,414.475,419.088,"Now that goes to the second question, the remedial question, but--"
1992.91-1826,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,419.088,420.039,It does go to that.
1992.91-1826,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,420.039,420.54,--Yes.
1992.91-1826,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,420.54,429.015,Doesn't it also go to the question of the appropriateness of applying McNary here on... in effect on an impossibility of review theory otherwise?
1992.91-1826,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,429.015,431.877,"No, we don't really think it does."
1992.91-1826,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,481.34,505.695,"With respect to the possible application or, in your view, extension of McNary, in McNary what if the... what if the... what if the action in this case had been filed after the 1-year period began and the period... and the practice of front desking was known and, in fact, was... was pleaded, would that affect the appropriateness of a McNary kind of jurisdictional determination?"
1992.91-1826,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,505.695,533.825,"--Well if you're... if you're filing a suit challenging INS's practices of accepting applications... for example, if the complaint isn't that INS has an improper regulation for determining whether you are eligible for relief, but instead that INS... INS officers are refusing to accept applications, it seems to me that that is a... that is a type of claim that arguably might be covered by McNary, but that's not the claim that's before the Court in this case."
1992.91-1826,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,581.716,582.187,Okay.
1992.91-1826,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,582.187,591.742,"And it's our view that if you walk into INS's offices and you attempt to apply, it's one thing if they say we don't think you're going to get relief and so you shouldn't waste the money."
1992.91-1826,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,678.498,682.181,"Mr. Mann, could I just ask one... the statute's kind of long and I forget one point in it."
1992.91-1826,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,698.1,701.223,"--It does not expressly say that, but it's our view--"
1992.91-1826,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,701.223,702.295,It's a negative application.
1992.91-1826,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,702.295,707.878,"--That the only... the only basis that INS would... all of the people in the class are, by definition, people who are illegally here."
1992.91-1826,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,707.878,715.164,There's no statutory... at least no express statutory prohibition against the attorney general granting an extension of time.
1992.91-1826,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,715.164,718.243,I don't... I don't think the attorney general views it that way.
1992.91-1826,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,754.041,755.291,"Well, where does he get the authority to do that?"
1992.91-1826,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,755.291,763.406,"--Because the statute requires a person to apply, and the attorney general has interpreted the word apply to include a person who comes into the office and attempts--"
1992.91-1826,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,763.406,774.465,"But you think he has no statutory authority to simply say we will... we will... because our offices are crowded and overloaded and everything, we will grant a 30-day grace period or something like that."
1992.91-1826,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,774.465,776.266,--I don't think the attorney general would have had the authority to do that.
1992.91-1826,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,777.147,779.328,"But there's no statutory prohibition against that, though."
1992.91-1826,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,779.328,782.219,--There's no express statutory prohibition on that.
1992.91-1826,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,782.219,794.018,"Mr. Mann, can you tell me if the provisions of the regulations that are under challenge here could have been adopted, instead of by regulation, through adjudication?"
1992.91-1826,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,823.677,826.178,"Yes, we think he could have."
1992.91-1826,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,852.825,853.246,Right.
1992.91-1826,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,875.252,881.774,I believe that respondents would probably take the same position even if this was adopted by a legalization appeals unit decision.
1992.91-1826,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,881.774,882.946,Is that right?
1992.91-1826,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,887.06,899.516,"I believe that their view is the only thing the statute does not cover is if an individual... particular individual files an application and it is denied, on I'm not sure what particular basis."
1992.91-1826,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,904.851,907.062,It's hard to think of something that would.
1992.91-1826,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,907.062,919.091,"--Well, in most cases I believe that's true because the requirements for relief are fairly generalized; you have to be here since 1982 unlawfully and you have to have not left since 1986."
1992.91-1826,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1024.349,1037.678,"Well, Mr. Mann, I guess we said in Irwin that at least there is a rebuttable presumption that statutory time limits incorporate principles of equitable tolling."
1992.91-1826,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1037.678,1040.419,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, that's correct."
1992.91-1826,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1054.958,1058.962,"Well, do you think this is a time limit that could be equitably tolled?"
1992.91-1826,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1058.962,1065.166,"--In our view this is not the type of time limit that this Court was talking about in Irwin, and I'd like to address that for a moment."
1992.91-1826,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1362.59,1368.795,Certainly the proposed regulations would indicate as much.
1992.91-1826,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1368.795,1370.275,I... I--
1992.91-1826,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1370.275,1371.927,They're a little counterintuitive.
1992.91-1826,0,39975,ronald_j_mann,,1384.355,1393.639,"--Well, actually, if you compare that provision of the... of IRCA with a corollary provision about exclusion, I think the regulation actually comes pretty close to... to being correct."
1992.91-1826,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1518.923,1521.294,"Very well, Mr. Mann."
1992.91-1826,1,38533,ralph_s_abascal,,1523.614,1528.74,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-1826,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1553.734,1557.347,Do you think the Government concedes that they were invalid?
1992.91-1826,1,38533,ralph_s_abascal,,1560.129,1574.298,The argument that was being made earlier by Mr. Mann attempting to justify at least the LULAC regulation suggests that they have an argument to make to justify that regulation.
1992.91-1826,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1576.788,1578.531,"Well, I know, but they don't concede the invalidity."
1992.91-1826,1,38533,ralph_s_abascal,,1578.531,1579.711,No.
1992.91-1826,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1580.381,1581.233,That is all I wanted to know.
1992.91-1826,1,38533,ralph_s_abascal,,1581.233,1581.793,--No.
1992.91-1826,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1619.738,1620.339,Excuse me.
1992.91-1826,1,38533,ralph_s_abascal,,1623.09,1623.949,"--No, no."
1992.91-1826,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1629.044,1631.456,And now decided that they were wrong.
1992.91-1826,1,38533,ralph_s_abascal,,1631.456,1631.907,--Yes.
1992.91-1826,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1856.505,1865.682,"Well, Mr. Abascal, I guess there is the difference here that whether the regulations are valid or not presents just a question of law--"
1992.91-1826,1,38533,ralph_s_abascal,,1865.682,1867.242,Yes.
1992.91-1826,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1867.242,1878.591,"--that at some level a court, a district court or a court of appeals, could address and decide without the necessity of a factual record of some kind."
1992.91-1826,1,38533,ralph_s_abascal,,1878.591,1884.255,"But there were... there were important, if you will, corollary issues in this case."
1992.91-1826,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,3359.082,3363.416,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.91-1826,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3461.293,3466.196,"Well, what's your response to his definition of discouragee?"
1992.91-1826,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,3469.408,3483.276,"Well, for one thing, because I think that title VII is violated by a discriminatory practice that the... is violated by discriminatory practice that poses a considerable headwind to blacks getting employment."
1992.91-1826,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3483.276,3489.37,But this is a discriminatory practic that imposed considerable headwinds to these people applying for the relief under the statute.
1992.91-1826,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,3490.121,3499.418,"But I don't believe... I don't believe that title VII contains a provision saying... that says that you have to apply for a job in order to have standing under the act, and that if you don't courts cannot... have no jurisdiction over the case."
1992.91-1826,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3499.418,3499.898,But neither does this statute.
1992.91-1826,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,3499.898,3500.559,Excuse me?
1992.91-1826,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3500.559,3501.739,Neither does this statute.
1992.91-1826,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,3501.739,3502.27,Well--
1992.91-1826,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3502.27,3506.401,"It specifies a period in which you may apply, but it doesn't have the other language in it either."
1992.91-1826,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,3506.401,3508.334,--But the only people--
1992.91-1826,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3508.334,3515.457,"It's a fair reading that you must, because... but it's also a fair reading that if you're going to seek relief for being denied a job, you ought to apply for the job."
1992.91-1826,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,3518.458,3523.634,--I think that's quite a different case involving title VII as a remedial statute directed at private employers.
1992.91-1826,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3523.634,3525.063,Is this a remedial statute?
1992.91-1826,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,3525.063,3536.792,"This is a statute giving a very important immigration benefit to private individuals from the Government, and in light of the customary requirements that people apply for relief from the Government--"
1992.91-1826,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3536.792,3542.004,"What if you did have a sign up that... on the site that said don't apply unless such and such, apply, and then they didn't apply."
1992.91-1826,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,3546.228,3554.423,"--I think if the... if the sign said we will not accept applications from people who are in the following fact situations, period, I believe that would be different."
1992.91-1826,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3555.835,3557.735,Then you'd apply the same rule as in title VII.
1992.91-1826,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,3557.735,3558.857,--No.
1992.91-1826,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3569.503,3570.424,They would or would not have applied?
1992.91-1826,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,3570.424,3571.874,--They would have applied.
1992.91-1826,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3571.874,3572.354,Okay.
1992.91-1826,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,3572.354,3581.631,"But what... what's going on in this case is, if you look at the legalization manual and last... we've lodged with the Court the entire part of the legalization manual that's at issue here."
1992.91-1826,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3610.769,3615.214,And I take it there's no finding that this policy was violated.
1992.91-1826,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,3615.214,3617.475,There is no finding--
1992.91-1826,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3617.475,3621.338,I take it there's no finding that applicants were... that applications were rejected.
1992.91-1826,2,39975,ronald_j_mann,,3621.338,3622.708,--There is no finding that this policy was violated.
1992.91-1826,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3695.166,3696.576,"Thank you, Mr. Mann."
