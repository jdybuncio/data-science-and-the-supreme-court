1982.81-1794,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.072,We'll hear arguments next in Jones against Barnes.
1982.81-1794,0,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,66.455,72.26,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1794,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,150.642,154.061,May I ask a preliminary question?
1982.81-1794,0,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,188.667,213.4,"Well, the question... whether a particular question is non frivolous, being a question of law, it seems to me, is necessarily before this Court and the predicate for determining whether the rule stated by the Second Circuit is... was appropriately announced in this case."
1982.81-1794,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,235.148,239.95,Should we just assume that requests were made and get on with the other issues?
1982.81-1794,0,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,239.95,241.519,"Yes, except for this point."
1982.81-1794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,262.565,269.988,"But, nevertheless, they predicated their bottom line on the grounds that in their understanding there had been a request?"
1982.81-1794,0,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,269.988,270.538,"Well, they found--"
1982.81-1794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,270.538,273.29,"As a matter of fact, an insistence."
1982.81-1794,0,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,273.29,280.194,"--Well, they characterized what had happened as a request and as an insistence, that is correct."
1982.81-1794,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,288.231,294.602,"Well, since so much seems to turn on this, Miss Underwood, could you briefly summarize what, in fact, did happen?"
1982.81-1794,0,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,294.602,295.204,Yes.
1982.81-1794,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,607.365,609.548,"Miss Underwood, can I ask you a question?"
1982.81-1794,0,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,633.43,635.099,"Yes, I think there might well be."
1982.81-1794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,674.321,692.633,"Do you think if a lawyer refuses to appeal on an issue that the client insists on would ever be a ground for complaining against him on ethical grounds, not on competency grounds, just on the basis that the client should be in control of such decisions rather than the lawyer?"
1982.81-1794,0,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,692.633,693.316,It might well be.
1982.81-1794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,759.927,760.96,"Right, right, right."
1982.81-1794,0,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,760.96,764.562,--The don't say who should make the final decision.
1982.81-1794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,764.562,768.014,It is the client who says... What does the Code say?
1982.81-1794,0,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,768.014,775.853,The Code doesn't specifically describe the situation of selection of issues.
1982.81-1794,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,834.141,839.359,Did you cite the standards of the ABA on the defense counsel's functions in your brief?
1982.81-1794,0,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,840.311,849.484,I believe they are cited in a footnote about those standards and... They are not quoted.
1982.81-1794,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,849.484,855.57,"There is very little left to the client as compared to the lawyer under those standards, is that not so?"
1982.81-1794,0,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,866.293,868.362,Whether he will or will not appeal.
1982.81-1794,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,868.362,869.73,"No, I am talking about the trial."
1982.81-1794,0,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,869.73,871.38,"Yes, that is correct."
1982.81-1794,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,880.936,882.472,Thank you.
1982.81-1794,0,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,921.113,938.89,"Well, I would say that in the ordinary case that would constitute a waiver; that is that reasonable strategic judgments of a lawyer do, in fact, bind the client and they bind him not only on the direct appeal but also for the purposes of making the procedural waiver."
1982.81-1794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,964.523,978.032,"But, even if the waiver surmounted... no waiver on your argument, the petitioner's habeas corpus would be dismissed."
1982.81-1794,0,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,980.634,982.451,"In this case, there was no constitutional violation."
1982.81-1794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,988.388,989.407,Yes.
1982.81-1794,0,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,989.407,991.859,--petition raising one of the claims.
1982.81-1794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,996.227,1011.837,"Well, I know, but suppose it was and the lawyer didn't raise it and you say there would be no waiver, but you would say there would be no violation of constitutional right, wouldn't you?"
1982.81-1794,0,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,1011.837,1012.237,I would say--
1982.81-1794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1012.237,1030.048,"If the lawyer has... If on direct appeal it is ruled that the lawyer cannot be faulted for omitting the claim, do you think there is still recourse to federal habeas?"
1982.81-1794,0,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,1030.048,1030.484,"--In the ordinary case, no."
1982.81-1794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1036.002,1056.3,"Say there is no forfeiture, they reach the merits, and the question was is this conviction constitutionally invalid because a lawyer failed to raise a colorable constitutional claim that he chose for strategic purposes not to raise."
1982.81-1794,0,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,1056.3,1056.967,--I would say there is no constitutional error.
1982.81-1794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1056.967,1058.667,"There never would be, would there?"
1982.81-1794,0,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,1117.423,1117.74,Yes.
1982.81-1794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1120.042,1120.925,That is the way I understood it too.
1982.81-1794,0,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,1120.925,1126.696,And my argument would be that in the ordinary case that ought to bar federal habeas relief because--
1982.81-1794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1126.696,1127.981,I understand your answer.
1982.81-1794,0,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,1135.635,1139.455,--How about the merits of what?
1982.81-1794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1139.455,1141.971,You say ordinarily that would be a bar?
1982.81-1794,0,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,1141.971,1143.24,Ordinarily that would be a bar.
1982.81-1794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1156.731,1159.414,"And, if there was cause for avoiding the procedural bar--"
1982.81-1794,0,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,1159.414,1163.568,Then the federal habeas court should reach the merits.
1982.81-1794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1163.568,1170.388,--And rule on the merits of the constitutional issue he is presenting?
1982.81-1794,0,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,1170.388,1176.042,"Well, in that case it would probably be the case if there was no state exhaustion, if there was not exhaustion of state remedies."
1982.81-1794,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1203.743,1204.593,Sure.
1982.81-1794,0,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,1208.53,1223.623,The Second Circuit justified its rule in part as unnecessary method of providing equality to indigent defendants.
1982.81-1794,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1531.303,1541.861,Mrs. Riesel?
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,1541.861,1545.397,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1589.776,1598.298,"But, the consequence of that, you claim, and the Court of Appeals seems to have said, is that there is ineffective assistance."
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,1598.298,1600.734,"--No, Your Honor, that is not our claim."
1982.81-1794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1600.734,1604.702,Do you concede it was effective assistance?
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,1604.702,1613.291,"There was no assistance, Your Honor, on the issues that Barnes urged upon his counsel."
1982.81-1794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1614.774,1621.98,"Well, don't you think we should be concerned with whether or not there is or is not a claim of effective assistance of counsel?"
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,1621.98,1623.23,"--Not in this case, Your Honor."
1982.81-1794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1623.23,1625.865,"Isn't that the ultimate issue, the ultimate question?"
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,1625.865,1627.384,"No, Your Honor, it is not."
1982.81-1794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1634.455,1642.727,"To put it another way, the question is who is going to try the case, is that not perhaps a corollary statement of the issue?"
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,1642.727,1645.013,"Well, Your Honor, this case does not deal with trials."
1982.81-1794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1646.513,1648.215,You are trying the case here.
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,1648.215,1657.236,"Your Honor is correct that a question in this case is who is the master, if you will, of the proceeding."
1982.81-1794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1712.471,1714.657,"Well, you are saying on direct appeal, Counsel."
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,1723.263,1734.736,"Your Honor, the issue in this case is whether a lawyer on direct appeal from a criminal conviction can decline to raise a non frivolous issue urged by his client?"
1982.81-1794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1734.736,1743.759,Do you think that you were required... that you are required here to raise every non frivolous issue that your client wants whether you think it makes any sense or not?
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,1743.759,1747.644,Do you mean in a collateral proceeding?
1982.81-1794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1747.644,1751.282,Here in this Court today in your brief.
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,1751.282,1759.869,I think the questions of access and the questions of right to counsel as decided by this Court may change the complexion.
1982.81-1794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1767.042,1772.111,Even if you thought it would weaken the ultimate... the total presentation in the case to this Court?
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,1772.111,1781.051,"My responsibility to my client, Your Honor, would be to explain that view to him and explain the reasons why I had reached that conclusion."
1982.81-1794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1791.173,1794.459,You would put it in... You would feel required to put it in the brief?
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,1794.459,1795.325,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1795.325,1814.372,"Then when you came here to argue it as you have today, and your client says, now, I want you to be very sure you argue every one of these points, even the ones you didn't think make any sense, obligation on your part in these terms to orally argue those points?"
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,1814.372,1821.009,"Well, of course, the give and take of an oral argument sometimes precludes the best intentions of counsel, but I think advocating--"
1982.81-1794,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1821.009,1822.561,Touche.
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,1822.561,1825.996,--the issue would certainly be my intention.
1982.81-1794,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1828.698,1831.067,The most you could say if you were allowed to?
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,1831.067,1831.733,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1834.685,1846.843,"But, you might, you might in doing that neglect oral argument on points that you consider truly important and crucial, is that not so?"
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,1846.843,1875.094,"--That is true, Your Honor, and that too I would explain to my client and I would urge him... as I might add parenthetically Mr. Melinger did not urge Barnes here... that we should relinquish that, but if understanding my arguments and the reasons for my conclusions he determined that he wanted... that the issue was important to him and the issue were a non frivolous one, I would go forward with it."
1982.81-1794,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1875.094,1886.135,How would you determine what is non frivolous by some objective standard or what counsel deems it to be as you suggested in your brief?
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,1886.135,1899.894,"Well, Your Honor, this Court in Anders sat down a requirement for making... for counsel initially making that determination and for the courts making the determination of what is non frivolous."
1982.81-1794,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1899.894,1901.913,"Well, Anders didn't tell you how to go about it."
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,1901.913,1905.031,"No, sir, it does not give you a handbook."
1982.81-1794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1931.931,1936.15,Now you have changed your terms from non frivolous to legitimate.
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,1936.15,1939.502,"I did not mean to change the sense of it, Your Honor."
1982.81-1794,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1942.387,1949.31,"If it is a legitimate claim, you shouldn't need to be... The lawyer shouldn't need to be urged by the client to present them."
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,1949.31,1952.945,"I meant to use the terms interchangeably, Your Honor."
1982.81-1794,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1955.88,1963.718,"Mrs. Riesel, your client did have a brief submitted on his behalf to the state appellate court, did he not?"
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,1963.718,1965.486,"By counsel, yes, he did, Your Honor."
1982.81-1794,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1965.486,1974.775,"So, are you claiming that counsel's performance on the written part of the appellate presentation of briefing fell short of constitutional standard?"
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,1974.775,1983.297,"No, Your Honor, we are not asserting that the brief that assigned counsel filed was an incompetent brief."
1982.81-1794,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1983.297,1993.42,"But, supposing there had been no oral argument, that the case had simply been submitted on the basis of your client's pro se brief and the counsel's brief."
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,1998.374,1999.659,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1982.81-1794,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1999.659,2004.128,Because the lawyer wouldn't sign his name to the brief prepared by your client?
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,2004.128,2014.066,"No, it is not just the refusal to sign his name to the brief, Your Honor, but to assist the client, Mr. Barnes, in the presentation of the issues."
1982.81-1794,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2035.249,2038.301,Counsel would have had to retool the pro se brief to meet these standards?
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,2038.301,2042.519,Exactly that.
1982.81-1794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2042.519,2052.125,"Am I correct that the constitutional provision on which you have relied is not the 6th Amendment, not the Due Process Clause and not the Equal Protection Clause, but just the right of access cases?"
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,2052.125,2060.129,"Well, we rely on the right of access cases and those, in turn, Your Honor, I believe rely on the due process and equal protection."
1982.81-1794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2060.129,2067.301,"But, in those cases, the prisoner access to the courts, for example, usually pro se submissions have been adequate."
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,2071.687,2077.59,"Well, Your Honor, the access cases are not limited only to the prisoner cases."
1982.81-1794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2106.093,2109.978,"If it doesn't equate, then it is an equal protection matter, but there is access--"
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,2109.978,2136.212,"--No, Your Honor, I think that when the Petitioner must proceed pro se, his ability to frame his issues and to present them effectively and fairly to the court is so imputed as to infringe on his access right, particularly when standing side by side with him is his lawyer, whose refusal to raise the issue communicates to the court--"
1982.81-1794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2136.212,2138.228,--But that goes to the persuasive character of the presentation.
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,2148.853,2150.32,"--No, Your Honor--"
1982.81-1794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2150.32,2159.558,"I do not know of any access case that said there had been a denial of access when the message gets through, even though it may be poorly written and pro se and all the rest."
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,2167.497,2170.283,"--Well, Your Honor, I beg to disagree."
1982.81-1794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2187.228,2189.43,"Which case, do you think, is your strongest access case?"
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,2189.43,2193.399,"I think Bounds is very helpful to us, Your Honor."
1982.81-1794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2193.399,2194.282,Which case?
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,2194.282,2204.988,"Bounds against Smith, which is a prisoner's case, Your Honor."
1982.81-1794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2204.988,2217.045,"You use the term effective, although earlier you disclaimed any thoughts of lack of effective assistance of counsel here."
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,2239.994,2243.613,"I do not think so, Your Honor."
1982.81-1794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2251.267,2269.244,"Well, but your point of your argument that you were making was that the counsel had an obligation to take this pro se brief and cast the pro se's points in terms that a lawyer would use with the skill of the advocate, I think you have said."
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,2276.767,2282.238,"--I do not think so, Your Honor, because here counsel refused to do anything."
1982.81-1794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2282.238,2290.758,"What if he thought one of them was a dishonorable, unethical point, do you think he had an obligation to raise it any way?"
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,2290.758,2292.194,"But that is not this case, Your Honor."
1982.81-1794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2292.577,2296.212,"No, I said, what if, hypothetically?"
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,2296.212,2308.603,"--If, for example, counsel were to determine if the issue were a frivolous one, the Second Circuit makes clear that counsel does not have an obligation in that instance to raise the issue."
1982.81-1794,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2359.786,2361.821,May I back up minute to the 6th Amendment?
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,2367.54,2368.642,--Your Honor--
1982.81-1794,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2368.642,2369.792,You are abandoning it?
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,2369.792,2371.943,"--No, I am not abandoning it."
1982.81-1794,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2384.584,2389.388,"Well, you say in your brief, you quote from Justice Shaefer,"
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,2405.931,2416.852,--We are relying on the need for counsel to enable or protect the defendant's access to the court.
1982.81-1794,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2416.852,2429.094,"My only point is that you object to the counsel in this case abandoning a point, and you are abandoning a point here."
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,2432.748,2438.652,"Well, Your Honor, I did not mean, nor do I intend to abandon the point--"
1982.81-1794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2438.652,2444.722,"Of course, I suppose we must be curious to know whether your client wanted you to make that point."
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,2450.108,2463.45,"--Given the critical importance of appellate issue selection, the client must have the right, should he choose to exercise it, to participate in the appellate process."
1982.81-1794,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2583.979,2595.337,Would you still be here if your client had not requested the inclusion of these issues on appeal.
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,2619.402,2621.305,"No, Your Honor, I would not."
1982.81-1794,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2621.305,2623.411,Why wouldn't you?
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,2623.411,2640.452,Because I think that in the situation where... and this is the most frequent situation in my experience... where a client defers to his lawyer's judgment and--
1982.81-1794,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2640.452,2642.099,"Well, he defers by silence."
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,2656.425,2669.316,"--That may be true, Your Honor, but by his conduct, he has communicated a confidence in his lawyer in his willingness to permit his lawyer to make these decisions."
1982.81-1794,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2685.344,2702.238,"Well, doesn't the lawyer, then, have a duty if he thinks of four or five non frivolous issues that he thinks are not quite strong enough to raise, should he not tell the client about the non frivolous issues he has decided not to raise so the client can make a meaningful decision as whether to let him go ahead that way?"
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,2702.238,2706.539,The court below did not find that counsel had that duty.
1982.81-1794,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2753.503,2761.859,"In fact, didn't counsel here raise six points that were not covered or raised by the Defendant?"
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,2767.327,2778.866,"He raised a total, or the prospect of a total of seven, Justice Blackmun, and then ultimately raised three of the seven."
1982.81-1794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2778.866,2799.612,"--Now, referring back to my inquiries about whether you were or were not raising effective assistance of counsel, I note that while it is very flattering to Judge Bazelon and to Judge Kaufman and to me to have you cite our articles, you have devoted about four pages and they all deal with effective assistance of counsel."
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,2799.612,2823.043,"Well, Your Honor, that was in response to the premise of the Petitioner's argument, namely, that the lawyer should be and must be in control of the proceedings because he is the only competent representative of the appellant."
1982.81-1794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2945.221,2956.312,"In your view, Mrs. Riesel, should the clients rather than the lawyer make the decision on whether to cross examine or not to cross examine an adverse witness?"
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,2956.312,2959.48,"--Your Honor, of course, that deals with a trial situation--"
1982.81-1794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2959.48,2961.465,"Well, it is important."
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,2961.465,2967.352,"--And, that as I have indicated, we believe is quite distinct from the appellate situation."
1982.81-1794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2971.088,2989.883,"You exchange it on appeal, at trial... the trial counsel having been replaced on appeal... the trial counsel declines to cross examine a government witness explaining to his client that it would be disastrous to cross examine in his professional judgment."
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,3009.613,3016.267,"--I think in answer to your question, it depends on the exigencies of the trial situation."
1982.81-1794,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3038.465,3059.879,"Could I ask you if the Second Circuit had arrived at this point it arrived at and said that counsel should have raised this on request, but then went on and said that this requires us to look at the ground, we find the ground, although non frivolous, was a loser."
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,3068.985,3085.279,"Your Honor, it is our view that the failure or the refusal to raise a non frivolous issue is sufficient to grant relief, relief being a new appeal."
1982.81-1794,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3085.279,3092.016,"I know it is sufficient, but what if the Court of Appeals had went on and said, well this is a federal habeas proceeding."
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,3116.149,3127.372,"Of course, the analysis at that juncture would not be whether the issues appellate counsel did not raise in the state court were of constitutional dimension."
1982.81-1794,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3138.58,3142.632,Which they do all the time any way on the other side of the case.
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,3153.257,3160.761,"Surely, Your Honor, but in simple answer to your question, we would be here because we think that would be the wrong standard."
1982.81-1794,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3160.761,3165.397,"So, the Chief Justice's question must still stand, then."
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,3172.901,3174.437,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1794,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3174.437,3176.789,I do not understand what it is.
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,3181.857,3192.649,It is an access case because the question is whether the appellate lawyer denied his client access on direct appeal.
1982.81-1794,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3192.649,3193.749,He did not deny anything.
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,3199.719,3202.421,"But, he did not want to proceed pro se, Your Honor."
1982.81-1794,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3204.939,3206.808,"I know, but counsel said no."
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,3215.33,3216.23,The answer--
1982.81-1794,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3216.23,3218.116,Was it a constitutional performance?
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,3218.116,3220.449,"--No, it was an unconstitutional performance."
1982.81-1794,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3220.449,3221.834,"But, not because of competence?"
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,3221.834,3226.652,"No, because of a denial of access."
1982.81-1794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3226.652,3229.921,Competent but unconstitutional?
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,3229.921,3249.233,The question of competence does not pertain to this issue because counsel failed or refused to present the issue.
1982.81-1794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3249.233,3252.784,Sort of a malpractice claim?
1982.81-1794,1,41917,sheila_ginsberg_riesel,,3252.784,3262.14,"Perhaps, but not providing sufficient relief to this defendant."
1982.81-1794,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3323.379,3325.146,Do you have anything further Miss Underwood?
1982.81-1794,2,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,3325.146,3328.998,"A few brief points, if I may."
1982.81-1794,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3384.269,3393.975,"So, your position would be the same, though, wouldn't it, if the client himself had not filed a letter with the appellate court?"
1982.81-1794,2,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,3393.975,3394.708,Yes it would.
1982.81-1794,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3394.708,3396.26,That makes no difference to your argument?
1982.81-1794,2,36823,miss_barbara_d_underwood,,3396.26,3398.61,That is correct.
1982.81-1794,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3398.61,3401.412,"Thank you, counsel."
