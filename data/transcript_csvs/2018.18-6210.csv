2018.18-6210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.96,"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-6210, Mitchell versus Wisconsin. Mr. Hinkel."
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,6.96,33.68,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The State advances a bold and novel proposition here, that it can excuse itself from the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement simply by enacting a statute saying that some of its -- that its citizens have consented to a search. Here, that search is a blood draw, but there's no reason that similar statutes couldn't be enacted to authorize all manner of other searches."
2018.18-6210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,58.68,77.6,"Is it -- it doesn't strike me immediately as that horrendous to allow the officers to look, not through the cell phone, but to sort of calls, find out was this person calling somebody or talking to somebody at the time they, you know, ran over somebody else? Is that -- is that so obviously --"
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,77.6,80.04,I don't know that it's --
2018.18-6210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,80.04,83.52,Is that so clearly something that they couldn't do?
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,83.52,89.16,"Well, I don't know that it's more -- that it's an equally intrusive search as opposed to a blood draw."
2018.18-6210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,89.16,89.4,Yeah.
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,89.4,122.32,"What I'm trying to express is that once we accept that a -- the simple existence of a statute can provide consent, then reasonableness doesn't really enter into the picture anymore. A -- a search that's based on consent is reasonable regardless of any other factors. If a police officer comes to my house and says, hey, I'd like to come in and look around, do you mind, and I say yes, it doesn't matter if he has any suspicion. So these are the kinds of situations that we find ourselves in if we permit that -- that a statute can bring about consent."
2018.18-6210,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,122.32,159.32,"How -- how -- how would it be if the statute simply said, if you don't consent -- let's say we have -- we now have a conscious driver -- if you don't consent, then we will immediately revoke your license and, when we try you for driving under the influence, we can tell the jury that you refused to consent to a blood test. Would that statute -- that statute wouldn't have a Fourth Amendment problem, would it?"
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,159.32,166.28,"Under Birchfield, no. That's the whole thing of Birchfield, that the states can impose that sort of condition on the decision to operate."
2018.18-6210,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,166.28,173.56,"What about the unconscious driver, who couldn't hear that notice?"
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,173.56,179.08,"Who is incapable of having that conversation, is that --"
2018.18-6210,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,179.08,193.24,"He's uncapable -- he's incapable of hearing what he's told, but, in the -- in -- in the case of the unconscious driver, could his license be revoked?"
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,193.24,198.68,The Wisconsin statute at issue here doesn't lead to that result.
2018.18-6210,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,225.36,245.64,"Well, we let people give advance consent on any number of issues, including DNR, Do Not Resuscitate, consent forms, and, generally, they come into effect when you're not in a position to revoke. Why isn't this comparable?"
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,245.64,248.8,"That -- I mean, that's certainly true, Justice Sotomayor."
2018.18-6210,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,266.8,281.52,"Do you think Wisconsin could do that? Suppose, at the time you went in to get your driver's license, you had to sign something and it said, I'm -- I'm -- I'm agreeing that if I'm ever found unconscious, you know, I'm giving my consent now."
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,281.52,287.52,"Yes, I think that's a harder question."
2018.18-6210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,340.76,345.48,"Although it's -- it's -- you know, ignorance of the law is no excuse."
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,364.4,365.28,Sure.
2018.18-6210,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,390.28,436.6,"Well, these laws have -- have been labeled implied consent law, but -- implied consent laws, but it's kind of a -- an unusual type of consent, and maybe what they're really about is attaching a condition to the privilege of driving, so the state says you want to drive, this is a very dangerous activity, it causes thousands and thousands of deaths and serious injuries every year, and if you want to engage in this activity, you have to bear certain consequences that are very closely related, reasonably related, to -- to traffic safety. Now, if it's analyzed that way, what would be wrong with that?"
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,436.6,460.08,"I agree with you, Justice Alito, that that is a more sensible way doctrinally to look at this than as consent. What would be wrong with it, some of the things that this Court said in Birchfield. First -- and Birchfield, of course, was applying the exigency exception rather than a reasonable condition, but the analysis is essentially the same. It's a balancing of privacy interests versus government interest in the search."
2018.18-6210,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,503.92,517.76,"Well, it's very -- it's easy to say, well, you can always get a warrant and -- at 2:00 on Christmas morning. You can find -- you know, every state can find a prosecutor and wake up some judge to -- to grant the warrant."
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,573.76,584.84,"To respond to the first part of your question, Justice Alito, of course, the two elements typically of drunk driving are -- are drunkenness and driving. And in -- in this case, the question was whether Mr. Mitchell had driven."
2018.18-6210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,678.16,692.44,"If somebody's there lying down, he's unconscious, smells a little of alcohol perhaps, wouldn't the policeman take him to the hospital? Wouldn't that be the first thing that -- that he'd think of?"
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,692.44,693.64,"Yes, I would certainly hope so."
2018.18-6210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,693.64,693.96,All right.
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,715.6,719.88,"If the officer believes that there might be evidence of a crime in his blood, is that the hypothetical, or --"
2018.18-6210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,719.88,725.12,"I'm saying taking your case, but all the officer knows is somebody's lying here unconscious."
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,725.12,726.08,Uh-huh.
2018.18-6210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,726.08,728.24,"And in your opinion, what's supposed to happen?"
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,728.24,733.88,"In that opinion, I mean, if -- if there's a medical emergency that an officer comes upon, of course, they should make sure that they're --"
2018.18-6210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,733.88,739.36,"No, isn't that always going to be true, I mean, or almost always? He's lying here unconscious."
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,739.36,740.12,Yeah.
2018.18-6210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,741.56,742.72,Take him to the hospital.
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,752.24,753.12,I would agree with that.
2018.18-6210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,753.12,753.28,All right.
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,779.16,784.0,The warrant requirement in the Fourth Amendment typically requires officers to make these sorts of judgments about --
2018.18-6210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,784.0,786.4,"No, I didn't ask that question."
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,790.64,791.52,Uh-huh.
2018.18-6210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,791.52,808.2,-- what am I supposed to do when I get to a car and there's someone there lying unconscious? Other people may or may not be hurt. I have to say that very often in my experience this is a result of drunk driving. I look around.
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,813.88,815.84,"Well, certainly, you're supposed to get the person to the hospital. That's --"
2018.18-6210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,815.84,816.32,Of course.
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,816.32,817.88,It's not our position that you shouldn't.
2018.18-6210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,817.88,818.68,"No, of course."
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,820.12,821.56,"Well, if you have evidence of a --"
2018.18-6210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,821.56,828.48,"No, no, don't say if. I just put the case because I want you to tell me what I'm supposed to do."
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,828.48,829.36,If there's no --
2018.18-6210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,829.36,836.12,"You can make up whatever you want in situations, but just tell me as if I were this officer who wants to know."
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,836.12,841.8,"If there's no indication that a crime has been committed, then there would be no justification for a search."
2018.18-6210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,841.8,845.08,"Well, we have a guy lying on the ground."
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,848.64,853.04,"I would think you would have to have some reason to think that that was due to intoxication, due to an intoxicated drunk."
2018.18-6210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,853.04,857.08,"Some reason? Okay. Now, so I add there's a whiskey bottle."
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,858.08,859.56,That seems like a much clearer case of probable cause.
2018.18-6210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,859.56,859.96,All right.
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,862.36,867.6,"You're supposed to call -- well, you're supposed to arrange, first of all, for medical care."
2018.18-6210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,867.6,867.8,Yeah.
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,867.8,874.92,"And if, again, you believe that there's probable cause, you're supposed to call up the magistrate and say, I have probable cause to believe this person is intoxicated."
2018.18-6210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,874.92,876.56,So you bring him to the hospital?
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,876.56,877.12,Correct.
2018.18-6210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,877.12,882.96,"The intern or the emergency room says, we better take care of him."
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,887.64,888.28,I agree.
2018.18-6210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,888.28,890.96,What does the officer say?
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,890.96,898.68,"Again, I think, if the officer wants access to that -- to that blood as evidence, then he needs to either get a warrant or have the magistrate say --"
2018.18-6210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,898.68,902.44,"Does he say to the intern, don't do it until I can find the -- find the magistrate?"
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,902.44,906.52,"No, there's no reason that there can't be more than one blood draw. It doesn't have to interfere with medical care. And, in fact --"
2018.18-6210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,906.52,906.64,Okay.
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,906.64,914.36,"-- it probably shouldn't. If, in fact, medical care is keeping the officer from -- from pursuing a warrant, that's a textbook case of exigency."
2018.18-6210,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,914.36,914.68,I was going --
2018.18-6210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,914.68,915.04,Hmm.
2018.18-6210,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,915.36,933.12,"-- to ask your adversary this, but maybe you know the answer. I know HIPAA does not provide for the release of those information -- of that information to law enforcement. Does HIPAA also prevent a subpoena?"
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,933.12,962.6,"Yes, Justice Sotomayor. Actually, I mean, really, the question is those -- those questions, or the answers, those questions are sort of percolating up through the courts now. In general, the cases that I've seen, and I can't cite them, but they -- you know, there have been instances in which a prosecutor sometime after the fact wants to subpoena the blood from the hospital or the results of the blood test. And I think the correct rule that I've seen in some cases is, yes, if you can get judicial approval of that."
2018.18-6210,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,973.72,979.04,But it doesn't mean necessarily that the courts are precluded from subpoenaing that information?
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,979.04,979.96,"Oh, no, certainly. Certainly."
2018.18-6210,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,981.2,989.88,So let's go back to the hypothetical so I understand your position. Someone's sitting after an accident unconscious.
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,1048.28,1060.0,"If I understand the hypothetical, what you're proposing is would be an obstacle to them getting a warrant in time. And -- and that, again, is -- is essentially the definition of exigency."
2018.18-6210,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1060.0,1061.76,That would be the first hypothetical.
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,1067.48,1070.64,"Yes, that would be -- that would be, I believe, exigent circumstances."
2018.18-6210,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1070.64,1071.12,-- the result.
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,1089.08,1102.44,"The legal difference is that exigency, as -- as it was described in McNeely, involves some obstacle to getting a warrant or something that would make timely getting a warrant impractical."
2018.18-6210,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1102.44,1109.88,"They knew he -- they needed the warrant when they arrested him. If they needed the evidence, then they didn't have to wait an hour to try to get it."
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,1109.88,1114.72,"Well, and -- there -- there's just no indication that -- that there was ever a thought of a warrant."
2018.18-6210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1117.68,1123.36,"Well, that's the -- I mean, this discussion has highlighted, I think, the reason you have these laws."
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,1195.96,1204.0,"Yes, there's something wrong with it, I mean, because, under Schneckloth, we analyze consent under the totality of the circumstances."
2018.18-6210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1213.52,1214.52,So what would count --
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,1214.52,1214.72,But there --
2018.18-6210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1214.72,1216.24,What's on the other side?
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,1216.24,1219.16,"I mean, certainly, the lapse of time."
2018.18-6210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1220.84,1224.32,"So, if he signed it two years ago, it doesn't count anymore?"
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,1224.32,1233.6,"I -- I'm willing -- I -- I -- I will allow that -- again, that those -- those hypotheticals look a lot more like consent than what happened here."
2018.18-6210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1233.6,1237.16,But does that mean it's okay?
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,1237.16,1240.24,"I don't think it's okay, but you don't have to agree with me to --"
2018.18-6210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1240.24,1244.08,"Well, no, but I do have to have a reason you don't think it's okay."
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,1244.08,1255.72,"Because, again, when the state conditions, you know, participation in some activity on your consent to give up some part of your Fourth Amendment --"
2018.18-6210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1255.72,1256.92,Right.
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,1256.92,1259.72,"-- rights, it becomes very difficult to see where the limit to that is."
2018.18-6210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1259.72,1266.12,"Yeah, but this is not -- I understand your argument, who knows where this will stop, and I guess the answer is it'll stop with, you know, a license to drive on the roads."
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,1286.96,1298.48,"The -- the problem with -- again, the problem with using consent as the -- as the way to -- to analyze this is that consent doesn't take into account whether the conditions are reasonable or not. And for all the --"
2018.18-6210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1298.48,1304.72,"Well, the only conditions -- I mean, to belabor it, the only conditions you need to know about are the ones that I gave you."
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,1321.16,1326.92,"I agree with Your Honor, in that circumstance, it's very likely that the Schneckloth test would be met."
2018.18-6210,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1331.16,1336.72,Don't you have an -- an unconstitutional conditions argument?
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,1336.72,1340.76,"Well, yes, I think there would be an argument of unconstitutional conditions."
2018.18-6210,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1340.76,1352.24,And don't you have an argument that the state can't extract a condition that's more invasive than reasonably necessary for its needs?
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,1352.24,1352.84,I think those -- I think --
2018.18-6210,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1352.84,1359.96,And a blood draw is different than -- than searching somebody's home?
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,1359.96,1360.52,I -- I --
2018.18-6210,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1360.52,1366.96,"Intrusive as searching someone's home is, invading someone's body is a different level of intrusion."
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,1366.96,1368.16,"I agree with you, and that's why I think it's --"
2018.18-6210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1368.16,1375.08,"Well, you've come up -- you've come up with some good arguments there, but -- (Laughter.)"
2018.18-6210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1375.08,1391.32,"-- but I guess I would say in terms of the unconstitutional conditions thing, it's been pretty well established, I think uniformly, that driving on the roads is considered a privilege and not a right, to which certain conditions can -- can attach."
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,1393.28,1394.28,I -- I --
2018.18-6210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1394.28,1397.32,Go ahead.
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,1397.32,1404.2,"If I may, I agree with Your Honor that conditions can be attached to -- to operating on the roads."
2018.18-6210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1425.52,1435.04,"Well, let me go back for a second if I can. I was conceding to you there are dozens of good legal arguments."
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,1515.08,1517.88,Whether it's reasonable simply to say that police can always use the blood?
2018.18-6210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1517.88,1520.96,"Yeah, if they take the test, if he goes to the hospital, so forth."
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,1520.96,1521.84,If a nurse or -- or a doctor --
2018.18-6210,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1521.84,1522.24,Yeah.
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,1522.24,1533.68,"-- draws the blood for medical reasons, I understand. If I may answer the question? The difference is that when the hospital is performing a blood draw on a person, it's for their benefit."
2018.18-6210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1552.56,1553.36,"Thank you, counsel."
2018.18-6210,0,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,1553.36,1563.52,I reserve the balance of my time.
2018.18-6210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1563.52,1565.72,Ms. Jurss.
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,1565.72,1573.2,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The fundamental question is reasonableness."
2018.18-6210,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1622.12,1624.36,"No, no, he's just -- take him to the hospital."
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,1650.92,1695.16,"There are potential problems with that, and we see that playing out. So, once we've -- once he's at the hospital, if law enforcement -- excuse me -- medical staff will want to draw his blood quickly because that's how they're determining how to treat him. And so, if, at that point, law enforcement can say, instead of drawing X amount of blood, please draw a little bit more blood to be used for law enforcement purposes, then we're talking about one blood draw all at that time. If, instead, a law enforcement officer has to get on the phone and call the magistrate, even if it's not a tremendously significant delay in terms of time, what's happening is then interim medical care may be offered."
2018.18-6210,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1731.32,1744.92,"Ms. Jurss, if I could, just to understand your argument, I mean, usually you're exactly right, that reasonableness is the core of the Fourth Amendment. But usually we say: Well, what's reasonable is you get a warrant --"
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,1744.92,1745.64,Uh-huh.
2018.18-6210,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1745.64,1752.44,"-- or you fall under one of the established, well-acknowledged, well-understood, historic exceptions to the warrant."
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,1752.44,1753.16,Uh-huh.
2018.18-6210,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1753.16,1761.84,"Which exception are you saying we fall under, or are you saying that it kind of doesn't matter, we could do the reasonableness inquiry free-style?"
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,1761.84,1787.16,"So this Court could decide it under one of two theories: either consent or as a condition of driving, which would fall under a general reasonableness balancing test. And, ultimately, under either of those theories, it's going to come back to reasonableness, because, as this Court acknowledged in Birchfield, reasonableness sets the boundaries of this type of implied consent scheme."
2018.18-6210,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1787.16,1788.76,"Well, start with the consent."
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,1791.44,1796.48,"Yes, it's a special application of consent, but it still is consent."
2018.18-6210,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1796.48,1797.48,How is it consent?
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,1797.48,1824.8,"Because the person has, through his voluntary actions, demonstrated his agreement with these conditions. And so, when we look at consent and the Schneckloth consent, what we're ultimately talking about is a voluntary decision, meaning not coerced by the government, and there doesn't have to be a knowing waiver. And so, here, both of those things are met."
2018.18-6210,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1855.24,1874.56,"I guess this isn't consent in -- you said it a little bit differently -- but it wouldn't seem as though this is consent in the normal way, where it's like I understand the choice I'm making, I agree to that choice. There's nothing to say that Mr. Mitchell or anybody in his position understood this choice he was making."
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,1876.24,1876.36,Not --
2018.18-6210,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1876.36,1889.84,"I mean, if he had signed something at the DMV, you might have an argument, look, there's the manifestation of consent, his signature on a page saying that he agreed to a blood test. But there's nothing like that here, is there?"
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,1889.84,1891.16,"No, there's not."
2018.18-6210,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1943.4,1949.08,Now the problem that I have with this implied consent is I take the road.
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,1949.08,1949.8,Uh-huh.
2018.18-6210,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1949.8,1950.68,I should know the law.
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,1950.68,1951.48,Uh-huh.
2018.18-6210,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1951.48,1958.8,"I'm guilty of violating the law if I drive intoxicated, whether with alcohol or drugs."
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,1968.08,1968.8,Right.
2018.18-6210,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1968.8,1970.68,This is not quite ignorance of the law.
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2021.96,2026.16,"If -- if you don't believe it's consent, it's still a reasonable condition of driving."
2018.18-6210,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2026.16,2042.36,But we've always said that reasonable -- how can it be reasonable when you don't know that that invasion is necessarily part of the law? You know that not driving intoxicated should be part of the law.
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2047.56,2063.12,"Well, I think it's reasonable to expect, given that every state in the country has had implied consent laws for decades, which are specifically designed to test for evidence of intoxication, I think it's reasonable to expect --"
2018.18-6210,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2063.12,2071.0,"But it's a fiction, isn't it? It's not consent, no matter how much you call it implied or presumed."
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2094.88,2096.64,Uh-huh.
2018.18-6210,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2096.64,2103.64,It doesn't mean that you can't say you can drive on our roads. You have to answer for any damages that you cause.
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2117.52,2154.96,"And so, if this Court wishes to look at it not through consent but as a condition of driving, it's still a reasonable condition. And as to your question, Justice Sotomayor, why would this person expect it, for the unconscious driver in particular, he has every reasonable expectation that he will be facing bodily intrusion to test for evidence of intoxication. So he, more than other intoxicated drivers, has put himself in a position where the reasonable expectation is he will be taken to a hospital and there will be testing of his blood."
2018.18-6210,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2154.96,2163.12,"Counsel, I'm not sure he expects much of anything at that stage, but I -- I just have kind of a fundamental state law question for you."
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2163.12,2163.6,Uh-huh.
2018.18-6210,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2163.6,2186.28,"We've been proceeding on the assumption that -- that the state law operates to create implied consent or it's a condition of driving. But has actually a majority of your supreme court ever so held? As I understand it, there were three justices who held that that is, indeed, how the law works, as you're arguing, but only three justices."
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2218.0,2233.08,"Your Honor is correct that it was a three-justice plurality in this case that upheld this search under consent grounds. The two other justices, just as one point of clarification, recognized it as a valid search incident to arrest."
2018.18-6210,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2233.08,2234.24,"I'm sorry, I misspoke."
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2249.28,2266.36,"Well, I think Your Honor and this Court may still recognize it reasonably at -- under the Fourth Amendment as a form of consent or, if this Court doesn't wish to do that, as a reasonable condition of driving."
2018.18-6210,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2266.36,2278.08,"But we normally -- we normally take state law as it's given to us. We are not great interpreters of state law. We may think we're pretty good at a lot of things, but -- but we're not the last word on state law."
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2294.24,2302.88,"Well, I would say that a majority of our court has recognized that a blood draw from an unconscious person is a reasonable search."
2018.18-6210,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2331.12,2332.48,But is there a way --
2018.18-6210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2332.48,2340.64,"How do we remand for -- I mean, you know, there's certification and all, which is -- I don't say usually but often doesn't quite work out the way you hope."
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2344.92,2349.64,And this was the second case from the Wisconsin Supreme Court where that happened.
2018.18-6210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2352.8,2355.08,But I'm not faulting them for that.
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2356.6,2357.0,Right.
2018.18-6210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2357.0,2361.08,-- but it doesn't seem that it would help us with our particular conundrum.
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2361.08,2362.08,We would agree.
2018.18-6210,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2369.04,2402.64,"Is there any doubt about what the Wisconsin law does? There's disagreement on the state supreme court about the -- the theoretical basis for the decision in this case, but is there any doubt that Wisconsin law says that if you drive on our roads, and a police officer has probable cause to believe that you were driving under the influence, and you were unconscious, that the police -- that the police may, without obtaining a warrant, get a blood sample from you?"
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2402.64,2410.04,There is no doubt of that. Petitioner --
2018.18-6210,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2410.04,2454.48,"The -- the main rule, I think you would recognize, is that if you're going to seize blood or anything else from a person, you should get a warrant, with -- with exceptions. One thing that we take into account is, how difficult is it to get a warrant? And in this case, we are -- we were told that in Wisconsin, magistrates are available around the clock by phone or by email, and often it's only -- it takes only 15 minutes."
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2455.88,2459.8,So it varies from county to county across Wisconsin.
2018.18-6210,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2490.04,2498.16,Does every county in Wisconsin have a judge who's on duty 24/7 for these purposes or at least on call 24/7?
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2498.16,2509.2,"I don't know for sure with every county, but I think the common -- the common practice is to have an on-call judge. But what -- an important --"
2018.18-6210,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2509.2,2510.24,Could you have an issue --
2018.18-6210,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2510.24,2510.88,That one of the --
2018.18-6210,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2510.88,2512.36,-- it -- it -- it -- I'm sorry.
2018.18-6210,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2512.36,2512.52,Go ahead.
2018.18-6210,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2512.52,2523.84,It seems to me that -- why did the officer wait to take him to the precinct? Meaning he didn't black out for an hour.
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2540.76,2541.84,Uh-huh.
2018.18-6210,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2541.84,2556.52,"I think what was in their mind is we either get consent, and if we don't, they're going to suspend his license anyway, and it's only convenient for me now that I have to take him to the hospital to take the blood draw."
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2556.52,2566.04,So the officer in this case first took him to the police station because he wanted to first offer the lesser intrusive breath test.
2018.18-6210,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2638.08,2643.56,"So that maybe answers a question I had, which is what are the practical problems with getting a warrant?"
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2643.56,2643.6,Uh-huh.
2018.18-6210,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2643.6,2651.04,And maybe you just said that delaying medical care while you're getting a warrant -- is that what you're saying?
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2651.04,2652.32,That's a --
2018.18-6210,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2652.32,2656.12,Because you're not transporting the person right away? Or at least just -- can you spell out --
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2656.12,2656.28,Sure.
2018.18-6210,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2656.28,2657.16,Maybe I'll just ask it generally.
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2662.36,2662.72,Sure.
2018.18-6210,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2690.36,2693.36,"In some of these situations, I assume it'll be a single officer?"
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2693.36,2695.84,"Some of these situations, it will be a single officer."
2018.18-6210,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2758.84,2764.0,I assume most of these cases or at least many are cases where there's been an accident?
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2764.0,2765.48,"Yes, you're correct."
2018.18-6210,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2766.48,2768.44,Do you have any sense of the numbers in Wisconsin on that?
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2768.44,2773.32,I don't have the numbers of the breakdown of car crash versus other circumstances.
2018.18-6210,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2828.68,2837.32,"That sounds like an exigent circumstance argument, which you stipulated against in seeking --"
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2837.32,2875.28,"So there -- there may, in many of these cases, be exigent circumstances, but the question should not just simply be one of time because, as this Court recognized in Kentucky v. King, there's -- there's nowhere in the Constitution that says that the minute police have probable cause, they need to drop everything and get a warrant. And that should be particularly true where we know law enforcement is going to be confronted with someone who needs urgent medical attention and, again, he hasn't withdrawn his implied consent. So law enforcement has every reason to believe that he is continuing to agree."
2018.18-6210,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2875.28,2883.44,Why -- why do you -- the problem I'm having with your argument is I don't know where you get the implied consent from.
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2885.08,2885.28,Okay.
2018.18-6210,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2885.28,2898.68,"If there is none for the reasons we've discussed, then you are back to exigent circumstances or some other recognized exception. You say incident to arrest."
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2904.8,2912.6,So general reasonableness in the same way that this Court has applied it in Maryland v. King and in other -- a number of other --
2018.18-6210,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2912.6,2917.48,"Well, what Maryland v. King said was that an alcohol swab of your mouth --"
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2917.48,2918.4,Uh-huh.
2018.18-6210,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2918.4,2934.2,"-- for purposes of identification, not for purposes of proof at trial but for purposes of identification, was not sufficiently intrusive to require a warrant."
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2942.56,2954.16,"Well, even in Birchfield, this Court said that, where there's been no clarity from the founding, it looks to reasonableness, and -- this Court looks to reasonableness."
2018.18-6210,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2995.88,2996.56,Suppose --
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,2996.56,2997.88,-- precise type of intrusion.
2018.18-6210,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2997.88,3015.04,"Suppose he had a card on his windshield that says: If I'm unconscious, I do not consent to a blood draw. (Laughter.)"
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,3015.04,3036.36,"That -- that could very well make a difference, because, if we're thinking about it through the lens of what I'll call typical consent, if an officer objectively perceives a withdrawal of that consent, then the state may no longer proceed under his -- under the theory of -- that he's offered consent."
2018.18-6210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3037.76,3041.84,"Well, there may not be consent, but you'd have pretty good evidence, wouldn't you?"
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,3041.84,3042.04,Pretty good --
2018.18-6210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3042.04,3045.92,"I mean, you have a card saying if -- he's anticipating being unconscious while he's driving a car. (Laughter.)"
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,3045.92,3049.0,"Well, that would certainly be helpful."
2018.18-6210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3085.92,3101.72,"Well, that's the -- I mean, that's actually the question presented, is how to deal with an unconscious person. To what extent do you think the ability to withdraw the consent that was given, and -- I mean, call it implied consent, I'm not quite -- I don't quite understand why it's not consent if it's a condition --"
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,3101.72,3102.0,Right.
2018.18-6210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3102.0,3116.16,"-- upon driving the automobile. So, if you have that, the validity of that, to what extent does it depend on the ability to withdraw? Because that's the -- that's the problem here, of course, is the unconscious person can't withdraw at the moment."
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,3116.16,3116.8,Right.
2018.18-6210,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3223.04,3252.0,"But I guess what you just said suggests the limits of these laws. You know, in general, these laws work fine, and the reason that they work fine are because most drivers are conscious. And so the police officer engages with them, and what the law does is it functions not as implied consent, it functions as induced consent or incentivized consent. The police officer comes up and says: Unless you consent, your license is going to be taken away."
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,3278.8,3304.44,"So two parts in response. I think it's important here that the government has not put the person in that situation. Right? If -- if that opportunity -- if there is an opportunity that's offered to the conscious driver, the unconscious driver's lack of having that opportunity is his fault, not the government's. And then what I would say as a second response is, again, consent --"
2018.18-6210,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3304.44,3307.88,The Fourth Amendment often applies against people who violate the law.
2018.18-6210,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3311.72,3314.08,You're a criminal. (Laughter.)
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,3314.08,3314.72,True enough.
2018.18-6210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3369.08,3370.16,Finish your sentence.
2018.18-6210,1,63130,hannah_s_jurss,,3370.16,3376.64,Thank you -- of how that consent will be demonstrated and the expectations that person will be held to. Thank you.
2018.18-6210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3376.64,3380.2,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Hinkel, you have four minutes remaining."
2018.18-6210,2,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,3380.2,3393.44,"Thank you. This Court has repeatedly recognized that a blood draw is a significant interest that affects -- sorry, that offends an individual's sense of dignity and bodily integrity."
2018.18-6210,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3427.88,3482.76,"Didn't we just hear some reasons why the warrant would -- would -- the warrant requirement would create problems? I mean, I'd like to hear your response to that. If -- if there's a crash, the need to attend to people who may be injured in the crash, the need to attend to the medical needs of the person who is unconscious, once at the hospital the -- the potential that medical care may interfere with the -- with the accuracy of a subsequent blood draw, the possibility that if the medical treatment proceeds at the hospital before a warrant -- before the blood draw for the presence of drugs or alcohol can be administered, it may not be possible to do it because of what -- the care that the person is being given."
2018.18-6210,2,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,3486.96,3491.52,Those are all textbook factors that would go toward the exigency analysis.
2018.18-6210,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3508.72,3509.36,Isn't it most?
2018.18-6210,2,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,3509.36,3509.92,The most extreme --
2018.18-6210,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3509.92,3520.92,"Why not have a categorical exigency for this category of cases involving unconscious, because the factors in many cases are going to be such as were described."
2018.18-6210,2,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,3520.92,3524.6,"Well, I don't think we have any evidence that that is, in fact, the case, that that is most cases."
2018.18-6210,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3540.56,3555.92,"Well, what's on the other side of the balance where you have somebody who's unconscious, so will not even be able to perceive that the blood test is being administered, and the person is in all likelihood having a blood draw for other purposes anyway?"
2018.18-6210,2,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,3555.92,3562.24,"Well, the reasonableness of the search hasn't ever depended on whether or not someone was around to see it."
2018.18-6210,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3587.04,3588.96,How many --
2018.18-6210,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3588.96,3595.96,"So -- I mean, in Birchfield, you say I'm going to take your license away unless you're going to agree."
2018.18-6210,2,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,3622.28,3623.4,I disagree.
2018.18-6210,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3623.4,3628.68,"Unless you're into Birchfield, it's sort of good-bye."
2018.18-6210,2,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,3630.08,3630.84,I disagree with --
2018.18-6210,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3630.84,3633.96,"-- I can't get my hands on that, which is why I repeat it."
2018.18-6210,2,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,3633.96,3640.28,I disagree with the premise that the consequence of license revocation is going to lead to automatic consent in every case.
2018.18-6210,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3640.76,3650.08,"No, no, you're right, not every case, but on many it'll be confusing and a few he'll say no, but 99 percent, sure."
2018.18-6210,2,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,3650.08,3650.68,If I may?
2018.18-6210,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3650.68,3651.08,Sure.
2018.18-6210,2,63129,andrew_r_hinkel,,3651.08,3652.4,I don't think that's true.
2018.18-6210,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3661.68,3661.92,Okay.
2018.18-6210,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3661.92,3663.0,"Thank you, counsel."
