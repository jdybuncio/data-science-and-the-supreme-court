2002.01-1184,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.569,"We'll hear argument now in Number 01-1184, United States versus Francisco Jimenez Recio and Mr. Lopez-Mesa."
2002.01-1184,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3.412,4.446,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1184,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,7.388,7.894,What does the word inchoate mean?
2002.01-1184,1,36611,m_karl_shurtliff,,451.503,454.295,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, counsel:"
2002.01-1184,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,472.034,475.343,"Well, Mr. Shurtliff, the only question presented in the petition for certiorari is whether a conspiracy ends as a matter of law when the Government frustrates its objective."
2002.01-1184,1,36611,m_karl_shurtliff,,476.401,481.134,"It is, Mr. Chief Justice, because that's the argument that the Government makes that we should not sustain the Ninth Circuit decision in this case as framed by Judge Browning who formulated the decision."
2002.01-1184,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,481.134,482.065,"Well, but the Government formulated the question here."
2002.01-1184,1,36611,m_karl_shurtliff,,482.065,483.168,"I... I understand that, Mr. Chief Justice, and... and we do speak to that."
2002.01-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,517.488,519.372,Why would impossibility caused by the Government be any different from impossibility caused by somebody else?
2002.01-1184,1,36611,m_karl_shurtliff,,524.152,526.887,"--I think, Mr. Justice Scalia, that you could answer the question no and still find for our clients because this is not the case."
2002.01-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,528.094,528.644,There wasn't impossibility at all?
2002.01-1184,1,36611,m_karl_shurtliff,,528.644,528.794,--There wasn't impossibility.
2002.01-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,528.794,529.001,What was it?
2002.01-1184,1,36611,m_karl_shurtliff,,529.001,529.442,It was termination.
2002.01-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,530.189,530.574,"Well, why was it terminated?"
2002.01-1184,1,36611,m_karl_shurtliff,,533.992,536.417,"--The object, Mr. Justice Scalia, was... was frustrated by the Government intervention."
2002.01-1184,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,536.888,538.071,But the Government's position is there's only two ways a conspiracy can end.
2002.01-1184,1,36611,m_karl_shurtliff,,550.733,551.79,"--Indeed, Justice Ginsburg, there was sharp disagreement."
2002.01-1184,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,583.709,583.755,Well--
2002.01-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,583.755,586.604,--But there... there is a public danger presented by people who band together to rob a bank even when there is no money in the bank.
2002.01-1184,1,36611,m_karl_shurtliff,,597.314,597.567,"Indeed, Justice Scalia."
2002.01-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,597.567,600.462,But you say it does... it is not a criminal conspiracy if the reason there is no money in... in the bank is that the Government has removed the money from the bank knowing that there's going to be a... a break-in?
2002.01-1184,1,36611,m_karl_shurtliff,,600.462,603.898,There would be no conspiracy if the Government had intervened in that conspiracy early on and the involvement of the participants charged was only as a result of that involvement.
2002.01-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,603.898,605.839,"So if the Government took the money out of the bank, that would be different than if there was just no money there from the outset."
2002.01-1184,1,36611,m_karl_shurtliff,,605.839,606.483,"I'd think not, Mr. Justice Scalia."
2002.01-1184,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,610.045,611.01,"They... well, in both cases they thought there was money in the bank."
2002.01-1184,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,957.063,957.948,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1184,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1011.437,1011.747,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
