1969.188,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,47.691,"Number 188, Baldwin against New York."
1969.188,0,44962,william_e_hellerstein,,65.876,69.541,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1447.42,1450.922,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.188,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1644.775,1646.181,It includes New York?
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1646.181,1647.49,Including New York --
1969.188,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1647.49,1651.801,Because out of New York City as I understand it the right is to a six-man jury?
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1651.801,1658.318,The right is to a six-man jury in all of other counties for crimes punishable by up to one-year.
1969.188,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1685.564,1693.329,"Now in a hybrid, you're including jurors -- a jury of less than 12 people and also you're including a trial de novo?"
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1693.329,1705.318,"Yes there are for example 9 states in which there are fewer than twelve jurors for crimes punishable explicitly by no more than one-year, that is the explicit cutoff in 9 states."
1969.188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1736.991,1747.744,"But the real problem with three judges and six jurors, is that the real problem?"
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1747.744,1752.456,The problem is that three judges or even 12 judges are not a jury.
1969.188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1764.006,1766.323,"Well, why have three instead of one?"
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1766.323,1773.879,That is a legislative determination in New York which is based on a long standing history and the --
1969.188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1773.879,1781.387,"Well, I -- maybe you say that the difference is between the judge and the jury and now you've got a three judge bench?"
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1781.387,1799.056,I think it was felt Mr. Justice Marshall that in adopting a system which had no jurors at all there might be a ameliorating factor by interposing at the option of the defendant more than one judge so that you could have deliberations --
1969.188,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1799.056,1801.897,And it would be more ameliorating with a jury of six?
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1801.897,1805.075,No question and it would be even more with a jury of twelve.
1969.188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1812.84,1816.456,"In the de novo states, what's the situation?"
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1816.456,1826.761,"There are five states which provide a trial only de novo with a common law jury for crimes punishable by up to one-year, that's the cutoff."
1969.188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1828.814,1830.701,"Well, what do you mean by de novo?"
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1830.701,1833.615,"That means in the first instance, there is a trial --"
1969.188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1833.615,1834.484,Without a jury?
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1834.484,1840.131,"Without any jury or is in the case of Virginia which is one of these things, there are five jurors."
1969.188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1846.745,1848.636,But the penalty is of the same possible (Voice Overlap) --
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1848.636,1854.689,"The penalty is the same, punishment by up to one-year."
1969.188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1915.64,1918.603,What do the rest of the states do?
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1918.603,1927.787,The majority of states provide for a common law jury at various levels of a sentence.
1969.188,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1982.242,1983.941,What about the other states?
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1984.894,1993.322,"We list a quite a few other states in our brief, in our argument and in our appendix, Mr. Justice White."
1969.188,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2027.731,2031.053,How many did you say requires a fair jury (Voice Overlap)?
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2031.053,2039.011,"Under the common understanding of the Sixth Amendment, twelve jurors rendering a unanimous verdict."
1969.188,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2039.011,2040.002,What state?
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2042.103,2047.641,"Well, there are 18 states which provide such a jury in every criminal case regardless of the punishment."
1969.188,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2095.121,2096.837,Including New York?
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2096.837,2106.288,Including New York and this is the federal system of justice incorporated in the federal rules of criminal procedure.
1969.188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2138.238,2147.144,"Well, isn't the adjustment of three judges aimed at the same - I believe what Mr. Hellerstein was talking about the arbitrariness of one judge?"
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2147.144,2147.541,Yes.
1969.188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2166.089,2171.822,Is the demand for a three-judge trial exercised frequently?
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2171.822,2182.301,"I would estimate in approximately 5 to 10% of the cases, perhaps 5 to 10% of the cases that are actually tried brought to trial."
1969.188,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2352.681,2354.444,"You mean, guiding (Inaudible)"
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2354.444,2354.706,Pardon?
1969.188,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2354.706,2355.948,-- as I understand it?
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2355.948,2357.061,Excuse me.
1969.188,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2445.687,2451.99,Isn't that highly relevant (Inaudible) in connection with the destruction of the constitution?
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2451.99,2452.439,No.
1969.188,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2474.567,2477.345,You mean a predominant sentiment?
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2477.345,2501.621,"A community sentiment rather than a judicial sentiment and as Mr. Justice Marshall pointed out in the Frank case in the last term of this Court, the difficult task of defining serious offenses should be undertaken without regard to the judicial sentiment, but rather with regard to some objective criteria as to how the national community views crimes."
1969.188,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2501.621,2503.607,(Inaudible)
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2503.607,2513.53,By the legislative enactments by the judicial decisions and to some extent by the history of the administration of justice in the various states.
1969.188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2513.53,2527.031,I take it you wouldn't be making these points except that your friend has urged a different drawing on these sources for a different cutoff date?
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2527.031,2542.075,"I think that they not only rebut Mr. Chief Justice the appellant's arguments but they point the Court towards the one-year cutoff provision because this is the real choice, is it going to be six months or is it going to be one-year."
1969.188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2543.951,2545.367,"Well, if the third alternative --"
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2545.367,2545.985,The third alternative --
1969.188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2545.985,2550.949,-- or is it going to be left to the states?
1969.188,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2550.949,2561.744,"If that alternative is adopted I suppose there would be some limits on the state, for example the State of Louisiana chose a two-year cutoff and that was deemed to be impermissible under the Sixth Amendment."
1969.188,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2617.95,2621.514,You have about seven minutes and we'll continue and let you get back to your homes tonight.
1969.188,2,44962,william_e_hellerstein,,2621.514,2623.76,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1969.188,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2799.211,2800.596,Thank you.
