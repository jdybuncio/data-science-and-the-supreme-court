2005.04-1067,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.297,We'll hear argument next in Georgia versus Randolph.
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,4.297,5.079,Mr.--
2005.04-1067,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5.079,5.845,Ms. Smith.
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,5.845,9.752,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1067,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,53.433,56.606,Do we look to what is socially acceptable?
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,60.576,65.467,"There has been some of that in some of the prior cases, Your Honor, that you do look to social norms."
2005.04-1067,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,67.093,85.082,"Do you think it is the norm that, if there are coinhabitants of a house or apartment, that it's okay to let a stranger in, against the express wishes of your spouse or coinhabitant?"
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,85.082,86.253,--I think that is--
2005.04-1067,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,86.253,88.504,You think that's socially acceptable?
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,88.504,90.958,"--I think it is... I think it is common, Your Honor."
2005.04-1067,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,92.942,99.053,"Well, it might be common, but I'm not sure that's an acceptable kind of performance."
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,99.053,117.276,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, we have what we have called either adduced expectation of privacy or a limited expectation of privacy or what we called a shared expectation of privacy, by making the decision, long before police appear at the door, to share this premises with someone."
2005.04-1067,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,117.73,117.995,What--
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,117.995,118.323,--that decision--
2005.04-1067,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,118.323,121.762,"--what if the spouse had put a sign up, ""No police allowed here""?"
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,121.762,131.341,"--I don't think that, even as... in... one could ensure that the spouse would honor the other person's wishes."
2005.04-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,141.782,142.11,What--
2005.04-1067,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,142.11,142.438,Is--
2005.04-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,142.438,144.219,--What about the extent of the search?
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,148.986,164.489,"I think, Your Honor, that would be a question of fact, under the circumstances, to see whether the husband has exhibited some exclusive use of that drawer or whether the facts would demonstrate that she puts socks in there for him, she puts--"
2005.04-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,164.489,164.942,"I mean, how does the--"
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,164.942,165.177,--notes in there--
2005.04-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,165.177,166.052,--how does the policeman--
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,166.052,166.458,--for him--
2005.04-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,166.458,167.271,"--so, how is the policeman supposed to know that?"
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,167.271,174.522,"--Well, I think... looking... we measure what is reasonable on the part of the police by looking to what they know."
2005.04-1067,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,236.645,240.005,I thought she said she came to collect her belongings.
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,243.037,245.881,She did not... she did not relay that to the officer.
2005.04-1067,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,250.961,253.9,But isn't it relevant what the status of the person is?
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,260.041,266.589,"--Well, Your Honor... and I think that, looking at the tenor of the conversations, that is exactly what this officer ascertained."
2005.04-1067,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,276.372,276.622,She called--
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,276.622,277.247,--only there--
2005.04-1067,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,277.247,277.669,"--the police, didn't she?"
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,278.842,279.717,--She called the police.
2005.04-1067,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,289.25,292.173,--And is that a... is there any issue about that here?
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,292.173,293.095,"No, Your Honor."
2005.04-1067,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,293.095,302.16,"In other words, I thought the issue was whether his statement, in effect, vetoed whatever... for Fourth Amendment purposes, whatever permission might have been given."
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,314.256,315.709,"That is our position, Your Honor."
2005.04-1067,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,327.024,327.321,That's what I thought.
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,327.321,331.024,And there had been an argument raised in the appellate court--
2005.04-1067,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,331.024,331.712,But we--
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,331.712,334.259,--about whether she had abandoned the property.
2005.04-1067,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,336.26,341.495,--But all of this is really getting pretty far from what I think is really the key question in the case.
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,378.814,383.972,"--That is correct, Your Honor, as to not addressing the spectral situation."
2005.04-1067,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,390.613,392.411,"Well, what if we think it does?"
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,403.32,409.994,I think you look to whether she has common authority over the premises in his... in her own right.
2005.04-1067,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,409.994,410.135,Why?
2005.04-1067,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,410.135,410.541,Even when--
2005.04-1067,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,410.541,410.807,Why?
2005.04-1067,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,410.807,415.682,--when the husband is physically present and says no?
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,415.682,426.559,"Yes, Your Honor, because, first of all, you said, in Rodriguez, the Constitution does not guarantee that a search, only with the defendant's consent, will occur."
2005.04-1067,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,427.608,428.905,"But, do you--"
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,428.905,429.326,--only a search that--
2005.04-1067,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,429.326,429.795,--do you--
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,429.795,430.233,--is unreasonable--
2005.04-1067,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,430.233,435.203,--think the officers had sufficient grounds to get a warrant here for a search?
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,435.203,442.219,"--They ultimately did, Your Honor, but that consideration of getting a warrant was also at play in Matlock and, I think, in Rodriguez."
2005.04-1067,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,447.174,447.658,But that's--
2005.04-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,447.658,448.049,"Well, but that's the--"
2005.04-1067,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,448.049,448.424,--the issue.
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,455.441,465.209,"--Well, Your Honor, I think you... we come back to the fact that he does not have a reasonable expectation of absolute or unequivocal control--"
2005.04-1067,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,465.209,465.35,Why--
2005.04-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,465.35,465.741,"--Well, I guess that--"
2005.04-1067,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,465.741,466.1,--Why not?
2005.04-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,466.819,467.976,--that depends on what we say.
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,495.81,505.374,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, its ability... if we're going to have consent, and if we're going to have a third party consent rule, then this is an issue that is going to have to be resolved."
2005.04-1067,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,505.374,505.734,--You're talking about--
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,505.734,506.187,I'm--
2005.04-1067,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,506.187,508.374,"--reasonable expectations, I suppose, here."
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,508.374,508.952,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1067,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,508.952,530.974,"Why do you assume that it... that it is the reasonable expectation of two people who have... who are living together in... on... in common premises, that, where one of them wants somebody to come in, and the other one does not want somebody to come in, the person may come in?"
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,540.492,548.65,"Well, I think, in the Morning case that was cited in the brief, they realized one can always hope that the other will accede to one's wishes."
2005.04-1067,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,564.277,564.621,In--
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,564.621,564.934,--that shared--
2005.04-1067,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,564.934,565.387,--In Matlock--
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,565.387,565.886,--premises.
2005.04-1067,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,566.167,566.652,--In Matlock--
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,566.652,566.98,--that's out of sync--
2005.04-1067,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,566.98,569.763,"--In Matlock, did the... did the absent person say no?"
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,569.763,572.716,--He was... it... he was silent.
2005.04-1067,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,573.669,573.841,"So, you--"
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,573.841,574.372,--on the scene--
2005.04-1067,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,574.372,580.623,"--you don't even have, in Matlock, a situation where you know that one of the parties didn't want entry."
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,590.47,608.161,"--Well, in... and even in that situation, Matlock, the reference to the absent nonconsenting defendant was in a paragraph where the court had talked about how it had reserved, in Amos... the Amos case... the question of whether a wife could waive her husband's rights."
2005.04-1067,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,647.139,648.358,"Okay, Ms.--"
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,648.358,648.733,But--
2005.04-1067,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,648.733,651.827,"--Ms. Smith, may I... your time is getting short, and I want to get clear on one thing."
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,666.393,669.394,"--I think, Your Honor, we had called it a--"
2005.04-1067,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,669.394,670.097,"Okay, and let me--"
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,670.097,670.769,--a reduced--
2005.04-1067,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,670.769,691.492,"--If that is correct, then your whole argument rests on the fact that, although he has, and may assert, an expectation of privacy, that is irrelevant to the right of his wife to let people, including the police, come into an area which is under her control, as well as his."
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,692.462,693.54,"--Yes, Your Honor--"
2005.04-1067,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,693.54,693.634,Okay.
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,693.634,693.884,--that is.
2005.04-1067,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,708.605,713.951,But your expectation... this is what I'm trying to get at... your expectation is not what governs.
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,724.155,725.235,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1067,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,725.235,737.627,"--but that his expectation is irrelevant to the fact that the wife, in this case, we assume, had the right to admit them to an area which was under her control, as well as his."
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,739.081,740.596,"Yes, Your Honor, I think so."
2005.04-1067,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,740.596,740.987,Okay.
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,740.987,743.097,I think that his... his expectation is unreasonable.
2005.04-1067,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,753.741,758.413,"So, you would distinguish... in your answer to Justice Souter... this is... this is a lawyer."
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,761.586,761.899,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-1067,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,761.899,763.93,"Her permission wouldn't extend to that room, would it?"
2005.04-1067,0,38324,paula_k_smith,,763.93,786.06,"I think it would... it would have presented a much closer question of... and particularly given the protection of papers and the fact that you may have business papers in there with attorney client privilege... I think her authority to consent it would have presented a closer question, although it would still be something to look at under totality of circumstances."
2005.04-1067,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,814.55,817.098,"Thank you, Counsel."
2005.04-1067,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,820.38,827.928,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1067,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,880.549,880.94,But we--
2005.04-1067,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,880.94,881.284,Was--
2005.04-1067,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,881.284,882.159,--Go ahead.
2005.04-1067,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,882.159,886.332,"--I was curious, though, which way that fact cut."
2005.04-1067,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,913.838,918.385,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that the law in this area is founded on a notion of agency."
2005.04-1067,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,938.515,941.735,"But she can do that by advising the police, and then there's probable cause."
2005.04-1067,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,944.595,960.348,"Justice Kennedy, there may well be other bases to allow law enforcement activity to go on, but that presupposes that her authority to consent is somehow qualified, if the police could obtain a warrant or some other doctrine, would it support the search?"
2005.04-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,966.239,985.244,"Mr. Dreeben, does this authority to let someone in, over the objection of the cohabitant, apply only to policemen, or is it... is it also the case that... I don't know, as a matter of, what, property law, or whatever +/?"
2005.04-1067,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1004.514,1012.406,"Well, the law of property, Justice Scalia, to the extent that it's relevant here, would allow any cotenant to license his or her interest--"
2005.04-1067,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1012.406,1018.157,"But we have not decided Fourth Amendment issues on the basis of the law of property, have we?"
2005.04-1067,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1018.157,1019.236,"--I quite agree, Justice--"
2005.04-1067,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1019.236,1019.454,Don't we--
2005.04-1067,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1019.454,1019.954,--O'Connor.
2005.04-1067,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1019.954,1023.58,--have to look at social understanding on right to privacy?
2005.04-1067,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1041.085,1049.43,"Well, Justice O'Connor, I certainly do not think that there is any uniform social understanding that should drive the decision in this case, for two different reasons."
2005.04-1067,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1065.213,1073.31,"Well, that's possible, but you have a case here where the wife says, ""Come in"", and the husband is right there and says, ""No, you can't""."
2005.04-1067,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1073.31,1096.58,"--And I think that the other factor that the Court needs to consider in evaluating this is not just social expectations with respect to non law enforcement events and visitors, but this positive, affirmative social interest in encouraging cooperation with the law, which is something that she has the ability to do with respect to property over which she has common authority."
2005.04-1067,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1096.58,1102.067,"But... well, you keep saying that, but that policy is... can be vindicated by using doctrines other than consent."
2005.04-1067,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1114.788,1116.756,I--
2005.04-1067,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1116.756,1125.993,"And I also agree with Justice Scalia, that social expectation may be, in part, measured by our cases on this subject."
2005.04-1067,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1134.245,1142.84,"--I think that what the Court needs to do is look at the consent search doctrine in relation to third party consents, generally."
2005.04-1067,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1156.78,1168.972,"Well, yes, but there's kind of an assumption there that if the cotenant is not there, sure, you'll let the tenant who is there call the shots."
2005.04-1067,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1168.972,1174.535,"--I don't think that, on the facts of either Matlock or Rodriguez, that would be a particularly logical or reasonable assumption."
2005.04-1067,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1191.742,1192.694,May I ask--
2005.04-1067,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1192.694,1200.025,"Rodriguez is even more dramatic, because, in Rodriguez, the victim of a battery, Gail Fischer, seeks out the police and says,"
2005.04-1067,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1213.98,1215.622,--May I ask two questions?
2005.04-1067,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1254.6,1255.069,Well--
2005.04-1067,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1255.069,1255.522,--in this case.
2005.04-1067,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1255.522,1255.882,--At--
2005.04-1067,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1255.882,1260.351,"And the second question I want you to address at the same time is, What if this was a suitcase that they both owned?"
2005.04-1067,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1266.509,1269.602,"--Well, Justice Stevens, the second one is the easier one."
2005.04-1067,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1290.748,1293.217,"Well, Matlock is the reasonable police... well, go ahead."
2005.04-1067,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1293.811,1320.817,"--The attempt to transpose ordinary social understandings from a myriad of infinitely varied settings that do not involve law enforcement, I submit, will not correctly allow this Court to calibrate what it should be doing, which is balancing the individual interests in privacy against the social interests that affirmatively encourage and validate the use of consent."
2005.04-1067,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1368.967,1371.077,"The ""different way"", of course, would be to get a warrant."
2005.04-1067,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1371.077,1382.72,"--An option would be to get a warrant in cases where the police do have probable cause, but, as this Court recognized in Schneckloth versus Bustamonte, the courts... the officers will not always have probable cause."
2005.04-1067,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1382.72,1392.676,"Would they, on... in... on these facts... I thought not, but perhaps I was wrong... the... when the police come to the house, they don't suspect anything about cocaine."
2005.04-1067,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1421.87,1424.136,"I think it clearly would, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-1067,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1425.09,1425.934,"It would, or would not?"
2005.04-1067,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1425.934,1426.856,It would?
2005.04-1067,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1426.856,1441.858,"--It would amount to probable cause if the wife, who has... she's in a position where she would know what's going on in the house, what kind of activity is going on in the house, she is a presumptively reliable citizen providing information to the police, and the fact--"
2005.04-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1441.858,1443.843,"All she said is, ""He's a cocaine user""."
2005.04-1067,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1453.377,1455.284,"--Well, that's not all she said, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1455.284,1455.596,--Oh.
2005.04-1067,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1455.596,1458.816,What she said was that there were items of drug evidence--
2005.04-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1458.816,1459.144,Yes.
2005.04-1067,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1459.144,1459.503,--in the house.
2005.04-1067,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1528.003,1540.099,"Well, not nothing, because we have cases that have said, if the coinhabitant is not there, he relinquishes whatever right he had to object."
2005.04-1067,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1546.052,1558.228,"--I think it's very odd to say that, in Matlock, the right was relinquished, when Matlock was arrested and taken to a police car and was never asked for consent, or that Rodriguez relinquished his right by falling asleep in his own apartment."
2005.04-1067,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1586.234,1590.625,"Well, but it's by happenstance that the police find the wife in the house."
2005.04-1067,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1593.907,1601.519,"--Well, in this case, as in many other cases involving this kind of potential incident, the wife called the police to the scene."
2005.04-1067,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,1682.159,1690.288,"Mr. Dreeben, is it... is this case materially different if she simply ran upstairs, grabbed the straw, brought it down, and handed it to the police officer?"
2005.04-1067,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1692.975,1694.226,"It is, in effect, the same thing."
2005.04-1067,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1712.213,1719.247,"You want us to take the position that there's no legal difference between, (a) entering a home and taking something, and, (b) receiving it on the outside?"
2005.04-1067,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1719.247,1731.077,"I think that the difference, when you receive something with the consent of someone who has the authority to exercise control over it, is a question of whether she leads the police upstairs, or whether she brings the item downstairs."
2005.04-1067,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1734.844,1735.344,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1737.547,1740.767,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1067,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1751.019,1759.084,"What about the telephone call between a husband and wife, and the wife tells the police, ""Listen in on this call""?"
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1770.32,1775.039,"It is, Mr. Chief Justice, although not on the theory of third party consent."
2005.04-1067,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1804.374,1805.187,She's consenting.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1823.738,1825.098,"--But... yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1845.461,1845.805,Well--

2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1846.571,1846.867,--Excuse me.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1846.867,1847.274,"--""# in the house""."
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1847.274,1853.26,"It was... it was the... it was a search only of premises with respect to which she had, supposedly, common rights."
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1855.26,1856.292,You do--
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1856.292,1856.636,If--
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1856.636,1857.417,--Justice Souter.
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1857.417,1863.48,"--If she and her husband, you know... if she had a right to be in only two rooms, she couldn't authorize the search of the whole house, right?"
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1863.48,1864.215,That is--
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1864.215,1864.528,Okay.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1864.528,1865.043,--correct.
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1878.953,1879.328,"All right, then he--"
2005.04-1067,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1879.328,1879.624,"Well, that--"
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1879.624,1879.874,--if he--
2005.04-1067,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1879.874,1881.938,--begs the question... it begs the question to say
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1890.284,1892.644,"Mr. Chief Justice, that's why I finished off on that."
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1959.346,1961.518,"--Well, it... let me make sure I understand where you're going."
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1982.164,1982.539,--Good guess.
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1982.539,1983.632,And that's the focus of your argument--
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1983.632,1984.054,Exactly--
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1984.054,1984.32,--correct?
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1984.32,1985.023,--right.
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1985.023,1985.445,Okay.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1985.445,1993.399,"But I do think it's important, of course, this Court's precedents have often said that the degree of the expectation informs the reasonableness of the search."
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1994.713,1995.025,Okay.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,1995.025,1995.666,--search is reasonable.
2005.04-1067,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1998.104,1998.401,All right.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2002.683,2003.198,--Yes.
2005.04-1067,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2003.198,2005.12,"Well, she wants the policeman in."
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2012.811,2013.936,I think everybody makes their--
2005.04-1067,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2013.936,2014.748,And vice versa.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2014.748,2015.311,--Yes.
2005.04-1067,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2015.702,2015.967,Right.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2015.967,2016.467,--that's the point--
2005.04-1067,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2020.546,2022.25,Everybody makes some sacrifices.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2022.25,2022.484,That's--
2005.04-1067,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2022.484,2022.844,All right--
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2022.844,2023.203,--right.
2005.04-1067,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2023.203,2023.734,--let's think--
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2023.734,2024.094,"And so, he--"
2005.04-1067,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2024.094,2025.595,"--of the need for this, because it's the other thing that's on my mind."
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2062.884,2071.808,"--Justice Breyer, because she's not authorizing a search... she wants them to come in and talk to her, wherever, in the house... that might be a different case."
2005.04-1067,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2072.309,2072.668,"Oh, no."
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2097.173,2097.908,--Yes.
2005.04-1067,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2134.322,2136.542,"No, no, but... no, I'm not getting your answer."
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2167.517,2168.97,--No.
2005.04-1067,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2169.548,2170.235,All right.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2170.564,2170.845,--saying is--
2005.04-1067,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2170.845,2172.971,--is it clear that the policeman cannot do it?
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2172.971,2175.111,"--Well, Your Honor, the... it is an unresolved question of--"
2005.04-1067,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2175.111,2175.674,Fine.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2175.674,2176.159,--this Court.
2005.04-1067,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2176.44,2176.721,That's what--
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2176.721,2177.362,--equally divided--
2005.04-1067,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2177.362,2177.941,--I thought it was not clear.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2181.738,2182.004,--Yes.
2005.04-1067,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2182.004,2182.222,--is the law--
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2182.222,2182.519,Yes.
2005.04-1067,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2182.519,2186.192,"--there are 200,000 cases a year in Chicago, alone."
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2211.963,2211.948,All right.
2005.04-1067,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2238.86,2240.329,There aren't exigent circumstances.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2256.442,2260.88,"--Justice Breyer, I am not an expert in spousal abuse; and so, I'm not... which I think is a very serious issue."

2005.04-1067,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2376.28,2376.858,--reflects is the--
2005.04-1067,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2376.858,2377.296,--Go on.
2005.04-1067,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2377.296,2380.359,"--I was just going to say, it just reflects the expectation of privacy."
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2400.52,2402.599,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I do think you've put your finger on it."
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2433.105,2434.871,"Yes, but Olson was a standing case."
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2460.672,2463.721,"--Justice Souter, that's why I, sort of, paused and came to you."

2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2473.41,2474.16,--I don't see that--
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2474.16,2474.488,--Okay.
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2474.488,2474.864,--at all.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2474.864,2475.27,Well--
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2475.27,2491.164,They concede... the only expectation of privacy you've got to have for Fourth Amendment purposes in order to raise a claim is a minimal one... they concede that the... that this individual has an expectation of privacy sufficient to raise a Fourth Amendment claim.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2491.164,2491.727,--But--
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2491.727,2505.746,"Their argument is that, although he can raise it, the rights, however they may be derived on the part of his wife, allowed her to admit the police... in effect, thwarting his expectations."
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2517.545,2519.576,"--Justice Souter, I think it is."
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2525.187,2525.78,That--
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2525.78,2526.171,--let me--
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2526.171,2526.921,--I... I agree with you.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2526.921,2527.126,--Okay.
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2527.657,2528.517,There is this talk about lessened--
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2528.517,2528.845,Yes.
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2528.845,2531.314,"--expectation, and I... I think, ultimately, that's irrelevant."
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2531.314,2531.486,All right.
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2564.93,2565.118,Okay.
2005.04-1067,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2565.962,2567.118,"Well, that's not a fair reading of Rodriguez."
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2573.479,2581.808,"Mr. Chief Justice, the Government has argued successfully in this Court that we don't make any assumptions about whether people will consent or not."
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2584.356,2594.969,"--Well, maybe we don't, but isn't there... isn't the... isn't Mr. Dreeben's argument fair that no one in his right mind would have expected Matlock to agree to this?"
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2621.223,2622.286,"--No, Justice Souter."
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2655.496,2655.966,"Sure, but--"
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2655.966,2656.56,"--""# who lives here""."
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2656.56,2672.297,"--an equally clear line would simply be that, if the area to be searched is one of common tenancy or occupation or whatnot, the only consent that will suffice will be the consent of the person against whom you expect to use any evidence found."
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2673.5,2676.517,"It's true, Justice Souter, there are a lot of possible clear lines."
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2693.177,2693.74,Okay.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2693.74,2694.287,But that--
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2694.287,2706.882,"But an equally administrable rule here is that, even though the person you suspect objects, you can still go in, if a person with authority otherwise says you can."
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2714.399,2716.275,"--Justice Souter, I don't think they're silly cases."
2005.04-1067,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2739.015,2740.703,An expectation of privacy.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2812.047,2816.86,"--Justice Breyer, I think that's why it's important that our rule is not that the police should go away."
2005.04-1067,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2818.814,2844.929,"But I want you to address the question of how the legal category of ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" fits in with what I just said, where I'm assuming, in some social situations, you do think you'd be left alone; but, in the typical situation, stretching well beyond, but certainly including, situations of danger where the police might be involved, you wouldn't have an expectation that you will be left alone."
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2854.322,2863.152,"--Justice Breyer, the Court has precedent on this very point, and that is... and, Justice Souter, he is asking about reasonable expectations of privacy... Minnesota versus Olson."
2005.04-1067,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2918.414,2921.867,The... but this was not an uncabined search.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2931.275,2932.462,"--Yes, because that's not a search."
2005.04-1067,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2932.462,2932.573,Okay.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2938.495,2940.168,Justice--
2005.04-1067,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2940.168,2940.716,Which is what she did.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2940.716,2945.81,"--Justice Thomas, it's how it played out, because they stopped the search then, because she withdrew her consent."
2005.04-1067,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2948.951,2951.921,But she withdrew it after he observed the straw.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2951.921,2954.203,"--Yes, Justice Thomas, that's absolutely correct."
2005.04-1067,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2984.741,2987.382,"Now, any reason to believe--"
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2987.382,2987.631,Of--
2005.04-1067,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2987.631,2988.053,--but--
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2988.053,2988.867,--Sorry.
2005.04-1067,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2988.867,2990.757,--you can't enter without probable cause.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2990.757,2991.632,Right.
2005.04-1067,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2991.632,2993.57,And that's a... with exigent circumstances.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2993.57,2994.086,Yes.
2005.04-1067,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2994.086,2999.118,Suppose you have suspicions of a domestic problem that's ongoing.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3009.652,3013.215,"Justice Kennedy, I don't think that it does."
2005.04-1067,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3038.19,3039.362,You talk about that tie.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3054.74,3072.541,"--Mr. Chief Justice, the straightforward rule that I have argued for today is that if you have an equivalent interest in the premises... it is, of course, the State's rule that, if nine people object, Matlock says that any one of them can let them in, and an individual can override the objections of everybody else in the house."
2005.04-1067,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3076.276,3077.041,"What... well, what is your answer--"
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3077.041,3077.604,--I'm sorry.
2005.04-1067,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3077.604,3078.213,--to that case?
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3084.387,3086.544,I don't think that has to follow from our rule.
2005.04-1067,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3109.096,3113.972,"But the... I... you assume we got... there goes the... that... there goes any bright line administrable rule, I guess."
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3114.222,3117.425,"--Justice Souter, I honestly don't think that's true."
2005.04-1067,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3172.547,3175.016,"So, can I just take the next step in my hypothetical?"
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3181.674,3193.363,"--On our broadest rule, the husband would control, although it doesn't follow, from our... that, to affirm the judgment, you have to say that, because I think you could say that, reasonably, the person realizes they would be outvoted."
2005.04-1067,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3196.161,3198.474,"Reasonably, the person realizes he would be outvoted?"
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3198.474,3199.115,Yes.
2005.04-1067,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3199.115,3206.539,"So, it does go to his presumably objectively reasonable views of what nature of privacy he has."
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3206.539,3206.883,Yes.
2005.04-1067,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3207.226,3208.102,"So, if he thinks,"
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3215.665,3218.306,"--Mr. Chief Justice, when... I agree with you objectively."
2005.04-1067,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3265.754,3273.099,"What is the case that says that, that the child's invitation overrides the parents' objection?"
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3273.099,3276.146,"--Justice Ginsburg, that question hasn't been confronted by any court we've checked."
2005.04-1067,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3285.571,3285.805,So--
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3285.805,3286.289,--standard.
2005.04-1067,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3286.289,3287.554,--would a mother in law.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3288.321,3288.524,Yes.
2005.04-1067,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3288.524,3299.057,"But they don't have the same... they don't have the same property interest as a spouse does, as a tenant in common or whatever."
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3301.12,3305.934,"Mr. Chief Justice, that's right, but, of course, that's not the inquiry under Matlock and Rodriguez."
2005.04-1067,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3328.47,3339.129,"Mr. Goldstein, your time is almost up, but I want to know if you place any weight at all on the fact that the husband was the target in this case."
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3344.973,3348.99,"--The... I do not believe, as a matter of doctrine, that it does."

2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3402.549,3403.049,"--Oh, Justice--"
2005.04-1067,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3403.049,3403.689,Was there?
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3403.689,3404.455,--Justice Breyer--
2005.04-1067,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3404.455,3405.065,I'll go back and read it.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3405.065,3406.065,"--she said, ""I think you should""... she said--"
2005.04-1067,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3406.065,3406.393,I'll reread it.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3407.409,3407.784,--Okay.
2005.04-1067,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3409.238,3410.05,Uh huh.
2005.04-1067,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,3410.05,3418.927,"But, inescapably, what's going on, there are... I think that this is not a case that follows, necessarily, from Matlock and Rodriguez."
2005.04-1067,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3450.136,3451.184,"Thank you, Mr. Goldstein."
2005.04-1067,3,38324,paula_k_smith,,3454.169,3455.528,"No rebuttal, Your Honor."
2005.04-1067,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3455.528,3458.232,The case is submitted.
