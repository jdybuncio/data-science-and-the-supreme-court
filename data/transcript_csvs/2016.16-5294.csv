2016.16-5294,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.06,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 16-5294, McWilliams v. Dunn. Mr. Bright."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,7.06,38.1,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court, in 1985, clearly established in its decision in Ake v. Oklahoma that a poor defendant whose mental health or mental issues were a significant factor in the case, is entitled to an expert, and an expert independent of the prosecution, to assist in the evaluation, the preparation, and the presentation of an effective defense for the defendant."
2016.16-5294,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,38.1,44.735,"Suppose we thought that -- and it's not your position, I understand it -- that Ake was ambiguous on this point."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,75.635,76.72,Right.
2016.16-5294,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,76.72,79.46,-- when we say it must be a defense psychiatrist.
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,79.46,84.01,"Well, as Your Honor guessed, we don't think it's ambiguous."
2016.16-5294,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,87.195,87.685,Sorry.
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,100.835,105.46,"Well, if you accept that it was ambiguous, which, of course, we do not accept --"
2016.16-5294,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,105.46,105.735,Right.
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,105.735,118.885,"-- but, of course, I mean, this goes to some of the clearly established cases the Court has looked at where it's -- does it extend a decision that the -- the Court has -- has rendered, and is this asking for something more."
2016.16-5294,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,126.09,126.15,Why --
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,126.15,126.79,-- if it even goes to --
2016.16-5294,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,126.79,165.245,"-- is that so, Mr. Bright, if -- if it's -- we're informed correctly by the Respondent that on remand in Ake itself, the lower courts held that due process is satisfied by the assistance of a neutral psychiatrist. So if it was all that clearly established, it was not understood by -- in the very case that was argued here, and that on remand, according to the Respondent at least, the lower courts held a neutral psychiatrist is good enough."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,165.245,208.07,"Well, but whether or not the Oklahoma court got it right or wrong when the case was remanded, what -- what clearly established, we believe, starts and ends with this Court, whether something is clearly established. And when the Court says, where it's a significant factor, you have a right to an expert and then goes through the things that that expert is going to do to gather facts for the defense, to analyze facts for the defense, to even assist in cross-examination of the State's expert witness, you can't get more intimately involved in the defense of the case than being involved in the cross-examination of witnesses for the prosecution."
2016.16-5294,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,208.07,236.975,"But we're told here that the -- that the -- the prosecution didn't have a partisan expert either, that there was this -- everyone who was appointed was a neutral expert serving the court, the prosecution, and the defendant. So I think, roughly, it suggests you're asking for something that the prosecution didn't have, didn't have an independent expert."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,236.975,240.57,"Well, in -- in our case, it's very much like Ake."
2016.16-5294,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,245.815,249.86,"What do you mean by ""State experts""?"
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,249.86,250.29,They all worked --
2016.16-5294,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,250.29,252.985,Provided by the State or working for the prosecution?
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,252.985,253.7,No.
2016.16-5294,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,266.64,269.95,So you mean they were paid for work by the State --
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,269.95,270.04,Right.
2016.16-5294,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,270.04,277.62,-- as opposed to being -- working for the prosecution for a particular result in a given case.
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,277.62,289.93,"That's true, Mr. Chief Justice, but had there been an issue, which there was in this case, and should have been litigated, certainly the State has no problem having an expert."
2016.16-5294,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,336.1,348.865,"Mr. Bright, even the terminology that you are using, both here and in your briefs, contains some ambiguity, because you keep saying, well, Ake established the rights to an independent expert."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,388.28,393.075,"Well, it did, because of the way it described what the expert was to do."
2016.16-5294,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,420.84,429.3,"Suppose you have a single, court-appointed expert, and let's assume he's not paid by the State; he or she is an outside expert."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,451.875,457.165,"Well, I think the ethical duty is that you can't work both sides of the street in that way."
2016.16-5294,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,472.945,473.38,"Well, you say --"
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,473.38,473.75,So --
2016.16-5294,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,473.75,489.475,"-- in your -- in your reply brief in -- on page 1, you've got four examples where you say the language clearly shows that they were meant -- meant to be -- I don't know what the word is, but you hope it's not partisan or nonobjective, but aligned experts, I guess."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,536.305,539.77,But I don't think you can take each one in isolation.
2016.16-5294,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,564.56,567.915,"Mr. Bright, that is the essence of this."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,588.1,588.87,Correct.
2016.16-5294,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,588.87,616.285,"And so once there is evidence -- and here, there was evidence at the last moment -- that, in fact, as the prior experts have testified that certain tests should be taken, that certain signs of organic brain injury were present, once that was confirmed, what the expert was saying to the Court is now I need help."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,616.285,616.94,Right.
2016.16-5294,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,616.94,637.65,"Because this expert is -- this court-appointed expert is telling us that all these things really are irrelevant to my defense, but I have a viable claim that organic brain injury exists, and that it might have an effect and provide me with a defense."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,640.925,642.01,Exactly.
2016.16-5294,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,642.01,662.074,In what other area do we permit the State or a court to appoint -- to not fund an expert once there is viable evidence of a potential defense?
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,662.074,666.43,I -- I don't know of any. You mean with regard to mental health?
2016.16-5294,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,666.43,668.05,In the -- in any area.
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,668.05,707.07,"I mean, you look at Ford v. Wainwright, where the Court looked at the question of whether someone was competent to be executed or not, and the Court found that there, the -- for the process to work, you couldn't have what Florida had, which was just accept information from the State's doctors and not accept information from the defendant's doctors. And, of course, this Court found in Panetti v. Quarterman that that was a clearly established rule, what was in Justice Powell's concurring opinion was a clearly established rule about the procedures that were to be involved with regard to whether or not a person is competent to be executed."
2016.16-5294,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,707.07,710.915,"Now, I'm not sure that you've answered Justice Kennedy's question."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,744.83,759.46,"I -- I think to prevail under 2254(d), we have to show that there was a violation of a clearly established -- of a -- a Federal rule or a constitutional rule that was clearly established by decision of this Court."
2016.16-5294,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,765.58,769.505,"Mr. Bright, before you move on to that, you say it's clear."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,793.145,793.56,"Well, I --"
2016.16-5294,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,793.56,794.67,-- it wasn't deliberately ambiguous.
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,794.67,800.485,"-- have the greatest respect for Professor LaFave, but just like lower courts, professors make mistakes, too."
2016.16-5294,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,800.485,814.52,"Well, they do, but your position has to be that LaFave made a mistake, the Fifth Circuit made a mistake, eight State courts -- the final State courts made mistakes, the -- on remand in Ake, it was a mistake."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,831.05,837.955,"Well, I think whether a proposition is clearly established begins and ends with this Court."
2016.16-5294,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,853.67,854.08,Mr. Bright --
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,854.08,855.32,-- according to the Court's finding.
2016.16-5294,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,856.315,879.9,"As I understand your position -- and you'll correct me if I'm wrong -- you seem to be arguing that what the defendant is entitled to is an expert who will function, more or less, like the kind of expert who would be retained by the defense, if the defense were simply given funds to -- to hire an expert. Am I right in -- in thinking that?"
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,879.9,882.54,"Well, that's not what the case holds."
2016.16-5294,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,882.54,890.57,"But I -- but in terms of what this expert would do, you'd want an expert who would function more or less like that."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,890.57,895.08,"Well, to -- I mean, the prosecution can hire as many experts as it wanted."
2016.16-5294,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,895.08,895.34,Right.
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,895.34,898.12,It can choose experts that will come out the way it wants.
2016.16-5294,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,909.37,910.16,"Yeah, well, that's what I'm --"
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,910.16,910.43,But I --
2016.16-5294,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,910.43,911.33,-- that's what I'm getting at.
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,944.705,947.31,"Well, it's no different than a court-appointed lawyer."
2016.16-5294,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,947.85,953.09,"It is different from a lawyer, because a lawyer -- you know, a lawyer doesn't have to believe in the client's innocence."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,972.285,972.83,Yes.
2016.16-5294,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,972.83,973.675,Am I wrong?
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,973.675,974.51,Right.
2016.16-5294,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,974.51,983.08,"So what would you say to this court-appointed -- you -- you get one expert that's appointed -- what do you say to this expert? Now, I don't really want you to give your neutral opinion."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,987.66,988.34,No.
2016.16-5294,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,990.605,992.445,"But, Mr. Bright, why is that wrong?"
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,992.445,993.83,What? I'm sorry.
2016.16-5294,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,993.83,999.775,Why -- why is it wrong to ask an expert that's been provided to the defense to do that?
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,999.775,1000.49,"Well, I think --"
2016.16-5294,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1000.49,1004.125,"-- to say I have to defend this man, give me my best argument."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1004.125,1006.5,I -- I think that's what lawyers do.
2016.16-5294,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1006.85,1008.45,"Not lawyers, experts."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1008.45,1009.23,"Yeah, and experts."
2016.16-5294,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1025.09,1027.3,"Well, no, I understand. That really wasn't my question."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1089.475,1117.425,"But -- but the -- the expert described in the Ake opinion, Justice Alito, is someone who is a part of the defense team. I mean, this question of partisan came up, of using the word ""partisan."" Of course, parties, whether it be the prosecution, whether it be a wealthy criminal defendant, whether it be a wealthy civil litigant, are all going to hire partisan experts. They're going to hire the experts that they think will give them the opinion that will help their side of the case."
2016.16-5294,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1117.425,1117.85,Did the --
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1117.85,1117.98,But --
2016.16-5294,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1117.98,1140.68,"Did the -- did the defendant ask for an expert? On page 11 of their brief, they quote the Respondents, these court of appeals, which says that there is no indication in the record that McWilliams could not have called Dr. Goff, or the trial court indicated that it would have considered a motion to present an expert."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1150.785,1151.71,Well --
2016.16-5294,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1151.71,1155.175,"Did he ask? He said, Judge, please appoint an expert."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1155.98,1157.08,"Two things, Justice Breyer."
2016.16-5294,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1157.08,1157.14,Yeah.
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1158.76,1177.335,"Well, what he did, and you can look at what John Bivens, one of the lawyers said, right towards the end -- it was in the Joint Appendix at about 207 -- where he made a long plea, you can almost see him on bended knee reading this, in which he said, we've received these records, which show he's on psychotropic drugs."
2016.16-5294,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1188.735,1193.09,"And then he ended up by saying, that is why we renew the motion for a continuance."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1193.09,1194.05,For an expert.
2016.16-5294,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1194.67,1196.65,Does it say that? Where did it say that? I just don't see --
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1196.65,1196.74,Well --
2016.16-5294,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1196.74,1197.09,-- where he said.
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1197.09,1201.53,"-- if you read all the way through, all the motions for a continuance, I mean, half the pages."
2016.16-5294,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1201.53,1203.41,Did he ask the judge to appoint --
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1203.41,1205.03,He didn't come right out and say --
2016.16-5294,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1205.03,1206.55,"The answer is no, then; is that right?"
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1206.55,1207.92,"Well, no, I don't think that's true --"
2016.16-5294,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1207.92,1208.175,Okay.
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1208.175,1214.91,"-- because I think everybody knew what exactly was going on when he kept saying, I need an expert and I need --"
2016.16-5294,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1214.91,1224.105,"Where, somewhere else, does it become apparent that he wants the State to appoint an expert? Where? I just want to know where."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1224.105,1225.14,"Well, he says --"
2016.16-5294,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1225.14,1225.8,I'm not seeing --
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1225.8,1228.82,"-- over and over, we can't do this without an expert."
2016.16-5294,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1228.82,1228.88,Yeah.
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1230.13,1230.36,We --
2016.16-5294,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1230.36,1230.94,-- someone --
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1230.94,1231.03,-- need --
2016.16-5294,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1231.03,1232.45,Maybe he already has an expert.
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1234.595,1245.005,"Well, when the case goes up on appeal to the court of criminal appeals, both the State of Alabama and the defendant brief it on the merits of the Ake claim."
2016.16-5294,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1286.629,1291.4,May I -- may I point out --
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1291.4,1291.825,Yes.
2016.16-5294,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1291.825,1308.745,"-- on page 211A, Mr. Soble does say, ""I told Your Honor that my looking at these records were not of any value to me, that I needed to have somebody look at these records who understood them, who could interpret them for me."

And on the day of -- he had been subpoenaing the records from the prison since August, and this is October 7th -- he receives those records on the morning of the hearing itself when he gets to court."
2016.16-5294,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1388.55,1388.93,Suppose --
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1388.93,1389.75,We know we have something.

There are lots of tests."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1423.325,1424.41,That's not sufficient --
2016.16-5294,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1424.41,1424.5,Okay.
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1424.5,1424.83,-- because --
2016.16-5294,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1424.83,1431.26,So you say that there's always a conflict of interest unless the psychiatrist works for the defending -- for the defense only.
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1431.26,1431.75,No.
2016.16-5294,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1459.92,1469.03,"Mr. Bright, can I ask you for your interpretation of -- there are two paragraphs on page 85 which talk about Smith v. Baldi, which was a case --"
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1469.03,1469.13,Yes.
2016.16-5294,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1469.13,1473.025,"-- where there was, in fact, a neutral expert."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1489.985,1503.265,"Well, I think it was giving Baldi -- Smith v. Baldi a respectable burial is what it boils down to, because the court says we're in fundamental disagreement and points out that Baldi is a case that comes from 1953."
2016.16-5294,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1520.98,1522.685,"But, counsel, if we could just follow up on that."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1526.52,1527.02,No.
2016.16-5294,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1539.3,1547.62,"Where -- where is the stopping point, then? Because common law history, our tradition is that often courts could apply and appoint a neutral expert of its own choosing."
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1552.98,1554.88,It's not a partisan expert. I'm sorry.
2016.16-5294,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1554.88,1575.76,"Well, if I might just finish, and then you can tell me where I've gone off the rails. Where's the stopping point? Is it just psychiatry? Would we also have to apply the same rule in other kinds of medicine, perhaps? Forensic science? Where is the stopping point that you would advocate for the Court?"
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1575.76,1579.83,"Well, I wouldn't advocate it because it's not before the Court in this case."
2016.16-5294,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1580.16,1583.41,But it would be something we'd have -- an implication we would clearly have to consider.
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1583.41,1592.18,"Well, but -- but the thing that the Court has to consider here is the unique nature of mental health and the fact that experts widely disagree on mental health."
2016.16-5294,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1592.18,1594.44,Experts widely disagree on everything.
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1594.66,1594.89,And that --
2016.16-5294,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1594.89,1595.75,-- you hire them.
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1595.75,1597.045,And that may mean --
2016.16-5294,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1597.045,1599.39,And why they cost so very much.
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1599.39,1611.72,"And -- and many courts, State courts, other courts, have said and, of course, under the Criminal Justice Act in the Federal courts, that where there are other issues, there may be other experts as a due process question --"
2016.16-5294,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1611.72,1625.39,"That's -- that's my other question, is if due process requires a partisan expert, surely it would also require a partisan lawyer, in which case what does the Sixth Amendment do? Does it guarantee the -- the right of effective assistance of counsel, it's just superfluous?"
2016.16-5294,0,40972,stephen_b_bright,,1625.39,1633.4,"No, the Sixth Amendment guarantees a lawyer who will carry out their professional responsibilities in an ethical and legal way as they should."
2016.16-5294,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1644.57,1650.37,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Brasher."
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,1650.37,1663.64,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Ake did not hold that a neutral expert fails to satisfy the Due Process Clause. Let me talk about the psychiatric assistance that was provided in this case, because I think it's important to begin there."
2016.16-5294,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1682.11,1682.715,I'm sorry.
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,1686.93,1688.13,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2016.16-5294,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1688.13,1694.69,And I thought that the purpose of the Lunacy Committee was to see if he was mentally competent or not.
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,1694.69,1696.105,"That's incorrect, Your Honor."
2016.16-5294,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1708.73,1713.98,Did that report suggests that further tests had to be taken with respect to that?
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,1713.98,1714.55,"No, Your Honor."
2016.16-5294,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1743.1,1766.335,"Sorry, General, but if we could just focus on -- because I think it would help to just sort of -- let's assume for the moment that this defendant did not get what he was asking for, which was a defense expert, and say whether Ake entitled him to such an expert. And I just want to sort of focus on the money sentence in Ake, you know, what -- the ""we therefore hold"" sentence."
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,1819.05,1821.82,"Well, if I can answer that with two points, Your Honor."
2016.16-5294,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1829.79,1851.765,"Well, they're capable in the sense that sometimes they might, but it's not what you would -- this is -- I -- I guess I'm repeating myself, but this is the language that you use when you're talking about, not somebody who sometimes might, and is capable of, but who, in fact, will do so, to the best of his ability, assist the defendant."
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,1851.765,1859.095,And -- and I think the way an expert assists the defendant is by translating a medical diagnosis into language that lawyers can understand.
2016.16-5294,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1873.38,1880.53,"But the word ""assistance,"" you know, we use it -- we use it most often is, the defendant is entitled to the assistance of counsel."
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,1905.43,1908.335,"Well, if I could just respond to that, Justice Ginsburg."
2016.16-5294,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1926.62,1936.77,"But sometimes the Court goes beyond what the facts are, and sometimes -- you know, sometimes it issues a holding that's just precisely calibrated to the facts, and sometimes broader."
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,1972.385,1976.735,"Well, there are -- there are parts of the opinion that we would suggest that also cut in our favor."
2016.16-5294,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1986.6,1988.07,"Well, at first it does, you're exactly right."
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2010.7,2015.42,"Well, I'll count ""incredibly confusing"" as a plus for me in a Federal habeas case, where the law has to --"
2016.16-5294,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2015.42,2016.13,"No, no, no."
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2023.835,2024.4,Right.
2016.16-5294,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2034.13,2037.81,"I saw it, but what about the point that Justice Kagan raised."
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2056.85,2057.41,What -- what --
2016.16-5294,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2057.41,2068.035,"The defense has to have somebody who will conduct an appropriate examination, assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense."
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2095.845,2096.42,Well --
2016.16-5294,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2096.42,2101.63,"He came in, they presented a -- a report, I've read pages from the report."
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2116.57,2116.81,Right.
2016.16-5294,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2135.47,2138.03,"So what? So what? I'm sorry, I'm not being facetious."
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2151.94,2152.06,Well --
2016.16-5294,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2152.06,2153.185,I didn't see one here.
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2153.185,2157.24,"My point, Your Honor, is that that person who prepared the report was his expert. It was exactly what --"
2016.16-5294,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2157.24,2157.645,Mr. Goff?
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2157.645,2158.81,"Mr. Goff, exactly."
2016.16-5294,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2158.81,2160.61,He didn't seem to be his expert.
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2170.03,2172.31,"Just to be clear, he was not a member of the Lunacy Commission."
2016.16-5294,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2172.31,2172.83,"Oh, all right."
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2172.83,2177.53,He was a -- he was the head of psychology at a mental hospital.
2016.16-5294,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2180.02,2180.2,"Fine, fine."
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2197.45,2199.47,There was no cross-examination.
2016.16-5294,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2199.47,2202.88,And he was -- and why was there no cross-examination?
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2202.88,2205.1,Because he was the defense expert.
2016.16-5294,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2205.745,2207.585,Because he was the defense expert?
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2207.585,2208.53,Right.
2016.16-5294,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2208.53,2216.0,"Well, you usually meet with your expert and go over the testimony with care. Did that happen here, or could that happen here?"
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2216.0,2218.39,It -- I -- Justice Kennedy --
2016.16-5294,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2218.39,2225.04,"And -- and if he had met with the prosecution, would that have been a violation of -- of -- of his ethical obligations?"
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2225.04,2232.205,Dr. Goff comes into the case because the defendant files a motion for full neuropsychological testing after the penalty phase of trial.
2016.16-5294,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2246.32,2252.33,Could he have been consulted by either or both sides privately to prepare -- prepare the examination?
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2252.33,2256.18,I don't think that there was anything prohibiting the prosecution from talking to --
2016.16-5294,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2256.18,2279.635,"Would you -- would you object to the following disposition of the case: That we say the issue is not partisan versus independent. The issue is whether the defense had assistance from a psychiatrist in the evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense, including cross-examination of hostile or State psychiatric witnesses."
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2287.13,2291.59,I -- I think that we -- I would suggest that the right way to -- to --
2016.16-5294,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2291.59,2293.5,Would you agree with that or not?
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2293.5,2295.77,"Well, I -- I agree with it except for this one caveat --"
2016.16-5294,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2295.77,2296.45,You do agree with it.
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2296.45,2303.59,"Except for this one caveat, which is that this is a Federal habeas case, so the question would be whether the State courts unreasonably applied --"
2016.16-5294,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2303.59,2304.29,If they did not --
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2304.29,2304.74,-- the holding in Ake --
2016.16-5294,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2304.74,2322.05,"If they did not give the -- if they did not give him psychiatric assistance and pay for it, a psychiatrist who would have done those four things that I just mentioned, then they did violate clearly established law --"
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2322.05,2322.295,But --
2016.16-5294,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2322.295,2324.26,-- because that's what Ake says.
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2324.26,2331.36,"But my -- my point is though, Your Honor, is that the question under Federal habeas laws is whether the State court unreasonably applied the law."
2016.16-5294,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2334.46,2360.455,"Mr. Brasher, I thought the question on which we granted cert was whether somebody with the status of Dr. Goff sat -- whether it was clearly established that somebody with the status of Dr. Goff did not satisfy Ake, not whether Dr. Goff, given his status, did the things that he was supposed to do under Ake."
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2360.455,2362.15,"That's exactly right, Justice Alito."
2016.16-5294,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2392.17,2410.325,"Is there -- is there any jurisdiction that holds that today, that all that Ake requires is a neutral expert? I thought by now every jurisdiction recognizes that Ake requires an expert who will be, essentially, part of the defense team."
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2410.325,2415.945,"Well, this issue really has been mooted over the last 30-some-odd years because of statutory changes."
2016.16-5294,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2419.68,2442.99,"Including -- including Alabama, am I right, that in 2005, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals said Ake made it clear that an indigent defendant is entitled to an independent expert devoted to assisting his defense, not one providing the same information or advice to the court and prosecution."
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2442.99,2443.97,That's correct.
2016.16-5294,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2466.07,2497.43,"Well, if Ake says that you have a right to meaningful assistance from a -- from a psychiatrist, you, the defense, and then over time it becomes clear to us that that psychiatrist must be -- must -- must be retained for the benefit of the defense only, is that a new clearly established holding, or is it simply a refinement of a clearly established right that was set forth in Ake? The -- the Petitioner's counsel didn't seem to want to embrace that."
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2503.49,2510.605,"Well, I think the reason my -- my friend didn't want to embrace that is because when you use the word ""refinement,"" I think what you're suggesting, Justice Kennedy, is extension."
2016.16-5294,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2524.62,2527.45,What was the case where we said that? I think you're right.
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2527.45,2532.8,"The Court said -- is that in White v. Woodall, the Court said that. I should also point out that there's --"
2016.16-5294,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2532.8,2541.885,"But again, General, I mean, the actual holding of Ake calls for assistance in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense."
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2595.595,2603.23,"Well, to go to the issue of wealthy and indigence, this Court did say, in a footnote, that it was reserving that question."
2016.16-5294,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2605.9,2606.32,"No, no, no."
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2623.995,2624.31,Right.
2016.16-5294,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2624.31,2634.02,"And we're going to give this indigent person a single one who will be able to assist him in these ways, in evaluating, preparing, and presenting the defense."
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2634.02,2642.24,"And our point, Justice Kagan, is just that this question presented in this case, which is about whether a neutral expert can satisfy that, was not at issue in Ake --"
2016.16-5294,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2642.24,2645.9,"It seemed in the defense -- well, here, what about this."
2016.16-5294,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2664.04,2666.795,"Because, of course, I'm quoting from the dissent."
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2666.795,2667.1,Okay.
2016.16-5294,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2667.1,2672.225,And what the dissent says is that is precisely what the Court doesn't hold.
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2686.28,2691.87,"Well, Justice Rehnquist -- former Justice Rehnquist in that case dissented for three reasons, really, on this issue."
2016.16-5294,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2728.1,2732.15,"General, that just has to be wrong as a statement of how we figure out what clearly established is."
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2735.595,2736.06,Well --
2016.16-5294,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2736.06,2737.31,This is what the holding says.
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2742.73,2746.98,"Well, with respect, Justice Kagan, this is what the Court said in Lopez about how you evaluate this issue."
2016.16-5294,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2777.32,2777.68,Mr. Brasher --
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2777.68,2778.76,And that's the dispositive --
2016.16-5294,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2778.76,2791.035,"Mr. Brasher, one piece of evidence about what a holding means is what the parties ask for in an adversarial system, where parties generally control the outcome of cases, in terms of the issues presented."
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2802.77,2804.29,That's -- that's exactly right.
2016.16-5294,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2813.28,2815.72,"That would be quite something, I have to say, General."
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2831.435,2834.76,"Well, just to be clear, Justice Kagan, I'm not saying you look at the cert. petition itself."
2016.16-5294,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2859.44,2859.6,May I --
2016.16-5294,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2859.6,2862.295,Maybe what the parties actually --
2016.16-5294,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2862.295,2863.415,Justice Ginsburg.
2016.16-5294,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2863.415,2875.18,One -- one facet of this case you presented as -- as -- the defense is asking for a defense-oriented expert.
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2913.68,2919.205,"Just to be clear, Justice Ginsburg, are you talking about the facts of Ake, or the facts of this case?"
2016.16-5294,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2919.205,2922.11,I'm talking about the facts of Ake.
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2922.11,2922.61,Right.
2016.16-5294,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2967.99,2991.075,"I -- I'm not asking about that particular issue, but I thought that the sentencing judge now, after the guilt phase, is looking to the testimony that was given at the guilt phase by experts who were prosecution experts, not neutral experts."
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2991.075,2993.2,I'm so sorry.
2016.16-5294,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2994.81,2995.16,Yes.
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2995.16,2995.25,Okay.
2016.16-5294,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2995.25,2996.37,This is all in Ake.
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,2996.37,2997.3,Yes.
2016.16-5294,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3151.72,3152.34,No that's true.
2016.16-5294,1,56097,andrew_l_brasher,,3183.37,3185.49,I think that's a very reasonable hypothesis.
2016.16-5294,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3217.36,3220.655,"Thank you, counsel. Three minutes, Mr. Bright."
2016.16-5294,2,40972,stephen_b_bright,,3220.655,3233.9,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice. I think with -- with regard to this question about extension, I think what really has happened here is refinement, that Ake was decided in 1985."
2016.16-5294,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3371.585,3375.6,"If you prevail, it would be a new sentencing hearing, right?"
2016.16-5294,2,40972,stephen_b_bright,,3375.6,3376.175,Yes.
2016.16-5294,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3376.175,3377.635,"Yeah, because guilt is over."
2016.16-5294,2,40972,stephen_b_bright,,3377.635,3383.52,"Yes, that's true. Otherwise, if there are no questions, I'd ask the Court to reverse."
2016.16-5294,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3383.97,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
