2004.04-637,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.949,We'll hear argument now in Margaret Bradshaw v. John David Stumpf.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,9.523,15.213,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-637,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,38.506,43.573,"Counsel, I... I think he was given the death sentence."
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,44.187,45.275,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2004.04-637,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,45.275,45.841,At the end of the day.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,49.076,52.294,"There was a separate mitigation hearing under Ohio law, yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-637,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,52.294,57.355,And was it argued at that hearing by the State that Stumpf was the triggerman?
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,57.355,63.753,"Your Honor, the State said that they... they thought there was evidence to support that."
2004.04-637,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,71.564,72.32,But it was argued.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,72.32,74.105,--The court... or I'm sorry.
2004.04-637,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,76.278,88.683,And was there evidence at the recent habeas hearing that at least one of the sentencers relied on the fact that the judge thought Stumpf was the triggerman and the murderer?
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,88.683,97.155,"Your Honor, after... at the time of the original sentencing hearing there was no other evidence, this new evidence of which he's complaining--"
2004.04-637,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,97.155,97.382,Right.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,97.382,97.841,--didn't exist.
2004.04-637,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,99.551,99.733,Right.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,99.733,102.161,--he then moved to vacate his sentence at the State--
2004.04-637,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,102.161,102.378,Right.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,102.378,102.832,--court.
2004.04-637,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,105.045,105.814,Yes.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,105.814,108.058,"--one of the judges said, it may have made a difference."
2004.04-637,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,122.526,133.062,"Well, I guess my concern actually is more with the sentencing proceeding here, in light of what's happened, than with the guilty plea."
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,140.826,148.0,"I... I guess that would be conceivable, Your Honor, although I note that there's only one due process claim he's making."
2004.04-637,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,162.169,162.453,Why--
2004.04-637,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,162.453,169.23,Do you think he has waived any due process claim insofar as it applies to the sentencing?
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,171.476,173.254,"No, Your Honor, I wouldn't say that."
2004.04-637,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,189.863,199.371,"--Why do you argue that if there is no due process violation with respect to the actual plea, there is, therefore, no due process violation with respect to the sentence?"
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,199.371,203.919,"Well, because his theory, Justice Souter, is the same with regard to both."
2004.04-637,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,205.529,213.612,"Yes, but we... we may say the theory really is... is not sufficiently relevant with respect to the plea but that it is with respect to the sentence."
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,213.612,215.815,"--That's conceivable, Your Honor."
2004.04-637,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,221.232,223.095,I... I... no question about that.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,223.095,226.502,--the thrust of our arguments before this Court were directed towards the conviction.
2004.04-637,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,231.746,231.961,No.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,231.961,238.691,"--clear that, A, we haven't, but B, in any event, the due process theory sounds the same in both."
2004.04-637,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,249.04,249.224,No.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,277.39,297.515,"--Well, Your Honor, referring to page 187 and 188 of the joint appendix, he says, given those circumstances, although we believe the evidence does prove he was the shooter of Mary Jane Stout, legally, technically, I don't believe it makes any difference when you have two people acting in concert for the joint and unlawful purpose of committing an aggravated robbery and... and murder results."
2004.04-637,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,297.515,302.406,Did... did the prosecutor ever say he was the triggerman?
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,306.587,309.619,He said there's ample evidence from which the court could conclude--
2004.04-637,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,309.619,317.242,"But did he take the second step and say there's ample evidence and he was, in fact, the triggerman and you should so find, or in so many words?"
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,317.242,332.003,"--In so many words, Your Honor, in connection with the mitigation phase, in... in connection with the factual basis hearing even, he put on the evidence saying, you know, Mr. Stumpf says he wasn't the shooter and gives a lot of reasons to discount that evidence."
2004.04-637,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,347.674,357.653,"Well, the... the evidence was Stumpf... Stumpf himself who said Wesley was the triggerman with respect to Mrs. Stout."
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,421.215,423.842,"To vacate the sentence, yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-637,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,423.842,424.033,Yes.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,462.195,482.275,"Well, A, I think that's an inference that's supported by the fact that he voted to deny the motion, but B, in any event, there's been an independent reweighing of all of the evidence in the Ohio intermediate appellate court and that court said that... very specifically said, even if we didn't believe he was the principal... or principal offender, the actual shooter... we do believe that."
2004.04-637,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,493.239,496.698,But it would be appropriate because the statute permits it.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,522.08,530.522,"--Well, Justice... Justice Ginsburg, the... the evidence wasn't available at the time of the original sentence."
2004.04-637,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,551.818,568.593,"Well, what... what is the rule if there are two successive... there are successive trials with different defendants and there can only be one shooter and in each trial it's found that the defendant is the shooter?"
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,583.567,589.612,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, I... I think it depends, at least in part, on what role that finding played."
2004.04-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,613.568,614.158,By whom?
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,615.571,618.054,"--Your Honor, I... I think that's a great question."
2004.04-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,618.054,618.653,Do we flip a coin?
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,618.653,630.408,"Well, I... I think the point is probably both would have some kind of claim in that I don't think the State can pursue and convict two people on necessarily inconsistent theories because at that--"
2004.04-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,630.408,631.223,Why... why is that?
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,685.645,688.394,"--And I don't know that there is either, Your Honor."
2004.04-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,693.102,694.936,Due... due process doesn't mean perfection.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,698.337,703.674,"--I... I agree with that, Your Honor, and I hate to argue against my position, so I... I do this gently."
2004.04-637,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,726.176,729.222,When... when did this new evidence come to light?
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,729.222,735.793,--The new evidence came to light some 6 months after his plea was entered and after the sentence was announced.
2004.04-637,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,735.793,739.991,Did the other guy confess to a... kind of a jailhouse snitch?
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,739.991,742.276,"To... to a jailhouse informant, yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-637,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,761.596,766.983,But it is the case that he argued that... that you should find him guilty because he was the triggerman.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,832.031,835.43,"Well, Your Honor, first, I... I don't think they're... he was without process."
2004.04-637,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,841.455,859.848,"Oh, he could... he could get into court, but as I understand it, there was no recognition here that there is... that there is in fact something wrong with the two inconsistent... or the two arguments of the State, each of which, if accepted, will necessarily result in one false conclusion."
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,859.848,876.988,"--Well, Your Honor, the... again, the intermediate appellate court independently reweighed this evidence and concluded that even if we conclude that Mr. Stumpf is not the shooter, even if that's our... our conclusion... it isn't, but even were we to conclude that, the death penalty would still be appropriate here."
2004.04-637,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,882.156,883.314,Maybe... maybe that's enough.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,907.561,908.241,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2004.04-637,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,925.315,925.961,And... and I take it also--
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,925.961,927.087,--That was part of the record on appeal.
2004.04-637,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,927.087,934.151,"--stipulated or represented or admitted, whatever, that in fact the State had argued in the second case that Wesley was the triggerman."
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,934.151,935.844,"I believe so, Your Honor."
2004.04-637,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,944.229,945.635,Because of being... because of being the triggerman.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,945.635,949.223,--The only way to be the principal offender under that specification is to be the triggerman.
2004.04-637,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1024.539,1031.696,"But, General Cole, isn't there a distinction between eligibility for the death penalty and actually making the decision to impose the death penalty?"
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1045.648,1055.536,"--I... I think it's definitely a fact that the court weighs, although here we have evidence that at least one Ohio court took that possibility into account and said even in light of that fact--"
2004.04-637,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1055.536,1055.981,Right.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1055.981,1057.966,--we still conclude that the death sentence is appropriate.
2004.04-637,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1063.049,1065.655,"Well, and the original sentencer might... might not have done the same thing."
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1066.55,1072.871,"--Well, this did go back in front of the two... two of the three original sentencers and they declined to allow him to vacate his sentence."
2004.04-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1081.843,1093.683,"As I understand the facts, even if he hadn't shot the wife to death, which was what the prosecution was for, he had tried to kill the husband, shooting him twice in the head?"
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1093.683,1096.75,"--Twice at the head from essentially point-blank range, Your Honor."
2004.04-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1096.75,1097.629,From point-blank range.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1097.629,1098.059,Right.
2004.04-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1098.059,1109.893,"And then there was some discussion that the... that the lying, seriously wounded husband heard between the two perpetrators, and then there was shooting of the wife."
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1131.322,1138.497,"Your Honor, we agree and that certainly falls well within the... the range of culpability that this Court set out in--"
2004.04-637,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1138.497,1144.746,There's no doubt that they could have... the trier of fact could have reached the same conclusion.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1222.597,1227.504,"--Well, first, Your Honor, I don't think we have to guess what the judges would do because the judges did what they did."
2004.04-637,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1229.163,1241.427,"They denied it, but as I read what the Ohio court said after the denial, I thought it did probably rest upon their determination that Stumpf had pulled the trigger."
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1241.427,1244.008,--And certainly the intermediate--
2004.04-637,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1244.008,1244.438,Did you think that?
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1244.438,1252.536,"--Well, the intermediate appellate court expressly said that its determination did not turn on who had pulled the trigger, that they would have reached the same conclusion independent of who pulled the trigger."
2004.04-637,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1252.536,1257.758,But the panel... the panel that didn't reopen... there was no reopening because they denied the motion.
2004.04-637,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1261.077,1268.364,"It's the Supreme Court of Ohio that then I think I got my impression from, and of course, they don't know either."
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1268.364,1268.934,Well--
2004.04-637,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1268.934,1272.427,The fact is we don't know what that original panel thought.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1272.427,1272.897,--That's--
2004.04-637,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1272.897,1279.663,"Well, it isn't that... isn't one of the answers to Justice Breyer's questions that you... you never know exactly what a fact finder would do."
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1283.958,1284.732,--That's--
2004.04-637,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1284.732,1295.207,"And when... and when you have someone who shoots the first person and is obviously attempting to kill him, and then there's an apparent discussion... not... not 100 percent clear that those were the two voices."
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1301.573,1302.955,--I would think that's--
2004.04-637,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1302.955,1304.014,Absolutely right.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1319.992,1320.461,--But--
2004.04-637,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1320.461,1323.617,And that's what gives rise to the problem in the case.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1323.617,1336.494,"--But, Justice Breyer, I think it... it's always going to be the case that after a sentence is announced, there's the possibility that new evidence might come up that would cause us to say we can't know for sure what this panel would have done with that new evidence."
2004.04-637,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1337.384,1344.125,"--the State say when it comes to the panel, the reopening panel, we'll tell you something."
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1370.106,1370.627,--Mr. Wesley.
2004.04-637,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1370.627,1371.307,--Mr. Wesley.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1371.307,1374.576,"But, Your Honor, I'm not sure that that would have been the State's position."
2004.04-637,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1382.326,1382.621,Yes.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1385.833,1390.267,"They did, Your Honor, and Mr. Wesley... it isn't as though all the new evidence is in Mr. Stumpf's favor."
2004.04-637,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1407.225,1407.492,"Okay, but wait."
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1463.306,1471.689,"--The State... and I would encourage the Court to look at the State's response to that motion, which is in joint appendix at 126."
2004.04-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1498.559,1499.564,Could... could I get one fact?
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1507.434,1508.568,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2004.04-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1508.568,1517.03,But what was introduced was... was the testimony of one of his jailhouse companions who said that Wesley had told him that he was the shooter.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1522.964,1526.979,As the court expressly... or as... as the State expressly noted in its closing in that case--
2004.04-637,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1526.979,1530.813,"Yes, but the State's position was that the jailhouse informant had told the truth, wasn't it?"
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1530.813,1532.096,--In closing--
2004.04-637,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1532.096,1532.651,At the trial.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1532.651,1538.161,"--In... in closing at that trial, Your Honor, the... the prosecutor was relatively agnostic, frankly."
2004.04-637,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1539.982,1541.113,He at least put in the evidence.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1541.113,1546.5,"--He... he put in the evidence, and then he said, look, from this evidence you could conclude that Wesley was the shooter."
2004.04-637,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1547.404,1551.698,And normally you don't put in evidence unless you think it will support a proposition that you... that you're in favor of.
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1551.698,1563.898,"--Well, and Your Honor, I... I think if he could show Wesley was the shooter, that would, of course, support a conviction against Wesley, but he recognized that the jury didn't necessarily need to believe that, and in fact, he wasn't relying on that in order to secure the conviction."
2004.04-637,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1563.898,1565.867,May I ask you one final question?
2004.04-637,0,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1598.379,1600.537,"Because, Your Honor, the State is not the fact finder."
2004.04-637,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1611.693,1612.746,"Very well, Mr. Cole."
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,1615.053,1623.58,"In light of the questioning, I'd like to indicate what exactly was argued below and what was the rulings."
2004.04-637,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1631.146,1632.306,Who is they?
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,1632.306,1635.945,--The prosecutors.
2004.04-637,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1649.573,1650.585,"Mr. Freedman, it wasn't a trial."
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,1652.497,1661.091,"--That's correct, but there was... but... but in Ohio there's a requirement to have an actual prove-up of the aggravating factor itself."
2004.04-637,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1689.533,1696.231,"I... I thought the prosecutor in closing in the Wesley trial said, it could have been Stumpf, but it doesn't make any difference."
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,1696.231,1697.159,They--
2004.04-637,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1697.159,1697.995,I thought they argued both?
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,1697.995,1700.195,--That... they really didn't argue both.
2004.04-637,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1712.069,1714.178,"Well, but it's at the bottom of page 187."
2004.04-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1717.26,1718.086,What... what page is that?
2004.04-637,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1718.086,1720.97,--187 like the... of the joint appendix.
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,1734.284,1735.652,But the... but they urged.
2004.04-637,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1762.304,1771.07,"Well, I think there's quite a difference in... in case A where you say our position is that Stumpf was the shooter, pure and simple."
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,1782.202,1786.665,"--But... but they took the position of actually urging, making a recommendation."
2004.04-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1797.316,1799.19,What... what was the due process violation here?
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,1801.493,1804.55,"The due process violation, Your Honor, would be--"
2004.04-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1804.55,1805.379,--Was in the first trial?
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,1805.379,1806.943,"--No, of course, there wasn't in the first trial."
2004.04-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1806.943,1809.791,But that's the trial that you're trying to get set aside here.
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,1809.791,1814.407,We submit that the due process error is at the motion to vacate.
2004.04-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1827.683,1828.095,"Well, it was."
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,1835.695,1837.876,--Because they've taken inconsistent positions.
2004.04-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1844.786,1848.847,--Not... not if they said in the second trial it doesn't matter whether he's the shooter.
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,1848.847,1851.531,I think they did more than it didn't... it just didn't matter.
2004.04-637,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1864.786,1874.978,"Suppose the State had said on motion for resentencing in Stumpf's trial, Your Honor, we took the position that Wesley was the shooter in Wesley's trial."
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,1890.261,1893.007,"It's different, but that's not what happened."
2004.04-637,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1895.266,1899.331,"It... it would... in the case I put, would your argument be the same, and if so, why?"
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,1899.331,1907.911,"--I... I put it that it's not the same because they... first of all, in reality, that's not what they did."
2004.04-637,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1934.246,1937.402,"That was introduced by Wesley, not by the prosecution."
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,1937.402,1938.338,--That's correct.
2004.04-637,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1977.669,1991.454,"Mr. Freedman, you're trying to read back now into what apparently you recognize is... is not a flawed initial sentencing hearing."
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,1991.454,1992.55,That's correct.
2004.04-637,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1992.55,2010.808,"And it might be more persuasive if the trier were a jury when the motion to vacate is made, but these are judges whose business it is to preside over these kinds of cases."
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2020.777,2021.88,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2004.04-637,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2021.88,2029.495,"Comes back to them and says, judges, don't vacate the sentence that you yourself entered."
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2043.01,2060.21,"The due process violation is that at the minimum, assuming that... that a weighing is even appropriate here, they never weighed it, and clearly any indication that there was a waiver... a... a weighing of whether Mr. Stumpf would be put to death as an aider and abetter."
2004.04-637,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2069.614,2071.484,"Well, they didn't have to take it as true."
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2148.032,2152.741,We submit the due process violation comes at the time of the motion to vacate.
2004.04-637,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2164.729,2167.413,"But it... I mean, that... that statement is true, I take it."
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2167.413,2169.488,But... but they're also urging a position.
2004.04-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2191.839,2196.055,"Well, because it seems to me they... they would have two arguments."
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2228.46,2236.643,We... we proffer to the Court that they shouldn't be taking inconsistent positions as to... in a death penalty case in the sentencing--
2004.04-637,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2236.643,2239.659,What should... what... was Wesley then denied due process?
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2271.736,2274.711,--I... I don't believe that Wesley was denied due process.
2004.04-637,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2296.255,2307.584,"Well, do you concede that the evidence presented in the Stumpf proceeding was sufficient to support a finding of guilt as an aider and abetter?"
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2312.506,2318.103,"Without the Wesley evidence, I... I... at the initial trial, I certainly would concede that."
2004.04-637,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2318.103,2319.134,"Right, right."
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2319.134,2330.385,As... as to... as to whether the evidence that you learn from the Wesley trial... that's a much closer question because the... the aggravating factor in this case--
2004.04-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2330.385,2332.703,"She asked as aider or abetter, not as shooter."
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2332.703,2333.932,"--Okay, all right."
2004.04-637,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2335.962,2350.904,"And as to that, it seems to me the guilty plea can stand and the only question that, it seems to me, I would have would be with the sentencing, and I'm not sure that has to be overturned."
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2350.904,2352.032,Well--
2004.04-637,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2352.032,2354.126,So it would help to focus on that.
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2354.126,2354.86,--I--
2004.04-637,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2354.86,2361.316,"Did you address, on behalf of Stumpf, some allegation that he has to be resentenced?"
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2361.316,2363.846,"--That's correct, and that's what the Sixth Circuit--"
2004.04-637,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2363.846,2364.817,Is that still before us?
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2364.817,2366.167,--That... that is correct.
2004.04-637,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2366.167,2368.13,Or has that been subsumed somehow?
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2368.13,2368.694,No.
2004.04-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2383.555,2397.645,"I thought a State appellate court had effectively reweighed and effectively resentenced, saying that this additional evidence would, in our view, have made no difference."
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2425.188,2428.964,"--Well... well, I'd like to ask... answer that in two ways."
2004.04-637,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2503.866,2514.634,"What is your best case, Mr. Freedman, for the idea that an inconsistency, such as you say was present here, is a violation of due process?"
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2514.634,2518.618,--The best case we cite in our brief is Green v. Georgia.
2004.04-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2518.618,2520.667,Which one?
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2520.667,2525.101,Green v. Georgia where they came in with inconsistent positions.
2004.04-637,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2525.101,2537.914,"Mr. Freedman, you've... you've argued just a second ago that both of the appellate courts decided the case or went through so-called reweighing on a false premise that he had pleaded guilty to being the shooter."
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2548.215,2550.471,"In all candor, I don't know."
2004.04-637,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2553.176,2553.689,Yes.
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2609.54,2616.28,"On... on this... on this record, we would have a due process claim for twofold."
2004.04-637,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2623.316,2624.351,I'm... I'm not getting it.
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2625.061,2632.392,"--I mean... I mean, it's... it's that they honestly believed that Wesley... that in the Wesley trial, that Eastman testified truthfully."
2004.04-637,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2633.786,2637.153,"Well, can't they... can't they profit from the jury's verdict?"
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2637.153,2652.46,"Perhaps, but not in this particular case because what the jury weighed in Wesley was not only Eastman's testimony, they weighed the fact that Stumpf pled guilty, was found to be the principal offender, and was sentenced to death."
2004.04-637,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2663.214,2667.539,The jury simply decided they didn't want to sentence two people to death for the same offense.
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2667.539,2668.12,--Right.
2004.04-637,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2672.037,2675.499,Can I ask you a procedural question here?
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2738.769,2745.245,"They... they argued generally in... in the record, and it was... it was somewhat cryptic."
2004.04-637,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2747.189,2747.591,All right.
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2748.903,2749.571,--I'm sorry.
2004.04-637,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2753.694,2757.84,I'm not interested in what defense counsel did or did not say.
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2762.799,2763.382,Thank you.
2004.04-637,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2763.382,2767.112,And my point there is my... do I repeat it or do you have it?
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2767.112,2768.013,"I have it now, yes."
2004.04-637,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2786.78,2787.221,All right.
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2798.406,2798.693,--Okay.
2004.04-637,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2798.693,2805.648,"They went on both grounds, first the confession... sorry... the guilty plea, and second, the inconsistency."
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2815.463,2815.882,Okay.
2004.04-637,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2815.882,2818.517,You understand what the problem is or shall I--
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2818.517,2818.89,"Yes, I see it."
2004.04-637,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2822.57,2831.965,--The Sixth Circuit seemed to be addressing the inconsistency between the sentencing proceeding of Stumpf and the Wesley trial.
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2845.125,2847.246,I... I... maybe I should clarify.
2004.04-637,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2851.549,2869.542,"It's relevant in terms of evidence, but I think you're asking us to say that there is a due process violation because of the inconsistency between what the prosecutor said at the Wesley trial and what the prosecutor said when Stumpf made his motion to vacate."
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2870.249,2870.703,That's correct.
2004.04-637,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2870.703,2871.185,All right.
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2876.951,2878.279,I'm uncertain.
2004.04-637,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2880.268,2881.448,So I read this.
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2896.53,2906.478,"Well, as an... as an alternative, the Court could remand back to have the Sixth Circuit--"
2004.04-637,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2906.478,2910.918,"Did you raise that argument before the Sixth Circuit, the one that you're making now?"
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2910.918,2915.594,"--With absolute certainty, Mr. Chief Justice, yes, because they asked the same questions."
2004.04-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2929.609,2940.381,What if... what if Wesley comes in with a... with a motion to vacate now and... and he points to the inconsistency with the... with the Stumpf trial?
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2947.62,2949.625,"Well, he certainly wouldn't have the death sentence."
2004.04-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2954.798,2955.521,Yes.
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2955.521,2957.087,He might.
2004.04-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2959.394,2979.246,"So a jury, having found both of them guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and possibly on a basis that... or not a jury but the judges and possibly on a basis that has nothing to do with whether they were the shooter, you think both of them are entitled to have the death sentence vacated."
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2980.789,2982.861,"--Well, in all due respect, only one has the sentence--"
2004.04-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2982.861,2984.212,Which one?
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2988.092,2991.743,"--Not... not as to the death... not as to... not as to the death sentence, no."
2004.04-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2991.743,2991.924,Why?
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,2991.924,2992.49,Why?
2004.04-637,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2997.824,3000.435,I thought Wesley didn't receive a death sentence.
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,3000.435,3001.001,"--No, he did not."
2004.04-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3001.544,3001.799,No.
2004.04-637,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3002.698,3003.073,Okay.
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,3009.929,3013.405,--There's still an issue out there because this is killing a witness.
2004.04-637,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3049.395,3050.301,But that's Stumpf's case.
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,3050.301,3051.103,"Yes, that's correct."
2004.04-637,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3051.103,3051.251,Yes.
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,3051.832,3052.346,So I'm saying that he would not--
2004.04-637,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3052.346,3054.191,--I don't see where Wesley--
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,3054.191,3056.666,"--No, Wesley would not have... Wesley would not have that scenario under--"
2004.04-637,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3056.666,3062.603,--So... so Wesley would have neither a... a due process claim with respect to sentence nor with respect to guilt.
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,3062.603,3062.934,--That's correct.
2004.04-637,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3063.593,3075.381,"But now your... your part about the guilt, the Sixth Circuit agreed with you because it vacated not only the sentence, but the conviction."
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,3081.181,3106.784,"And... and what they... they deduced from that is that the... the evidence of the Wesley trial... their position is that... and the position that... that the prosecutor took and the evidence that Eastman took, that there would be no specific intent as to the killing of... of Mary Jane Stout inferred from the shooting of Norman Stout because he dropped the gun."
2004.04-637,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3119.336,3127.691,"I... I thought the... the specific intent element would be satisfied if... if they, by plan, went to the scene with... with deadly weapons."
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,3127.691,3131.685,I believe under Ohio law that that's not correct.
2004.04-637,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3138.682,3147.375,"I thought the State argued that knowledge... there's this plan, and they had a common design to rob."
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,3171.023,3177.446,But I... I believe that they needed a plan for... for the killing of a witness.
2004.04-637,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3187.006,3191.617,"Did... did any judge say that, any judge on the Sixth Circuit say that that was the Ohio law?"
2004.04-637,1,15934,alan_m_freedman,,3191.617,3193.187,--I believe so.
2004.04-637,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3276.493,3280.204,"Thank you, Mr. Freedman."
2004.04-637,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,3282.464,3297.702,"Justice Ginsburg, to respond to your question, under Ohio law you do not need to... to plan to kill the witness in order to have specific intent for aggravated murder."
2004.04-637,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3352.754,3354.11,You... you mean at the hearing on the motion to vacate.
2004.04-637,2,20687,douglas_r_cole,,3354.11,3356.931,--Hearing on the motion to vacate and further appellate review.
