1974.73-6336,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.979,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in Number 73-6336, Rogers against the United States."
1974.73-6336,0,40239,ralph_w_parnell_jr,,29.508,33.997,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-6336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,254.446,262.709,"In five occasions, three of them on that morning in the Holiday Inn resident dining room and that two were later to the police officers, isn't it?"
1974.73-6336,0,40239,ralph_w_parnell_jr,,262.709,264.361,That's correct.
1974.73-6336,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,265.078,266.813,Substantially the same statement each time?
1974.73-6336,0,40239,ralph_w_parnell_jr,,266.813,273.737,"Substantially, the same statement, also substantially the same conversation each time."
1974.73-6336,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,273.737,276.35,Was there something said about killing the President?
1974.73-6336,0,40239,ralph_w_parnell_jr,,276.35,280.709,"This was said I believe, Your Honor, to the police officers."
1974.73-6336,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,701.73,709.624,"Mr. Parnell, are you going to deal with the suggestion of the Solicitor General we ought not reach this question?"
1974.73-6336,0,40239,ralph_w_parnell_jr,,709.624,713.197,"No Your Honor, I'm not."
1974.73-6336,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,713.197,722.987,"So what your reaction to it? Apparently, the Government is saying, they don't want to retry this man and that this conviction ought to be set aside."
1974.73-6336,0,40239,ralph_w_parnell_jr,,722.987,733.713,"Certainly, Your Honor as defense counsel I would adopt any argument that the Solicitor General may have towards releasing my client or acquitting him on any basis, I certainly would."
1974.73-6336,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,733.713,739.739,He's given you a very good opening on the subject suppose you address yourself to that question briefly.
1974.73-6336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,739.739,749.168,You didn't ever raise that question yourself did you in the Court of Appeals or feel it was sufficient to call either to the attention of the Court of Appeals or to this Court?
1974.73-6336,0,40239,ralph_w_parnell_jr,,749.168,750.845,"No, we did not raise that issue."
1974.73-6336,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,756.285,764.127,"Mr. Parnell, out of -- is it incarcerated now or is he out on bail?"
1974.73-6336,0,40239,ralph_w_parnell_jr,,765.662,773.515,"Your Honor he was sentenced to five years, he -- the Fifth Circuit expressed some concern about the sentence."
1974.73-6336,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,835.366,837.931,I would support -- suppose you would support.
1974.73-6336,0,40239,ralph_w_parnell_jr,,837.931,842.082,"Yes very definitely, we would support it anyway."
1974.73-6336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,842.082,846.94,"Well, if you would support it and thought it was of any importance at all?"
1974.73-6336,0,40239,ralph_w_parnell_jr,,852.378,861.4,Because we did not find that about it until -- I would assume until we got to the Court of Appeals or even after that.
1974.73-6336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,861.4,868.803,"Well, if you find out about when you got the Court of Appeals, why didn't you press that there?"
1974.73-6336,0,40239,ralph_w_parnell_jr,,868.803,888.082,"To be honest with you, we felt like that the issues involved as far as Mr. Rogers was concerned we thought that we had a better argument on the law than with this technical violation of the other law."
1974.73-6336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,897.748,905.951,"I know but on the Court -- when the Court pulled the jury you had some implication of it, didn't you?"
1974.73-6336,0,40239,ralph_w_parnell_jr,,905.951,908.187,"We had some indication in, yes we did."
1974.73-6336,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,908.187,910.051,And you still did nothing about it?
1974.73-6336,0,40239,ralph_w_parnell_jr,,910.051,913.035,No.
1974.73-6336,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,913.035,922.52,"But, counsel suppose we hear from your friend and you can reserve some time for rebuttal if that's seems desirable to you?"
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,927.021,931.5,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-6336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1068.067,1072.962,"Well, are those threats made to any private individual or were they're made to the police?"
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1072.962,1076.101,"They were made to both, Mr. Justice."
1974.73-6336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1082.993,1085.548,Now that I've interrupted you.
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1088.807,1092.155,He said he was going to do that in Washington DC.
1974.73-6336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1092.155,1095.137,And he was in Shreveport which is a little ways away?
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1095.137,1096.78,He was in Shreveport.
1974.73-6336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1096.78,1101.493,It's a little ways from Washington.
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1101.493,1103.115,"That's no question, it's a little way."
1974.73-6336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1109.502,1116.02,Is it also true that when he goes in those direction they lockup and that's like him.
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1116.02,1125.73,If there is a knowledge of the threat and if the Secret service has adequate advanced information they would take precautions.
1974.73-6336,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1133.086,1136.627,Did Mr. Rogers say he was going to walk to Washington?
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1136.627,1146.14,He said that and I construe that as meaning that he was going to hitchhike because in the statement to the police officer.
1974.73-6336,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1165.773,1171.001,And the police did not elect to arrest him or take him in custody?
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1171.001,1173.456,"The police did in fact take him into custody, Mr. Justice."
1974.73-6336,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1173.456,1178.969,But didn't they release him or that any bond?
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1178.969,1181.726,The record is not entirely clear on that.
1974.73-6336,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1203.789,1209.16,Was there any charge lodged against him by the Shreveport police?
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1209.16,1221.909,No charge was lodged against him although the Shreveport police did notify the Secret Service of the fact of this threat and it was on at the behalf of the Secret Service that Mr. Rogers was then arrested.
1974.73-6336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1221.909,1228.111,Was it agreed that he hadn't violated any Louisiana law?
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1228.111,1233.139,I can only testify -- I can only recount what the record states.
1974.73-6336,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1308.74,1312.011,"By mad, do you think he meant angry or crazy?"
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1312.011,1317.674,I think that would be an inference on my part but I would assume he meant crazy.
1974.73-6336,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1325.321,1342.41,"Mr. Tuttle, your suggestion that this conviction we set aside be accompanied where the statement that if it is set aside, the Government will not retry him some of the things you were saying seem however inconsistent with that determination."
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1344.978,1355.247,"Well, that judgment has been made on reflection on the facts of the case, on the --"
1974.73-6336,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1355.247,1359.367,"Well, this is what the Government also thinks, did it not?"
1974.73-6336,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1360.862,1361.331,I suppose --
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1361.331,1366.452,"I didn't -- Mr. Justice, I didn't say that anybody thought it was not a real threat."
1974.73-6336,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1368.642,1369.229,I know you didn't.
1974.73-6336,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1380.144,1385.922,I suppose also the Government is taking into account that he is been in prison for two years or more already.
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1385.922,1387.96,He has been imprisoned for more than two years.
1974.73-6336,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1399.675,1406.031,Was he still being confined other than separately for some alcoholic problem?
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1406.031,1418.373,"Well, he is on -- the sentence to included a five-year condition of sentence of probation which included as a condition thereof participation in the Alcoholics Anonymous Program."
1974.73-6336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1422.236,1433.671,"Well, why would a man who was not under the influence of alcohol wasn't drunkard, why was his probation put on Alcoholics Anonymous?"
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1433.671,1438.192,Because the man has a history -- a chronic history of alcoholism.
1974.73-6336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1439.059,1443.121,But I mean he is a chronic alcoholic.
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1443.121,1446.428,There is evidence to that effect.
1974.73-6336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1446.428,1447.644,And --
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1447.644,1448.021,And yet there is evidence that he didn't --
1974.73-6336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1448.021,1463.827,"Well, there must be something wrong with anybody to goes into it jail -- I mean, a precinct, the station of police and confesses to a crime that the only way he could commit it was by confessing to it."
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1463.827,1485.267,But the crime we're dealing with -- the crime that presents the background to all of these law and in our concern is the crime of presidential assassination and I would assume we would all agree that any one who -- would even contemplate such a crime would be in some sense unstable and then some sense are not.
1974.73-6336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1485.267,1490.566,"Well, he doesn't been offered not to go in and then confess, wouldn't he?"
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1513.794,1519.41,We are not going to retry him because of all of the circumstances of the case.
1974.73-6336,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1682.144,1694.887,I suppose you're suggesting that any alert defense counsel in those circumstances would have insisted on an unqualified verdict in order as he would hope that this would force a verdict of not guilty?
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1694.887,1710.572,"I would assume so, Mr. Chief Justice, because if the jury is talking about mercy, he may feel that they are taking the possibility of punishment into the account to break a deadlock or to resolve a question in favor of guilt."
1974.73-6336,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1730.418,1740.988,"So, I gather Mr. Tuttle your view is that this falls within the category of plain error which maybe addressed even though objection was not made."
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1740.988,1764.934,"And that is our view, Mr. Justice, and for the reason that precisely because this was a unilateral communication to the jury which counsel was not informed about, they were not in the position to object to it and not knowing about it, it is hard for us to say that they knowingly waived any objection that they might have to this circumstance."
1974.73-6336,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1830.694,1835.532,You're free to submit on briefs on those questions counsel unless there are any questions from the bench.
1974.73-6336,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1835.532,1838.547,"Well, I have a good deal of question Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1846.306,1851.25,"Well, very well Mr. Justice, I'm prepared to proceed with that."
1974.73-6336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1851.25,1860.079,"Well, why wouldn't you -- I think we heard the government more effective condition (Inaudible)?"
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1860.079,1863.986,"I don't understand your question Mr. Justice, excuse me."
1974.73-6336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1863.986,1874.363,"Well, I've just remarked you, I've never heard the Solicitor General's office take position like this in this Court asking the Court if it has any questions and otherwise we won't argue the case."
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1874.363,1874.966,"Well, Mr. Justice --"
1974.73-6336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1874.966,1878.094,Have you -- have you heard it before?
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1878.094,1882.912,"Mr. Justice, I apologize if my suggestion is an inappropriate one to the Court."
1974.73-6336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1882.912,1886.662,You don't use the -- except the cases on briefs.
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1886.662,1898.114,I -- the reason why I made the suggestion was merely because we thought the case would probably be disposed of on the ground that we had raised.
1974.73-6336,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1898.114,1901.759,"Well, it wasn't."
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,1901.759,1914.839,"It was not and therefore, I suggested that I was prepared to proceed and I apologize for putting it in the form of a question rather than a continuing presentation."
1974.73-6336,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2230.287,2244.2,I suppose that provision that Mr. Volstead request on the Congress would also protect the newspaper or that in these days a radio or television commentator who repeated the --
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,2244.2,2257.623,"As a matter of news, I think that would fall precisely within that discussion and that shows the point of having the word “knowingly and willfully” in the statute in our construction of the statute."
1974.73-6336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2266.751,2279.173,"Well, before you get there Mr. Tuttle, during the two years he was in jail, suppose he made the same threat, will he violate the statute?"
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,2279.173,2285.855,"I would have to -- before I could answer that question, know the circumstances under which they were made."
1974.73-6336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2289.821,2292.985,The exact same statements you made here.
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,2292.985,2294.47,I'm going to Washington.
1974.73-6336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2294.47,2294.939,No sir.
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,2302.42,2309.611,"If he repeated them as a matter of saying, “I was convicted for the following words"" or in circumstances which led -- which the fact finder --"
1974.73-6336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2309.611,2316.562,"Mr. Tuttle, I said he says the exact same words and nothing else."
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,2320.974,2336.954,I would think that those would probably be words of repetition of explanation of what he had said before and would not constitute a true threat.
1974.73-6336,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2352.579,2365.645,"How about now where he is now in a place as nicely called an alcoholic place, suppose he repeats in there and when you leave there I'm going to take you to the cell and so."
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,2369.242,2370.73,That's correct.
1974.73-6336,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2555.563,2571.527,"As that well that would be true about threat they communicated to the target of the threat but is it going to be true of a threat against acts when made to A, B and C?"
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,2571.527,2572.96,I believe it is.
1974.73-6336,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2599.217,2609.024,You're speaking of an established procedure that whenever such threats come to the notice of local police they are required -- refer them to the FBI and the Secret Service?
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,2616.188,2626.132,The Warren Commission report does indicate that threats to the President constitute a serious drain on the resources of the commission.
1974.73-6336,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2693.325,2708.165,Has any court ever taken the view in construing this statute that it applies only to communications directed to the President or the other --
1974.73-6336,1,17127,allan_a_tuttle,,2708.165,2715.932,"No, very early on in the very earliest cases on rulings on demurs to the indictment."
1974.73-6336,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2731.088,2736.587,Do you have anything further Mr. Parnell?
1974.73-6336,2,40239,ralph_w_parnell_jr,,2736.587,2747.338,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice very brief in reply to counsel as to he inferred that the facts are going to speak for themselves the record will speak for themselves."
1974.73-6336,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2765.696,2768.94,What crime could he have been arrested for in Shreveport?
1974.73-6336,2,40239,ralph_w_parnell_jr,,2768.94,2773.639,Disturbing the peace is as close as we could pen it down.
1974.73-6336,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2773.639,2782.409,"Until after Mr. Kennedy was assassinated, was there any federal statute making at federal crime to kill a president?"
1974.73-6336,2,40239,ralph_w_parnell_jr,,2782.409,2783.707,Until --
1974.73-6336,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2783.707,2787.577,Until after Mr. Kennedy was killed?
1974.73-6336,2,40239,ralph_w_parnell_jr,,2787.577,2789.374,To actually kill a president?
1974.73-6336,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2789.374,2791.399,-- yes.
1974.73-6336,2,40239,ralph_w_parnell_jr,,2791.399,2796.99,"I believe that's correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-6336,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2874.312,2899.725,"Mr. Parnell, would you turn to page 52 of the brown appendix if you have that in front of you that has that entry entitled handwritten note then apparently the foreman's signature and then below that what appears to be Judge Dawkins response to it."
1974.73-6336,2,40239,ralph_w_parnell_jr,,2909.342,2910.493,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-6336,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2910.493,2916.122,And I presume this was a part of the record that you've prepared for the Fifth Circuit?
1974.73-6336,2,40239,ralph_w_parnell_jr,,2916.122,2919.015,"Your Honor, I don't believe it was in the record at the Fifth Circuit."

1974.73-6336,2,40239,ralph_w_parnell_jr,,2922.525,2924.839,I never knew that this note existed.
1974.73-6336,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2936.119,2940.742,How are records prepared on appeal from the District Court to the Fifth Circuit?

1974.73-6336,2,40239,ralph_w_parnell_jr,,2955.326,2958.089,Couldn't find it.
1974.73-6336,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2958.089,2965.446,"So far as you know, you did not designate this is a part of the record."

1974.73-6336,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2967.051,2968.017,And you have no idea how it got --
1974.73-6336,2,40239,ralph_w_parnell_jr,,2968.017,2969.055,To the Fifth Circuit.
1974.73-6336,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2969.055,2969.736,Yes.

1974.73-6336,2,40239,ralph_w_parnell_jr,,2973.586,2974.644,"No, I do not."
1974.73-6336,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2974.644,2978.515,"And for that matter, you're not sure that really is genuine, I suppose?"
1974.73-6336,2,40239,ralph_w_parnell_jr,,2978.515,2981.32,"I would not doubt the genuineness of it, no."
1974.73-6336,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2981.32,2983.927,Why not if you never seen it before?

1974.73-6336,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3007.233,3011.974,"Well, but I would thought this would've occurred after the trial?"
1974.73-6336,2,40239,ralph_w_parnell_jr,,3011.974,3013.263,"Yes, Your Honor."

1974.73-6336,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3092.076,3103.529,"And you have -- you didn't examine the Court's, these docket entries in your preparation for appeal to the Fifth Circuit?"
