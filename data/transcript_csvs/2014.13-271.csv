2014.13-271,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.201,"We will hear argument next this morning in Case 13271, Oneok versus LearJet."
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1622.01,1625.819,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-271,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1671.417,1672.386,"No, I'm not sure."
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1695.644,1699.425,"Well, Justice Scalia, let me say two things about that that are very important."
2014.13-271,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1727.755,1732.581,"All that is true, but it might depend on how."
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1784.942,1785.418,--Right.
2014.13-271,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1785.418,1785.996,Right.
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1894.905,1899.451,"So that's the best version of the other sides argument, but it's not this case."
2014.13-271,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1910.498,1912.49,But that is conflict preemption--
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1912.49,1912.6,Right.
2014.13-271,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1912.958,1914.089,--not field preemption.
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1914.089,1915.074,--That's exactly right.
2014.13-271,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1947.088,1947.767,Can you give me a page number?
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1947.767,1948.357,--Pardon me.
2014.13-271,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1948.357,1948.935,Page number you're--
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1948.935,1951.654,This is on page 517 of Northwest Central.
2014.13-271,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2003.825,2004.976,"Yes, yes, but wait."
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2032.512,2033.059,That's right.
2014.13-271,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2033.059,2039.759,So it depends on their reason for thinking that the price or the sale -- they can't regulate the sale any way they want.
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2050.224,2051.943,"Those are two very different points, Justice Breyer."
2014.13-271,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2101.874,2106.451,"So as I understand your argument, Mr. Fisher, you are rejecting the Ninth Circuit's analysis."
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2114.668,2123.773,"--The Ninth Circuit didn't explicitly say, but I think the reading of the Ninth Circuit opinion, proceeding from the premise that my friends are proceeding today, which is Section 5(a) is coterminous with field preemption."
2014.13-271,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2148.216,2166.52,"So you can't -- let me think of a better -- the -- the State, it faces a three dollar cost of goods sold to the wholesale pipeline, to El Paso, plus an additional claimed dollar in expenses, including reasonable profit."
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2203.437,2206.223,"No, Justice Breyer, we're not second-guessing anything."
2014.13-271,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2213.927,2214.144,That's a different argument.
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2214.144,2223.485,"Now, my friends have described themselves as jurisdictional sellers, but what the statute says is you're a jurisdictional seller or not depending on what kind of sales you are, quote, ""engaged in""."
2014.13-271,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2272.904,2274.027,--Could you go back to one point?
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2282.529,2283.519,"Theoretically, yes."
2014.13-271,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2287.184,2287.34,"No, no, no."
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2304.051,2307.399,"Well, the reality is they were simply reporting fake prices."
2014.13-271,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2307.746,2308.455,"Yeah -- no, no, no."
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2308.455,2313.015,"--Now, it shows whether or not they were supposed wholesale transactions or supposed retail transactions."
2014.13-271,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2315.542,2320.931,I'm not sure how the indices -- the indices set both prices; is that what you're saying?
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2320.931,2322.819,"Well, the indices don't set any prices."
2014.13-271,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2323.274,2323.417,"No, no, no."
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2327.07,2327.445,--That's right.
2014.13-271,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2341.3,2342.735,"Are they the same, those two prices?"
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2342.735,2343.984,"No, not necessarily."
2014.13-271,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2390.122,2394.027,You could say the same for setting prices of anything at all.
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2427.874,2433.466,"--No, it shouldn't, if all you are doing is asking whether FERC has authority to regulate it under Section 5A."
2014.13-271,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2453.488,2456.184,"Mr. Fisher, there is a field."
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2456.184,2456.565,Yes.
2014.13-271,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2456.565,2457.79,Define the field.
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2459.54,2467.069,"The field is what the Court said in Schneidewind, which is the field is practices relating to wholesale transactions."
2014.13-271,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2621.805,2623.133,It's -- it's not this case.
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2635.064,2635.58,--No.
2014.13-271,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2637.064,2640.548,And is that because you rely on a conflict preemption theory?
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2640.548,2645.888,"That's the proper way to go about this, and nothing in the code of conduct conflicts with anything that we're asking for."
2014.13-271,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2699.13,2705.972,"They have power over the transactions that you are complaining about, the transactions that are the subject of the suit."
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2705.972,2708.738,"--No, they do not have any power over the retail transactions."
2014.13-271,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2714.609,2715.344,But -- but wait--
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2715.344,2718.078,--FERC said it did not have authority over retail transactions.
2014.13-271,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2718.078,2724.024,--The gravamen of your complaint is the fiddling with the reporting.
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2724.024,2724.454,Yes.
2014.13-271,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2724.454,2734.055,"That is the antitrust violation, that conspiracy to report false amounts and to make false sales."
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2749.644,2750.883,"You are using the word ""transactions""."
2014.13-271,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2752.476,2752.707,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2768.198,2769.726,"So two things, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-271,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2780.868,2781.716,"Well, actually, Louisiana."
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2792.876,2793.02,Yes.
2014.13-271,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2793.02,2800.659,"And they're saying that it's the reporting to Joe in his magazine, the false reporting to Joe in his magazine."
2014.13-271,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2800.659,2801.324,Right.
2014.13-271,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2801.324,2806.639,"That is what we use to set the wholesale rate, the reporting of Joe to his magazine."
2014.13-271,1,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,2821.288,2830.661,"It's just not factually accurate, because if we win this case, they can pick up the phone tomorrow and lie to indices all they want and State antitrust law would not prohibit it."
2014.13-271,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2837.924,2841.862,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-271,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2850.436,2853.092,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-271,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2952.676,2958.175,"No, no, not just the sales, but the practices affecting the wholesale, which is kind of the key to their argument."
2014.13-271,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,2958.175,2967.546,"Mr. Chief Justice, 5(a) as is being argued here, in the State's view, is a massive expansion of anything Congress ever intended in the Natural Gas Act."
2014.13-271,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3226.868,3228.696,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-271,2,41786,stephen_r_mcallister,,3228.696,3228.697,--Thank you very much.
2014.13-271,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3228.697,3231.993,"Mr. Katyal, you have four minutes left."
