1967.47,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,137.898,145.211,"Whether it was in this -- within the scope of the statute just that question isolate it is a matter of state law, isn't it?"
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,145.211,146.989,"Well, I mean constitutionally."
1967.47,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,153.912,157.311,"Within the scope of the statute that's a matter of state law, New York law."
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,157.311,168.687,"Was in the scope but as applied, as the statute has been applied and construed with respect to this particular publication can you condemn this appellant."
1967.47,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,168.687,177.522,"Well, does the constitution permits you to do what the state did with respect to that publication regardless of what the statute says, that's our question as to --"
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,177.522,182.046,"Yes, that's in it."
1967.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,504.992,506.543,You mean there are tie-in kinds of (Voice Overlap) --
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,506.543,508.049,They're sort of tie-in and the --
1967.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,508.049,508.97,And if he wants Time (Voice Overlap) --
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,508.97,510.268,"Well, he doesn't write --"
1967.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,510.268,510.678,Those things (Voice Overlap)--
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,510.678,510.749,Yes.
1967.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,510.749,511.92,-- he has to takeover rest?
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,511.92,514.88,He has to take that or I'll -- let's put it --
1967.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,514.88,516.909,Is that all in the record?
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,516.909,541.55,"That's in the record but not as a tie-in and not -- is not developed to that extent but it is developed to the extent what -- which we properly know in the field and that is that he doesn't order these magazines, they just come to him from the distributor."
1967.47,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,573.877,575.01,What's the title?
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,575.01,577.225,Sarah is in the name of the magazine.
1967.47,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,657.527,660.443,Are you asking us to review the findings?
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,660.443,673.642,"No, I'm not asking to review it but you could only take on the findings upon which he was charged, Cole against Arkansas situation, he was only charged with a certain crime."
1967.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,675.498,683.281,"Well, specifically, are you complaining about the finding that the written material apart from the photographs?"
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,683.281,684.477,"Yes, that's right and --"
1967.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,684.477,686.007,And you say that that --
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,686.007,690.582,That should be disregarded because I don't think its part of the charge.
1967.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,690.582,693.706,I see.
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,693.706,718.679,"At the time of the trial, the defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute on its face and he was overruled and was convicted, the Appellate Terms they said before affirmed and the Court of Appeals refused to review."
1967.47,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,718.679,731.028,"Would you repeat why Mr. Redfield, repeat why we shouldn't take in a consideration that reading matter in the magazine as well as the pictures?"
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,731.028,734.948,"Because he wasn't charged with the reading matter, he was charged merely --"
1967.47,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,734.948,736.198,What was the charge?
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,736.198,736.585,The charge --
1967.47,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,736.585,736.772,You said --
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,736.772,746.617,"The charge was that he -- that these magazines contained nude pictures, that's all."
1967.47,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,746.617,747.691,(Inaudible)
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,747.691,748.607,Yes.
1967.47,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,768.319,773.16,"Well, of course that's a very important issue if he was charged in one thing and convicted (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,773.16,780.135,"Yes, that's a -- but I say its subsidiary to my main contention in this case."
1967.47,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,780.135,781.555,"What do you mean, you're waiving it?"
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,781.555,784.09,"No, I'm not waiving it."
1967.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,835.67,839.965,"Well, let me get this, this is at page 248, isn't it?"
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,839.965,843.257,"No, on page -- I'm reading from page 5 -- yes, in the record, its on page --"
1967.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,843.257,845.924,"Well, I'm looking at the Court's finding."
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,845.924,846.577,Yes.
1967.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,846.577,859.686,"In which he finds that people who are proven beyond a reasonable doubt before he was 16, defendant who had reason to know that it was that, and that People's Exhibit two, three, four and five, now those are the four magazines, are they?"
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,859.686,860.118,Yes.
1967.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,860.118,865.664,Contained pictures and photographs depicting female nudities as to find by the Courts as sexual?
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,865.664,865.91,Yes.
1967.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,865.91,867.555,And this has last further.
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,867.555,867.965,Yes.
1967.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,867.965,875.706,That People's Exhibit five and People's Exhibit three contained a verbal descriptions and narrative accounts of sexual excitement and sexual conduct?
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,875.706,876.437,"Yes, that's right."
1967.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,876.437,879.006,And that's what you say is beyond the charge --
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,879.006,879.864,Scope of the charge --
1967.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,879.864,881.572,"-- and that's the Cole-Arkansas point, is it?"
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,881.572,888.643,"Yes, but as I say I'm not pressing that as the ultimate decision in this case --"
1967.47,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,888.643,889.994,You're not pressing it.
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,891.214,891.686,"No, I mean --"
1967.47,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,891.686,892.921,I don't quite understand it.
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,892.921,896.0,I mean my emphasis here is for a decision --
1967.47,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,896.0,898.424,You mean there's something else that's more important?
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,898.424,899.199,"Yes, I do."
1967.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,900.019,902.076,"You want us to declare the statute unconstitutional, that's what you want?"
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,902.076,903.656,Yes sir.
1967.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,903.656,906.375,Even if you can win by -- on the Cole-Arkansas (Voice Overlap) --
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,906.375,907.64,Right sir.
1967.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,907.64,910.533,Why do you do that Mr. Redfield?
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,910.533,913.301,"Well, I'm not trying to make it harder for --"
1967.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,913.301,916.481,"You've argued -- the last time you were here, you tried that too."
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,916.481,922.878,"Well, I try also nothing, sometimes I succeed, in other times not."
1967.47,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,922.878,933.725,"You put great stress upon this man being very a poor man, this old man, so were the -- I would think it could be -- interested in winning your case anyway you could win it for him."
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,933.725,948.264,"And -- well, I also place that emphasis I should say because many people confused as Ginsberg was another Ginsberg that was here before and I think that distinction is very clear in this case."
1967.47,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,948.264,949.943,What was the sentence in this case?
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,949.943,951.703,He got to suspended sentence.
1967.47,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,960.532,962.458,For how long?
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,962.458,966.306,"He didn't mention, he just said suspended sentence and that was it."
1967.47,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,966.306,969.248,He doesn't impose a sentence and then suspend it?
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,969.248,969.883,That's right.
1967.47,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,969.883,972.363,"Well, what was the sentence that he suspended?"
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,972.363,973.392,He didn't impose any sentence.
1967.47,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,973.392,974.193,"Well, then you --"
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,974.193,975.733,"He just said, suspended sentence."
1967.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,979.811,981.167,Do you challenge that practice?
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,981.167,982.483,No.
1967.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,982.483,984.401,That was successfully challenged here not long ago.
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,984.401,1008.05,I remember that but I haven't -- you know I should men -- it should be pointed out too that this statute is directed at those who sell the magazines for a monetary consideration.
1967.47,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1253.586,1258.196,Before you do that I'm not sure I understand what you last said.
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,1263.79,1265.279,Yes sir.
1967.47,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1265.279,1292.071,"And that you can make any sort of -- well, how do you fit that with your theory in this case that -- then it would follow wouldn't it that you can assess the scope of the police power of the state without reference to the First Amendment insofar as the issue relates to who may buy these magazines, they maybe so-called?"
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,1292.071,1296.883,"Oh, I wasn't approving any -- I wasn't approving any such doctrine that the --"
1967.47,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1296.883,1298.285,"Well, I'm not asking you what you're approving."
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,1303.291,1303.644,"The First Amendment does direct, (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.47,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1303.644,1311.777,"-- the First Amendment does not protect the -- a right to hear, a right to read --"
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,1311.777,1312.033,Right.
1967.47,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1312.033,1313.194,-- did you say that?
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,1313.194,1325.01,I said that the First Amendment is directed to the rights of the speaker not so much as to the right of the individual or the regulation of the receiver of the information.
1967.47,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1325.01,1339.762,Well then where does that lead you in this case then the police power of the state can operate within reasonable limits but without any special reference to the First Amendment.
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,1340.891,1349.522,"Well, here -- what my protection is here is the protection of the vendor which is the same as the First Amendment speech."
1967.47,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1349.522,1372.317,"What you're saying then is that the protective interest, your submission is that the constitution protects not the child's right to read but the vendor's right to sell and the author's derivative right to turn out this store?"
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,1372.317,1373.038,Yes.
1967.47,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1373.485,1382.779,And so you relinquish any argument based upon the right of children or of adults for that not to read?
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,1382.779,1383.28,Right.
1967.47,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1510.761,1522.063,Let us suppose this is based on the premise that minors or at least -- they're only 16 or 18 have less IQ than those of others?
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,1522.063,1526.298,"Yes, so I thought it's above that age."
1967.47,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1526.957,1535.018,"So, really what they're talking about here and all of these I presume is the kind to protect people with low IQs?"
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,1535.018,1535.972,Yes.
1967.47,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1559.988,1569.013,"Well, I presume if you can -- had the right to read it on the age, you can decide upon the IQs, isn't that constitutionally?"
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,1569.013,1583.652,"Well, whether -- if that was so, I don't know what we do about it -- I mean I don't know how we could administer such a law or how to or better yet how one could sell books on -- or magazines under that type of the law."
1967.47,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1583.652,1591.653,"I presume most everyone known people of 16 who had far more IQ or whatever that is, a man of 50."
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,1591.653,1592.401,Yes.
1967.47,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1592.401,1595.287,Some men of 50?
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,1595.287,1597.917,That's what I've argued here.
1967.47,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1689.284,1702.223,"May I ask you one -- returning to your first argument, what page did you say it to be found on that the judge can rely not merely on the pictures of nudity but on the literature that was in the --"
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,1702.223,1704.241,Yes sir.
1967.47,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1704.241,1705.064,248 of the record.
1967.47,0,23029,emanuel_redfield,,1705.064,1711.195,"248, the last paragraph from the button of that page."
1967.47,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1711.195,1711.917,Alright.
1967.47,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1717.128,1720.934,Mr. Cahn.

1967.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1725.059,1728.563,What about this Cole and Arkansas point?

1967.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1776.063,1777.631,"Now, why do you say that?"
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,1777.631,1788.641,Because the entire statute gives reference Mr. Justice Brennan in its description of what is the obscene.
1967.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1788.641,1789.576,Right.
1967.47,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1789.576,1792.627,That's the statute but the charge doesn't?
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,1792.627,1796.3,The charge mentions in the second count.
1967.47,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1872.191,1873.038,Mr. Cahn.
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,1873.038,1874.652,Yes sir.
1967.47,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1874.652,1879.742,How is it that New York has 17 and Dallas has 16?
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,1879.742,1882.968,This is a matter for the legislature Mr. Justice Marshall --
1967.47,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1882.968,1884.373,Out of the clear blue?
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,1884.373,1884.823,Pardon?
1967.47,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1884.823,1887.208,Out of the clear blue?
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,1887.208,1917.926,"Well, the legislature found it in its wisdom that the obscenity statute in reference to 484-h should apply to those under 17 and perhaps for different reasons in the State of Texas found that it should apply to those under 16 for the reason that -- the states have considerate 21 to be the age for qualified voting rather than 15, 16, 17 or 18."
1967.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2035.601,2039.677,"Well, Mr. Cahn, that being the -- those being terms of the statute?"
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2039.677,2040.208,Yes sir.
1967.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2040.208,2042.373,I've just looked at these magazines.
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2063.264,2064.411,That is -- there's no question about it.
1967.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2064.411,2071.664,"So, you got to say that although in their distribution to adults they are not obscene."
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2081.246,2096.42,Even though it does not -- it is not obscene as to adults and adults in this particular statute are not bound by the rigid concepts established by the statute.
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2121.169,2122.381,"Now, why do you say that?"
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2122.381,2124.562,Because experience is thought as --
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2124.562,2124.759,I know.
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2124.759,2131.639,-- Mr. Justice Fortas that the teenager is the greatest market for these girly magazines.
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2131.639,2133.974,Is that in the record?
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2133.974,2138.008,It is submitted and suggested by the appellee's brief.
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2138.008,2138.666,"Well, it's not."
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2142.048,2142.388,"No, there is none sir."
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2142.388,2143.473,There is none.
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2151.423,2157.658,"Well, I am suggesting that because of my own experience Your Honor I have found that --"
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2157.658,2170.951,"Well, these stories -- is the written material in here to -- on the level of what you commonly think of as boys, of course when I was younger, it was the (Inaudible) boys and things like that?"
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2170.951,2172.134,Time has changed since then --
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2172.134,2172.368,Times had changed.
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2172.368,2173.375,-- Mr. Justice Fortas.
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2173.375,2183.878,But is that so as a written material of the -- what is specifically and specially a youthful kind?
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2183.878,2201.518,"The magazines which we refer, the magazines in question are written and insofar as my own personal opinion is concerned with a direction toward the teenage market and not very bright teenagers at that."
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2201.518,2202.386,And what?
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2202.386,2205.308,And not very bright teenagers at that.
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2205.308,2217.443,"Well, I -- to me this is an important point and -- but I don't know that the -- I would -- the liberty to take your judgment for the -- and the absence of anything in the record."
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2238.879,2247.67,I might agree Mr. Justice Fortas but as I said it has appeared from the experience which I have had with dealers --
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2247.67,2250.915,"Well, you might agree or you might not but there's nothing in the record."
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2250.915,2251.258,Nothing in the record.
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2251.258,2251.64,Alright.
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2251.64,2261.788,There's no question about that.
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2580.255,2601.85,I don't understand you sir because you are -- I thought you agreed on response to the questions by Mr. Justice Brennan that these magazines would not be held obscene and therefore outside of the First Amendment protections in the case of an adults.
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2601.85,2601.863,That's --
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2601.863,2606.284,So what comfort do you get out of Roth and all the rest of them?
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2636.34,2646.443,"No, I -- Mr. Justice Fortas, I agree that these magazines if sold to adults would not constitute a violation of any obscenity statute."
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2665.858,2692.176,"And your state's -- from your state courts might have held that over and over again.But by on the basis of a colloquy between you and Mr. Justice Brennan, this Court would have to say that these particular magazines here are within the protection of the First Amendment if you relied only on Roth and our decisions today."
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2710.445,2710.944,"Well, this is the --"
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2710.944,2711.784,"(Inaudible) in the statute, I certainly (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2711.784,2713.414,"-- variable concept doctrine, is it not --"
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2713.414,2716.612,-- would be straightened out on it.
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2716.612,2721.181,I believe that this is the variable concept doctrine Mr. Justice Fortas.
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2727.08,2761.946,"Now, what is the -- what would you add to the Roth definition or subtract on the Roth definition in the case of children or why do you say that these magazines although by hypothesis would not be held obscene in the case of adults should be held to be within the First Amendment -- it should be held outside of the First Amendment protection in the case of children?"
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2761.946,2774.173,Because taken as a whole these magazines are harmful to minors as our statute specifically states.
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2787.582,2797.597,And what -- and we have to sustain that as being sufficiently precise and not too broad or too vague for First Amendment purposes?
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2797.597,2818.476,"Yes, because harmful -- the terms in the statute are very explicitly explained each and every term used, nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, sadomasochistic abuse, harmful to minors and prurient interest and so forth."
1967.47,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2835.894,2856.427,"May I ask you if your court has ever sustained this particular charge made in count two, to the extent of saying that it charged anything more than the fact that these were bad because they add pictures of nude persons?"
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2856.427,2859.869,"Mr. Justice Black, I cannot honestly answer the question, I don't know."
1967.47,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2859.946,2865.323,"I -- as I read it, I read a different -- draw a different inference to yours."
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2876.784,2878.2,The magazine taken as a whole.
1967.47,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2878.2,2879.954,"Well, I don't find that."
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2879.954,2881.744,"Oh, I see sir."
1967.47,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2881.744,2887.904,"I haven't been able to find (Inaudible), it seems to me like it means the other."
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2887.904,2889.868,I would have to (Voice Overlap) this Court --
1967.47,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2889.868,2896.757,Whatever construed it the other way.
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2896.757,2897.924,The --
1967.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2897.924,2908.916,"Oh, I gather that under this -- as I read the statute, nudity alone doesn't -- isn't -- is not proscribed."
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2914.028,2914.176,True.
1967.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2914.176,2919.054,-- and nudity which is harmful to minors has to be patently offensive --
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2919.054,2919.978,Patently offensive --
1967.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2919.978,2924.888,-- to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors.
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2924.888,2926.635,That is correct and --
1967.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2926.635,2929.192,And is that really without redeeming social importance for minors.
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2929.192,2930.262,That is correct sir.
1967.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2943.298,2952.655,I take it though the -- any picture -- any nude picture in a magazine would be bad under the statute?
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2952.655,2970.77,"No sir, not any nude picture, the -- these magazines which contained pictures of nudes we contend that we proved were directed to the prurient interest where without social value were provocative, were sexual -- were for the purpose of sexually stimulated."
1967.47,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2970.77,2973.797,And you got one in particular you could show us?
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2973.797,2974.868,The --
1967.47,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2974.868,2977.052,I'd looked at all of them.
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2983.949,2990.824,I don't have the magazine with me at this time Mr. Justice Marshall.
1967.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2990.824,2994.361,"Mr. Redfield, I had one there, some I guess, over there."
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,2994.361,3007.117,The one in question?
1967.47,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3010.323,3011.55,"Go ahead, do you have one?"
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3011.55,3023.729,"I submit that all of these pictures as they are, are for the purpose of sexual stimulation rather than for purposes of displaying great works of art --"
1967.47,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3023.729,3025.991,Then you say all nudes?
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3025.991,3028.116,"All of these nudes in their positions, in their --"
1967.47,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3028.116,3028.607,"Well, that --"
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3028.607,3029.554,-- provocative positions --
1967.47,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3029.554,3033.834,I don't see any difference from those nudes and all other nudes we've had come in through here?
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3033.834,3037.157,"Insofar as children are concerned, Mr. Justice Marshall?"
1967.47,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3037.157,3040.189,"We've been looking at them, to all of them, for children."
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3040.189,3040.934,"Well, this is why --"
1967.47,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3040.934,3046.435,"Well, I'm just trying to say, aren't you actually saying that nude in and of itself is bad --"
1967.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3046.435,3046.652,That's what --
1967.47,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3046.652,3047.149,-- for children?
1967.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3047.149,3055.207,"That's really -- I really, it's a -- I wonder if a statute wouldn't reach all nude -- any kind of a nude in that magazine?"
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3055.207,3058.408,I respectfully must disagree with the --
1967.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3058.408,3059.114,"Well, let me ask you."
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3072.742,3079.732,Mr. Justice White I have enough of a problem to cope with that which I have rather than to become a profit and I don't know.
1967.47,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3079.732,3081.219,"Okay fine, thank You."
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3081.219,3084.043,This is really up to the Court's to decide.
1967.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3084.043,3095.448,"Well, I must say Mr. Cahn, I don't know why you say that any picture in light of two ways instantly this is -- this prosecutions under the 65 statute of course not under the amended 67 statute."
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3095.448,3096.455,That's correct sir.
1967.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3096.455,3101.148,"Now, they -- as I read at page 29 I'm looking at Mr. Redfield's brief."
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3124.166,3128.967,And the harmful to minors is very vividly described in subdivision (f).
1967.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3128.967,3129.679,Yes.
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3132.334,3134.442,That's correct sir.
1967.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3134.898,3148.204,"Any single picture, it would seem to me looking at A, that satisfied that description and this magazine even if none of the others did would support a prosecution under A, wouldn't it?"
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3148.744,3150.302,Yes.
1967.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3152.236,3153.855,"That's right, if it was harmful to minors with --"
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3153.855,3154.363,Yes sir.
1967.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3154.363,3155.076,(Inaudible)
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3155.076,3156.105,I would say so.
1967.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3156.105,3160.14,"No, so that the (Inaudible) taken as a whole is meaningless, isn't it?"
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3160.14,3161.614,"Well, that's in subdivision (a)."
1967.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3161.614,3168.941,"Well, I know but this gets me, that's why I'm trouble by the Cole and Arkansas point."
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3180.025,3181.649,"Oh, I don't think he relied on that."
1967.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3190.896,3195.595,You say that what he did is merely surpluses that on the --
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3195.595,3205.472,No question about it because he found violation of paragraph A as well as paragraph D
1967.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3214.037,3215.045,Could I just ask you --
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3215.045,3215.149,Yes sir.
1967.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3215.149,3226.343,-- before you go on this -- under the New York practice and under a suspended sentence may the defendant be called back into Court and sentenced later is that the end of the matter?
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3226.343,3229.008,If it's a straight suspended sentence it's over.
1967.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3229.008,3229.036,Its over.
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3229.036,3230.312,The sentence is finished.
1967.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3236.809,3239.402,But when he doesn't impose the sentence and then suspended it?
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3239.402,3240.52,That's correct sir.
1967.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3240.52,3242.977,"But just suspend any sentencing, the case is over?"
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3242.977,3243.111,That's right.
1967.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3243.111,3246.879,So there is such a thing then as a final judgment suspending sentence.
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3246.879,3247.477,That's correct.
1967.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3247.477,3248.838,I say and that's what we have here?
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3248.838,3250.087,Yes sir.
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3250.087,3252.806,"Well, does that have any consequence at all?"
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3252.806,3254.833,I don't see where it has.
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3254.833,3259.671,"I mean, it's just like a sort of reprimand, is that what you're telling us?"
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3259.671,3260.341,No.
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3268.355,3270.412,And what's a straight suspended sentence?
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3270.412,3270.571,Just that sir.
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3270.571,3273.742,Does that mean that he can -- ever be put in jail for this offense?
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3273.742,3274.655,"No, no."
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3274.655,3276.265,Could he ever be fined for this?
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3276.265,3277.492,"No, no sir."
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3277.492,3279.9,"So it's sort of a reprimand, is it?"
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3279.9,3280.456,"Well, it's --"
1967.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3280.456,3293.766,"Well, why is he does -- a year or so ago, we've dismissed a couple of case is here wherein a New York prosecution where the man had been fined but he had paid his fine."
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3302.189,3307.151,I -- my distinguished colleague has called for a determination of the constitutionality of the statute --
1967.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3307.151,3310.054,"Well, I know but that doesn't require us to give it as the case is moot."
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3310.054,3311.652,I understand.
1967.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3317.949,3320.099,What do you think?
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3320.099,3323.725,"Well, I think we've come a long way for --"
1967.47,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3323.725,3332.175,"You like it -- everyone who comes here wants us to pass on some constitutional question, doesn't it?"
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3332.175,3332.804,I will say this --
1967.47,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3332.804,3334.668,Whether do we have to or not?
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3334.668,3344.804,"May I say this and in due respect; suspended sentence or no, this is a conviction of a misdemeanor of a crime on this man's record."
1967.47,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3350.781,3362.726,"Well, but if -- then you're suggesting we are wrong a couple of terms ago when we dismissed this misdemeanor convictions where the fine had been paid."
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3365.354,3375.306,"Perhaps, Mr. Justice White this may be characterized as a more serious offense since it involves possibly moral turpitude and --"
1967.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3375.306,3376.219,That's what they were.
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3376.678,3376.905,"Well, I don't know the --"
1967.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3376.905,3378.082,-- obscenity convictions.
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3378.082,3378.324,Pardon?
1967.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3378.634,3384.293,They were obscenity convictions and a fine had been paid and we dismissed the cases as moot.
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3384.293,3386.4,Well certainly let me say this from myself.
1967.47,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3395.593,3400.528,That doesn't answer whether or not those other cases are not precedents for dismissing this is moot.
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3400.528,3405.043,I can't talk without seeing the cases themselves Mr. Justice Brennan.
1967.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3407.367,3415.298,There would be a different proposition I suppose if this suspended -- if these sentences could be imposed.
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3417.667,3417.911,There is no sentence --
1967.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3417.911,3418.618,The case is over.
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3418.618,3421.287,-- to be imposed Mr. Justice White.
1967.47,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3496.726,3497.778,Why?
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3497.778,3511.216,The greatest social thinker of our time Robert (Inaudible) has observed that knowledge in the social sciences will always be incomplete and imperfect.

1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3522.057,3522.483,Yes sir.
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3522.483,3525.133,Has been established in this record?
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3525.133,3526.305,The danger itself sir?
1967.47,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3526.305,3526.677,Yes.
1967.47,1,44256,william_cahn,,3526.677,3531.014,"No sir, in the cases that have gone here before."
1967.47,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3531.014,3532.364,Mr. Redfield.
1967.47,2,23029,emanuel_redfield,,3532.364,3545.912,"The few minutes, as to the question of mootness Your Honors on the very day that you dismissed those other cases, one was the Tannenbaum case and the -- I forgot the name of the other one."
1967.47,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3561.637,3562.11,Yes --
1967.47,2,23029,emanuel_redfield,,3562.11,3564.411,-- to argue that case now.
1967.47,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3564.648,3572.342,"I gathered from the state's presentation that once that sentence was suspended, that was the end of the case --"
1967.47,2,23029,emanuel_redfield,,3572.342,3573.017,"Oh, no, no."
1967.47,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3573.017,3573.23,"And then, that (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.47,2,23029,emanuel_redfield,,3573.23,3573.488,"Oh, no."
1967.47,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3573.488,3574.33,And then that -- that no sentence could --
1967.47,2,23029,emanuel_redfield,,3574.33,3575.154,I --
1967.47,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3575.154,3576.243,No sentence could be imposed.
1967.47,2,23029,emanuel_redfield,,3576.243,3582.472,"No, I wouldn't go along with that because it's a very same statute you had in the Tannenbaum case and in the other case --"
1967.47,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3582.472,3583.059,"Well, yes, but there they've --"
1967.47,2,23029,emanuel_redfield,,3583.059,3583.276,-- within the year.

1967.47,2,23029,emanuel_redfield,,3584.661,3584.746,Pardon?
1967.47,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3584.746,3587.652,If they could fine in Tannenbaum.
1967.47,2,23029,emanuel_redfield,,3587.652,3588.588,"Well, but --"
1967.47,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3588.588,3589.804,They were only fine in those cases.
1967.47,2,23029,emanuel_redfield,,3589.804,3591.852,"Yes, yes, right."
1967.47,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3609.092,3610.203,Why?
1967.47,2,23029,emanuel_redfield,,3610.203,3621.388,"While at this moment, the year might have passed that the time you granted review certainly at the time when this case was lodged in this Court though the year have not passed."
1967.47,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3621.388,3639.7,"Well, Mr. Redfield, I understand that counsel for the state to say that if he merely says suspended sentence without any particular sentence to be suspended but the case has ended then and there --(Voice Overlap) and do you say the opposite (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.47,2,23029,emanuel_redfield,,3639.7,3640.891,I wouldn't accept that.

1967.47,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3661.264,3664.224,What else could be done?
1967.47,2,23029,emanuel_redfield,,3664.224,3672.075,"Well, at this moment, I'm not prepared to say that Your Honor because this is the point I haven't even examined."
