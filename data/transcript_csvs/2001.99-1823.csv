2001.99-1823,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.647,"We'll hear argument now in No. 99-1823, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Waffle House, Inc.-- Mr. Clement."
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,9.647,19.265,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondent Waffle House and Eric Baker agreed to arbitrate rather than litigate disputes between them."
2001.99-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,53.64,64.245,"Mr. Clement, suppose the individual employee had settled with the employer, not just an agreement to arbitrate, but there had been a complete settlement."
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,71.413,76.99,"We believe the Government would still have a cause of action in that case, though we admit it would be a much more difficult case."
2001.99-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,76.99,77.7,Wow.
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,77.7,83.365,"Because in the case of settlement, of course, judicial or arbitral resources have already been expended."
2001.99-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,88.021,88.699,What are the damages?
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,97.691,99.778,--The... the damages could go to the individual.
2001.99-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,101.4,106.424,"So, if he'd settle and get the damages, and then... and then he'd get additional damages recovered for him by the EEOC."
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,106.424,107.631,--That's right.
2001.99-1823,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,139.931,141.2,"Well, but that's... that's a separate wrong."
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,160.371,165.771,"--Well, in a case like that, I'm sure as a matter of its prosecutorial discretion, the EEOC would not bring that case."
2001.99-1823,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,165.771,169.162,"Well, let's say the prosecutor doesn't exercise his discretion that way that day."
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,169.162,173.559,"Well, in that case I think they would have cause of action."
2001.99-1823,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,175.35,176.237,And what... and what happens--
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,176.237,176.971,--a much more difficult case.
2001.99-1823,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,176.971,185.212,"--What would happen... what would happen if the employee recovered $10,000 in the arbitration, then only $5,000 in the litigation?"
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,186.667,188.386,I don't think that would follow.
2001.99-1823,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,191.481,203.66,"Well, but... but we're asking what the... what the logical consequences of... of your position are, and that's why we're putting the more difficult case so we can test the general proposition."
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,213.286,215.169,"--Well, let me do... let me make two responses."
2001.99-1823,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,264.908,295.735,"Well, here we have a case where the employee did not settle, but we were really discussing with you the possibility not presented in this case of a full settlement or a judgment in arbitration, disposing of the victim-specific relief, and asking you why then should EEOC continue to have a cause of action for the victim-specific relief, as opposed to broad injunctive relief, to address the overall problem."
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,295.735,299.382,--And I guess I do think there are two reasons why they would still have a cause of action in that situation.
2001.99-1823,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,337.869,340.473,"Well, why did the EEOC decide to get into this case?"
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,346.497,353.33,--My understanding is that the EEOC picked this case because this case... the events here took place in 1994.
2001.99-1823,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,369.101,371.099,This is... this is not any broad pattern or practice.
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,374.051,376.018,--That's fair enough.
2001.99-1823,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,392.798,393.445,Mr.--
2001.99-1823,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,393.445,404.912,"--Mr. Clement, may I ask you to back up on how we would get to the point of having a settlement after... or an arbitral determination?"
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,450.866,461.621,"Well, I had taken the import of the hypothetical as being that the individual had already sued and settled and then, only after that had taken place, that the EEOC decided to initiate a duplicative action."
2001.99-1823,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,467.736,469.652,Can the individual bring a suit?
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,475.188,476.644,--That's absolutely right.
2001.99-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,501.659,507.636,"Once they... once they do initiate the action, though, the individual cannot also bring an action."
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,521.708,523.852,"--Well, allow... allow me to make two responses."
2001.99-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,544.646,545.268,Exactly.
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,557.243,558.05,I mean--
2001.99-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,558.05,559.904,"Not by both successfully, anyway."
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,559.904,571.275,"--I respectfully disagree because, unlike the ADA, the ADA does not make the EEOC suit the exclusive vehicle and extinguish any cause of action or any basis to get into court for the individual."
2001.99-1823,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,574.226,584.296,"So, you're saying that if the EEOC brings an action in circumstances such as this, an individual who has agreed to arbitrate the claim can intervene and not be bound?"
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,587.191,588.966,"No, we do not take that position."
2001.99-1823,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,607.039,619.586,It's a very strange use of the Article III courts to have litigation proceeding in which one of the real parties in interest is not permitted to intervene.
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,620.304,622.447,Well--
2001.99-1823,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,622.447,629.08,--that strikes me as a... a distortion of the whole case in controversy rule.
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,629.08,635.312,"--It may be, but I think that is the consequence of the arbitration agreement and the implication of the FAA."
2001.99-1823,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,635.312,638.616,"Well, if it is a distortion of the case in controversy rule, then we're in real trouble, aren't we?"
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,638.616,658.75,"Well, even if you disagree with me on... on that particular point and you say that the FAA does not prevent Baker from intervening on this action, it's still true that the arbitration agreement is... has a meaningful benefit to Waffle House because before Waffle House entered that arbitration agreement with Baker, it was subject to a suit in court by either the EEOC or Baker."
2001.99-1823,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,672.727,690.523,"Do you think it is... do you think it is going to be very comfort to Waffle House to know that, yes, it can't be sued in court by the individual, but the entire prosecutorial power of the United States can be brought to bear on it in... in a suit in court?"
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,701.885,709.392,"Well, with respect, if Waffle House wants to stay out of court, then it needs to reach an agreement with every party that has a statutory right to get them into court."
2001.99-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,711.943,714.504,Unless one statutory right is derivative of the other.
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,716.734,718.445,"--Yes, and we think there are good--"
2001.99-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,718.445,722.332,"And you... you keep saying the Government has an independent right to sue, but you know, that begs the question."
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,730.844,732.466,--And I do not think it is.
2001.99-1823,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,734.954,738.825,Then I think your answer has got to be that the settlement clearly does not bind the Government.
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,738.825,742.44,"That's exactly right, and that's... that's a well-established principle."
2001.99-1823,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,751.816,760.682,"How does this compare with the Fair Labor Standards Act where the Secretary of Labor could sue or the individual could sue, say, for a wage and hour violation?"
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,767.921,771.92,"I think in all of those cases, the statutory scheme works effectively the same."
2001.99-1823,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,790.429,796.817,"Of course, the... the cause of action for... that EEOC has could be vindicated by an equitable remedy."
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,796.817,800.713,I... I don't think that's necessarily true.
2001.99-1823,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,820.865,832.532,"But in this case then you say EEOC can go into court and that Baker can probably not... not intervene, but the EEOC could get whatever he could have gotten and give it to him."
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,832.532,837.54,"That is true, but I don't think that is particularly anomalous or limited to this area of law."
2001.99-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,857.287,859.19,Who had already recovered?
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,859.19,860.277,No.
2001.99-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,862.996,863.25,No.
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,877.853,885.766,"--Well, actually they could get the order, and then there are specific provisions in the Federal restitution statute that allow a set-off for amounts that have already been paid or that will be paid."
2001.99-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,885.766,887.541,"Oh, well, that's quite different."
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,887.541,888.027,But I don't think it--
2001.99-1823,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,888.027,888.282,Okay.
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,923.203,926.082,"--Again, we don't think the agreement is binding, but let me give you three reasons--"
2001.99-1823,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,926.082,926.376,But why... but--
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,926.376,928.359,--Let me give you three reasons why I think it's a harder case.
2001.99-1823,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,928.359,930.158,--you did say earlier that you thought the settlement case more difficult.
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,933.301,933.803,Okay.
2001.99-1823,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,977.225,988.971,"Well, but in each of the... in each of the cases that you posit, even the third one, the... the essence of the objection to your position is that an agreement has been made between the individual and the defendant."
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1005.934,1012.575,"--Well, I actually think there is a reason to treat that one agreement different, which is the agreement to settle a case extinguishes any claim to relief."
2001.99-1823,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1033.345,1039.337,"Then your objection is the transmogrification, not to the... not to the recognition of the agreement as such."
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1039.337,1045.69,"Again, we have no... absolutely no objection to having the agreement bind the parties to the agreement."
2001.99-1823,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1045.69,1052.842,But you do say that the employee could not proceed even in the arbitral forum once the EEOC starts.
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1066.15,1072.902,Actually the EEOC is of the opinion that the... that the individual could bring an arbitration action at that point.
2001.99-1823,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1079.373,1080.019,"So, then the EEOC--"
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1080.019,1081.61,--they have to have one action or the other.
2001.99-1823,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1081.61,1084.793,--says we can have this... we can have this... you've just told us that the substantive law is the same.
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1106.316,1110.403,"That's equally, of course... I mean, I... I agree that there is that problem."
2001.99-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1120.341,1120.899,Well--
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1120.899,1122.154,But... but I think--
2001.99-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1122.154,1123.72,--that doesn't strike me as so terrible.
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1129.615,1130.965,--And... and--
2001.99-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1130.965,1136.445,What Justice Ginsburg points out is... is the anomaly of... of the same relief being sought in two different forums.
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1136.445,1145.007,"--Well, and... and I think that... I mean, that may be a product of... that happens when you have an arbitration agreement that limits some parties but not others."
2001.99-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1147.013,1150.901,"Only if we adopt your view of the thing, that the two... that the two are independent."
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1165.745,1166.527,"Well, fair enough."
2001.99-1823,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1235.179,1240.731,"Except there's a Federal Arbitration Act, and we've said it's designed to encourage arbitration of disputes."
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1240.731,1246.251,"Well, in fairness, I don't think that the FAA embodies a self-executing preference for arbitration."
2001.99-1823,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1247.09,1255.499,"No, but... a... a favoring where the... where an arbitration agreement has been entered into, as it was here."
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1255.499,1256.609,"--Well, that's true."
2001.99-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1295.866,1301.115,The trouble is it's not a public enforcement action to the extent that it is seeking damages for this individual.
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1321.493,1325.54,"With fairness, I think that's a position that Congress rejected in Title VII itself."
2001.99-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1340.439,1340.748,Why?
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1349.73,1350.544,--Well--
2001.99-1823,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1350.544,1360.914,"But... but to say that the portion of it that compensates the individual is essentially, you know, a vindication of the public doesn't seem to me... doesn't seem to me reasonable."
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1369.171,1370.986,"--Again, with all respect, I disagree."
2001.99-1823,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1378.833,1395.75,"If the model... if the model is the Fair Labor Standards Act, which antedated these discrimination acts by many years, where the Secretary can sue for the money to go into the pocket of the employee, I thought that those were characterized as public interest actions."
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1395.75,1397.34,--That's absolutely right.
2001.99-1823,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1450.859,1461.27,"Well, what are your best authorities for the proposition that when litigation has been concluded, another party can recommence the litigation alleging its own injury?"
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1461.27,1462.86,I guess I would point--
2001.99-1823,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1462.86,1463.954,--some other areas.
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1465.465,1465.831,--Yes.
2001.99-1823,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1478.52,1484.096,"Well, but that was because the other parties had their own injury of a pecuniary nature, as I recall the case."
2001.99-1823,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1485.855,1497.858,"As a practical matter, how often does the EEOC seek victim-specific relief in the form of monetary damages after there's been a settlement between the victim and the other side?"
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1497.858,1500.257,I'm actually aware of no case where that's happened.
2001.99-1823,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1500.257,1501.207,This is all a hypothetical.
2001.99-1823,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1501.207,1502.213,This is all hypothetical.
2001.99-1823,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1511.387,1512.498,"Very well, Mr. Clement."
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,1514.512,1529.901,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The answer to the question presented today is found in the broad terms and policies of the Federal Arbitration Act."
2001.99-1823,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1587.543,1592.142,"Mr. Gordon, if I understood him correctly, he did take that position, but he said you don't have to take that position to prevail in this case."
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,1593.165,1597.18,"--Well, perhaps I perceived it differently, Your Honor."
2001.99-1823,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1607.702,1622.682,"Mr. Gordon, but that's so highly hypothetical because the likelihood that the employee would have proceeded... if the EEOC in the beginning is the only one who can bring an action in court, EEOC brings an action."

2001.99-1823,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1668.298,1672.314,"Well, because one of them has power to bind the other."
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,1688.194,1693.346,"--Well, Your Honor, it should be, but the EEOC doesn't take that position, as I understand it."
2001.99-1823,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1705.291,1707.482,But we're not talking about Mr. Baker.

2001.99-1823,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1733.276,1745.975,"But the other way around, if the arbitrator, say, finds no discrimination in that arbitration forum, couldn't bind the EEOC because the EEOC wasn't party to that litigation."
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,1747.757,1766.539,"Well, I would have to disagree with you on that because I believe that in the arbitration, if there were... an adjudication was made as to Mr. Baker and in... as in this particular case... if I may use this case as the example, in this particular case, Mr. Baker is the only game in town here."
2001.99-1823,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1772.377,1781.698,"Let's... let's cut out the relief aspect of it and again concentrate on the issue, was there discrimination or not, as to which there might be injunctive remedies."

I still believe that there's no reason to wait in this case, that the arbitration can go forward to resolve Mr. Baker's individual claims, that the EEOC, under the Fourth Circuit rule, can go forward and have the claims for broad-based injunctive relief heard there."
2001.99-1823,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1844.403,1850.315,"But isn't it true that for any relief, there must be a finding that the employer has violated the act?"

2001.99-1823,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1897.622,1898.348,No.

2001.99-1823,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1920.735,1921.677,And why... and why is that?
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,1921.677,1923.34,--What I... what I'm anticipating--
2001.99-1823,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1923.34,1930.637,Why is it that the employer cannot... that the EEOC cannot re-litigate the raw finding of liability?
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,1930.637,1940.959,--I am anticipating from your hypothetical that a specific finding is being made about Mr. Baker being discriminated against based on the facts and circumstances of his case.
2001.99-1823,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1949.744,1951.663,I just want to make it clear what your position is.
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,1970.372,1981.07,"Your Honor, the EEOC, to the extent that it's bringing a public enforcement action, something involving a pattern or practice of discrimination, something--"
2001.99-1823,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1981.07,1981.86,Suppose it's not.
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,1983.467,1983.697,--Just--

2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,1992.194,1998.523,"--If it... if the injunction is solely based on relief specific to Mr. Baker and the facts of his case, yes, it would be binding."
2001.99-1823,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1998.523,2000.561,And what's your authority for that proposition?
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2000.561,2013.133,"Well, Your Honor, the... the authority would be that based on general principles of collateral estoppel where there's been... these issues have been litigated and--"

2001.99-1823,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2051.242,2068.567,"Or unless you say the statutory scheme necessarily finds that there is privity because the EEOC's interests in this case, where there's no broad pattern or practice, are allied solely with those of the... of the employee."
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2079.735,2093.594,"--Well, it is and it runs throughout our brief, Your Honor, and it runs throughout what I'm... what I'm going to say to the Court is that basically what... what is happening here, in the... in the terms of seeking individual relief, is that the EEOC is acting on behalf of Mr. Baker."
2001.99-1823,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2093.594,2094.433,Why... why--
2001.99-1823,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2094.433,2104.347,--The EEOC is... is effectively a party to the earlier proceeding since its right in the later proceeding is purely derivative of the right of... of the individual employee.
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2105.513,2128.929,"It is, Your Honor, and... and essentially the EEOC is standing in the shoes of Mr. Baker when you look at this case because it is... if you look at the joint appendix, page 51 and 52, the interrogatory responses from the EEOC, you see that they acknowledge they are seeking... when asked what... what damages are you seeking in this case, we are seeking relief on behalf of Mr. Baker."
2001.99-1823,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2128.929,2130.319,That... that happens to be in this case.
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2161.739,2162.762,"There is, Your Honor."
2001.99-1823,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2170.281,2172.072,But isn't there a public interest?
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2189.187,2194.131,"--True, Your Honor, but that public interest can be vindicated just as effectively in arbitration."
2001.99-1823,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2194.131,2194.666,That's the question.
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2219.073,2224.501,They can continue to pursue that claim for broad-based injunctive relief involved.
2001.99-1823,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2225.844,2229.531,I'm talking about can they not get appropriate relief.
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2231.242,2237.515,"It does say that, and the relief would not be appropriate where an individual has signed an agreement to arbitrate."

2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2258.511,2265.209,"Well... well, the answer to your case I think is found in the Federal Arbitration Act because this individual agreed to arbitrate--"
2001.99-1823,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2265.209,2268.0,I'm not... there is no arbitration agreement in my case.
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2277.962,2278.536,--All right.
2001.99-1823,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2283.32,2295.459,"The person is lazy, frightened, or whatever and says to the EEOC, I don't want you to bring this action to get me reinstated."
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2315.243,2315.849,Yes.
2001.99-1823,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2315.849,2316.647,They can do that.
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2316.647,2317.358,They can do that.
2001.99-1823,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2317.358,2317.828,Fine.
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2326.713,2337.22,"Well, there is, of course, the... the strong Federal policy favoring arbitration, the text of the Federal Arbitration Act that says, we're going to enforce agreements."
2001.99-1823,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2337.22,2346.557,"And, of course, my example is designed to show that all those interests have to do with the private interest of the individual perhaps."
2001.99-1823,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2346.557,2348.06,Mr. Gordon--
2001.99-1823,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2348.06,2348.866,--Not the other.
2001.99-1823,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2349.632,2365.725,"--I think... I think it is your position, is it not, that the... that the agency would not be able to bring such a suit if the individual had already sued and had been compensated, or indeed, if the... if the individual had already settled?"
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2365.725,2366.651,True.
2001.99-1823,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2366.651,2367.471,Isn't that your position?
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2367.471,2368.824,True.
2001.99-1823,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2368.824,2384.516,"And... and your further position is that the... that the conclusion of an arbitration agreement is similar to a settlement, that the agency's ability to bring the later suit depends on what the individual, on whose behalf it sues, has given away."
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2384.516,2386.035,That is correct.
2001.99-1823,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2386.035,2386.489,Good.
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2398.287,2405.824,"Your Honor, the EEOC in these cases... and I hope I can be responsive to your question."
2001.99-1823,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2422.425,2432.013,But the remedy... I think we've agreed that what we're not talking about here is the substantive law... the substantive right and the remedy.
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2475.09,2496.216,"Your Honor, the... the notion of the importance of the Federal Arbitration Act is that these agreements have to be put on the same footing as other contracts, and we must give force to an arbitration agreement such as this."
2001.99-1823,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2516.096,2537.966,"But do you... procedural mode, but do you... you don't contest, do you, that Title VII or the disability act or the... whatever Federal law is the law that the arbitrator is to apply so that the substantive law to be applied, whether you're in court or in arbitration, is the same?"
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2552.406,2553.853,"No, I'm not."
2001.99-1823,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2554.347,2561.931,"So, we're talking about the forum and forums have rules of procedure, which can be different, but the substantive law is the same."
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2564.962,2588.457,"--That's true, Your Honor, but... but still if we... if we go forward with the rule that's proposed by the EEOC, in... in my view we will be flying in the face of the Court's decisions in Gilmer, the Court's decision in Circuit City, the plain text of the Federal Arbitration Act."
2001.99-1823,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2592.697,2602.355,"Mr.... Mr. Gordon, I assume that giving up the whole cause of action is the greater and giving up the forum is the lesser."
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2632.666,2646.326,"--True, and if you take a step back... and let's... let's take the more general... general example where there... there hasn't been a claim filed and where an individual is having a dispute with his employer."
2001.99-1823,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2668.528,2669.767,Why is this greater?
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2715.172,2719.476,"I can't accept the spectrum analysis, if... if I may."
2001.99-1823,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2744.471,2747.287,"Would that carry over to, say, wage and hour claims?"
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2750.366,2751.556,Your Honor--
2001.99-1823,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2751.556,2760.221,Could the Secretary of Labor also be in privity with the individual employee who hasn't... who has been denied equal pay?
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2760.221,2765.078,--Under the... under the wage/hour laws--
2001.99-1823,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2765.078,2765.483,Yes.
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2765.483,2766.562,--there... there are different interests there.
2001.99-1823,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2787.94,2789.603,How about an Equal Pay Act claim?
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2789.603,2796.164,"Equal Play Act claim, Your Honor, I believe would be covered under the Department of Labor scenario."
2001.99-1823,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2796.164,2801.564,"Mr. Gordon, may I just ask you a question sort of about the other end of this case?"
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2866.795,2868.113,Yes.
2001.99-1823,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2868.113,2870.52,Would that include back pay?
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2870.52,2873.391,"No, it would not where there's been--"
2001.99-1823,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2873.391,2873.829,Why not?
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2873.829,2875.148,--When there's been an arbitration agreement.
2001.99-1823,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2875.148,2877.427,"Well, not back pay for this individual."
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2883.065,2892.002,"Our position would be, Your Honor, that for those individuals who have signed arbitration agreements, then any relief specific to them must be awarded in arbitration."
2001.99-1823,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2907.004,2920.591,"Okay, but then... then I... is it also your position that the... that the general equitable relief could not include an injunction to rehire all of those who were improperly fired?"
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2920.591,2929.374,--The... the equitable relief specific to the individual... specific to the individual--
2001.99-1823,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2929.374,2931.405,"Well, the injunction is just a general injunction."
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2945.212,2948.94,--It could if the relief was broad-based and not--
2001.99-1823,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2948.94,2958.59,"Well, in my example, it's broad-based in the sense that it applies to everyone in the class, but in order to enforce it, it will have to be enforced against specific individuals."
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2969.068,2970.61,"--Yes, it could, but--"
2001.99-1823,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2970.61,2972.553,Then why can't back pay be enforced in that case?
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2972.553,2976.08,"--But... but... well, it would be enforced in arbitration."
2001.99-1823,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2977.679,2977.989,No.
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,2994.55,2996.332,The determination would be in court.
2001.99-1823,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2996.332,2997.475,All right.
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,3012.476,3014.435,"Well, it could, Your Honor."
2001.99-1823,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3029.538,3040.076,"I can understand why you say that, but I don't understand why you say that a... a general equitable order to rehire could be enforced in court and would not have to be remitted to an arbitral forum."
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,3040.076,3052.615,"--The determination could be made in court, but the determination of what specific equitable relief, whether this person should be reinstated or... or this person should not, that should be made in arbitration."
2001.99-1823,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3052.615,3065.779,"So, in... the only thing that on your theory then that is totally within the control of the court would be totally prospective relief, e.g., an order, don't do this again for anybody."
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,3068.401,3070.488,Yes.
2001.99-1823,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3070.488,3071.231,And purely in court.
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,3071.231,3072.349,That would be.
2001.99-1823,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3072.349,3085.088,"And let's say... let's say a claim is made then later on that that order has been violated, that the title has been violated again, and the injunction against violating the title has been... has been violated."
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,3095.648,3099.536,"Well, in that particular case, Your Honor, I believe there would be contempt--"
2001.99-1823,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3099.536,3100.646,Right.
2001.99-1823,1,20916,david_l_gordon,,3100.646,3101.652,--of the injunction.
