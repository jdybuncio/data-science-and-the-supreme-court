2000.99-1908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.114,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 99-1908, James Alexander v. Martha Sandoval."
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,12.343,17.09,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1908,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,77.775,81.203,"Well, we're not dealing with a damages action here, are we?"
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,81.203,82.317,"--That's true, Your Honor."
2000.99-1908,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,82.893,86.033,We're dealing with prospective relief.
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,86.033,86.776,"--That's true, Your Honor."
2000.99-1908,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,86.776,88.444,Declaratory and prospective.
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,88.444,100.416,"Exactly, Your Honor and, of course, the Eleventh Amendment applies even to injunctive relief and even, as this particular case reveals, you can still alter the Federal-State balance by allowing private rights of action."
2000.99-1908,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,127.908,140.251,"Mr. Sutton, do I understand what you just told us to mean that if the Cannon case had been against the State medical school instead of against a private university there would have been no claim?"
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,140.251,141.737,"I think that's right, Your Honor."
2000.99-1908,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,151.108,164.483,"That's a different point, but I wanted to know how sweeping your position is, and you are saying that if Cannon had been against the University of Illinois instead of the Medical School of the University of Chicago, it would have been thrown out?"
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,164.483,168.941,"That's exactly what I'm saying, Your Honor, and I think that's true, and that is our first principal point."
2000.99-1908,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,189.253,205.311,"Cannon itself said that's... as far as implied rights of action it said, we come from a past when Congress was reacting to the courts' activity and knew that the courts were implying private rights of action."
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,223.062,224.798,"--But, Your Honor, States are different."
2000.99-1908,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,285.289,311.073,"That's true, but you do... in your view, is this... do I have your argument correct that there'll be a certain number of civil rights statutes where, in respect to an implied right of action, there is basically silence, and do you think there could be a number of those statutes where you would imply from that silence a private right of action against an individual but not against a State?"
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,313.424,315.448,"That may be true, Your Honor, but I did--"
2000.99-1908,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,315.448,315.448,It is your view?
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,315.448,316.441,"--It is my view, Your Honor."
2000.99-1908,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,316.441,317.472,All right.
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,325.108,330.864,The reason you're saying that is because States will be treated differently from other litigants in the statutes?
2000.99-1908,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,330.864,331.197,Yes.
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,342.198,347.499,"Well, Your Honor, first of all, as Justice Powell said in Atascadero, States are different."
2000.99-1908,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,359.909,371.259,Is there any authority for that kind of interpretation of a silence that we get out of the silence actions against a private person but not actions against the State?
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,371.259,382.776,"That's exactly Atascadero, where you could get money damages actions against private individuals under Section 504, but not against States, so there is authority for that exact point."
2000.99-1908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,412.378,423.645,"Atascadero, which you put so much reliance on, is distinguishable in that it did involve a money damage action, and it explicitly involved the Eleventh Amendment."
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,426.411,433.636,"--That's true, Your Honor, but as I pointed out, in Cannon, in footnote 13, the Court has already dealt with this very issue."
2000.99-1908,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,471.448,485.732,"Would you explain, Mr. Sutton, the impact in the civil rights remedies, Equalization Act that I thought waived the Eleventh Amendment immunity for Title VI, Title IX... and 504 cases, no?"
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,485.732,488.416,You're referring to the 1986 Rehabilitation Act amendments?
2000.99-1908,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,488.416,488.549,Right.
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,488.549,493.379,"Your Honor, that's a very good point, and we're very sympathetic to it, but I just want to clarify one thing."
2000.99-1908,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,526.899,536.475,"I thought you were stating sweepingly that when you answered my question, Cannon was under the basic prohibition, not against--"
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,536.475,537.218,--Title IX.
2000.99-1908,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,537.218,537.756,--Right.
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,537.756,538.582,"Under 901, yes."
2000.99-1908,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,538.582,546.095,"Right, and you said there would be no such claim, but now I think you're amending that, because you said after the '86 act there would be."
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,546.095,548.119,"Well then, I misunderstood your question."
2000.99-1908,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,597.083,601.541,What if it were a city who was the... which was the defendant in the case?
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,601.541,602.284,In this particular case?
2000.99-1908,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,602.284,602.739,Uh-huh.
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,602.739,606.371,"Well, I think, as this Court has said, cities are different from States."
2000.99-1908,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,609.798,617.023,Do you acknowledge there would be a private right of action for enforcement of the regulations against a city?
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,617.023,628.623,"--There would be with respect to the first argument I'm making, but let me switch now to the second argument we're making, where I do not think there would be a right of action against a city, county, or for that matter, a private person."
2000.99-1908,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,752.589,758.82,"Well, it also says, or by any other means authorized by law, so isn't that the issue?"
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,758.82,761.05,"--Exactly, Your Honor, and this is critical."
2000.99-1908,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,821.319,850.669,"Well, one way the two could be reconciled, and I'm not suggesting that it's the best way, but one way to reconcile them would be to say that the private right of action is contingent upon the States having taken the steps in the proviso, so that until the State had notified, and until there had been some conclusion drawn that voluntary compliance would not be reached in the absence of action, the private party could not seek the injunction."
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,850.669,854.922,"--But Your Honor, let's take the most virtuous and earnest State Attorney General."
2000.99-1908,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,865.038,868.131,"Well, I was suggesting something perhaps even more awkward."
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,895.79,902.477,"--And the point... I guess the point I'm making is that, take the ideal State Attorney General."
2000.99-1908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,916.473,926.958,"Mr. Sutton, look at the sentence, provided, however, that no such action shall be taken until the department or agency concerned."
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,933.934,939.136,"--It does, Your Honor, and you're... this is a better point than the one I'm making in response to Justice Souter."
2000.99-1908,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,969.246,988.176,"Oh, I... actually, as I guess my question implied, I think that is certainly the easier reading, but I guess I also think that if we felt otherwise impelled to recognize the private action here based on other principles, I don't suppose this would necessarily stand in the way of that."
2000.99-1908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,988.176,995.523,"Mr. Sutton, do you think the word compliance talks about private actions as well as actions by the Federal Government?"
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1004.811,1004.911,"Oh, Your Honor, but--"
2000.99-1908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1004.911,1005.82,--Do you read it that way?
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1005.82,1007.223,"--Well, I do, Your Honor."
2000.99-1908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1007.223,1013.622,"Even though... do you think there's an express cause of action, rather than an implied cause of action under Title VI?"
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1013.622,1017.503,"Here's the reason I read it this way, and I want to make sure I'm answering your question--"
2000.99-1908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1017.503,1020.764,Do you think there's an express cause of action under Title VI?
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1020.764,1028.359,--I think there's a very good argument that there's an overwhelming implication after 1986 that there is a cause of action under Section 601.
2000.99-1908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1028.359,1029.929,"No, that's not my question."
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1041.258,1045.161,"Are you referring to 602, or 601?"
2000.99-1908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1045.161,1046.087,602.
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1046.087,1052.22,I think there's a very good argument that there is an express cause of action for all of Title VI.
2000.99-1908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1052.22,1052.22,I see.
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1052.22,1055.192,"After 1986, so post Cannon."
2000.99-1908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1093.17,1097.711,"Well, one could read it to say, that sentence just refers to actions instituted by the Federal Government--"
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1097.711,1098.826,But it's--
2000.99-1908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1098.826,1101.964,"--compliance actions, which is a fairly normal way to refer to the--"
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1101.964,1103.822,"--Well, maybe this is my confusion."
2000.99-1908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1124.05,1124.15,"--Well, why do you--"
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1124.15,1124.976,--I may be wrong.
2000.99-1908,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1141.572,1149.829,--Do you concede that Congress has authorized the regulations at issue here?
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1149.829,1160.725,"--No, Your Honor, we do not, and we think the better reading is that these regulations are invalid, but as we indicated in our opening brief and our reply, we don't think the Court needs to address the validity of the regulations."
2000.99-1908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1160.725,1164.812,"Well, let's assume that the regulations are permitted."
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1176.579,1201.099,"Well, Your Honor, and that's a possibility, but you still have the problem of rules of the language in Section 602 that I just referred to that suggest indicates that all of those rules were rules that agencies were to enforce, not private individuals, so even if you decided... and I don't think you need to decide this, but even if you decide the rules were valid, it would still be rules that could be enforced by the agencies."
2000.99-1908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1201.721,1214.102,"But the substantive obligation that the State must meet is a 601 obligation, as interpreted by the agency under 602."
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1214.102,1214.102,--Absolutely.
2000.99-1908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1214.102,1216.869,Why can't you say the suit is under 601?
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1216.869,1225.208,"Well, I don't think anyone agrees... I mean, I want to be clear but I don't think anyone agrees that this suit can be characterized as being under 601."
2000.99-1908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1225.208,1227.438,"I understand that, but I want to know why."
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1227.438,1243.496,"And the reason, the reason is that the Court has already made clear that Section 601 does not cover disparate-effect legislation and, as Justice O'Connor and Justice Powell indicated in Guardians, one does not effectuate a statutory antidiscrimination mandate by redefining it."
2000.99-1908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1243.496,1251.01,"But once the regulation is in place, doesn't the statute then have a new meaning, as interpreted by the agency?"
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1251.01,1251.365,No.
2000.99-1908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1251.365,1255.385,Or else why does the agency have authority to do this at all?
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1255.385,1256.871,"Respectfully, no, Your Honor."
2000.99-1908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1256.871,1259.266,As a preventative measure?
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1259.266,1270.124,"The most that can be said is that you would be enforcing at that point Section 602, and Section 602 is the part of the statute that gives the agencies rulemaking authority."
2000.99-1908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1275.158,1281.391,Would the agency not have had any rulemaking authority without Section 602?
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1286.593,1287.336,That is possible.
2000.99-1908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1287.536,1295.881,--setting forth what its own view of the anti-intentional discrimination provision of 601 was?
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1295.881,1304.137,"--That's true, and that's not the way the case has been argued, but if that were true, then I think it's fair you would need to look at whether that's a legitimate interpretation of Section 601."
2000.99-1908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1304.137,1305.912,"Right, and under our case law it wouldn't be?"
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1305.912,1308.307,"Absolutely not, because Chevron deference--"
2000.99-1908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1308.307,1326.677,"So the only way the regulation here is valid is on the assumption that it is not an interpretive regulation, but rather is a regulation that goes beyond the meaning of 601 in a prophylactic way to, as 601 puts it, to effectuate the provisions of 601?"
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1326.677,1329.649,"--That's exactly right, and there's some guidance in the Court's cases."
2000.99-1908,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1374.109,1375.966,Is the same true of Rule 14?
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1375.966,1376.709,Excuse me?
2000.99-1908,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1376.709,1381.705,"The proxy rules, the statute and the proxy rules, is the same... what you're saying now true--"
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1381.705,1386.413,"Well, Your Honor, that, of course, is the Hagen case that you wrote for the Court in 1997--"
2000.99-1908,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1386.413,1386.989,--Where I thought I--
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1386.989,1390.704,--Under Rule... I want to make sure I'm answering your question.
2000.99-1908,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1390.704,1391.076,--Yes.
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1391.076,1396.277,Under Rule 14(e)(3) you've got a different statutory authorization of rulemaking power.
2000.99-1908,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1402.964,1407.96,"But the rule, the regulation there, the rule went beyond the statute."
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1439.994,1443.588,"Your Honor, I couldn't agree more, and I don't think there is precedent for that point."
2000.99-1908,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1451.101,1454.157,But that's on your argument that the regulation is invalid.
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1458.532,1478.761,"--But Your Honor, the implied right of action inquiry is an inquiry that goes really to the same question that you ask when you decide whether an agency rule is valid, and that's what did Congress mean, what did Congress authorize here, so it's true, if there's not an implied right of action it may make these regulations of dubious validity, but that's not necessarily true."
2000.99-1908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1478.844,1484.5,"If I understand your argument, you're saying even the Federal Government couldn't bring this argument."
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1484.5,1486.608,"--If the regulations are invalid, that's true."
2000.99-1908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1486.608,1490.239,"Well, your position is, they are invalid, therefore the Government couldn't bring this action, either."

2000.99-1908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1495.235,1501.468,You wouldn't need to worry about all the argument about implied cause of action and all the rest if the regulation's invalid.
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1501.468,1504.894,"--Well, that is one way to proceed, and we've argued that they're not valid."
2000.99-1908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1506.264,1514.809,"But that's not the question for which we took the case, and I'm assuming and will assume that the regulations are valid."
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1555.471,1562.735,"That's a harder case, Your Honor, but the reason... I think the way to look at it is, does the text unambiguously create this right."
2000.99-1908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1564.843,1580.325,"Well, a text cannot... you're... a text cannot unambiguously create a right for the agency to issue a Chevron-based rule which is premised upon an ambiguity in the statute."
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1580.591,1582.349,"--Your Honor, you're right."
2000.99-1908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1582.349,1585.693,"--The agency has no Chevron power unless there's an ambiguity in the statute, right?"
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1585.693,1590.401,--This question gets to the distinction between my first argument and my second.
2000.99-1908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1600.432,1600.653,Okay.
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1600.653,1602.761,"If it's a private party, city, or county, then I do not."
2000.99-1908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1602.761,1610.684,"It doesn't matter to you whether it's an interpretive rule or a substantive rule, you can't imply it against the State in a private right of action?"
2000.99-1908,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,1610.684,1611.222,That's exactly right.
2000.99-1908,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1613.739,1614.937,"Very well, Mr. Sutton."
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1616.628,1619.972,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1908,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1656.381,1657.124,"In what case, Mr. Schnapper?"
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1657.124,1673.349,"--In Will v. Department of Corrections, that that is precisely the kind of legislation that does not fundamentally disturb Federal-State relations, and I think the whole line of cases since Ex parte Young simply could not survive if that were the law."
2000.99-1908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1674.668,1686.557,"Well, that handles the Eleventh Amendment argument, but it doesn't handle the Spending Clause argument, you know, the argument that any conditions you're imposing upon the States under the Spending Clause have to be clear."
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1686.557,1688.786,--I... to which I'm about to turn.
2000.99-1908,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1716.279,1717.31,What was Cannon?
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1718.879,1719.401,Title IX.
2000.99-1908,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1719.401,1720.532,Title IX?
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1720.532,1720.615,Title IX.
2000.99-1908,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1720.615,1721.441,So that's strictly Spending Clause?
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1721.441,1723.01,Strictly Spending Clause.
2000.99-1908,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1723.01,1726.642,"In Cannon, Cannon did not involve the regulation, right?"
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1732.093,1736.673,The specific claim in Cannon was actually an effect claim.
2000.99-1908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1744.929,1747.696,"Right, but the university wasn't a State university, it was a private university."
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1747.696,1749.265,"Yes, I understand."
2000.99-1908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1749.925,1753.352,"Well, that's sort of crucial to your Spending Clause argument, isn't it?"
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1753.352,1755.005,It's not--
2000.99-1908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1755.005,1765.202,I don't think our cases say that even when you're using your Spending Clause power to give private individuals the rights to some Federal money you have to be clear.
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1770.858,1783.406,"--I'm about to turn to the State issue, but I think a fair reading of the... I think the Spending Clause argument is, as they make it, would encompass private defendants."
2000.99-1908,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1783.406,1793.231,"Well, but the Spending Clause argument is, as I understand it, goes to the fact that you're trying to make a State a defendant, so Cannon can't be dispositive of that."
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1793.231,1802.353,"If the Spending Clause rules are limited in that fashion, then that would be correct."
2000.99-1908,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1803.923,1808.547,But I thought you said to accept the Spending Clause argument meant that Cannon had been wrongly decided.
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1808.547,1828.238,"--Well, if you conclude, were to conclude that the Spending Clause limitations don't apply to private parties or to cities at all, then you... then that problem would be solved, but the next problem would not, because this Court has been applying this implied cause of action to State defendants."
2000.99-1908,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1839.345,1843.803,"Did it explicitly decide the question, or did it just assume it in those cases?"
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1843.803,1849.459,"I think it's fair to say that it assumed it, as have the lower courts for years."
2000.99-1908,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1855.403,1859.945,Did either of those cases involve regulations as the immediate premise for the suit?
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1859.945,1860.483,Both.
2000.99-1908,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1860.483,1861.143,Both did?
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1861.143,1867.237,"In Bazemore we relied on a Title VI regulation, and in Alexander we relied on a Section 504 regulation."
2000.99-1908,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1867.237,1905.065,"So in other words, you're saying that if you take the silence... this is... I'm trying to follow the complicated... if you take the silence, and if you... you either read the silence as a whole, just private rights of action against States and individuals for damages and injunctions, or you try to create epicycles, or split the atom, if you're going to split that atom of silence, and if you split it to distinguish between State and private defendants, then you should also split the State defendants to distinguish between injunctive actions and damage actions."
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1915.756,1915.922,Right.
2000.99-1908,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1915.922,1916.665,Is that right?
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1916.665,1917.408,That is right.
2000.99-1908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1935.53,1942.467,"Mr. Schnapper, the two cases that you said did involve regulations, Bazemore and Alexander, were they?"
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1942.467,1942.839,Yes.
2000.99-1908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1942.839,1950.64,Did they involve a regulation that could not possibly have been an interpretive regulation?
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1954.15,1954.638,I--
2000.99-1908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1954.638,1956.003,--That's what's distinctive about this case.
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1956.003,1956.174,--Yes.
2000.99-1908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1956.174,1968.096,"Here we have a regulation that cannot possibly represent the agency's view of what the statute, 601, requires, because we've said what 601 requires, and it doesn't require this."
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,1973.214,1973.957,They did not.
2000.99-1908,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2022.588,2025.393,"Those were a long time ago, weren't they, Mr. Schnapper?"
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2025.393,2033.278,"--Yes, but the Court has continued to recognize that cause of action."
2000.99-1908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2056.146,2057.632,"Well, it would be '64 to '86."
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2063.576,2065.078,We have... we think--
2000.99-1908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2065.078,2071.188,"And at least by the time those amendments were adopted, those earlier cases were subject to considerable doubt."
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2071.188,2078.081,"--Right, but we think that an implied cause of action was appropriate under the '64 act as written."
2000.99-1908,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2078.081,2080.022,Without resort to the '86?
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2080.022,2081.219,Without resort to the '86 act.
2000.99-1908,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2197.549,2200.233,Which argument do you say was made?
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2200.233,2200.35,--That... I'm sorry.
2000.99-1908,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2224.582,2234.779,"Well, but when you start talking about Guardians, to suggest that it hasn't been accepted, really nothing was accepted, nothing much was accepted in Guardians, there were so many different opinions."
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2234.779,2237.751,"Well, with all... am I answering?"
2000.99-1908,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2237.751,2238.494,Yes.
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2238.494,2244.067,"With all respect, there were three different issues in Guardians, two of which were clearly resolved, one of which was opaque."
2000.99-1908,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2259.26,2264.833,"Yes, but the reasoning of the various opinions was not identical."
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2275.235,2281.262,I think the reasoning with regard to the first two issues I mentioned was perfectly consistent.
2000.99-1908,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2281.262,2283.203,"Well then, why were there different opinions?"
2000.99-1908,1,23226,eric_schnapper,,2283.203,2299.178,Because the... because there were differing views as to the... as to subsidiary... as to other issues.
2000.99-1908,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2312.636,2314.865,"Thank you, Mr. Schnapper."
2000.99-1908,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2317.011,2328.611,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.99-1908,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2360.107,2363.701,What social context existed in 1964?
2000.99-1908,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2363.701,2380.791,"Well, among other things, Mr. Chief Justice, the persistent practice of many local jurisdictions in evading the dictates of this Court and of Congress with respect to a variety of civil rights issues, the most prominent one being--"
2000.99-1908,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2380.791,2387.273,You're referring to what was... what various local jurisdictions were doing at the time?
2000.99-1908,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2387.273,2389.047,"--Yes, local and State jurisdictions."
2000.99-1908,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2392.845,2417.282,"Can you say anything about... it's 35 years, and you said in 35 years everyone has assumed that there is a private right of action for injunctive relief based on a regulation under Title VI, but have there only been like one or two in 35 years, or have there been a lot, or is this the first time it's come up, or the second time, or--"
2000.99-1908,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2417.282,2417.82,Are you talking about against--
2000.99-1908,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2417.82,2417.903,--You can say anything--
2000.99-1908,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2417.903,2421.247,"--Against States, or generally speaking, because the answer is yes--"
2000.99-1908,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2421.247,2425.333,"--Well, let's say against a governmental body, however you want to answer it."
2000.99-1908,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2431.649,2433.506,--I think that it is utterly embedded.
2000.99-1908,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2477.717,2477.717,"Well, one--"
2000.99-1908,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2477.717,2480.112,This is a separation of powers issue.
2000.99-1908,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2480.112,2488.74,"--General, I may... I think I agree with the proposition you start with, but one reason to look at it differently now would be this."
2000.99-1908,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2528.288,2528.864,That's--
2000.99-1908,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2528.864,2547.44,"And therefore there may be a good reason simply because this is no longer the world of Case and Borak, to draw just the kind of distinction which you point out we never have drawn before, but which we have never recognized, which we have never precluded drawing before."
2000.99-1908,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2547.44,2553.096,"--I would like to make two points, Justice Souter, in response to that observation, with which I agree."
2000.99-1908,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2626.906,2630.044,"None of those, though, were against States."
2000.99-1908,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2630.044,2631.736,"--Well... no, no, no."
2000.99-1908,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2660.509,2670.995,Were those regulations that you're concerned about regulations that plainly went beyond an interpretation of the statute?
2000.99-1908,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2670.995,2672.192,--They were--
2000.99-1908,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2672.192,2675.702,"You see, I mean, that's what's distinct about this case."
2000.99-1908,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2689.448,2693.429,--I wish I were more expert in medicare and medicaid regulations.
2000.99-1908,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2693.679,2695.081,"I wish I were, too."

2000.99-1908,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2737.972,2746.063,"My only thought, they may have the force of law, but they may not have the force of the unequivocal for purposes of the Spending Clause."
2000.99-1908,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2746.063,2779.128,"--Well, I don't think I can do better than simply to repeat what I... the point I hope that I had made, which is, there is no case suggesting that for purposes of enforcing a Spending Clause obligation there is a distinction in recognizing a cause of action based on a statute, or on regulations that the funding agency is mandated to put forward."
2000.99-1908,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2779.871,2782.843,"But there's no case suggesting that there isn't, either."
