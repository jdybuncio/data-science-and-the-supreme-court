2007.06-7517,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.527,"We'll hear argument next in Case 06-7517, Irizarry versus United States."
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,10.684,15.588,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This is a sentencing process case."
2007.06-7517,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,76.298,87.949,"You may not have had notice of the issue of whether or not an alternative procedure and medication audit would help, but you certainly knew that future dangerousness was going to be on the table."
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,96.197,107.114,"--The... the... the notice that suggested... the Guidelines departure which is suggested in the last paragraph of the pre-sentence report, is very specific."
2007.06-7517,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,118.578,127.855,"Well, yeah, I... but in terms of what issues might suggest themselves to a judge sentencing this particularly defendant, I would have thought future dangerousness."
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,140.085,149.784,"Well, it was looked at in the context of the sixth level enhancement for intent to carry out the threat, and it did come up in the context of acceptance of responsibility."
2007.06-7517,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,160.077,171.384,"Well, you know this... this provision 32(h), really doesn't... does simply not work with post-Booker guidelines."
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,242.403,242.7,"Yes, sir."
2007.06-7517,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,257.694,264.926,I don't think it is counter-intuitive to provide... to... to require notice when the number of grounds is finite.
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,273.97,286.854,"--But the... the decision of... in Burns, I think, answers the question because unless there's... if a party is not focused... and generally the parties' papers and the PSR will focus the issues."
2007.06-7517,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,333.445,340.691,"Post-Booker the guidelines are advisory, and the district judge has discretion as to the sentence."
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,373.287,375.677,I remember that system.
2007.06-7517,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,411.803,425.985,Suppose the district court in this case had said I'm considering an above-Guidelines sentence based on facts that are in the record in the pre-sentence report to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,427.454,429.14,No.
2007.06-7517,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,433.061,434.451,What would have been?
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,434.451,435.623,I think... I think--
2007.06-7517,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,435.623,443.165,And how much time... this is two questions; time question and the content question.
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,447.492,449.929,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-7517,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,489.616,501.549,"You seem to be requiring a very specific kind of notice, almost as if the district court has to say this is the sentence that I'm considering, and these are the exact reasons that I'm considering; now what do you have to say about that."
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,501.549,502.079,Yes.
2007.06-7517,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,506.078,507.218,Is that what you're asking?
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,507.218,521.712,--content... it needs to be specific... it needs to be specific enough so that the facts that get litigated are the ones that are ultimately recited by the court for the reason for the non-Guidelines sentence.
2007.06-7517,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,521.712,523.101,But why would the--
2007.06-7517,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,523.101,523.741,That's a complex answer.
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,569.99,581.485,"I think if... if she would have said something to the effect that... and this sometimes happens during the course of a sentencing, that's a different issue... but here's what's on my mind."
2007.06-7517,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,630.715,636.822,Why... why isn't that an equally response to what Justice Ginsburg just gave as a recitation of what the what the judge had said.
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,636.822,639.602,The--
2007.06-7517,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,639.602,644.833,She quoted and summarized the judge saying he's going to do it again.
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,644.833,645.458,--Yes.
2007.06-7517,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,645.458,652.816,Anybody knows that what the judge is getting at is I'm going to put him away as long as I can put him away.
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,664.624,666.857,"Yes, and that goes to the timing question."
2007.06-7517,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,679.367,682.569,So it's not the question of notice; it's the question of time to respond.
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,682.569,692.144,"--At that point it was explanation, it explanation of what she was doing, not notice of what she was going to do at a time when it would have made a difference."
2007.06-7517,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,692.144,693.316,What is she supposed to do?
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,698.954,699.422,Usually.
2007.06-7517,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,699.422,701.406,--a pre-sentence report which both parties have.
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,731.769,732.3,I--
2007.06-7517,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,732.3,734.611,Are you going to have a recess?
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,744.435,760.851,"--I think in... in the vast majority of cases, and the government concedes this in the brief or acknowledges it, that while there are infinite number of variables that lurk in every case, practically, there are not that many that are actually there."
2007.06-7517,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,773.173,776.797,"Now if it is in the pre-sentence report, is that enough notice?"
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,776.797,777.235,Yes.
2007.06-7517,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,778.391,783.857,So long as it is in the pre-sentence notice the judge doesn't have to say I plan to rely on this aspect of the pre-sentence report?
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,783.857,784.076,--No.
2007.06-7517,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,784.076,784.295,Okay.
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,784.295,788.698,"No, because in the vast majority of cases that's what occurs."
2007.06-7517,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,827.496,837.663,"Does the defendant have an obligation to give notice, both to the government and I suppose to the judge, saying at the... at the sentencing hearing, we're going to say this?"
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,841.193,844.879,"Usually, the interests, of course, are different."
2007.06-7517,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,898.108,911.524,"What about the point made by Chief Judge Boudin in his recent opinion, is that now that we look more carefully at the 3553 factors, counsel has to come in prepared to address all of those?"
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,911.524,919.239,"It is... you know, as a practical matter, it is extremely wasteful."
2007.06-7517,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,973.921,977.092,It's not what it meant when 32(h) was promulgated.
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,977.092,994.131,"Well, the Court in Rita, which was after Booker, discussed in fact, the sentencing court, applying the Guidelines in individual cases, may depart either pursuant to the Guidelines or since Booker by imposing a non-Guidelines sentence."
2007.06-7517,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,995.88,1008.578,"You could apply departure to post-Booker; but at the time this rule was adopted, departure did not consist of that; it consisted of something much more narrow."
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,1008.578,1020.012,"--It... it had a narrower meaning but... but the rule 32(h) was to implement the structure of rule 32, that's what Burns said."
2007.06-7517,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1021.527,1037.05,"Why should we put into rule 32(h), as Justice Scalia suggests, the 3553(a) factors, when we know that the rule makers did make a change in 2007?"
2007.06-7517,0,16493,arthur_j_madden_iii,,1069.709,1084.672,"--Well, I don't think that that answers the question, because under the prior structure of the rule, the pre-sentencing was supposed to set out all of the factors and (h) was just... just a stopgap."
2007.06-7517,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1115.284,1116.034,"Thank you, Counsel."
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1126.188,1142.744,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Rule 32 requires the district court to provide notice before any departure from the Guidelines range based on a ground not previously identified by the PSR of the parties, including a departure based on the factors in section 3553(a)."
2007.06-7517,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1152.286,1154.581,"Well, why shouldn't this rule be dealt with by further rulemaking?"
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1191.004,1200.656,"First of all, as enacted rule 32(h) requires notice of all deviations from the Guidelines range, and by its plain terms it continues to do that."
2007.06-7517,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1201.609,1202.391,Are you saying--
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1202.391,1203.172,--Either way--
2007.06-7517,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1203.172,1207.435,--Are you saying that if they had in mind at the time that Booker might be coming down the road.
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1207.435,1207.841,--No.
2007.06-7517,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1207.841,1211.903,There would be non-Guidelines variances from the Sentencing Guidelines.
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1211.903,1212.09,No.
2007.06-7517,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1242.42,1248.434,"The rules advisory committee is currently considering whether or not to change this, right?"
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1248.434,1249.45,Yes.
2007.06-7517,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1250.012,1255.916,"Nobody in that process has suggested, well, it's too bad you've already decided this in 32(h)?"
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1255.916,1256.774,"--Well, yes."
2007.06-7517,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1299.32,1304.833,A lot of judges objected to the idea they would adopt the position you're urging here.
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1304.833,1305.286,That's true.
2007.06-7517,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1337.195,1340.179,It's not inferring from the failure to act.
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1354.39,1363.153,"I don't think so, because they've... they've referred it back to the subcommittee and said they want to wait and see what... what this Court does and what the courts to."
2007.06-7517,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1378.054,1386.645,May I ask you this question about the rule: It says before the court may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified for departure.
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1400.311,1400.796,--No.
2007.06-7517,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1411.057,1418.024,"Well, could the pre-sentencing report just list a series of... a whole series of factors saying these are possible grounds for departure?"
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1419.054,1430.986,"--I mean, at a certain point it wouldn't, but if it listed more than one as a possible ones and they were identified with sufficient specificity to enable--"
2007.06-7517,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1430.986,1438.125,Would future dangerousness... future dangerousness be something that could be put in the report and that would cover these--
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1438.125,1438.936,--Yes.
2007.06-7517,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1445.246,1448.152,--That's the latest thing we're talking about very much.
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1448.152,1450.042,--That's required.
2007.06-7517,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1460.491,1475.079,What if the ground is I just simply believe that the Guidelines' recommendation for arson when there are people in the building is simply too low?
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1483.92,1484.966,--The parties can--
2007.06-7517,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1484.966,1495.961,"It's almost, you know, a determination of the judge's gut feeling of what is condign punishment for a particular--"
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1495.961,1502.255,--The parties... the parties would be able to focus on that and try to inform the judge's decision on that.
2007.06-7517,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1542.099,1558.546,"Couldn't you have asked at the hearing, couldn't you ask the judge: Judge, please have a continuance here because you have taken us by surprise and we'd like to offer some evidence that you... that might influence you?"
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1558.546,1560.108,You could... we could certainly do that.
2007.06-7517,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1575.991,1576.756,When?
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1596.937,1599.2,"--Well, it's... it's a context-specific question."
2007.06-7517,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1624.3,1624.8,How can that be?
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1630.11,1638.122,"--Well, several reasons; for all the reasons, Your Honor, that we said that the... that it's failure to give notice of a variance here was harmless."
2007.06-7517,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1663.925,1667.329,"Well, that all goes... that all goes to the harmless error question."
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1671.812,1672.109,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.06-7517,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1723.338,1739.956,"--In a lot of cases, though, it will be impossible for judges to make their determination the night before, take home the pre-sentence report, and, you know, stuff from the trial and focus on the next morning's sentencing hearing."
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1739.956,1743.252,"--Well, judges... JUDGE SCALIA:... decide it a week in advance."
2007.06-7517,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1758.98,1763.199,But you're really asking them to sentence first and hearing afterward.
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1763.199,1764.321,"--No, they don't--"
2007.06-7517,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1764.321,1770.147,Maybe the whole purpose of the hearing is to find out what factors are pertinent and all that.
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1774.145,1788.046,"--That... it is true that they go into the hearing with an open mind, but it's also true that before the hearing, they're going to have some sense based on the written materials that they've reviewed and based on the parties' identifications of what they think the appropriate sentence is."
2007.06-7517,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1801.573,1802.852,How specific does the notice have to be?
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1807.429,1812.958,"--Well, at a minimum, the court would have to identify the relevant 3553(a) factor."
2007.06-7517,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1836.371,1837.51,"Well, what was required here?"
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1837.51,1841.134,Here I think it would have been sufficient for the judge to say.
2007.06-7517,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1852.005,1855.768,So you disagree with the Petitioner on the specificity of notice required?
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1855.768,1856.143,Yes.
2007.06-7517,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1970.207,1972.473,Could we go back to the example for just a minute?
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1994.12,2000.117,"Well, what we would have liked to do is bring in people to explain to the judge these are the programs that are available."
2007.06-7517,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2000.898,2001.71,Couldn't the lawyer have done that?
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2001.71,2002.601,--That's how it works.
2007.06-7517,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2009.738,2010.144,But wouldn't--
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2010.144,2011.035,"--well, based on this--"
2007.06-7517,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2011.035,2014.767,"--Well, that solves the problem because the judge apparently was operating under a misunderstanding of facts."
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2014.767,2020.328,"--Well, I think that what the judge thought was that there were no available treatments that would work."
2007.06-7517,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2020.781,2021.498,And the lawyer could say you're wrong.
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2021.498,2028.059,"--That... you know, it might have dissuaded the judge there, but it didn't give us the opportunity to bring in somebody who--"
2007.06-7517,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2028.059,2028.293,"No, I understand."
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2028.293,2032.556,"--who knows how it... you know, who knows what the programs are, to explain it."
2007.06-7517,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2040.882,2046.286,"Well, if you think you have a particularly good case that they are, again you make that point to the judge."
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2046.286,2047.036,--But--
2007.06-7517,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2047.036,2051.424,"If you can see what the last report about these programs was like, you wouldn't think that."
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2059.186,2061.827,"--The judge is... you know, counsel can make the argument."
2007.06-7517,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2097.936,2098.421,In your--
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2098.421,2099.577,--and the rules get at.
2007.06-7517,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2099.577,2103.498,"--In your experience, do judges often bring in experts on this kind of stuff?"
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2103.498,2105.45,Judges... do judges bring in experts?
2007.06-7517,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2105.45,2107.387,"Well, not judges... do judges say,"
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2111.511,2123.802,"We would have... if... I think that we would... could bring in someone and testify about... to present evidence on that for sure, if the judge was thinking of imposing probation because there was no treatment program."
2007.06-7517,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2129.658,2135.313,"But you're saying that, routinely in sentencing matters, you have expert who come in and advise the judge of programs and so forth?"
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2135.313,2139.249,"Not routinely, but, you know, generally that's not an issue."
2007.06-7517,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2172.672,2181.997,But you think that this case is a poor example because you're urging us to apply the harmless error rule and say this case would have come out the same way--
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2181.997,2195.149,"Yes... I mean, it's not the best... it's not the best example to illustrate to the Court why notice is required because here we do think that the error was harmless for various reasons."
2007.06-7517,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2195.149,2202.863,"--If we... if we grant the review so we can resolve the question, does the judge have to give notice or not?"
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2229.415,2244.018,"Well, we think the Court should, you know, first obviously address the rule 32 question on which it granted certain certiorari, but after doing that, we think the Court should address the harmless error question because that will provide useful guidance to the lower courts."
2007.06-7517,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2259.45,2261.105,--I suppose we'll have--
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2261.105,2261.543,--involving variance.
2007.06-7517,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2261.543,2264.979,--I suppose we'll have a lot of appeals about the adequacy of the notice.
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2271.555,2275.07,"Well, I think this is an easy case for an appellate court to address because--"
2007.06-7517,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2275.07,2275.82,Yes.
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2276.852,2277.68,--regarding whether the notice would be adequate--
2007.06-7517,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2277.68,2278.024,--I'm sorry.
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2282.067,2290.316,"--Yes, but the questions about adequacy of notice are really no different in kind than the same questions that come up for the traditional departure rule."
2007.06-7517,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2332.11,2332.407,Continue.
2007.06-7517,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2332.642,2333.048,Sure.
2007.06-7517,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2370.969,2371.625,"Thank you, counsel."
2007.06-7517,2,38264,peter_b_rutledge,,2382.12,2392.226,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court has before it today two alternative grounds to affirm the judgment below."
2007.06-7517,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2440.77,2461.978,"But then it would be easy for a district judge to escape any obligation to give 32(h) notice because he could simply say: Oh, yeah, before I would have ranked this as a Sentencing Guidelines matter, but now I'm treating it as a 3553(a) factor, so I don't have to bother with 32(h) anymore."
2007.06-7517,2,38264,peter_b_rutledge,,2461.978,2475.568,"Justice Ginsburg, I understand your concern about the possibility that district judges might, I guess in theory, attempt to do an end run around rule 32(h) by recasting a departure decision as a variance decision."
2007.06-7517,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2563.188,2572.919,But didn't the decision that the Guidelines are not mandatory make what used to be known as Guidelines departures completely irrelevant?
2007.06-7517,2,38264,peter_b_rutledge,,2592.129,2600.782,"Justice Alito, I don't believe that this Court's Booker and post-Booker jurisprudence has made the departure determination irrelevant."
2007.06-7517,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2636.251,2637.017,I just don't understand that.
2007.06-7517,2,38264,peter_b_rutledge,,2671.035,2687.514,"Well, it may well be the case, Justice Alito, that as this Court's Booker jurisprudence unfolds, that the concept of a departure declines in importance, in addition with respect to the 32(h) obligation for notice."
2007.06-7517,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2687.514,2690.278,"Well, why is the 32(h) obligation relevant?"
2007.06-7517,2,38264,peter_b_rutledge,,2779.849,2781.849,"Certainly, Justice Breyer."
2007.06-7517,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2911.485,2916.125,Do you accept Chief Judge Boudean's safety valve as well?
2007.06-7517,2,38264,peter_b_rutledge,,2923.621,2932.43,"I accept the first part of that premise, Chief Justice Roberts: That they are may be rare cases of truly unfair surprise."
2007.06-7517,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2973.46,2975.692,That is an abuse of discretion standardized?
2007.06-7517,2,38264,peter_b_rutledge,,2975.692,2976.989,--That is an abuse of discretion--
2007.06-7517,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2976.989,2984.393,Unworkable or is there just as many impracticalities as the rule.
2007.06-7517,2,38264,peter_b_rutledge,,2984.393,3013.663,"--I... I don't think that it presents a concern of impracticability, Justice Kennedy, for one simple reason; and that is by relying on a mechanism such as the continuance, the parties are given the opportunity to identify for the court whether or not there's a concern of unfair surprise; and if there is, the district judge is in the position to decide whether or not she believes that the continuance is necessary."
2007.06-7517,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3101.22,3113.81,"Why isn't it just whatever is the reason that the judge is considering is going outside the advisory Guidelines, whatever that reason is, just say it."
2007.06-7517,2,38264,peter_b_rutledge,,3125.913,3127.804,"--I... certainly, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-7517,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3344.215,3346.59,"Thank you, Counsel."

2007.06-7517,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3470.117,3481.644,"Mr. Rutledge, you briefed and argued the case as amicus curiae in support of the judgment below upon appointment by this Court, and we thank you for undertaking and discharging that assignment."
