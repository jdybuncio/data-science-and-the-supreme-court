1966.209,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,9.728,"Number 209, Railroad Transfer Service, Incorporated, Petitioner, versus the City of Chicago."
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,11.13,15.707,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.209,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,638.15,644.563,"Do respondents agree that that -- if that was done, are you in agreement on that?"
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,644.563,645.513,No.
1966.209,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,653.004,654.243,"Oh, very well, go ahead."
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,654.243,657.541,In part anyway.
1966.209,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,660.443,662.402,Very well.
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,662.402,678.356,"Respondents now in their brief on the merits, in this Court, concede that these two provisions, these two amendments that I've detailed cannot be applied to petitioner."
1966.209,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,776.219,776.283,"Well, I --"
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,776.283,777.175,-- expeditiously.
1966.209,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,777.175,786.983,"You don't have to summarize for me, I just -- I know that there was some phase of the facts that were interpreted differently by both sides."
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,786.983,788.011,That is correct.
1966.209,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,788.032,789.762,But I wonder if this was the one?
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,789.762,790.482,"This was the one, yes."
1966.209,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,790.482,795.515,This is the one.
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,795.515,808.464,The section regarding financial statements by taxicab operators was made in terms to apply to taxicab operators.
1966.209,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,867.631,869.021,May I ask this?
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,873.698,878.147,It was -- the case went to the Court of Appeals.
1966.209,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,880.539,882.562,"Yes, I mean the last time."
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,882.562,887.814,It was amend -- it was before the last argument in --
1966.209,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,887.814,888.693,Was it raised?
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,890.879,891.292,Yes sir.
1966.209,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,891.292,892.198,Did they deal with it?
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,892.198,892.778,Yes sir.
1966.209,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,892.778,895.129,"Okay, go ahead."
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,895.129,911.031,The Court of Appeals said that the requirement to furnish financial data or words to that effect is within the ul -- the legitimate police power of the city.
1966.209,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,978.994,991.052,Are you saying to us that if respondents have made a concession on these two points that that disposes of your grievance?
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,991.052,996.655,"Not entirely, there are two other points that -- in which they have not made concessions, or does that answer your question?"
1966.209,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,996.655,1001.504,"I thought so, and -- but are you still pressing those?"
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,1001.504,1002.485,Those other two points?
1966.209,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1002.485,1002.915,Yes.
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,1002.915,1005.658,Yes sir.
1966.209,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1098.239,1100.94,Did the city argue to that effect below?
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,1100.94,1102.893,Yes sir.
1966.209,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1165.565,1168.009,This petitioner's principal place of business is in Chicago?
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,1168.009,1168.773,Yes sir.
1966.209,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1186.54,1196.575,"I'm wondering if they -- if with respect to this issue, there is -- really is any right case with controversy now."
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,1196.575,1206.187,"Well, I'm -- I -- with all due respect, Your Honor, we believe there is in this way."
1966.209,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1277.453,1285.276,"And you don't -- then in most circumstances, you wouldn't consider it an important issue in the case where you said it wasn't raised?"
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,1285.276,1290.164,"That is correct, if -- well -- it -- well --"
1966.209,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1290.164,1291.916,You want us to make clear that you raised the point?
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,1291.916,1293.627,"We'd want it, I -- yes, yes, sir."
1966.209,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1300.767,1301.696,"I see, yes."
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,1301.696,1304.572,"Because in that way, that would avoid the defense of res judicata."
1966.209,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1304.572,1308.267,Yes.
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,1308.267,1322.847,A great deal of the argument of the respondents is to the effect that the city has done nothing to hurt us.
1966.209,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1463.337,1472.071,"What if your client insisted on his drivers not having licenses, driver's licenses or chauffeurs' licenses?"
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,1472.071,1475.237,"Oh, we admit that it has to have some kind of a chauffeur's license."
1966.209,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1475.237,1486.191,"Well, so that there are some grounds on which local authorities could suspend your operations or revoke your certificate or deny an app -- a new application."
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,1492.727,1495.298,"Under some circumstances, under the police power."
1966.209,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1495.298,1497.48,Well I -- in some circumstances and they would have the --
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,1497.48,1510.771,"Yes, but they -- we say that they can base the -- they can't say -- they can say to us, “Your chauffeurs must have licenses as chauffeurs, driver or a chauffeur's license”."
1966.209,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1518.705,1524.896,"Well, but I was just -- I don't see that why the Court of Appeals necessarily inconsistent."
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,1539.946,1557.905,"There are circumstances within the police power but we think that the phrase used that he must prove he's qualified to pursue the occupation of transferring passengers between stations, gives the city the right to --"
1966.209,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1557.905,1558.035,I know but --
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,1558.035,1559.874,-- exercise an economic power.
1966.209,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1559.874,1567.355,One example of proving your qualifications to prove that you've got drivers who are licensed for example to drive vehicles.
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,1567.355,1568.36,"Oh well, but there are --"
1966.209,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1568.36,1570.258,"Now, isn't that true?"
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,1570.258,1572.423,This is an addition to all of those others.
1966.209,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1572.423,1572.947,I know.
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,1572.947,1575.919,And it is not a sum -- it is not a summarization of them.
1966.209,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1579.687,1586.936,"Well, you don't even know what -- but, you don't know and I guess this is your point, what qualifications the city is going to insist though?"
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,1586.936,1587.74,That is right.
1966.209,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1587.74,1592.148,You have no -- except that you have them because you're licensed.
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,1592.148,1593.698,That is right.
1966.209,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1593.698,1613.508,"What's wrong -- what's the -- then why, why shouldn't the Court wait and see the circumstances in which -- or the qualifications on which the city is going to insist and the circumstances in which you might be denied the right to --"
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,1613.508,1624.4,"Because the city -- because -- two answers to that, because of our past experience with the city of deliberately trying to put us out of business and we think this is another attempt along the same line."
1966.209,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1624.4,1628.507,"Yes, but they're licensed, I mean, if you -- license is every year."
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,1628.507,1632.426,"No, we've had licenses in the first year which we obtained under the rest."
1966.209,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1639.089,1639.11,Yes.
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,1639.11,1639.55,-- the District Court.
1966.209,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1639.55,1642.758,But they haven't refused the license fees?
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,1642.758,1644.089,"No, they have not."
1966.209,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1644.089,1644.16,And --
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,1644.16,1647.42,"But someday, we think they will under critical times."
1966.209,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1647.42,1647.466,"Well, why is that --"
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,1647.466,1648.039,Now the point is we don't --
1966.209,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1648.039,1656.792,Why is that -- why isn't that a good time then to test out the validity of this ordinance since there are some circumstances on which you admit they could deny you --
1966.209,0,16508,amos_m_mathews,,1656.792,1663.242,Those circumstances are spelled out in the ordinance and we don't attack them.
1966.209,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1689.384,1699.024,"You may, Mr. Mathews."
1966.209,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,1700.061,1704.486,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.209,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1816.288,1824.913,"Now could you help me out -- well, there's no suggestion that there is -- that there's anything wrong when they're litigating the validity of this ordinance, is there?"
1966.209,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1824.913,1826.733,"No, Mr. Justice."
1966.209,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1826.733,1834.535,"Well, would you -- are you (Inaudible) and you are sustaining or saying that neither -- that the District Court didn't have any jurisdiction --"
1966.209,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,1834.535,1834.97,No.
1966.209,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1834.97,1835.601,-- to entertain this suit?
1966.209,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,1835.601,1847.75,"The point, Mr. Justice White that I'm attempting to make is that throughout its briefs, Transfer argues that the City of Chicago is endeavoring to subvert the opinion of this Court in Atchison."
1966.209,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1870.658,1870.671,Well I'm not sure --
1966.209,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,1870.671,1872.229,-- convenience and necessity again.
1966.209,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1872.229,1877.219,"I'm not sure what helps to decide the case, to find out who was trying to subvert what --"
1966.209,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,1877.219,1877.881,"Well, forget --"
1966.209,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1877.881,1883.079,-- to be -- real -- isn't it really the issue is the validity of this ordinance under the constitution or no?
1966.209,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,1883.079,1886.066,"Yes, it is, Mr. Justice White and perhaps what would the city --"
1966.209,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1886.066,1886.829,"Well, was --"
1966.209,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,1886.829,1887.387,-- perhaps the city was just --
1966.209,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1887.387,1892.88,But the Court of Appeals decide that that there was no jurisdiction to decide the case?
1966.209,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,1892.88,1897.468,The Court of Appeals really held that there was no controversy.
1966.209,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1897.468,1897.793,"It says, but if --"
1966.209,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,1897.793,1904.688,But the question which you presented to Mr. Mathews was really the basis of the Court of Appeals' opinion.
1966.209,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1906.789,1906.971,"Yes, but they said --"
1966.209,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,1906.971,1913.944,The City of Chicago has issued all of the licenses which Transfer his applied for.
1966.209,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1939.981,1949.445,But it says the District Court found jurisdiction to entertain Transfer's second amended complaint.
1966.209,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,1953.558,1953.663,Yes sir.
1966.209,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1953.663,1956.061,And then they said there was no controversy?
1966.209,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,1956.061,1974.014,"Your Honor was that relates to as in the initial complaint, the city asserted that the amount in controversy was not sufficient to give jurisdiction that the amount of fees that had accumulated was not equal to the jurisdictional amount."
1966.209,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1981.092,1981.123,Yes.
1966.209,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,1981.123,1982.311,-- the Commerce Act.
1966.209,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2082.949,2089.716,Mr. Simon I am having one difficulty in finding out just what the issues are.
1966.209,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2089.716,2090.058,Mr. Justice --
1966.209,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2090.058,2095.237,I'd like to ask you specifically in the 28-6.
1966.209,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2167.291,2167.709,Yes.
1966.209,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2167.709,2169.449,But what is the city's position?
1966.209,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2169.449,2184.746,"Mr. Justice Fortas, the city's position is that the record does not show whether Section 28-6 was applied to Transfer."
1966.209,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2193.494,2193.907,I know --
1966.209,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2193.907,2193.934,-- down the District Court.
1966.209,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2193.934,2195.578,-- but I'm asking you now.
1966.209,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2200.949,2201.076,And in regard to --
1966.209,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2201.076,2205.231,And under what -- maybe it is or is not properly before us.
1966.209,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2205.231,2226.338,"Mr. Justice, in regard to your specific question, the city in its brief was attempting to contradict transfer, not concede that qualified to pursue the occupation of a coachman was not applicable."
1966.209,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2243.274,2248.48,"Alright, I beg your pardon Mr. Simon, I don't want to press you unduly."
1966.209,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2255.466,2257.603,Yes.
1966.209,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2257.603,2263.505,-- was incorporated in these -- in this ordinance --
1966.209,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2263.505,2263.69,That's right.
1966.209,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2263.69,2267.6,-- after our decision in Atchison.
1966.209,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2316.167,2321.102,"Well, Mr. Justice, I -- really and truly, I'm not trying not to evade your question."
1966.209,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2381.989,2386.824,That's the way the 28-6 seems to read --
1966.209,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2386.824,2386.963,Well --
1966.209,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2386.963,2406.32,"It requires that the applicant specifically do all these things you've mentioned and then it said, and that the applicant is qualified to the city occupation of the cabman or coachman which seems to superimpose as your Brother, opposing counsel said, an additional requirement."
1966.209,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2406.32,2407.476,"No, the first sentence would be meaningless --"
1966.209,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2407.476,2408.259,The word and --
1966.209,1,40388,raymond_f_simon,,2408.259,2408.558,-- Mr. Justice.
1966.209,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2408.558,2410.861,-- would seems to be adding something additional.
