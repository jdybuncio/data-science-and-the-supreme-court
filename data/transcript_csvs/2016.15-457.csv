2016.15-457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.97,"We'll hear argument first this morning in case 15-457, Microsoft Corporation v. Baker. Mr. Fisher."
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,7.97,29.26,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Years after Livesay, the rules committee considered what options should be available to plaintiffs who find themselves in precisely the situation the plaintiffs here claim to have found themselves, having class certification denied in a case where they claim the individual claims make it impractical to litigate ahead on an individualized basis."
2016.15-457,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,45.585,46.01,Mr. Fisher --
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,46.01,46.63,And it would --
2016.15-457,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,46.63,47.565,Please.
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,47.565,51.69,And it would also contravene statutory and case law on which it is based.
2016.15-457,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,51.69,64.35,"And may I ask, a lot of your briefing in this case operates on the premise that there really was -- that this claim will spring back, that there was some kind of reservation --"
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,64.35,64.59,Yeah.
2016.15-457,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,64.59,67.42,-- of rights such that this claim would spring back.
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,83.195,83.74,No.
2016.15-457,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,164.74,169.105,"I guess I read your brief, so I have largely bought into that assumption."
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,195.04,195.37,No.
2016.15-457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,206.29,206.58,You are not --
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,206.58,207.69,-- make no mistake --
2016.15-457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,207.69,209.8,You are not embracing that argument.
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,209.8,210.21,No.
2016.15-457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,221.275,221.59,Well --
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,221.59,221.69,But --
2016.15-457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,221.69,247.65,"Either they were talking about their original claims, which included the class allegation, and they argued, not only at page 45 but also at page 49, that if the class certification ruling is overturned, they, then, will have Article III standing, for example, because they do have particular injury, you know, the spreading of the costs of their attorneys' fees, incentive payments they -- they might receive."
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,247.65,250.065,"Let me -- let me be clear, Mr. Chief Justice."
2016.15-457,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,319.21,324.905,"Well, do you think that should be something? The -- the lower courts did not address that question."
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,338.06,360.13,"Well, Justice Kagan, if the Court held that the plaintiffs' claims cannot be revived, and so, therefore, the only question is whether there's a mootness problem, we think the law is clear enough -- and the reasons I just described, that it's so clear that they wouldn't be entitled to an incentive award based on individual claims they brought and immediately dismissed, but you could hold that the case is flat-out moot. If there were any doubt about that --"
2016.15-457,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,360.13,361.625,There was no discovery here?
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,361.625,368.92,There was no discovery because what we had is motion practice that was based on the earlier case where there were 16 months of discovery in the earlier case.
2016.15-457,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,380.03,405.19,"Mr. Fisher, you've been arguing this in the alternative, but what do you think is the critical fact for you? Is it that they dismissed their claim voluntarily? Is it that they dismissed their claim voluntarily with prejudice? Is it that the case is not moot? What's your best argument and what's your best critical fact that defines the outcome in this case?"
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,405.19,412.37,"I think the easiest way to decide the case, Justice Sotomayor, is to say when they dismissed their claims with prejudice, their claims were gone forever."
2016.15-457,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,412.46,412.95,Does that mean --
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,412.95,413.95,-- that's been consistent.
2016.15-457,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,413.95,419.18,"-- that there's no -- I mean, I personally don't like absolutes."
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,419.18,419.675,Uh-huh.
2016.15-457,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,419.675,430.7,"And so I haven't been able to imagine a situation in which a case is dismissed with prejudice, but where there may be some issues that should survive."
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,430.7,431.98,Right.
2016.15-457,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,431.98,452.215,"And I don't -- actually haven't done research on this, so I may be answering -- asking a question that's already been answered by our case law, but let's assume an attorney sanction, something of that nature. If I don't buy an absolute, how do I articulate it?"
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,452.215,452.84,Well --
2016.15-457,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,452.84,462.27,"You dismiss with prejudice all your claims, are all appeals are waived, or all appeals but? How do -- how do we answer that?"
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,462.27,464.41,So I think you can answer it in two steps.
2016.15-457,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,501.73,502.79,Isn't that the --
2016.15-457,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,502.79,513.735,"Can you give me an example of -- of what that would -- you have an antitrust case and the court insist that the market be interpreted so narrowly that the case doesn't make much sense, would that work?"
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,513.735,520.38,"Well, actually, the hypothetical you just said, Justice Kennedy, is quite close to the Thompson case itself, which was an antitrust case."
2016.15-457,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,532.81,533.05,How about --
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,533.05,533.26,And so --
2016.15-457,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,533.26,538.05,-- evidentiary ruling -- an adverse evidentiary ruling under Daubert this expert can't testify?
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,538.05,539.25,"By and large, that is --"
2016.15-457,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,539.25,540.915,And it decimates your case.
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,540.915,548.54,"Well, if it truly decimated your case, then perhaps, at least according to some of the lower courts, you could take an appeal from a voluntary dismissal."
2016.15-457,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,567.54,584.355,"And what you're creating with that is not just -- it's not just a small loophole. What you're creating is an enormous gap, because any interlocutory order could be characterized by the party that loses as something that's critical to the case."
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,590.015,595.34,"Well, Justice Alito, I think you could take an absolutely firm position to preclude that possibility."
2016.15-457,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,606.4,606.78,"Well, what -- what --"
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,606.78,607.32,If I could add --
2016.15-457,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,607.32,611.03,"-- would be the definition of a ruling -- well, what is decimate the merits? What does that mean?"
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,611.03,614.3,"Well, I think that you have effectively already lost on the merits."
2016.15-457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,632.68,639.145,"I don't understand how it normally works, which I'm sure trial judges must face this all the time."
2016.15-457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,666.47,669.59,"And then if he just refused to, I don't know what would happen."
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,678.235,683.83,"Well, I think by and large, Justice Breyer, in your hypothetical, the defendant, of course, would move for summary judgment."
2016.15-457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,693.64,699.395,"It would be the defendant who moves for summary judgment, and then it will be entered in his favor."
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,701.97,702.42,That's right.
2016.15-457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,703.42,705.3,I would think that was the normal system.
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,705.3,705.9,Absolutely.
2016.15-457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,712.72,713.21,"Well, but there's a lot --"
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,713.21,714.11,-- for the judgment against them.
2016.15-457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,714.11,718.355,"There's a lot left of their case, but just the individual claims, not the class claims; right?"
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,718.355,720.69,"Well, there are no class claims, Mr. Chief Justice."
2016.15-457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,720.69,720.89,Right.
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,724.135,726.03,"Well, they've given up their individual claims."
2016.15-457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,726.03,726.7,"No, I know, but --"
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,726.7,727.65,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2016.15-457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,727.65,728.69,-- that's like any appeal.
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,746.07,746.385,Right.
2016.15-457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,746.385,749.07,But it's not as if there's nothing left of the case.
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,752.915,757.15,"Well, their claims have been given away, remember, Mr. Chief Justice."
2016.15-457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,760.175,760.49,Well --
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,760.49,769.305,"But either they have revived -- either they've reserved the right to revive their claims, in which case I would agree, their individual claims are still alive, but we don't have a final judgment --"
2016.15-457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,769.305,769.49,"No, no."
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,769.65,770.93,-- or they've given them away.
2016.15-457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,770.93,775.085,Their -- their claims are alive prior to their -- their voluntary dismissal.
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,775.085,775.795,That's right.
2016.15-457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,775.795,776.315,Okay.
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,776.315,777.04,That's right.
2016.15-457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,789.73,795.205,Can you explain to me just how does it work in an ordinary case? A class action is special in this respect.
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,796.975,797.38,Uh-huh.
2016.15-457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,797.38,804.725,"The defendant, I say, has told the biggest lie anyone has ever told and it violates 19 statutes."
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,809.39,810.1,Uh-huh.
2016.15-457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,810.1,812.78,But I'd like to bring a class action.
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,818.335,818.69,Uh-huh.
2016.15-457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,818.69,819.2,All right.
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,833.26,833.755,Right.
2016.15-457,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,833.755,834.22,All right.
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,836.84,858.23,"Well, that's exactly the problem the rules committee considered, Justice Breyer. And what they held is that in that situation, the plaintiffs can go to a court of appeals and ask for a discretionary appeal and say -- they can argue just exactly as you did, that our claim isn't worth it on an individualized basis and for that reason, you should a grant us a right to an interlocutory appeal. If that right, however, is -- I'm sorry."
2016.15-457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,863.42,863.98,But in -- in --
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,863.98,865.71,-- where the Court unanimously held --
2016.15-457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,865.71,869.445,"In that -- that position, because this Court rejected the death-knell rule."
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,874.035,875.39,"Exactly, Justice Ginsburg."
2016.15-457,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,893.92,894.14,So just --
2016.15-457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,894.14,894.36,Do you have --
2016.15-457,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,894.36,896.1,-- out of curiosity -- I'm sorry.
2016.15-457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,896.1,903.77,Do you have any idea what the statistics show about how often appellate courts grant interlocutory appeals under 23(f)?
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,903.77,904.32,Yes.
2016.15-457,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,910.54,912.405,And what criteria did they use?
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,912.405,914.93,"Well, they're allowed under the rule to use any criteria they like."
2016.15-457,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,915.31,920.38,"But what did they really use? Did they, you know, basically take a peek at the merits? What did they do?"
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,920.38,920.9,Yes.
2016.15-457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,949.12,958.45,"And we made one change, I think, that would be favorable to the plaintiffs; that is, 1292(b) is double discretion."
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,968.955,972.3,"That's right, Justice Ginsburg. And so there's actually two things that are important here."
2016.15-457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1026.6,1032.445,"Well, but -- but as a practical matter, that's not going to happen, right? I mean, they have just their individual claim."
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1050.29,1057.07,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, first of all, and maybe a 10-cent hypothetical is rather in the extreme, but the --"
2016.15-457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1057.07,1063.27,"Given the expense -- given the expense of litigation, it can be $10,000 and it's still not going to be worth it to go forward."
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1063.27,1065.71,"Well, it might well be for a couple of reasons, Mr. Chief Justice."
2016.15-457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1145.225,1145.5,This is --
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1145.5,1146.815,And that was another element --
2016.15-457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1146.815,1174.925,"This is a case where there were two Rule 23(f) motions, both denied, and we're talking about the same court of appeals. Was there any effort when this appeal, the case that's now before us, to -- to get it to the same panel? We had three different panels, didn't we, for the..."
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1174.925,1182.97,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, to be precise, actually there are two different cases, so there was a first case where class certification was denied, and then Rule 23(f) was denied."
2016.15-457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1182.97,1183.55,And then you have --
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1183.55,1184.52,And that case went away --
2016.15-457,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1184.52,1185.15,-- two cases here --
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1185.15,1185.5,Right.
2016.15-457,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1215.98,1228.31,"It is odd that the panel that decided the case, finally decided the case, apparently thought that this -- there was a proper ground for this to go forward as a class -- as a class action, right?"
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1228.31,1228.81,No.
2016.15-457,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1229.61,1233.745,"Well, they said the class -- the class allegations were improperly dismissed."
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1233.745,1234.0,Right.
2016.15-457,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1234.21,1234.79,Were they not?
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1234.79,1235.74,Let me say two things.
2016.15-457,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1257.0,1257.76,"Yeah, okay."
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1267.245,1267.71,Right.
2016.15-457,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1267.71,1269.71,-- class action certification.
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1269.71,1285.065,"That's correct, and I think it goes to the nature and actually the benefit of Rule 23(f)'s discretionary review system, which is, just to use this Court as an example, it might deny certiorari on a meritorious claim, thinking, though, that the error would be harmless in any event or some other ground."
2016.15-457,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1307.56,1307.86,No.
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1326.875,1328.52,I might be able to say that.
2016.15-457,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1330.43,1330.75,How would that --
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1330.75,1340.18,-- one of the judges who was on the -- one -- one of the judges who was on the motion panel that denied the 23(f) petition was on the merits panel that decided the case in front of you today.
2016.15-457,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1347.33,1352.11,"Well, how would that be consistent with the -- the reasoning of the panel that decided the case that's before us?"
2016.15-457,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1352.11,1357.035,"Because, remember, go back to the idea why we have discretionary review in the first place, Justice Alito."
2016.15-457,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1463.82,1481.085,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stris."
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1481.085,1493.675,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If a district court commits prejudicial nonharmless error, our core position is that a plaintiff can bet her whole case on its reversal."
2016.15-457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1564.025,1566.545,"For some reason, that wasn't a class action."
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1566.545,1568.49,That -- that was not a class action --
2016.15-457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1568.49,1575.195,So -- but here you have -- you -- you have the individual claim.
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1585.06,1587.62,"So I don't agree with that characterization, Justice Ginsburg."
2016.15-457,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1599.52,1600.47,Just before the --
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1600.47,1600.78,Yeah.
2016.15-457,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1600.78,1613.98,"So there -- there is this one case that suggested that that is what would happen. I mean, is this a procedure that's used in the Ninth Circuit? What is it used for? Why did people think that this was the governing law?"
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1613.98,1616.1,"So, yes, it's not one case."
2016.15-457,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1628.885,1644.545,"You didn't do that. You said -- you said you -- a piece of paper I have here, whether it's a little technical, but it says this action you moved and would be granted, should be dismissed with prejudice. Then in the next paragraph you say you intend to appeal."
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1646.03,1647.11,"It is, and let me explain."
2016.15-457,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1647.11,1654.41,"How do I know that it's a reservation? There's a lot of case law that says you can't just express a future intent, and we're being technical."
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1661.465,1671.985,"I understand, Justice Breyer. I'm going to explain why it is a conditional dismissal, and I definitely will get back to your question, Justice Ginsburg, about why I think this is permitted in the class action context. So here's why, Justice Breyer."
2016.15-457,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1714.17,1714.62,There isn't --
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1714.62,1715.49,-- dismissal with prejudice.
2016.15-457,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1715.49,1716.14,-- there isn't --
2016.15-457,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1716.14,1719.66,Maybe now is the time for you to answer Justice Ginsburg's question. (Laughter.)
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1719.66,1733.915,I -- I -- I would -- I would love to. So the reason why I think this is permitted in -- in the class action context is because there's two things you need to do in -- in order to have your claim spring back to life.
2016.15-457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1761.46,1763.23,"Let me ask you, because you mentioned Rule 23."
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1792.125,1796.76,"I -- so I think every plaintiffs' lawyer certainly would, and it goes to the core of why --"
2016.15-457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1796.76,1798.13,But would you have to on your theory?
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1798.13,1818.43,"I don't -- you would not have to, but let me tell you why plaintiffs' lawyers would, and -- because it points up why at why this is not an end run around Rule 23. So there's nothing in the balance struck by Rule 23(f) that suggests, we submit, any intent to either penalize or prevent plaintiffs from obtaining a final judgment by betting their case."
2016.15-457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1841.92,1842.9,But they could have.
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1860.445,1861.21,Certainly.
2016.15-457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1919.235,1926.65,But -- did -- did it go back when it went back? Was it litigated as a class action?
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1926.65,1928.67,"Well, it couldn't be because --"
2016.15-457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1928.67,1929.065,Yes.
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1929.065,1931.65,-- but -- but they settled as a class action.
2016.15-457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1940.8,1946.13,"But you have just said, I take it, that, yes, it's the plaintiff's choice."
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,1968.58,1985.695,"Let me try to answer, I think I can give, hopefully, a more satisfactory answer in the following way. Even though 23(f) exists, a plaintiff could choose, after a class allegation is stricken, to litigate their individual claims to final judgment and then appeal."
2016.15-457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1998.97,2001.81,"They -- well, of course. 23(f) is about a class action."
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2003.645,2004.71,"No, no, no."
2016.15-457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2029.69,2030.26,But the --
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2030.26,2030.94,-- doesn't change that.
2016.15-457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2030.94,2034.89,"-- but any final judgment, when it's all over, you can bring up everything."
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2034.89,2035.23,Right.
2016.15-457,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2054.2,2054.29,Could --
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2054.29,2054.95,Underline --
2016.15-457,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2054.95,2059.93,"Could I take you back, sorry, just to this sort of nonreservation reservation point."
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2069.705,2072.42,We said we were going to appeal a prior adverse order.
2016.15-457,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2072.42,2073.13,Right.
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2089.64,2096.39,So the cases -- the cases you find on pages 2 to 3 or 3 to 4 of our Ninth Circuit brief.
2016.15-457,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2103.69,2108.51,"Yeah, but the problem is -- and it is a problem for you -- that there are other circuits."
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2186.255,2192.345,"So I -- I think even if you do think about the case that way, we're right, Justice Breyer, and -- and here's why."
2016.15-457,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2300.97,2303.625,"Counsel, what is the circuit split on this?"
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2303.625,2304.59,On which issue?
2016.15-457,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2304.59,2307.82,On this very issue of these conditional appeals.
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2322.42,2322.86,Yes.
2016.15-457,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2322.86,2326.59,"But if there's no agreement, then you plead guilty; you've waived."
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2332.68,2337.855,So I'll -- I'll -- I'm going to answer that and I want to say three things. The first is there's actually a series of circuit splits.
2016.15-457,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2371.93,2373.21,"Well, that's a different question."
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2390.28,2392.275,"In -- in Procter & Gamble, Your Honor."
2016.15-457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2408.36,2424.85,"But that had everything to do with the merits because the argument was secrecy. If the government's position was, well, if we turn over the transcript, we've -- we've lost, the whole thing is about the government secrecy plea."
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2433.54,2435.87,"Well, I don't think I agree, Justice Ginsburg."
2016.15-457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2441.63,2445.57,But they were ordered to -- the government was ordered to turn over a grand jury transcript; right?
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2445.57,2446.445,That's correct.
2016.15-457,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2487.295,2501.09,"Well, it's one thing when a party who suffered a very serious adverse ruling on an interlocutory order says: Okay, we give up; go ahead and enter judgment for the other side."
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2527.38,2527.75,"Well, I --"
2016.15-457,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2527.75,2528.475,-- I would say.
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2545.28,2550.635,But -- but that's precisely what happened in Procter & Gamble and that's precisely the argument that Procter & Gamble made.
2016.15-457,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2552.22,2555.135,"Well, tell me what's wrong with that as a matter of first principles."
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2555.135,2558.8,"Well, what's wrong with our position, or with rejecting our position?"
2016.15-457,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2558.8,2558.86,No.
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2560.15,2566.53,I think what's wrong with that is it runs square up against what the long-standing definition of finality has always been.
2016.15-457,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2596.2,2596.43,"No, no, no."
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2612.85,2633.805,"So I was answering a finality question, and I'd like to -- I'd like to explain it and then pivot back to that. What I'm saying is as a matter of whether this satisfies Rule 1291, the -- the fact that things could spring back to life if we win on appeal is irrelevant, because any judgment could spring back to life if you win on appeal."
2016.15-457,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2662.56,2665.3,"Well, it's not -- it's not simply the fact that you consented."
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2683.375,2687.06,So I guess there's a few things going on there.
2016.15-457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2694.05,2707.17,"What about Procter & Gamble, which you -- you've cited a number of times in this argument? But I thought that that decision said a plaintiff who voluntarily dismisses a complaint may not appeal that decision."
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2707.17,2708.19,"Oh, no, no."
2016.15-457,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2718.575,2727.29,"But in Procter & Gamble, the Court was very careful to say when the government proposed dismissal for failure to obey, it had lost on the merits."
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2727.29,2727.52,And what --
2016.15-457,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2727.52,2728.94,That is not your case.
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2728.94,2734.485,"Oh, it most certainly is, because what the Court meant there was had lost on the merits of the discovery ruling."
2016.15-457,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2806.89,2822.9,"Is there anything terrible that would happen if, say, the precedent leaves this open, and looking to try to simplify procedure, we'd say: If we take the other side, we leave to people in your position."
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2858.58,2861.27,"The answer, Justice Breyer, is I think a number of terrible things happen."
2016.15-457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2925.58,2944.875,"Suppose we have a case before the district court and the only issue, disputed issue, is a pure question of law and the plaintiff says, I don't want to bother with asking a district judge to resolve this question of law."
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,2961.625,2962.42,"Oh, certainly not."
2016.15-457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3076.07,3077.09,May I ask you something --
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,3077.09,3077.85,-- on their final judgment rule.
2016.15-457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3077.85,3085.055,-- before your time is out about the mechanics of this. So the Ninth Circuit didn't say you were entitled to a class action.
2016.15-457,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3095.63,3099.195,It's over 23(f) and go right back --
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,3099.195,3116.205,"So that's true as a -- as a jurisdictional matter, but not really and here's why. The idea that a -- an issue can come up multiple times on appeal, whether it's certification or not, that's an incident of a district court not deciding -- deciding an issue on fewer than all of the grounds that are possible."
2016.15-457,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3136.97,3143.9,Where in the briefs can I find the three splits that you didn't get to? You talked about the Second and the Federal Circuit.
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,3145.85,3150.3,So I don't think that the splits are addressed in -- in the brief.
2016.15-457,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3154.31,3154.8,Yes. MR. STRIS.
2016.15-457,1,38345,peter_k_stris,,3210.46,3231.215,"-- it chronicles the circuit's splits in a -- in a lot of detail, and -- and you can see the policy arguments on both sides. So I -- I suppose in conclusion, if I could leave you with anything, it would be this: This particular issue about conditional prejudice dismissals and its implications not just in the class setting but -- but writ large, is very complicated."
2016.15-457,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3290.07,3293.635,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fisher, six minutes."
2016.15-457,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3293.635,3294.87,Thank you.
2016.15-457,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3369.2,3374.18,But that's not quite -- that's not quite right.
2016.15-457,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3378.13,3378.19,Yeah.
2016.15-457,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3378.19,3381.97,-- you can go ahead with your individual claim.
2016.15-457,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3384.41,3384.69,All right.
2016.15-457,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3385.12,3391.25,"If they dismiss the case and they don't win on the procedural issue, that's the end of the case."
2016.15-457,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3391.31,3393.4,"But two responses, Justice Sotomayor."
2016.15-457,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3433.51,3433.82,So how do you --
2016.15-457,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3433.82,3434.285,-- this is really --
2016.15-457,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3434.285,3436.4,How do you account for the circuit split?
2016.15-457,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3436.4,3437.17,Well --
2016.15-457,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3437.17,3448.51,"So what -- what -- it appears, and I've not studied this part of the issue carefully, but that there's a lot of circuits permitting these conditional appeals."
2016.15-457,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3448.51,3452.305,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, I think there's two levels to that question you're asking me."
2016.15-457,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3655.105,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
