1989.89-65,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.606,"We'll hear argument first this morning No. 89-65, Fort Stewart Schools v. Federal Labor Relations Authority."
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,11.089,13.908,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-65,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,113.773,122.629,"Mr. Wright, with respect to that first category of employees, is bargaining over their wages specifically excluded by the act, by the FLRA?"
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,122.629,124.064,--It... it works that way.
1989.89-65,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,183.685,195.493,"Mr. Wright, the... the employees whose wages are at issue here are not employees where Federal law sets their wage, as I understand it."
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,195.493,196.01,That's correct.
1989.89-65,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,199.629,209.753,"And before this statute was enacted, there was an executive order that provided substantially similar provisions?"
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,209.753,211.02,It was similar in some ways.
1989.89-65,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,217.657,228.548,"And under the former executive order, would the bargaining proposal here have been upheld?"
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,228.548,235.285,"The FLRC, the FLRA's predecessor, did hold in two cases that pay was negotiable."
1989.89-65,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,325.009,327.442,"Well, don't we assume they understand?"
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,334.781,345.471,I don't... I don't know any example of a case quite like this one where a senator specifically said that pay is not negotiable under the FLRC cases.
1989.89-65,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,345.471,354.409,But that comment could reflect the generality of the fact that most Federal employees are... are... their salaries are set by law.
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,354.409,355.478,It's possible.
1989.89-65,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,370.404,376.141,"In what respect was the governing language here different from the language of the executive order, the FLRC--"
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,376.141,379.926,--It did not specifically refer to conditions of employment.
1989.89-65,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,417.718,426.824,"--You think conditions of employment, which is used in the statute, is a narrower term than working conditions?"
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,426.824,427.857,"Well, we think the different term--"
1989.89-65,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,427.857,434.328,Do you think conditions of employment is less likely to include wages than working conditions?
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,434.328,436.263,"--Well, they are obviously very similar."
1989.89-65,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,437.946,438.748,I don't think so.
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,448.238,456.094,"--Well, in this case, of course, it's... conditions of employment are defined to include matters affecting working conditions."
1989.89-65,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,507.026,515.131,"Well, Mr. Wright, on conditions of employment, does it include, in your view, more than physical working conditions?"
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,515.131,528.856,"Yes, we agree, as we tried to explain in our reply brief, that basically our position would be in accord with Justice Stewart's statements in his concurring opinion in the Fibreboard case."
1989.89-65,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,528.856,535.444,Why do you think that a condition of employment might not be the wage that's paid?
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,535.444,547.353,"Well, as Justice Stewart explained, and as the D.C. Circuit explained, the... the first impression you would get from that language is that Congress was talking about the physical conditions of work."
1989.89-65,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,547.853,551.488,Well it isn't... the term isn't self-explanatory.
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,551.488,552.205,--That's true.
1989.89-65,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,552.871,557.959,"Then why wouldn't we defer to the agency's interpretation of it, the FLRA?"
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,557.959,586.061,"--Well, because we think that after this Court uses the traditional tools of statutory construction, as this Court said was appropriate in the Chevron case involving deference, that the Court will be left with the impression, like four courts of appeals, that the statute... clearly that Congress in the statute clearly did not mean to wait... to make wages negotiable."
1989.89-65,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,588.194,597.1,"Well, there... do you feel that the FLRA's conclusion is unreasonable under the Chevron principle?"
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,597.1,597.536,--Yes.
1989.89-65,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,609.76,613.645,It seems to me that that is a great big mountain for you to get across.
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,613.645,617.08,"--Well, Your Honor, I am sorry to hear that."
1989.89-65,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,640.528,650.717,How... how much weight would we ordinarily give to the action of Congress in 1935 says wages are to be bargained about under the NLRA?
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,672.999,675.701,It would be a better case for us were that the case.
1989.89-65,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,748.297,759.038,Is any part of your case that bargaining would be inconsistent with the statute that controls or organizes these dependent schools?
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,759.038,759.555,--Yes.
1989.89-65,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,804.383,815.124,"So if the Army has that authority under... to interpret its statute that way, you would say that... that bargaining would be inconsistent with some of the law."
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,815.124,815.441,--Yes.
1989.89-65,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,821.511,822.045,Were the unions--
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,823.913,828.865,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1989.89-65,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,834.769,847.327,"Were the teachers here, the unions, asserting that... that they were entitled to wages that were not comparable?"
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,860.55,865.121,"Well, in fact, the proposals do not purport to be comparable."
1989.89-65,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,867.038,869.44,Are they admitted not to be comparable?
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,869.44,873.81,"--The... I don't know if they would admit that they are not, but--"
1989.89-65,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,873.81,874.494,All right.
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,874.494,879.629,--The salary schedules at these schools are actually set quite specifically.
1989.89-65,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,900.309,914.533,"Still in all, comparable isn't identical and you might say a couple of hundred dollars more in light of greater distance to travel to get to this school as opposed to those schools or some other things, wouldn't that be considered--"
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,914.533,914.883,--Yes.
1989.89-65,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,914.883,915.519,--still comparable?
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,915.519,916.219,"Yes, and... and--"
1989.89-65,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,916.219,918.021,So why can't you bargain over it under this statute?
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,918.021,922.223,"--Well, it seems to us that that sort of throws Congress' commands out the window."
1989.89-65,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,933.28,938.85,"Well, Congress should have said precisely then, you know, shall not comparable to... shall be... shall be those prescribed by."
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,943.552,944.852,--And they need to be comparable.
1989.89-65,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,962.697,965.132,"Well, you are talking about regulations not the statute now, aren't you?"
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,968.017,973.255,--The statute says that the education has to be comparable and that the per-public costs have to be comparable.
1989.89-65,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1036.744,1040.446,How is the Federal Services Impasses Panel appointed?
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1043.518,1062.829,"It's an agency within the FLRA, and it is my understanding that the FLRA has a semi-permanent panel of members of the Impasses Panel, but that they also... that the Impasses Panel itself relies very heavily on the Federal Mediation Service."
1989.89-65,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1069.566,1076.136,Is there any review authorized of a decision of the Impasse Panel?
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1076.136,1077.32,Not that I know of.
1989.89-65,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1089.628,1092.729,"Those decisions can be arbitrary and capricious, as far as we--"
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1092.729,1102.703,They certainly can.
1989.89-65,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1169.813,1174.448,"--But, Mr. Wright, it is... it is not your position, is it, that all proposals must be cost-free?"
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1174.448,1176.466,"--No, it is not our position."
1989.89-65,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1176.466,1176.749,Okay.
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1176.749,1184.905,We... we would certainly allow that something that had a relatively de minimis impact on the budget would... would not be negotiable.
1989.89-65,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1187.941,1188.507,Excuse me.
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1198.047,1198.297,Yes.
1989.89-65,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1205.367,1207.653,More than de minimis in other words?
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1207.653,1212.807,"Well, it would be for the FLRA to determine ultimately what that standard might be."
1989.89-65,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1221.06,1223.845,And who has the burden on the issue on the budget?
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1223.845,1225.864,"Well, the FLRA has--"
1989.89-65,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1225.864,1226.347,Says you do.
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1226.347,1229.332,--placed the burden on... on management--
1989.89-65,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1229.332,1230.016,Right.
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1230.016,1237.672,--not only to show the costs of the proposal... and here it seems to us a cost of a 13.5 percent pay increase seeks... speaks for itself.
1989.89-65,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1237.672,1243.992,"Well, it doesn't really because what's really at issue is the difference between 13.5 and what you were prepared to give anyway."
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1243.992,1247.878,"Which, of course, we're not prepared... we're not about to announce before a negotiations--"
1989.89-65,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1247.878,1253.782,"Well, there is something in the papers that suggests you... you did indicate a willingness to give something like 10 or 11 percent, didn't you?"
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1253.782,1265.941,--The... the... in this particular school year the agency gave the teachers a 6 percent pay raise and then in the middle of the year gave them... I think it was a 6.8 percent pay raise... and then in the middle of the year gave them another 4 percent.
1989.89-65,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1265.941,1275.13,"So the difference between 13.5 and 10.8 or whatever it is, is really what is the impact on the budget that would otherwise have been--"
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1275.13,1276.747,In this particular year.
1989.89-65,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1294.092,1301.53,"--Well, but as I understood the FLRA, they took the position that you had the burden of explaining just to what extent it impacted on the budget."
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1304.482,1311.836,"Well, they also wanted us to prove that the benefits that flowed from the union proposal wouldn't outweigh the costs."
1989.89-65,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1320.408,1321.108,"Well, sometimes you might."
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1332.483,1333.0,No.
1989.89-65,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1341.571,1351.713,"Is it your understanding that when they asked you to... to show that no benefits would come from it, they were talking about non-economic benefits?"
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1351.713,1367.806,"Yes, I believe so because what they... near as we can tell, they seemed to think that an across the board pay increase would improve employee morale and that would be the compensating benefit here that would outweigh the costs of the 13.5 percent proposal."
1989.89-65,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1375.06,1377.662,You are in control of your budget so long as you have high employee morale?
1989.89-65,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1379.447,1390.053,"Well, I think that's the other side's position."
1989.89-65,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1441.937,1443.287,"Thank you, Mr. Wright."
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1445.989,1448.757,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-65,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1514.617,1529.995,"Is it... would that showing have to discount not only the economic benefit of... but the tangible economic benefit for the agency but also the kind of intangible, such as employee morale factor?"
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1529.995,1536.482,"Well, as Mr. Wright indicated, some of the intangibles will very frequently be able to be converted into tangibles."
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1544.921,1548.123,"Now, cost/benefit analysis takes account of intangibles."
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1548.123,1548.74,"Yes, it does."
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1548.74,1550.659,"The word ""budget"" does not."
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1550.659,1556.896,"Well, but the point here is whether or not the cost impact of the proposals will be sufficient to offset."
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1564.316,1567.166,You need fewer teachers and therefore wouldn't have to spend as much.
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1567.166,1568.084,"--Well, that's a possibility."
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1568.084,1568.634,It's conceivable.
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1568.634,1570.903,There would be... there would be reduced turnover.
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1570.903,1578.224,Is it... is it only the intangibles that have that economic effect that the Authority is... is willing to take into account?
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1578.224,1585.829,"Well, I think it would be a mix of intangibles and... and best estimates as to how those intangibles would convert into monetary figures."
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1586.445,1589.597,"But, if an intangible has no economic effect, then it's irrelevant."
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1590.883,1590.933,--No.
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1595.418,1595.868,How so?
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1595.868,1596.535,I don't think it has to--
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1596.535,1605.041,How... how can an intangible that has no economic effect have any impact on whether the agency's budget is going to be affected or not?
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1605.041,1609.659,"--Well, I think is an intangible that may not be reducible to a specific dollar and cent term."
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1619.031,1620.217,You didn't answer my question.
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1631.072,1635.309,"--Well, again, I think that it would be largely a question of how those intangibles--"
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1635.309,1636.126,Let me... let me ask it as a question.
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1642.98,1645.248,--If the proposal does or the benefit does?
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1645.248,1646.232,The benefit.
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1652.336,1655.39,I think that would be an aspect of the employer's compensating benefits analysis--
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1655.39,1657.423,I think you can answer the question yes or no.
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1659.342,1664.877,"--I think it is possible that taking the collection of tangibles and intangibles together, it can be assessed whether this proposal--"
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1664.877,1667.579,I'm just... just talking about the intangibles.
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1673.565,1675.767,--That would be very difficult to say that it did.
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1675.767,1676.617,I think so.
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1676.617,1677.219,But I think that there--
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1677.219,1689.694,"But the Authority is saying, nonetheless, as I understand your argument, that you somehow must weight those non-economic intangibles and offset them against this budget provision here."
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1689.694,1704.787,"--Well, I think it would probably be very much like the cost/benefit analysis that's called for in Executive Order 12221 which places on regulatory agencies of the government the requirement to engage in cost/benefit analysis when they regulate an industry, and that specifically identifies--"
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1704.787,1710.422,But that... but that executive order is not dealing with a statute that uses the word budget.
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1719.712,1725.7,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that it really is more of a question to be worked out as agencies make the showing that is required here."
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1731.437,1741.626,It's a case for another day if... if the way the Authority is defending its... its position on this budget point is by saying the agency has to take into account non-economic factors.
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1747.03,1752.683,"--Well, Your Honor, we think that the test is reasonable as an implementation of the competing interests of the statute."
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1788.557,1793.76,"But I don't understand what you just said, that cost alone cannot require it to go to the budget process and ask for more money."
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1793.76,1795.227,"--Well, for instance, let's take the proposals in this case--"
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1795.227,1799.581,"I mean, cost alone, it has to... it has to spend another million dollars for teachers' salaries--"
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1799.581,1799.864,--But--
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1799.864,1805.235,--and you're telling me that alone will not require it go to the budget process unless there is an offsetting economic benefit.
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1805.235,1805.768,"--Well, no."
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1823.328,1824.111,They are all economic benefits.
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1824.563,1825.346,"--Well, Your Honor, I would think--"
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1825.346,1825.98,--economic benefits.
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1825.98,1834.551,"--I would think... well, all I'm trying to get across here, I think, is that I think primarily the economic issues are going to be the primary issues in compensating benefits analysis."
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1843.157,1845.026,More than... more than not ruled out.
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1853.197,1868.558,"--Well, I think what... as I remember in the Wright-Patterson test, the types of compensating benefits in Volume 2 of FLRA deal with such things as grievance filing rates, productivity, and I believe morale may be mentioned as one of the compensating benefits factors."
1989.89-65,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1931.382,1948.26,"Mr. Persina, what's your answer to the Solicitor General's contention that in the Postal Service Reorganization Act in '71 the statute dealing with what was bargainable specifically said wages; the NLRA specifically said wages."
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1951.395,1960.568,"Well, Your Honor, I think in those laws, the Postal Reorganization Act and the NLRA, Congress manifestly wanted to make pay negotiable for all employees who were covered under that law."
1989.89-65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1991.588,1993.338,Maybe they left wages out deliberately?
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,1994.121,2012.667,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that a Congress that was looking to make wages non-negotiable for 97 percent of the Federal work force would not normally include wages as something that could be bargained and then take it out through 7103(a)(14)(C) by saying that matters specifically established in statute are nonnegotiable."
1989.89-65,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2029.261,2033.665,You mean the conditions of employment just doesn't include wages for 97 percent of the people?
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,2033.665,2041.651,"--Well, it does not include wages because of the operation of the statutory exclusion from the substantive definition."
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2387.657,2393.727,"Mr. Persina, could you satisfy my curiosity as to who the Impasse Panel is."
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,2394.944,2396.429,The President of the United States.
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2396.429,2397.563,The President does.
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,2397.563,2399.215,They are appointed by the President.
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2410.654,2411.272,Is it a full-time job?
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,2411.922,2412.939,"--No, it is not."
1989.89-65,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2412.939,2414.057,--It is not.
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,2414.057,2423.996,"Panel members, as I understand it, meet approximately once a month to resolve impasses, but they are part-time Federal employees and officials."
1989.89-65,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2423.996,2426.865,Is it... is it correct that their decisions are nonreviewable?
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,2426.865,2428.298,"That is not correct, Your Honor."
1989.89-65,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2515.656,2531.366,"Are those decisions... is it like baseball free agency where the panel has to pick either one proposal or the other, or can it come up with a... can it say... can it say either your proposal is... has to be accepted or your proposal can be rejected?"
1989.89-65,1,45816,william_e_persina,,2534.068,2547.894,"--Well, Your Honor, under the plain language of Section 7119 it can take any action it deems necessary to resolve an impasse and that could include... and the panel has frequently not adopted either the employer or the union, but has developed some third course."
1989.89-65,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3181.112,3183.179,I'd like to make just a few points.
1989.89-65,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3253.74,3255.358,"May I interrupt there, Mr. Wright?"
1989.89-65,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3272.653,3279.074,"--Well, of course, our primary argument is that weighing costs and benefits is the heart of the budget-making process."
1989.89-65,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3279.074,3279.691,"Well, that may be but--"
1989.89-65,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3279.691,3281.093,That Congress has reserved the budget-making process--
1989.89-65,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3281.093,3286.997,--but don't you have to respond to the argument that at least you've got to show that it has a 50 cent impact on the budget?
1989.89-65,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3298.152,3303.037,--We... we think that any... any proposal that calls into account the salaries of the schools--
1989.89-65,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3303.037,3318.297,"But what if you had previously determined in your own budget that you'd sent to the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, or whoever it would go to, that you... you think the union is going make an outrageous demand because all the local schools have gone up 20 percent, so we'd better budget for 20 percent, even though we may not have to pay it?"
1989.89-65,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3318.297,3323.183,"--Well, our position is that salaries are just... are just off the negotiating table."
1989.89-65,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3323.55,3329.504,"Well, I understand, but your... and your budget argument... just confining it to the budget argument, how can you could say on that hypothetical there would be any impact on the budget?"
1989.89-65,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3329.504,3335.908,"--Well, in your example, Justice Stevens, we've already... the Army has already lost control of the budget process."
1989.89-65,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3339.645,3341.295,"But what if... no, say that it's not negotiable."
1989.89-65,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3350.185,3352.037,--It's not impossible.
1989.89-65,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3362.725,3365.227,Even if they ask for less than you had budgeted?
1989.89-65,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3365.227,3373.2,"Even in that unlikely event, which is not presented here."
1989.89-65,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3375.5,3376.25,"Thank you, Mr. Wright."
