1990.89-1332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.456,"We'll hear argument in No. 89-1332, Gene McNary, Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization v. the Haitian Refugee Center, Inc.--"
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,12.641,16.526,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1332,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,192.125,202.981,"Mr. Dreeben, I thought one of the problems was that there was no record made of some of these proceedings, so there was no way ultimately to review it?"
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,202.981,205.199,"Well, Justice O'Connor, I think that--"
1990.89-1332,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,205.199,206.016,Is that correct?
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,208.818,212.353,--I don't think the district court addressed that concern at all.
1990.89-1332,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,221.126,221.895,Right.
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,221.895,223.178,We disagree with that completely.
1990.89-1332,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,245.343,255.549,"Well, it is also suggested that perhaps there is no review possible unless there is a deportation order entered."
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,255.549,257.483,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1990.89-1332,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,258.418,268.958,"Do we face potentially a situation where in fact there is no deportation order, and so an individual claimant wouldn't be able to raise it?"
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,268.958,277.295,"--Well, in theory the INS has prosecutorial discretion not to institute deportation proceedings."
1990.89-1332,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,308.048,326.044,"Well, but the scheme also envisions, as I understand it, that information produced at these hearings should not be used by the INS to thereafter oust them, simply because the alien has come in and has requested this status."
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,326.778,327.428,That is correct.
1990.89-1332,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,354.129,370.323,"Well, if we were faced with the situation in one of these cases where no review could as a practical matter be obtained without giving up the confidentiality or something of that sort, do we have a Webster v. Doe problem here?"
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,370.323,372.307,"--No, I don't think so, Justice O'Connor."
1990.89-1332,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,476.241,489.067,"I take it, Mr. Dreeben, your entire case rests upon the prohibitory language in the statute that there shall be no administrative or judicial review except as provided in the subsection."
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,498.423,506.946,I think our case would not be as strong if Congress had not introduced this framework for judicial review with the preclusion provision.
1990.89-1332,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,541.017,544.987,Is there a case that stands for that proposition that I could look at?
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,544.987,550.308,"Well, I think the Heckler v. Ringer case presents a very analogous situation."
1990.89-1332,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,588.683,593.302,"Well, Mr. Dreeben, what about Bowen v. the Michigan Academy case?"
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,596.087,607.478,"I think Michigan Academy represents a distinctive situation, precisely because it did raise the question you alluded to about the possible preclusion of all judicial review of a constitutional claim."
1990.89-1332,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,754.871,758.823,"Mr. Dreeben, what is the status of the 17 plaintiffs in this case?"
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,768.631,773.417,"--I am not sure of the exact status of the 17 plaintiffs, Justice Scalia."
1990.89-1332,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,789.01,791.379,With the procedures that they are demanding in this suit?
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,791.379,793.195,--Those procedures will be applied.
1990.89-1332,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,797.112,798.881,You don't think that they have occurred?
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,798.881,799.648,--I do not think--
1990.89-1332,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,799.648,802.083,So they have not gotten what they are asking for in this suit yet.
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,802.083,802.35,--No.
1990.89-1332,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,818.842,825.281,Will the INS not give them their rehearing with the new procedures if this case comes out against the plaintiffs?
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,825.281,826.231,"Well,--"
1990.89-1332,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,826.231,834.804,"I'm trying to think if we're arguing about anything real here as far as these particular plaintiffs are concerned, if they in effect have been given what they want."
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,834.804,842.743,--I am just not sure of whether all of the 17 plaintiffs have been through the process and completed it at this stage.
1990.89-1332,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,923.879,926.081,May I ask another kind of a practical aspect.
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,947.144,949.512,"--Well, I don't think--"
1990.89-1332,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,949.512,953.731,"How would the 20,000 people be taken care of under the procedure that you think was proper?"
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,953.731,956.433,--I think that it would depend.
1990.89-1332,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,992.755,1005.313,"But are you saying that if they agreed, they decided as a matter of litigating strategy or whatever it might be, that the court of appeals making the same decision was right on the merits, then they would have gone ahead and had the 20,000 cases reopened, wouldn't they?"
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1005.313,1005.83,"--Well, they might--"
1990.89-1332,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1005.83,1010.05,It would be only to the extent they wanted to continue their challenge to the merits of the determination.
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1010.05,1016.62,--They may have conducted a more abbreviated review to determine precisely on what grounds the aliens had been denied.
1990.89-1332,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1063.351,1065.535,It didn't order the granting of the benefit across the board.
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1065.535,1066.053,--That's true.
1990.89-1332,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1066.053,1070.672,Just required the hearing with these minimum procedures to be met.
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1070.672,1071.639,"That is true, Justice."
1990.89-1332,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1071.639,1077.343,And you are suggesting that in a lot of the cases it might be harmless error because there were other grounds for denying the application.
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1077.343,1077.695,Exactly.
1990.89-1332,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1182.862,1190.634,Why would an individual want to assume the burden of proving a pattern in practice if he could win his individual case by just showing it wasn't applied properly to him?
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1190.634,1191.301,"Well, the--"
1990.89-1332,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1191.301,1195.57,I don't understand the motivation for doing that if it were not a widespread problem.
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1195.57,1210.096,"--Well, the motivation would be that the individual alien would like to have his denial reversed or his application readjudicated without having to go through the system that Congress intended, which does impose some more time elapsing before the alien can get it."
1990.89-1332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1238.682,1248.907,"Mr. Dreeben, what was the reasoning of the court of appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in saying that a pattern or practice suit could be entertained but apparently individual suits could not?"
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1248.907,1269.57,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, I think that the reasoning is the somewhat arbitrary sense that if a problem is affecting a large category of people the district court ought to hear about it, and if it is only a procedural error affecting one individual then we ought to leave it for the statutory review process."
1990.89-1332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1385.695,1387.98,How did the court of appeals rule on that point?
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1387.98,1392.348,The court of appeals upheld standing for the organizational plaintiffs.
1990.89-1332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1471.567,1481.823,"Mr. Dreeben, do you... I take it from what you say that all of the claims that these plaintiffs have could have been presented at the administrative level?"
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1481.823,1484.958,They could have been preserved at the administrative level.
1990.89-1332,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1484.958,1488.679,They couldn't... they could not then have been dealt with at the administrative level?
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1488.679,1493.397,I think on a... the constitutional claims would have been difficult for the INS to resolve.
1990.89-1332,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1520.615,1530.839,"Mr. Dreeben, do you acknowledge that the deprivation of SAW status is a deprivation of life, liberty, or property?"
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1530.839,1535.307,We haven't challenged that issue in the court of appeals or here.
1990.89-1332,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1535.307,1539.444,"Well, not challenging it... because, you see, they are claiming that they are being deprived of two things."
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1554.871,1558.24,"No, it... well, I think for purposes--"
1990.89-1332,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1558.24,1558.49,"Well, it can."
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1561.208,1565.41,"--That is right, but it's not a case where Congress had precluded review."
1990.89-1332,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1567.978,1568.212,I understand.
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1580.42,1582.871,--It appears to give them something of an entitlement interest.
1990.89-1332,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1593.762,1596.714,May I ask you one question before you sit down?
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1610.022,1612.891,"Well, Justice Souter, it could happen in two ways."
1990.89-1332,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1639.374,1645.362,"Well, what if he takes sort of a third ground, and that is he doesn't really want to precipitate review."
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1660.622,1660.872,That's right.
1990.89-1332,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1661.105,1672.061,"As a practical matter, if that is the case, he will never have any actual review of what he may now claim to be a pattern or practice violation."
1990.89-1332,0,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1672.061,1686.337,"--Well, the injury... the only injury that he can really complain of is the actual denial of his application, and Congress determined, not just for pattern or practice plaintiffs but for all participants in this legalization program, to limit the opportunity for judicial review."
1990.89-1332,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1702.282,1704.432,"Very well, Mr. Dreeben."
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,1706.501,1708.769,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1332,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1736.67,1741.657,Some of the named plaintiffs have not yet gotten SAW status?
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,1741.657,1742.04,"No, all of them--"
1990.89-1332,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1742.04,1742.74,They all have?
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,1742.74,1743.526,--That is correct.
1990.89-1332,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1743.526,1751.263,Will they be deprived of that status if the Government prevails here?
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,1751.263,1768.224,"I don't believe they would, Justice O'Connor, but the other class members, and remember this was brought as a class action... there are at least 8,000 or more applications that are still pending, in effect, resolution of this case, and they would be denied, we believe, the benefits if we did not prevail in this case."
1990.89-1332,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1813.186,1829.798,"Well, Mr. Kurzban, doesn't your statement that the INS deprived them of due process rights, isn't it predicated in part on the assumption that Justice Scalia quizzed Mr. Dreeben about, that the statute confers some sort of a life or... life or property interest in these people?"
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,1829.798,1832.084,"That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1332,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1853.545,1864.603,Would that apply to an immigration bill that permits immigration from foreign countries and says that a certain number of people shall be admitted?
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,1878.593,1879.695,"--Well, I think that is a different issue."
1990.89-1332,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1880.228,1884.164,"I know it is, but how would it come out?"
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,1884.164,1892.336,"--I think one might invoke other doctrines concerning the exclusion of aliens, particularly where if Congress passed a law--"
1990.89-1332,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1892.336,1895.138,"But these people were aliens in this case, weren't they?"
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,1895.138,1899.34,"--But they are not excludable aliens, and I think the Court's hypothetical really goes to--"
1990.89-1332,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1899.34,1904.661,"Why are they not excludable aliens, if the assumption that they had no right to be here is entertained?"
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,1904.661,1911.048,"--But once Congress granted that right, as they did here, they said if you qualify you are eligible for that right--"
1990.89-1332,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1911.048,1912.917,It's the same thing with someone who's in Poland.
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,1925.024,1930.795,"--Well, I would say if you were denied admission because the Government has exercised inappropriate due process procedures--"
1990.89-1332,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1930.795,1940.853,"--That's his claim, that the embassy in Warsaw wrongfully didn't use the proper procedures to get him to qualify."
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,1941.469,1950.959,"--Well, the only thing I would say about that hypothetical is that this Court has traditionally made a distinction between excludable aliens, that is people who are at the border seeking admission into the United States, and deportable aliens."
1990.89-1332,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1969.336,1976.257,--Indeed are there any of these SAW applicants who are not already in the country and applying?
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,1976.257,1976.557,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1332,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1976.557,1977.025,There are.
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,1977.025,1985.179,"There were applicants, and there was a procedure set forth, a specific procedure in this case, set forth for aliens who were outside of the United States."
1990.89-1332,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1992.118,2000.188,So the class of respondents before us today consists entirely of people who were in fact in this country?
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2000.188,2000.973,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1332,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2000.973,2005.008,"And were deportable, absent being given the SAW status."
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2005.008,2005.242,That is correct.
1990.89-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2025.422,2029.974,Unless they could have been remedied as a matter of statutory construction.
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2029.974,2034.676,"--Well, I don't think so, Your Honor, in this case, and I would like to give an example."
1990.89-1332,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2034.676,2036.128,"Well, suppose they could have been."
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2036.128,2052.053,"Well, in a hypothetical situation if they could have been, not on the facts of this case, we would say still that the procedure that was set out in this statute was designed to look at the merits determinations."
1990.89-1332,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2172.247,2180.252,"Mr. Kurzban, that could all have been reviewed before the deportation would occur."
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2191.644,2207.32,"--I respectfully disagree, Justice Scalia, and the reason is that if we went to the circuit court of appeals under 1160(e)(B)(3), which is the section defining the scope of review, the court of appeals is limited solely to the administrative record as it existed at the time."
1990.89-1332,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2207.737,2211.706,"It cannot remand to have a new, additional administrative record made?"
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2211.706,2215.592,The Government's claim here is that it could be remanded under the Hobbs Act.
1990.89-1332,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2247.362,2250.933,"They would remand it to the administrator of the INS, let him figure out how to get it taken."
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2256.101,2258.669,--Because then I think we're thwarting what Congress intended here.
1990.89-1332,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2267.358,2268.31,Can I come back?
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2298.996,2308.869,"But I think Congress... I am sorry, this Court has always recognized, since the 19th century, that with respect to deportable aliens, that those deportable aliens have constitutional rights under the Fifth Amendment."
1990.89-1332,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2308.869,2314.006,Of due process with respect to the liberty and property interests that they have... that have been conferred upon them.
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2320.577,2329.616,"But here the Congress has said if you work 90 days, if you maintained... if you were otherwise admissible, you are entitled to this."
1990.89-1332,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2336.039,2346.16,"But it may say that with respect to people abroad, and we would not hold, I am confident, that those people abroad had been given any right to enter the United States which requires due process protections."
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2346.16,2353.648,"--And that is an issue, Justice Scalia, respectfully, that is left for another day, because that is not an issue that is on the facts of this case."
1990.89-1332,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2356.35,2367.658,"What if Congress, Mr. Kurzban, after a period of months had repealed this statute so that there was no longer an authorization for the things that it provided for."
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2377.365,2380.4,"I think that would be a different question, Your Honor."
1990.89-1332,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2380.4,2380.6,Why?
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2380.6,2387.221,"Because the statute being repealed, I think the entitlement is created by virtue of the fact that Congress has given them that entitlement."
1990.89-1332,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2387.221,2389.071,And Congress can repeal it when it wants to?
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2389.071,2389.356,That is right.
1990.89-1332,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2390.773,2392.708,And can it condition it as it wants to?
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2392.708,2395.577,"It can condition it, I believe, as well."
1990.89-1332,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2586.297,2589.784,"That's standard administrative law, Mr. Kurzban, isn't it?"
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2625.957,2629.176,"That is right, Your Honor, and I think you're right in certain respects."
1990.89-1332,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2637.348,2640.9,"Well, one would assume that they intend the normal application of administrative law, unless they say something to the contrary."
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2640.9,2652.358,"--But the plaintiffs, particularly when it involves a due process claim, have a presumption in favor of judicial review unless the Government can show by clear and convincing evidence that Congress intended otherwise."
1990.89-1332,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2749.152,2763.929,"Well, Mr. Kurzban, the language of section 1160 says there shall be no judicial review of a determination respecting an application for SAW status, except in accord with the subsection."
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2768.333,2781.224,"Well, I think what it means, Justice O'Connor, is within this context when you look at 1160(e)(2)(A), (e)(2)(B), and (e)(3), when they are talking about a determination, a determination is on the merits of the case."
1990.89-1332,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2810.893,2814.012,"That brings you back to Abbott Labs again, Mr. Kurzban."
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2827.938,2828.554,"--That is correct, and--"
1990.89-1332,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2828.554,2838.043,"But you're saying you are being hurt not because of the mere existence of the practice or the rule, but because of the harm that that practice or rule produces in the adjudications."
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2866.23,2869.948,--But that's where on the record you could get a review.
1990.89-1332,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2891.864,2898.301,"Before you do that, I don't know if this is necessary to your case, but is this final agency action?"
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2898.301,2900.484,"--Yes, I think it is final agency action."
1990.89-1332,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2900.484,2901.669,Is that necessary to your case?
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2901.669,2913.561,"I think this is a case involving subject matter jurisdiction, so that whether or not ultimately there was a final agency action in any individual case is not necessary."
1990.89-1332,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2983.971,2992.326,"May I ask on that point, are you saying that the word denial in subparagraph 3 of (e) is the equivalent of the word determination in the earlier parts?"
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2992.326,2994.043,"--Yes, I think it is."
1990.89-1332,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2994.66,2997.878,"It says such a denial, and it doesn't use the word denial earlier in the section."
1990.89-1332,1,28600,ira_jay_kurzban,,2997.878,2998.147,--That's correct.
1990.89-1332,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3058.269,3060.971,"Thank you, Mr. Kurzban."
1990.89-1332,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3062.105,3062.805,Yes.
1990.89-1332,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3115.939,3119.593,"Well, Mr. Dreeben, isn't more at stake than just deportation?"
1990.89-1332,2,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3132.917,3154.065,"--Yes, those benefits do come with being granted SAW status, but an alien who wishes to challenge the denial of SAW status, which Congress was intend... could presume was an administratively correct denial, could seek work authorization as a matter of discretion from the INS and could get judicial review if INS abused its discretion in denying that work authorization to the alien."
1990.89-1332,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3155.915,3156.915,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
