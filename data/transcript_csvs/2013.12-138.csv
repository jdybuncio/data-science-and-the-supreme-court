2013.12-138,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.587,"We will hear argument next in Case 12-138, BG Group v. The Republic of Argentina."
2013.12-138,0,42726,thomas_goldstein,,7.454,10.122,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-138,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,41.493,55.168,"Mr. Goldstein, do you take the position that parties can't, by contract say, this particular precondition is -- goes to my -- to the parties' consent to arbitrate?"
2013.12-138,0,42726,thomas_goldstein,,55.168,57.02,--We do not take that position.
2013.12-138,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,72.212,72.646,All right.
2013.12-138,0,42726,thomas_goldstein,,126.164,126.764,Yes.
2013.12-138,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,128.033,128.433,All right.
2013.12-138,0,42726,thomas_goldstein,,142.042,143.642,"--Well, a couple of things about that."
2013.12-138,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,152.314,155.783,Maybe that's why the government is saying we shouldn't treat it as a presumption.
2013.12-138,0,42726,thomas_goldstein,,157.052,158.202,--All right.
2013.12-138,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,338.902,345.206,"I'm not sure that this argument helps you, but it's your argument."
2013.12-138,0,42726,thomas_goldstein,,350.208,350.61,--Correct.
2013.12-138,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,350.61,360.981,"So your -- your argument is that by agreeing that the arbitration would take place in the United States, they bought into U.S. arbitration law, no international modification?"
2013.12-138,0,42726,thomas_goldstein,,360.981,361.765,That's correct.
2013.12-138,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,377.11,387.216,"See, I would have thought that there would -- there'd be an argument for saying that the first options principle shouldn't apply to international -- or to a bilateral investment treaty."
2013.12-138,0,42726,thomas_goldstein,,406.612,407.646,"--No, that's part 3 of the opinion."
2013.12-138,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,485.146,489.183,Could I ask you just a -- a practical question and maybe the answer to this is obvious.
2013.12-138,0,42726,thomas_goldstein,,497.804,498.72,It is not.
2013.12-138,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,543.499,544.499,"Well, that's not true."
2013.12-138,0,42726,thomas_goldstein,,574.402,575.418,--We would be.
2013.12-138,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,590.61,592.462,"Well, then, let me just make clear where we are."
2013.12-138,0,42726,thomas_goldstein,,622.231,639.259,"Justice Kennedy, the way you would resolve that issue I believe is to get to Argentina's argument that it did not consent to arbitration, that there is no arbitration agreement in the first place, you would have to go outside the question presented to begin with."
2013.12-138,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,663.124,663.807,"Well, let me just put it."
2013.12-138,0,42726,thomas_goldstein,,681.986,692.726,"I agree with you, Justice Kennedy, that if you were asking me did the D.C. Circuit correctly interpret the treaty and decide, I misunderstood you."
2013.12-138,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,764.735,768.189,"Mr. Goldstein, you have given us three parts for an opinion."
2013.12-138,0,42726,thomas_goldstein,,768.189,768.506,--Yes.
2013.12-138,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,768.506,787.084,"Is it your position essentially that under this bilateral agreement, the case is to be decided by an arbitrator, not by a court in Argentina or the United States?"
2013.12-138,0,42726,thomas_goldstein,,830.946,831.646,Yes.
2013.12-138,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,918.919,924.556,"That's -- it seems to me that this is a difficulty for you, the structure of the treaty."
2013.12-138,0,42726,thomas_goldstein,,936.113,936.529,Right.
2013.12-138,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,936.529,938.895,Nothing about arbitration even in the background.
2013.12-138,0,42726,thomas_goldstein,,954.324,957.275,"I'll agree with that, but I just don't think you can ignore the rest of it."
2013.12-138,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1012.277,1020.783,"Your argument would be better there if this was Article VIII, you know, arbitration of disputes or, you know, parties can arbitrate but first they must do this."
2013.12-138,0,42726,thomas_goldstein,,1027.953,1028.119,--Okay.
2013.12-138,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1049.049,1053.084,If you want to accept the invitation to arbitrate that is in 8(2).
2013.12-138,0,42726,thomas_goldstein,,1059.338,1069.28,"--Fair enough -- no, that's not quite right, Mr. Chief Justice, because remember, imagine that we went to the Argentine courts and for the first time ever we won."
2013.12-138,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1371.974,1374.592,"--Counsel, what do you do with Wintershall?"
2013.12-138,0,42726,thomas_goldstein,,1374.592,1387.585,"So, Your Honor, I think that there are a variety of cases out there that deal with the question in other jurisdictions of different ways of reviewing arbitration awards."
2013.12-138,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1436.765,1449.909,"Isn't that the same thing in France, which is supposed to be a popular place for international arbitration, that in the first instance the arbitrator decides, but ultimately the court can review everything?"
2013.12-138,0,42726,thomas_goldstein,,1449.909,1452.944,"That is not the most current view, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-138,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1491.486,1506.079,Do I understand your position that in this case you did not have to go to the Federal -- to the Argentine court by reason of the language in this agreement and not by reason of anything that Argentina did?
2013.12-138,0,42726,thomas_goldstein,,1506.079,1514.332,--The language in the agreement meant that what Argentina did disentitled it from being able to rely on this provision.
2013.12-138,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1559.744,1561.513,Say that again.
2013.12-138,0,42726,thomas_goldstein,,1561.513,1561.996,--Sorry.
2013.12-138,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1561.996,1563.113,By reason of--
2013.12-138,0,42726,thomas_goldstein,,1563.113,1564.148,There are three other tribunals--
2013.12-138,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1564.148,1564.665,--Yes.
2013.12-138,0,42726,thomas_goldstein,,1564.665,1566.281,--that have reached the same conclusion as this one.
2013.12-138,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1594.066,1594.766,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-138,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1602.504,1604.872,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-138,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1643.081,1646.966,I must say I don't follow that line of argument.
2013.12-138,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1655.204,1665.762,"Well, there is no agreement unless the investor submits the claim to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the treaty, the conditions on the state's consent."
2013.12-138,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1678.154,1691.227,"I don't -- I can't find -- it seems to me this has sprung, full blown, from someone's brain, but is not well embedded in any law that I could yet find."
2013.12-138,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1754.97,1775.233,"Well, I think the reason that applying Howsam and its presumption that certain procedural-type requirements like notice requirements would be decided by the arbitrator, the reason that would risk subjecting a state to suit without its consent is that in investment treaties, what the states do is they say we will be subject to arbitration under certain circumstances."
2013.12-138,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1781.721,1782.906,Are you suggesting that they--
2013.12-138,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1782.906,1796.081,"So you suggest it was the State that said, Look, they don't say anything in the treaty, but it turns out, for purposes of counting time limits, filing a brief, they count Saturdays, but they don't count Sundays."
2013.12-138,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1823.981,1829.052,"--Well, they decided them because the state sets forth in the treaty itself that these are limitations on their consent."
2013.12-138,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1829.052,1834.689,"By the way, in the treaty itself, you can have dozens of things, as was true of Howsam."
2013.12-138,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1850.282,1862.106,"Because, for instance, what the United States has done in negotiating its treaties and free trade agreements for decades, in every one of these agreements is it has said: We need to limit the circumstances in which we."
2013.12-138,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1862.106,1863.458,"I have only found two, by the way."
2013.12-138,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1866.41,1868.16,"Well, we cited in our brief the Korea and--"
2013.12-138,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1868.16,1868.679,But in any case--
2013.12-138,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1868.679,1869.262,--and NAFTA.
2013.12-138,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1869.262,1876.033,"--you explicitly say, these are our conditions of consent, and you raise the question to me, you don't answer it."
2013.12-138,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1886.557,1904.785,"Well, to give you an example of a condition that we've actually used, NAFTA requires as a condition on the United States' consent to arbitrate that the investors, when they submit the claim to arbitration, they waive their right to pursue other remedies, and that satisfies a very important sovereign interests that we have and not being subject to parallel proceedings--"
2013.12-138,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1904.785,1917.093,"So here you are putting yourselves, I gather, that the U.N. rules, the AAA rules, the scholars who file our briefs, the doctrine of competence-competence, whatever that might be, is in fact far broader than what they want."
2013.12-138,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1925.766,1927.968,"--I don't think that's correct, Justice Breyer."
2013.12-138,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1933.787,1934.754,How do we know that?
2013.12-138,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1955.118,1961.889,"--That's a question of treaty interpretation and this Court has said that you look to first the text, but you also--"
2013.12-138,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1961.889,1963.141,"Well, let's say you've done all that."
2013.12-138,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,1987.339,1996.112,"--Well, the United States doesn't feel that it is appropriate for it to express a definitive view on that question now because the parties have not argued this really as a question--"
2013.12-138,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1996.112,2003.449,"I would be more open about that argument, Ms. Anders, if you had at least suggested how we should go about deciding that question?"
2013.12-138,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,2003.449,2003.816,--Yes.
2013.12-138,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2003.816,2010.372,"Because you read this through your brief, and I don't know what a consent-based objection is."
2013.12-138,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,2029.166,2031.701,I don't think that's right.
2013.12-138,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2044.193,2048.578,"That's no different from the rules we apply when there isn't a treaty, of course."
2013.12-138,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,2064.522,2070.176,"--Well, you would also -- you would also look possibly for mandatory language in the treaty; so, for instance, if the treaty says that--"
2013.12-138,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2070.176,2073.045,We would look to mandatory language in the arbitration agreement.
2013.12-138,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,2073.045,2088.138,"--I think that's right, but the problem with applying Howsam is that it's a presumption that is purely based on the nature of the requirement, so the fact that it is a notice requirement, the fact that it is a time limit, that that means that it's procedural and, therefore, the arbitrators would decide unless it is clearly stated--"
2013.12-138,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2088.138,2088.938,What about this -- what about this principle.
2013.12-138,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,2097.927,2104.833,"--No, I think that is still -- that would be grafting on a default term onto the treaty that may not reflect the treaty parties' intent."
2013.12-138,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2108.718,2122.711,"Well, there is nothing in the treaty that talks about consent at all, so we have to decide whether some requirement is a consent, is on something which consent is conditioned, or it's just a procedural requirement that would be decided by an arbitrator."
2013.12-138,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,2133.617,2145.241,"--I think one of the things the Court could look to is the nature of the requirements, does it serve sovereign functions, but I think in doing that analysis it's important to look to what the state says are the functions that its requirements are serving."
2013.12-138,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2199.376,2205.363,What's wrong with the House -- and I'm being a little defensive here -- but I didn't think there was the presumption you are talking.
2013.12-138,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2229.995,2232.528,Briefly.
2013.12-138,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2232.528,2233.363,Thank you.
2013.12-138,1,24896,ginger_d__anders,,2233.363,2241.134,"--I think in the treaty context, the state's parties are not agreeing, and they don't have expectations with respect to the allocation of authority between the court and the arbitrator."
2013.12-138,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2246.105,2247.89,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,2253.943,2267.268,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court: This is a contract formation case and it's a case that is decided properly by the court below whether you apply first options or whether you apply treaty principles.
2013.12-138,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2267.268,2274.44,"Mr. Blackman, may I ask you preliminarily, on your view, what happens next."
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,2293.418,2294.618,"Absolutely, yes."
2013.12-138,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2297.57,2305.743,"And if it is resolved, but not to BG's liking then, thereto, BG can invoke arbitration."
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,2305.743,2307.328,"That's absolutely correct, Your Honor."
2013.12-138,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2307.328,2315.767,"Well, doesn't that mean that treaty partners agreed that only an arbitration panel can conclusively resolve this dispute?"
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,2315.767,2326.823,"What the treaty partners agreed to here, Justice Ginsburg, was a condition, a precondition on their respectively derogating from their sovereignty."
2013.12-138,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2340.066,2342.934,I don't get your answer to my question.
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,2356.342,2357.611,It depends on the issue.
2013.12-138,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2397.919,2414.78,"Why are you complaining about the other party not initiating proceedings in the Argentine courts when if you really wanted those proceedings to occur, you could have initiated proceedings in the Argentine courts?"
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,2414.78,2418.499,"First of all, as First Option said, we didn't need to do that."
2013.12-138,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2445.652,2447.269,I must say I don't understand that.
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,2460.159,2460.842,No.
2013.12-138,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2548.8,2557.656,That's the D.C. Circuit treated this as there is no agreement until you go to the local court first.
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,2557.656,2558.473,That's correct.
2013.12-138,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2558.473,2562.208,The argument is that there is an agreement to arbitrate.
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,2590.46,2602.018,"I don't -- I don't think that's the correct analysis, Justice Ginsburg, because the dispute resolution mechanism which is, again, is an offer made by two States to each other to--"
2013.12-138,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2602.018,2605.654,"Mr. Blackman, can I just ask you to assume for a second that that's not so."
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,2618.295,2620.246,"--I would actually not, Your Honor."
2013.12-138,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2648.364,2651.449,"So how do you -- how do you distinguish John Wiley, which I think--"
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,2651.449,2652.035,--John Wiley--
2013.12-138,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2652.035,2654.835,--has two components and the second cuts against you.
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,2654.835,2657.37,"--And the first cuts in our favor, Justice Sotomayor."
2013.12-138,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2691.926,2697.08,"Everybody's getting to the same question, I think, but I haven't quite heard the answer."
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,2732.152,2732.752,UNCITRAL.
2013.12-138,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2732.752,2733.268,Yes.
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,2765.82,2766.504,I agree with you.
2013.12-138,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2794.49,2795.64,--So I agree that's not--
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,2795.64,2796.692,--it's not the last word.
2013.12-138,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2796.692,2798.125,--But those are not relevant.
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,2822.923,2829.094,"This is -- and, again, my friend conceded this -- this is an offer to a unilateral contract."
2013.12-138,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2836.0,2836.95,I don't think he conceded it.
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,2838.685,2840.368,I think that I misheard.
2013.12-138,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2840.751,2842.403,There's a subtle difference between the two.
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,2842.669,2843.036,I misheard him.
2013.12-138,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2865.182,2871.753,"Well, you said a few minutes ago you were going to explain why this litigation requirement is important."
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,2900.523,2902.375,It is very important.
2013.12-138,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2950.155,2952.64,Let me just interrupt before -- before the time expires.
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,2976.173,2982.41,"Well, but that's their choice, which they, in fact, made here not to avail themselves of the procedure--"
2013.12-138,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2982.41,2990.665,"Well, let's say they avail themselves of the procedure in only the most perfunctory way so as to satisfy the 18-month requirement."
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,2991.615,2997.853,--Why should my client be punished because they don't diligently pursue a requirement of our offer.
2013.12-138,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3004.423,3004.925,--You're really -- you're not answering--
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,3004.925,3006.559,--they say we elected not to follow--
2013.12-138,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3006.559,3008.159,Could you finish your answer.
2013.12-138,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3008.159,3009.511,--You're not answering my question.
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,3024.437,3027.472,"--Well, they have -- well, they've complied with it."
2013.12-138,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3075.119,3077.821,"Mr. Blackman, could you sort of indulge an assumption for me?"
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,3133.575,3136.777,"I have a number of responses to that, Justice Kagan."
2013.12-138,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3141.679,3141.979,I know.
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,3151.386,3158.123,"--Well, it's kind of assuming the conclusion if this is just John Wiley, that's a hard case for us."
2013.12-138,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3195.146,3195.829,"Well, the problem is--"
2013.12-138,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3195.829,3197.046,Please.
2013.12-138,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3197.046,3201.9,--You're -- it's a point on which I'm regularly confused.
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,3238.506,3241.292,It's -- it's kind of all of the above.
2013.12-138,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3268.042,3274.363,"It all gets down to the question, how do we tell, you know, the contract formation from the blue paper, right?"
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,3289.038,3293.84,I -- I think you have to kind of look at the language.
2013.12-138,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3394.792,3402.229,"Well, what would happen -- what would happen in this case if there was a judge's strike, so none of the courts were operating in Argentina?"
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,3404.763,3408.299,"Well, all you have to do is actually file."
2013.12-138,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3415.721,3417.055,"No, but the clerk's office is closed."
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,3417.055,3418.757,"The clerk's office is closed, too?"
2013.12-138,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3439.504,3441.321,"No, you can't -- no, you can't say that."
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,3446.507,3447.84,"--Well, there could be an arbitration in the first instance."
2013.12-138,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3447.84,3450.126,Your -- your whole argument gives me intellectual whiplash.
2013.12-138,2,28936,jonathan_i_blackman,,3459.332,3460.167,No.
2013.12-138,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3504.863,3505.646,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-138,3,42726,thomas_goldstein,,3507.096,3530.778,"Mr. Chief Justice, I do have a rule that distinguishes the A4 paper and that rule should be, and we think it does follow from the analysis of Howsam, which is just a thinking about when people make agreements and what they expect is that an arbitration agreement is formed and a party consents to arbitration when they guarantee that the ultimate decision can be made by an arbitrator and not a court."
2013.12-138,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3640.562,3645.466,They say that only the complaining party can bring a lawsuit.
2013.12-138,3,42726,thomas_goldstein,,3649.937,3652.403,"That, I don't believe that is correct, Justice Scalia."
2013.12-138,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3652.403,3654.072,I was going to ask them that.
2013.12-138,3,42726,thomas_goldstein,,3654.072,3654.522,I see.
2013.12-138,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3719.277,3723.262,"I'm not so sure you don't have to do anything, you can just submit the paper."
2013.12-138,3,42726,thomas_goldstein,,3734.886,3738.506,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I would then say that's a possible argument."
2013.12-138,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3775.463,3778.065,That seems that you're not totally circular in begging the question.
2013.12-138,3,42726,thomas_goldstein,,3785.402,3789.273,"And surely they wouldn't, Mr. Chief Justice, but that's the point of the treaty."
2013.12-138,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3816.09,3817.623,"Thank you, counsel."
