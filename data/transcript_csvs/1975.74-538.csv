1975.74-538,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,37.506,"We will hear arguments next in 74-538, United States against Watson."
1975.74-538,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,38.969,42.175,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-538,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,404.75,419.144,Do you think the Court of Appeals' holding amounted to a statement that a respondent like the one here who had been illegally arrested could not under any conceivable circumstances give a valid consent to a search of his car?
1975.74-538,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,419.144,451.539,"Well, I think the Court of Appeals did not expressly put it in on those words, but every single fact that would bear on the actual voluntariness of respondent’s actions tended to point toward voluntariness and I think it must be viewed in effect upon analysis as a per se rule there would be three factors: (1) custody (2) illegal and (3) the lack of a specific Miranda type warning of a right to withhold consent."
1975.74-538,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,462.472,475.835,"Excuse me Mr. Frey, you mean to say they made the per se rule, do you think they made a per se rule both on the arrest factor and on the consent or just only consent?"
1975.74-538,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,475.835,484.264,"Well, the rule on the arrest issue would turn on certain facts I think."
1975.74-538,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,508.981,516.811,"The only fact of determination left to be made is on the time, is that not so?"
1975.74-538,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,516.811,532.446,"I think it would be equivalent to the emergency doctrine for search warrants of homes, that is the government would be required to show exigent circumstances that justify the failure to get a warrant, otherwise the arrest would be unlawful."
1975.74-538,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,532.446,539.348,"Well, what cases held that a warrant must be obtained simply because there is time to obtain it?"
1975.74-538,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,539.348,540.131,An arrest warrant?
1975.74-538,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,540.131,540.751,Yes.
1975.74-538,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,540.751,542.199,No case.
1975.74-538,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,542.199,551.34,"So that they have established the rule that if there is time to get a warrant, an arrest without a warrant is invalid, is that not the holding here?"
1975.74-538,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,551.34,554.278,That is correct and it is definitely a new rule.
1975.74-538,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,554.278,557.676,"A per se rule, is it not?"
1975.74-538,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,557.676,575.598,"Yes, it is a per se rule, although unlikely rule on -- the rule on the consent issue, you look at three relatively concrete isolated and inflexible kinds of facts and if you find those three facts then there cannot be a valid consent."
1975.74-538,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1095.669,1101.723,Was not the holding in Schneckloth limited to the non-custodial situation?
1975.74-538,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1101.723,1103.559,Absolutely and I am turning to that next.
1975.74-538,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1214.793,1221.723,I assume this is all very short term?
1975.74-538,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1221.723,1225.051,I think that the record indicates about 15 minutes.
1975.74-538,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1235.718,1237.648,Consent was very shortly after?
1975.74-538,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1237.648,1242.065,"Right, it was on the street prompt consent."
1975.74-538,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1569.099,1578.212,Very well Mr. Frey.
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,1579.633,1584.362,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1624.45,1628.207,"Failed to carry its burden where, in the District Court or the Court of Appeals?"
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,1628.207,1630.774,In the District Court and the Court of Appeals.
1975.74-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1630.774,1632.91,Does the District Court order suppression?
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,1632.91,1633.516,"No, excuse me."
1975.74-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1635.736,1638.034,"You mean just in the Court of Appeals, do you not?"
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,1638.034,1658.772,"No, I mean just in the District Court, In the District Court at the hearing, the prosecution had the burden of proving (1) that the arrest was legal and proper and was made with probable cause since they did not have an arrest warrant and (2) that the consent to search was voluntary because the respondent was in custody at the time."
1975.74-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1663.065,1665.503,"Well, did the District Court suppress or not?"
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,1665.503,1667.183,The District Court did not suppress the evidence.
1975.74-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1667.183,1670.259,So the District Court found in favor of the government?
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,1670.259,1671.373,That is correct.
1975.74-538,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1749.083,1755.531,What can you do about the government's position that it was exigent at the time that he was committing the last crime?
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,1755.531,1759.158,It might have been exigent at the time he was committing the last crime --
1975.74-538,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1759.158,1762.51,"As a matter of fact, he was not convicted on the first one at all."
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,1762.51,1763.598,That is correct.
1975.74-538,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1765.647,1767.556,You do not see any significance in that?
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,1767.556,1771.765,I do not see any significance because the officer at the scene did not see any significance in that.
1975.74-538,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1777.784,1782.556,And then when he saw the crime committed in his presence --
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,1782.556,1783.659,He did not see a crime committed in his presence.
1975.74-538,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1783.659,1785.234,"Yes, he did."
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,1785.234,1785.971,All he saw was –-
1975.74-538,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1785.971,1788.416,He saw the possession?
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,1788.416,1791.855,All he saw in his presence was a cigarette being lighted.
1975.74-538,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1793.634,1796.146,What did the cigarette being lit mean?
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,1796.146,1801.78,That the respondent was in possession of stolen credit cards which is a crime.
1975.74-538,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1822.979,1828.25,Were the credit cards in the car in his possession?
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,1828.25,1830.524,The credit cards were in his car.
1975.74-538,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1830.524,1832.585,Was that in his possession?
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,1832.585,1836.184,"The Court found they were in his constructive possession, yes Your Honor."
1975.74-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1909.17,1916.522,"Well, you say that all cases have required warrants in this situation, were you talking about arrest and not a search?"
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,1916.522,1917.997,That is correct Your Honor.
1975.74-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1918.281,1920.77,Is there any case from this Court?
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,1920.77,1922.385,"Well, I can say the Fourth Amendment --"
1975.74-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1922.385,1923.68,"Well, you said cases."
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,1926.009,1933.632,"The cases from this Court are the Rabinowitz case, the Trupiano case, the Brown case, all the cases which --"
1975.74-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1933.632,1934.651,Those are searches?
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,1934.651,1953.092,"Absolutely searches, but are we going to say that a search of items or objects are more of an intrusion on a person’s privacy which I think anyone will admit the Fourth Amendment is designed to protect, are they more of an intrusion on a person’s privacy and a seizure that person himself."
1975.74-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1954.354,1965.11,"Supposing you get back to answering my question, which is about the cases that you said a moment ago held that all that warrant was required for arrest?"
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,1965.11,1966.606,A warrant is required where there are --
1975.74-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1966.606,1968.334,What cases are those?
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,1968.334,1969.897,"Your Honor, there are no cases which --"
1975.74-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1969.897,1973.527,But you said a minute ago that all of the cases held that.
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,1973.527,1976.75,All of the cases hold that in a search and seizure situation --
1975.74-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1976.75,1979.21,"Well, you did not qualify that way when you said it?"
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,1979.21,1982.504,"Well, Your Honor, an arrest is a seizure of a person."
1975.74-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1985.138,1993.012,"But there had been numerous cases from this Court that hold probable causes sufficient for an arrest of a person, have there not?"
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,1993.012,2003.369,"There have been the probable cause where there exigent circumstances, certainly and in every case where they have held that an arrest is proper, there have been exigent circumstances."
1975.74-538,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2004.743,2007.145,What are those cases?
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,2007.145,2010.113,In Trupiano for example.
1975.74-538,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2035.256,2039.578,"There had been many cases in which the validity of the arrest has been assumed, but --"
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,2039.578,2059.667,"Exactly Your Honor and Mr. Justice White, in a dissent and I do not have the case to cite to you at the present time, but in a dissent, he says that really it has been assumed that arrest have been made with exigent circumstances because in actuality this is an unusual case."
1975.74-538,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2091.435,2098.728,How did he know that he was going to be present except to he was invited or an appointment had been made?
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,2098.728,2102.224,"Well, certainly he did not know but obviously when Mr. Watson showed up --"
1975.74-538,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2102.224,2103.716,He did not know about it?
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,2103.716,2107.45,"He had the feeling and when Mr. Watson showed up, his feeling was confirmed."
1975.74-538,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2190.284,2197.757,"Do I understand you that if he said I will arrest you for having a credit card on your possession as of this time, everything would be alright?"
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,2197.757,2207.163,"I would not concede that there would be probable cause under that situation Your Honor, but I would concede that that would be a ground, that would be an exigent circumstance if there was probable cause."
1975.74-538,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2207.163,2209.278,So the only problem is he did not say that?
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,2209.278,2211.62,"No, the only problem is he did not rely on his informant."
1975.74-538,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2233.929,2238.986,"If everything is so obvious, do you really mean that?"
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,2238.986,2252.391,"In the decisions that I have read in this Court, I think Your Honor that every Justice sitting on the Court have said that we want to encourage warrants and we want to encourage involvement of the judiciary in arrest situations."
1975.74-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2352.681,2363.268,"Well, certainly one reason for distinguishing private property is that that is a fact situation which was deemed to important in Coolidge as to the situs of the car?"
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,2363.268,2378.941,Right and the only reason that it was deemed important in Coolidge and the only reason private property is deemed important in any situation as the Katz case makes clear Your Honor is because of the interest that people have in their property and in that privacy.
1975.74-538,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2388.98,2392.546,"What do you mean, if no person were involved?"
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,2396.811,2404.059,"No, if no one owned that car, like an abandoned car, if it was an abandoned car, if no one had an interest in it, if no one owned that home or lived there."
1975.74-538,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2438.323,2442.103,(Inaudible) both statements on what police usually do?
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,2442.103,2443.944,"Well, really the --"
1975.74-538,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2443.944,2445.711,Well that is the (Inaudible)
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,2445.711,2458.142,"No, the only authority that I have is Mr. Chief Justice White’s statement that this has never been litigated because people are not litigated much because people assume that there are exigent circumstances and --"
1975.74-538,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2458.142,2462.298,"Why did you not cite that, instead of bring it out of the air?"
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,2473.505,2476.984,"Certainly that is the usual rule, but there must be exigent circumstances."
1975.74-538,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2477.426,2485.793,"I do not see any exigent circumstance in what I have just quoted to you, and you will find that in Carroll against United States?"
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,2485.793,2486.59,In Carroll versus United States?
1975.74-538,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2486.59,2487.777,Yes.
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,2487.777,2492.421,"Certainly in Carroll versus United States, but you will also find exigent circumstances in Carroll versus United States."
1975.74-538,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2492.421,2493.935,"It is not in that phrase, is it?"
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,2493.935,2497.67,"It is not in that phrase, but that is what Carroll is all about, the moving vehicle."
1975.74-538,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2497.67,2499.021,I see.
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,2499.021,2504.704,"And that is what Carroll has been cited for in many, many years, it is the moving vehicle in exigent circumstances."
1975.74-538,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2504.704,2507.171,But that is the usual rule?
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,2507.171,2507.76,That has been --
1975.74-538,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2507.76,2511.617,The usual rule does not have exigent circumstances in it?
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,2511.617,2514.388,But the case did and the usual case has exigent circumstances.
1975.74-538,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2514.388,2515.581,The usual facts?
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,2515.581,2517.597,The usual facts do.
1975.74-538,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2517.597,2524.99,You want to tell us that where a man is committing a crime that exigent circumstances got to be shown?
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,2524.99,2527.479,Not where a man is committing a crime in the officers presence.
1975.74-538,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2528.673,2533.553,Was he not possessing a credit card illegally in the officer’s presence?
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,2533.553,2534.81,He was.
1975.74-538,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2540.537,2542.371,But the officer (Inaudible)
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,2542.371,2543.577,He did not move on that.
1975.74-538,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2550.573,2552.187,(Inaudible)
1975.74-538,1,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,2552.187,2557.576,"That crime was possession of stolen mail also, but that was a different crime."
1975.74-538,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3391.069,3395.564,One or two brief points Mr. Chief Justice.
1975.74-538,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3419.493,3426.634,"Well you do not test the validity of an arrest, but ultimately it turns out (Voice Overlap) do a search."
1975.74-538,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3426.634,3427.196,I agree if he have not had the --
1975.74-538,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3427.196,3431.607,Whether or not he had any cards had nothing to do with the reason he made it.
1975.74-538,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3431.607,3456.445,"It would not affect whether or not he had probable cause, but the point I want to make is that even if he subjectively believed he was arresting for the old credit card, the existence of probable cause with respect to the additional stolen credit cards would support the arrest and there are several cases that hold that that I would like to call for the Court’s attention in light of the argument that has been made."
