1989.89-542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.654,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 89-542, Rudy Perpich v. Department of Defense."
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,10.772,13.891,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,125.164,137.789,"And it is your position, I suppose, that the part of Section 16 that it violates is that that says it is reserving to the states the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress?"
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,137.789,140.424,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.89-542,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,142.693,143.376,Mr. Tunheim?
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,143.376,144.259,--Yes.
1989.89-542,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,144.259,157.535,"The Montgomery Amendment appears, at least on its face, to apply only to the National Guard of the United States, not the state militia component."
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,157.535,164.956,The National Guard of the United States is essentially the same thing as the National Guard of the states.
1989.89-542,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,167.741,181.568,"Well, of course, that's the question, whether, whether they operate as one and the same or differently somehow, at least on its face the amendment appears to apply to the National Guard of the United States."
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,181.568,185.385,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor, it does apply to the National Guard of the United States, but are--"
1989.89-542,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,185.385,205.699,"Now, would you tell me whether the President, in this case, ordered the guard units to Honduras for training, or did the President order the National Reserve component to Honduras?"
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,214.722,225.012,"--It's part of the two-week training program, but they were federalized, Justice O'Connor, as the National Guard of the United States in the reserve component part of dual enlistment."
1989.89-542,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,241.539,254.966,But at least the President attempted to articulate the position that they were being federalized and sent there in their capacity as the National Guard of the United States?
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,254.966,257.567,"Yes, that's correct."
1989.89-542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,258.684,273.243,"I take it... I take it you're saying that it's unconstitutional for Congress to divide by statute, as it has done, the National Guard segment of the militia and the so-called unorganized militia?"
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,276.695,284.801,"No, it's not unconstitutional to take the militia and organize it, which is what clause 16 gives Congress the power to do."
1989.89-542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,284.801,295.526,"Well, but Section 311 of Title 10 says that the classes of the militia are the organized militia, which consist of the National Guard, and the unorganized militia, which is not the National Guard."
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,302.263,305.381,"Justice Kennedy, I wouldn't agree that we would have to say that."
1989.89-542,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,327.83,330.616,"The unorganized, you do not have in Minnesota?"
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,330.616,338.936,"Well, the unorganized militia by statute exists everywhere, in states and under federal law, but it really is... is nothing."
1989.89-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,350.51,353.695,"There's nothing in the nature of things that requires it to be that way, I suppose."
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,379.18,391.92,"Well, Justice Scalia, currently under federal law there's no authority for a state to keep an organized militia, other than the National Guard, and the National Guard must be federally recognized, so there really is not an alternative for states."
1989.89-542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,399.51,422.376,"Don't you think the... it seems to me a less extreme application of the militia clause of the Constitution to say that it reserves to the states the right to draft able-bodied people and call them the state guard, if you will, than the contention that you're construing... the construction you're contending for it?"
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,422.376,425.078,The National Guard is the organized militia.
1989.89-542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,425.561,436.349,"Well, but I mean supposing the Governor wants to have a militia there in Minnesota to put down disturbances 365 days a year."
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,450.526,457.899,"--Federal law currently does not permit states to maintain an organized militia, other than the federally recognized National Guard."
1989.89-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,460.917,462.284,What do you mean by organized militia?
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,471.439,477.51,"Unorganized... the unorganized militia is defined under federal law, and I think the laws of most states."
1989.89-542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,492.353,498.976,Is there some provision in the law that would prevent the State of Minnesota from setting out to train those people?
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,498.976,505.863,"There's a provision of federal law that says that states may not maintain an organized militia, other than the National Guard."
1989.89-542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,508.148,512.549,But what if the states were to draw on this unorganized militia?
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,514.635,524.907,"I think it would, because that would be organizing the unorganized militia, and federal law says that you cannot keep an organized militia, other than the National Guard."
1989.89-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,524.907,527.209,"Define the term ""organized""."
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,549.224,551.591,There... there is a federal definition in federal law.
1989.89-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,555.545,562.949,"Well, if that's all it means, then you can create one that isn't the National Guard, and that will be the unorganized militia."
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,562.949,582.196,"But there's another provision of federal law that says you cannot keep an organized militia other than the National Guard, Justice Scalia, or something called state defense forces, which are not militia, they're not defined as militia, they can't be called forth into the federal service, they can't be paid, and they simply are not an organized militia under the--"
1989.89-542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,582.196,584.482,But they can't be paid by the federal government?
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,584.482,585.048,--That's correct.
1989.89-542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,585.048,591.301,"Well, but what's wrong with the State of Minnesota paying them if they want to have them serve the purposes of the State of Minnesota?"
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,591.301,595.67,Because the militia under the Constitution can be called forth into the federal service.
1989.89-542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,620.821,627.309,"But... but they don't exist, I... I suggest to you because the states haven't chosen to call them into existence."
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,662.898,673.455,"Well, certainly there exists statutory authority in each of these states for creation of something called a defense force, but it's carefully not described as an organized militia in any sense--"
1989.89-542,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,673.455,679.359,This is what I meant by my part of the question that Minnesota hasn's chosen to... to go along this line yet.
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,679.359,688.298,"--The... the provisions in Minnesota law allow for creation of this home defense force, and it... it was used during World War II."
1989.89-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,711.997,718.817,"Oh, I don't think they are or are not a militia simply because Minnesota chooses to call them or not to call them a militia."
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,727.173,734.01,"Justice Scalia, it is federal law that doesn't define these home defense forces as organized militia."
1989.89-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,737.029,739.648,But they can be militia but not organized militia.
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,753.039,754.674,"It was, but it wasn't militia in the sense--"
1989.89-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,754.674,757.625,So it was organized in some sense.
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,757.625,769.917,"--It... it was organized by the state, but it wasn't militia in the sense given to it by the Constitution which allows the militia of the states to be called into the federal service, and this is where the National Guard has come from."
1989.89-542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,785.043,788.664,Are you questioning the constitutionality of the dual enlistment system?
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,788.664,790.864,"--We are not, Justice Kennedy."
1989.89-542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,806.956,825.918,"Well, it's rather odd to say that Congress has the authority, as you just conceded, to have dual enlistment and then not permit the federal government to make that choice an effective one and to use all of its powers to make sure that the dual enlistment system works."
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,825.918,831.922,"--Well, I think the answer to that lies in the purpose of the dual enlistment system, Justice Kennedy."
1989.89-542,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,893.479,904.203,"Well, Mr. Tunheim, in this particular case were the troops federalized and ordered to Honduras for training?"
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,904.203,906.322,Yes.
1989.89-542,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,915.111,930.437,"Is it possible that the term ""discipline"" in the militia training clause includes the concept of location of the training?"
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,930.437,936.258,"Justice O'Connor, I think the term ""discipline"" clearly means the standards to be applied to training."
1989.89-542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,979.435,985.691,Does the militia clause speak of... of emergency?
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,996.963,1000.616,"Not in clause 16, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.89-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1099.78,1100.114,Excuse me.
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1123.112,1125.962,--The State... unorganized--
1989.89-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1125.962,1127.53,He just gives it a new name.
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1147.727,1156.416,"--Justice Scalia, if the governor wanted to do that he would not be able to maintain under federal law any other organized militia other than these defense forces."
1989.89-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1156.416,1157.199,Fine.
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1172.859,1175.311,They would not participate at all in... in the federal system?
1989.89-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1175.311,1175.928,That's right.
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1175.928,1181.199,"That's true; but, of course, federal law would not allow any organized militia."
1989.89-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1182.817,1184.683,But this is... he's called it an unorganized militia.
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1184.683,1185.185,--Okay.
1989.89-542,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1189.537,1190.87,"Well, he's chosen to do that."
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1199.143,1200.862,"I don't think that's the issue, Justice Scalia."
1989.89-542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1216.705,1219.324,"For... for the organized militia, which is your point?"
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1219.324,1222.859,"--For... for the organized militia, right."
1989.89-542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1222.859,1232.749,But in the Selective Draft Law Cases the court said that the power of Congress to raise armies could narrow the effect of a militia clause.
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1232.749,1234.649,During an emergency or wartime situation.
1989.89-542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1234.649,1237.035,"Well, it did, but the language doesn't say that."
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1237.035,1245.141,"Well, I think... I think, Mr. Chief Justice, in reviewing the Selective Draft Law cases you really can't separate that case from the context in which it was written."
1989.89-542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1421.84,1437.599,Could Congress have had power to call the militia of Minnesota what we call the National Guard to Honduras for a year to execute the laws of the United States under clause 15?
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1437.599,1445.288,"If that were the purpose of the call, to call forth into the federal service to execute the laws of the United States, yes."
1989.89-542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1445.288,1448.007,And the governor would have no veto power with reference to that?
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1448.007,1452.526,Absolutely none if there's a call pursuant to clause 15.
1989.89-542,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1452.526,1457.763,But your position is that this call was under the training provision--
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1457.763,1458.33,This was clearly--
1989.89-542,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1458.33,1463.85,--not... not under any of the three purposes in clause 15?
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1463.85,1464.85,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1989.89-542,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1471.439,1479.343,So that means we are in a position where we can't train them to do some of the things that we have to call them forth to do?
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1479.343,1487.032,"The Constitution, Justice Kennedy, gives to states the power to train, the authority over training the... the militia."
1989.89-542,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1538.815,1547.338,The power of training reserved to the state was to be exercised according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1548.522,1550.222,"The discipline, Justice White--"
1989.89-542,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1550.222,1550.973,"You mean, does that--"
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1550.973,1552.174,--means the standards.
1989.89-542,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1552.174,1554.093,--The standards and what they're supposed to teach them?
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1554.093,1555.459,What they're supposed to teach them.
1989.89-542,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1555.459,1556.093,What they're supposed to learn?
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1556.093,1558.878,The... the... originally it was a drill manual.
1989.89-542,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1558.878,1564.799,"So the states would just be... would just be... sort of a, just carrying out what Congress says they must do."
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1564.799,1566.151,That's... that's precisely correct.
1989.89-542,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1569.953,1571.686,What is that... what is that authority over the training?
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1587.831,1589.115,"--Well, if you read discipline--"
1989.89-542,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1589.115,1590.1,Is that right?
1989.89-542,0,33256,john_r_tunheim,,1590.1,1592.0,"--I... I don't think that's right, Justice White."
1989.89-542,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1624.588,1626.023,"Very well, Mr. Tunheim."
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1633.093,1636.997,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-542,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1745.099,1773.666,"Well, General Starr, in the statutes when Congress created this National Guard of the United States, as I understand it the statutes did provide that the Secretary of Defense could order any national guard unit into active duty for not more than 15 days a year with the consent of the governor."
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1779.587,1780.356,That's correct.
1989.89-542,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1781.189,1785.474,That Congress didn't have to say we'll give the governor a voice.
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1785.474,1791.812,That is precisely our position because of what this entity is.
1989.89-542,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1791.812,1808.589,Would you... would you be so kind as to tell me in this case whether you claim that the President called the guard to Honduras under one of the three purposes of the militia clause?
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1808.589,1810.208,"No, it did not."
1989.89-542,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1815.695,1820.897,"Well, were they called under the training clause of the militia clause?"
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1820.897,1822.866,"--No, they were not."
1989.89-542,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1832.472,1840.394,"Well, when... when the National Guard was created, was Congress acting pursuant to its power to organize the militia?"
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1840.394,1848.25,"Congress was acting in 1933 under its army clause powers, not under its organization--"
1989.89-542,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1848.25,1856.504,"Well, but Section 310 says that there is the organized militia, which is the National Guard."
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1870.68,1873.866,"--This is critical, Justice Kennedy."
1989.89-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1979.533,2005.166,"General Starr, is it within the power of a governor of a state to say I want to have my own militia that works for me full-time, I am willing to fund them, to buy their arms or they will fight with karate if necessary, but I do not want them to be part of the national guard, and, therefore, I am establishing a state militia that will be an unorganized militia, we will have no organized militia."
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2006.183,2007.452,Several points.
1989.89-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2015.239,2018.641,Why don't you answer yes or no and then go on and tell me?
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2020.143,2030.568,"--The governor cannot violate Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution with respect to maintaining troops in peacetime without Congress' consent."
1989.89-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2038.638,2040.674,I thought the Constitution allows the state to have a militia.
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2044.458,2046.993,In terms of maintaining... it depends on whether they are troops.
1989.89-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2055.183,2056.683,"Well, I assume militia have arms."
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2057.467,2059.135,Not at the time of the founding.
1989.89-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2083.15,2083.784,--I see.
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2100.928,2109.334,"Unless it comes within 109(c), which is the provision for state defense forces."
1989.89-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2112.703,2113.388,That's a matter of grace.
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2113.388,2114.072,--Exactly.
1989.89-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2114.072,2126.945,And you're saying that Congress can set it up in such fashion that the state cannot have any militia of its own which it arms that cannot be subject to the beck and call of... of the United States?
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2126.945,2134.385,It cannot equip individuals without the consent of Congress.
1989.89-542,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2164.82,2172.51,"But the framers, General Starr, were very careful to say that Congress has the authority to organize that militia?"
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2172.51,2173.126,That is true.
1989.89-542,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2173.126,2177.312,And you have been very careful to say that that isn't what's happening here.
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2177.312,2191.238,"In this respect, that is exactly right, that Congress has not been exercising its militia powers, which it does have under clause 15, to organize, and we think that includes defining who is serving in the militia."
1989.89-542,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2191.238,2204.646,"Well, is it... is it clear that the framers thought that Congress could prevent the states from setting up their own militia and giving them equipment?"
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2204.646,2223.709,"In terms of giving them equipment, I don't think the record is clear on that, but what we do know is that the Congress in 1792 determined that the individuals who would in fact be serving in the militia, all able-bodied persons, would supply their own, and it certainly was--"
1989.89-542,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2223.709,2233.315,What... what provision of the Constitution is it that you rely on to say that a state may not have its own militia that it arms?
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2233.315,2239.885,"--Oh, I'm sorry, not militia, but may not maintain troops in peacetime without the consent of Congress."
1989.89-542,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2239.885,2241.421,What provision is that?
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2241.421,2249.241,"That is Article I, Section 9, which limits the powers of the states."
1989.89-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2260.282,2262.75,"That means full-time troops, isn't that the meaning?"
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2279.277,2286.681,"As long as the individuals do not rise to the level of troops, there is no question that the Governor... first of all, the Governor enjoys--"
1989.89-542,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2286.681,2288.466,"But that's not involved here, is it, Mr. Starr?"
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2288.466,2290.599,"--It is not involved here, at all."
1989.89-542,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2293.001,2307.26,"What troubles me is that the Congress of the United States has authority to organize and arm the militia, not to create it, and the state has the right to create it, and there's a reserved right of the state to control it."
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2311.396,2325.906,"--The only control is that of the appointment of officers, clause 16, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress."
1989.89-542,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2406.81,2417.249,"Is it fair to say that the war power here is being used, in effect, to override a reserved power given to the states under Article 16?"
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2417.249,2418.283,I don't think so.
1989.89-542,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2479.469,2484.807,Did any governors object to any of those instances you mentioned?
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2484.807,2485.44,No.
1989.89-542,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2486.825,2489.377,"Well, then there was no constitutional problem."
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2489.377,2502.668,"--There was no gubernatorial objection, because I think until quite recently there was no sense at all that there was any basis for objecting to the training of individuals in their capacities as the Armed Forces of the United States."
1989.89-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2506.036,2507.072,"General Starr, can I ask you a question?"
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2509.072,2509.94,Yes.
1989.89-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2509.94,2528.902,"On the basic notion of the dual enlistment system, do I correctly understand you to say that the states really have no alternative, they cannot operate a separate militia as contemplated by the militia clause, if Congress says the only militia you can have has to have this dual status?"
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2532.354,2538.092,"They certainly have the option not to participate in the National Guard system, that is clear."
1989.89-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2538.092,2543.995,"But can they have... if they don't participate in the National Guard system, may they have their own separate militia?"
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2543.995,2546.197,They may have their own state defense forces--
1989.89-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2546.197,2546.513,No.
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2546.513,2547.68,--that are carrying out militia functions.
1989.89-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2547.68,2558.438,"Can they have the militia... whatever that term means in the militia clause of the Constitution, can they have that animal without having that animal become part of the United States Army?"
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2558.438,2559.707,"Yes, they can."
1989.89-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2563.259,2566.861,I thought earlier you said that they couldn't.
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2568.144,2573.431,The concern I have is with respect to consent with respect to maintaining troops.
1989.89-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2589.392,2595.13,"Well, they want to have a militia that would be available to become part of the United States if war should be declared."
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2603.617,2620.162,"Well, in addition, what Congress has seen fit to do is to define in federal law the militia of the United States, and it is indicated that that consists of all able-bodied males of a certain age."
1989.89-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2624.53,2625.882,--What section is this?
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2625.882,2638.707,"This is 10 United States Code Section 311, and the organized militia is then defined as the National Guard and the naval militia."
1989.89-542,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2660.489,2677.599,"The Petitioner says that Congress has also forbidden the states to have an organized militia except under the terms that Congress has provided, which also makes them part of the national reserve component."
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2678.701,2685.02,"Well, I take issue with that in terms of the definition in the Constitution of the militia."
1989.89-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2711.505,2720.944,"Yes, but they can only be called, according to the Constitution, into the service of the United States for the three purposes that are specified: to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrection and repel invasion."
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2720.944,2721.611,That's quite true.
1989.89-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2724.745,2728.281,That's quite different from calling them into duty for the purposes of training in Honduras.
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2728.281,2736.22,"--That's quite right, and that's why Congress in fact exercised army clause powers in 1933."
1989.89-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2766.489,2798.111,"Well, Mr. Starr, when Section 311 says that... in 311(b)... the classes of the militia are (1) the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard and the naval militia, (2) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the naval militia, does ""organized"" and ""unorganized"" have any objective meaning, or is it just a convenient term to refer to those militia that are the National Guard and those militia that aren't?"
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2798.111,2812.47,"I think it means Item (2), (b)(2), means that part of the pool of able-bodied persons defined in (a), the militia of the United States consists of all... in fact, it's--"
1989.89-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2812.47,2813.853,"What does ""unorganized"" mean?"
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2816.522,2816.941,--No.
1989.89-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2818.724,2820.476,They haven't been federally organized?
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2820.476,2823.178,They haven't been organized at all.
1989.89-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2823.178,2827.063,So a state cannot have any organized militia that isn't part of the National Guard.
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2827.663,2828.213,"No, that's not true."
1989.89-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2828.832,2829.715,"--Well, they have to be federally organized?"
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2829.715,2834.986,"--Our definitional difficulties are arising by virtue of different uses of the term ""militia""."
1989.89-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2869.04,2871.426,I'm trying to get back to whether the Governor can organize them.
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2892.09,2898.993,It certainly implies that those individuals who are in the unorganized militia may become organized.
1989.89-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2902.195,2915.455,"So you really think the unorganized militia means... in this statute means unorganized, that the state has no independent authority to organize a militia, all it can do is designate a bunch of people who we say, you are militia, but we can't organize you without federal consent."
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2918.121,2930.845,"In terms of maintain... as long as they do not run afoul... it's not involved in this case, but as long as they do not run afoul of the maintaining troops in wartime... in time of peace."
1989.89-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2946.938,2954.627,"I think you've said they can organize, so long as they don't run afoul of the maintaining troops clause, whatever that might mean."
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2955.227,2955.71,That is correct.
1989.89-542,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2967.316,2971.386,There are a lot of questions that are kind of lurking on the edge of this case--
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2971.386,2971.836,Yes.
1989.89-542,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2971.836,2976.539,--that we really don't have to decide in writing an opinion one way or the other.
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,2976.539,2978.806,I fully agree with that.
1989.89-542,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3050.068,3076.82,"General Starr, I have no doubt that Congress' power is plenary, but I'm not sure that we're going to read Congress' power to totally eliminate another power, namely, the power of the states to maintain militia, any more than we would enable Congress to... to draft all state governments, and say all members of state governments are automatically members of the National Guard, and we may send them abroad at our will."
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3097.549,3106.172,"I think, Justice Scalia, that, although not involved in this case, I must state that that is not involved in this case."
1989.89-542,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3130.188,3144.864,Do you know of any authority for the proposition that an express power given to Congress can override an express limitation on Congress' power under some other provision of the Constitution?
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3144.864,3148.832,When these individuals... the answer is... is no.
1989.89-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3206.871,3208.555,"Of course, those cases are easy when you get a time of crisis."
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3212.091,3212.775,--That's correct.
1989.89-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3213.875,3214.308,May I ask you?
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3216.793,3225.999,--I think it means the pool of able-bodied persons who are able to serve their country or to serve their state.
1989.89-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3244.813,3245.546,Which we aren't--
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3245.546,3246.18,--who can be--
1989.89-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3250.384,3251.034,--All right.
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3253.418,3258.62,"Others, I suppose, are emeriti members of... of... of the militia."
1989.89-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3259.555,3260.272,I don't know what I was now.
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3261.555,3267.493,--But I think that's what the militia clauses of the Constitution are getting at.
1989.89-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3267.493,3268.011,May I ask--
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3268.011,3269.861,They're talking about that pool of persons who can be summoned.
1989.89-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3269.861,3270.797,--May I ask one other question?
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3284.205,3285.121,"No, and--"
1989.89-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3285.121,3289.175,"For example, I don't think you relied at all on the troops... the prohibition--"
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3289.175,3298.697,"--Oh, I did that only in response to questions about what is the authority of governors to go and organize militia units?"
1989.89-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3310.422,3313.957,--It involves training in a time when there's no emergency.
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3313.957,3314.607,--That is correct.
1989.89-542,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3329.567,3333.788,"They wear two hats, and as I understand it now, and frankly I didn't... but they must wear two hats, too."
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3336.655,3341.441,"The National Guard, since... that is correct."
1989.89-542,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3371.163,3404.217,"General Starr, as an old buck private in the rear rank of a Minnesota guard, I can say that not a one of us in the rear rank would understand this argument today."
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3407.952,3409.718,May I respond very briefly to that?
1989.89-542,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3409.718,3411.337,"No, that's not a question, General Starr."
1989.89-542,1,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3414.189,3415.306,I thank the Court.
1989.89-542,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3415.306,3419.158,"Mr. Tunheim, you have two minutes remaining."
1989.89-542,2,33256,john_r_tunheim,,3419.158,3422.193,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.89-542,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3477.796,3481.131,May I ask you what you think the term militia means in the Constitution?
1989.89-542,2,33256,john_r_tunheim,,3481.131,3491.772,--I think the term militia in the Constitution refers to the militia organizations that the states had at the time that the framers sat down to write the Constitution.
1989.89-542,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3499.795,3502.497,But... but the power to organize the militia is given to Congress.
1989.89-542,2,33256,john_r_tunheim,,3502.497,3507.966,"And Congress has exercised that power, has organized the militia, and has created the National Guard."
1989.89-542,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3553.077,3554.427,"Thank you, Mr. Tunheim."
1989.89-542,2,33256,john_r_tunheim,,3554.427,3554.943,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.89-542,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3554.943,3556.043,The case is submitted.
