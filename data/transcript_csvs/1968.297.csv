1968.297,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,11.751,"Immigration and Naturalization Service, Petitioner versus Veljko Stanisic."
1968.297,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,13.699,32.122,"Mr. Chief Justice, I move the admission of Joseph J. Connolly, member of my staff and member of the Bar of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania to present the argument for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in this case."
1968.297,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,32.122,33.964,You move that it'd be a better for that purpose.
1968.297,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,33.964,35.722,I do sir.
1968.297,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,35.722,37.849,"Very well, motion is granted."
1968.297,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,37.849,39.634,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1968.297,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,505.086,508.444,What was the ground of the District Director's action?
1968.297,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,508.444,513.928,The ground that the District Director's action in denying parole?
1968.297,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,513.928,515.14,"Yes, under a --"
1968.297,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,515.14,515.445,Under the regulation?
1968.297,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,515.445,516.246,-- regulation.
1968.297,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,516.361,525.069,"There was no evidence at all Mr. Justice, respondent refused to give any evidence claiming that he had a right to a different procedure."
1968.297,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,525.069,529.806,"I see and well, then that was the ground for the District Director's action."
1968.297,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,530.923,531.864,There was no showing.
1968.297,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,531.864,533.956,Does that appear that that was his ground?
1968.297,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,533.956,538.96,Yes.
1968.297,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,547.165,554.461,"Mr. Connolly, what was the basis of respondent's claim to the right -- to a different proceeding than that under the regulation?"
1968.297,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,554.461,560.16,"Well, Mr. Justice it doesn't really appear from the record exactly what the basis --"
1968.297,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,560.16,561.732,Was the ship still in port at that time?
1968.297,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,561.732,564.789,The ship was still in port at that time.
1968.297,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,594.504,598.678,"Mr. Connolly, what kind of hearing did he demand?"
1968.297,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,598.678,613.388,He demanded a hearing before a special inquiry officer pursuant to Section 242 (b) which is set out in the Government's brief on pages 39 and 40.
1968.297,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,621.914,626.049,And is that the kind of a hearing that would be time consuming?
1968.297,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,632.621,641.186,"The record doesn't disclose Mr. Justice whether there were any special inquiry officers, Mr. Chief Justice, whether there were any special inquiry officers in Oregon at the time."
1968.297,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,652.23,657.443,But on that -- would it be enough time so that it would not be possible to get him back in his own ship?
1968.297,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,657.443,660.305,Conceivably it would be.
1968.297,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,680.907,694.384,"May I ask Mr. Connolly, if he had not had a permit for the jumped ship and his ship was still in the harbor when they picked him up."
1968.297,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,705.855,726.628,"My understanding, Mr. Justice would be that under the Act, he would not be subject to Section 252 (b) but that he must be preceded against under Section 2 -- on the grounds stated in 241 and under the proceeding in Section 242 (b)."
1968.297,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,726.628,738.22,"So that getting the permit, he gets only the summary hearing on persecution plan but if he hadn't got the permit and jumped ship, he didn't have the hearing before the hearing December, is that it?"
1968.297,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,738.22,750.131,That is right Mr. Justice and I intend to deal with that question later on as to whether the discrimination between a crewman who gets a permit and a crewman who jumped ship makes any sense at all.
1968.297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,750.131,755.32,"Well, isn't it also true if he says, he's going back on another ship, he gets a full hearing?"
1968.297,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,755.32,761.335,That is right Mr. Justice and I also intend to deal with that form of discrimination.
1968.297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1395.541,1400.139,Suppose he stayed two months?
1968.297,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,1400.139,1401.372,Suppose he stayed two months?
1968.297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1401.372,1402.871,Uh-huh.
1968.297,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,1402.871,1422.898,"Well, I think that the argument that I'm making does not require that you draw the lines between two months and three months, three months and four months without this -- the -- without in effect the statutory limitations period of Section 252 (b)."
1968.297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1422.898,1427.288,There's two -- these two months you got the same summary treatment?
1968.297,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,1427.288,1427.589,"No, because --"
1968.297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1427.589,1428.645,Is that your position?
1968.297,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,1428.645,1429.757,"No, sir."
1968.297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1435.855,1440.702,Suppose he is here one hour after the ship leaves?
1968.297,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,1440.702,1442.081,It's the same thing Mr. Justice because --
1968.297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1442.081,1443.181,What do you think?
1968.297,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,1443.181,1446.981,-- because we can't impose any other statutory limitations --
1968.297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1446.981,1450.733,"So, his rights are determined by how long the ship being around?"
1968.297,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,1450.733,1452.579,That is right.
1968.297,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1452.672,1454.548,Do you think that what's Congress think?
1968.297,1,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,1454.548,1454.764,"Yes, sir."
1968.297,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1690.633,1693.369,Mr. Fedde.
1968.297,2,25259,g_bernhard_fedde,,1693.369,1698.448,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.297,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1806.616,1813.382,"That wasn't -- that wasn't the basis on which we granted the permit -- the writ of certiorari, was it?"
1968.297,2,25259,g_bernhard_fedde,,1813.382,1814.167,No.
1968.297,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1988.245,1998.224,Were those facts -- were those facts raised before the Deputy Commissioner when he gave his original hearing?
1968.297,2,25259,g_bernhard_fedde,,1998.224,1998.481,No.
1968.297,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1999.087,2000.831,Why were they not?
1968.297,2,25259,g_bernhard_fedde,,2000.831,2003.3,We have 15 minutes notice.
1968.297,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2084.46,2086.047,That was what day?
1968.297,2,25259,g_bernhard_fedde,,2086.047,2087.629,"January 7th, still the same day."
1968.297,3,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,3672.309,3689.786,"Mr. Chief Justice, the Chief Justice was very kind in extending the Government's time in which improvidently was terminated its opening statement because there's a matters of some importance, some very great importance in this case in which the Government and the respondent strongly disagree."
1968.297,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3826.822,3848.06,Another way of looking at it is a person off a ship from Yugoslavia coming to a strange country worked up pretty well to get even to the place where he might get justice to think of an American landing in Yugoslavia and trying to work his way through all the nuisances of Yugoslavia law.
1968.297,3,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,3850.296,3851.155,The argument --
1968.297,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3851.155,3856.275,You assumed that every person who walks in has an LLB from Harvard.
1968.297,3,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,3862.244,3870.991,"Well, I think after Mr. Stanisic got on shore he did miraculously well against what Congress direct from the statute."
1968.297,4,25259,g_bernhard_fedde,,4629.79,4630.375,Yes.
1968.297,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4630.375,4633.502,What I want to ask you about was this.
1968.297,4,25259,g_bernhard_fedde,,4652.966,4653.968,Yes and no.
1968.297,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4656.768,4659.375,I'm talking about after the boat left.
1968.297,4,25259,g_bernhard_fedde,,4659.375,4663.868,The request was made before the hearing was after the boat had left.
1968.297,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4700.475,4704.335,"But the request was made while the ship was still in port in United States, is that right?"
1968.297,4,25259,g_bernhard_fedde,,4704.335,4704.87,Yes.
1968.297,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4711.11,4714.066,You -- you may have just a moment if you wish to have something to say.
1968.297,4,25259,g_bernhard_fedde,,4714.066,4728.31,Just one point in the protocol that has been referred to by the -- just points out with reference to who is a refugee.
1968.297,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4734.454,4747.743,"Mr. Fedde, in this case the Court appointed you to represent this indigent defendant and we appreciate the fact that you have done so with diligence and fairness."
1968.297,5,29797,joseph_j_connolly,,4756.166,4756.819,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
