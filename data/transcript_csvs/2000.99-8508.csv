2000.99-8508,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.767,"We'll hear argument now on number 99-8508, Danny Lee Kyllo versus the United States."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,8.318,20.035,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, this case is about thermal imaging of a home without a warrant, and whether that constitutes an impermissible search under the Fourth Amendment."
2000.99-8508,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,53.736,59.061,"Mr. Lerner, I thought the district court here made some findings in that regard."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,59.061,59.57,Yes.
2000.99-8508,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,59.57,77.07,"To the effect that the thermal imaging device cannot and did not show any people or activity within the walls of the structure, and the device cannot penetrate walls or windows to reveal conversations or human activities."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,84.667,94.852,"Well, I accept the finding, Your Honor, that the thermal imager is capturing emissions as they are coming from the wall."
2000.99-8508,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,94.852,96.985,"Well, let me ask you this."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,103.457,112.035,"Well, I think some of those findings are mixed questions of fact and law, such as what is activity and what activity does the Constitution protect."
2000.99-8508,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,155.483,169.742,"Well, don't we have at least a lodging here that indicates that the thermal imager will, in fact, or can, in fact, produce images of what is happening of objects and what is happening to those objects inside the walls?"
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,169.742,170.513,Yes.
2000.99-8508,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,170.513,170.943,All right.
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,173.515,181.65,"Well, I think the Court should look at, first of all, the videotape that's been lodged, and a few things you should know about the videotape."
2000.99-8508,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,194.549,196.749,Was the original of that introduced in evidence?
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,196.749,198.34,"Yes, the original was introduced in evidence."
2000.99-8508,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,201.602,224.179,"How could the judge make the finding that he made if he accepted the original item of evidence, assuming that it is substantially identical to what we have lodged with us, because one of the sights that appears from the videotape is the sight of individuals moving inside a house, I believe with the shades drawn."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,224.179,235.104,"--Well, that is one of the exhibits that we have lodged, Exhibit 107 and 108, do show an individual inside behind glass, but there is nothing with the shades drawn."
2000.99-8508,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,238.768,240.278,Was it supposedly taken in darkness?
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,240.278,242.228,--The thermal imaging?
2000.99-8508,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,242.228,255.228,"Well, tell me, was the... I looked at the lodged videotape, and it showed individuals moving, or an individual moving inside the building, inside an apartment."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,261.762,262.363,That's right.
2000.99-8508,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,262.363,264.815,So that in total darkness of visible light--
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,264.815,265.496,That's right.
2000.99-8508,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,265.496,269.125,--that image could have been made by the thermal imaging device?
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,269.125,269.376,That's correct.
2000.99-8508,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,272.959,279.094,The district court had that before it when it made these findings?
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,279.094,279.734,"Yes, it did."
2000.99-8508,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,279.734,286.8,"So presumably to the extent the findings are inconsistent with that exhibit, the district court did not give full accord to it?"
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,286.8,299.927,"That's correct, Your Honor, and I would like to say that I think Judge Frey at the district court level, was trying to determine what this thermal imager would do and what it did in this case, and she did not--"
2000.99-8508,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,299.927,300.948,"Mr. Lerner, would you qualify--"
2000.99-8508,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,300.948,302.488,--I think he is answering my question.
2000.99-8508,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,302.488,302.898,I'm sorry.
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,302.898,318.299,"--And so there is... apparently that's what the limit of her factual holding is that in this particular case, it did not show any person or activity, but she did not say that it's not capable of showing what our expert did show, that it can show people inside of windows."
2000.99-8508,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,318.299,328.257,"Now may I qualify that what you're talking about now, the one that shows people, was not the one that was involved in this very case?"
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,328.257,328.795,That's right.
2000.99-8508,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,328.795,329.606,It was a different one?
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,329.606,330.287,That's right.
2000.99-8508,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,330.287,333.058,So I think there is some confusion on that point.
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,336.752,337.112,That's right.
2000.99-8508,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,367.964,379.19,"--Well, Mr. Lerner, you say that in this particular situation the thermal imaging did only so much, but we shouldn't just look at that we should look at what it's capable of."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,379.19,379.931,Absolutely.
2000.99-8508,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,379.931,381.573,I don't think you're correct in that.
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,388.456,413.004,"Well, you know, you're the Supreme Court, so you will do what I assume you will do, but I think that you will probably have then a series of cases every time a thermal imager is used on a different wall or on a window or the newest version of the technology comes up, and I think it really makes sense, unless the Court wants to revisit this every few years, to look at what the capability of the science is."
2000.99-8508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,413.004,437.119,"Well, what about the proposition that so long as it is not showing anything that couldn't have been discovered without the visual imager, in this case when you're talking about how warm the roof is, I assume that if the police had waited for a good snowfall, they could have found out exactly what they found out through this thermal imaging."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,437.119,439.199,"Well, I--"
2000.99-8508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,439.199,445.454,"I mean, the snow would have melted on other roofs, it would not have melted... I mean, it would have melted in these portions, it wouldn't have melted elsewhere."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,445.454,449.487,"--Well, two things I would like to say about that Justice Scalia."
2000.99-8508,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,475.995,488.695,"Well, have we upheld, for example, the use of night vision glasses by law enforcement personnel to see things that they couldn't see with natural vision--"
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,488.695,490.027,"No, you have not."
2000.99-8508,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,490.027,490.938,--We've not?
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,490.938,491.306,No.
2000.99-8508,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,491.306,492.587,Other courts have?
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,492.587,495.049,"Some courts have, Your Honor, yes."
2000.99-8508,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,495.049,506.908,"But if we did, if we had such a case under your view, we'd have to ask what potentially they could see, and getting back to the Chief Justice's question, I just don't know if there's authority for that."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,531.754,537.779,"Well, I don't know if you do or you don't."
2000.99-8508,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,548.985,553.929,"Well, on that point, it seems to me you take somewhat inconsistent positions."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,569.779,575.703,"Well, that's not the question that's before this Court, but in the lower court we did claim that it was not accurate and should not be used in search warrants."
2000.99-8508,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,582.306,585.129,"--But my point is, you do make this argument to us."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,595.418,600.19,"This particular machine is very subject to manipulation, but thermal imaging itself is not."
2000.99-8508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,619.464,621.363,It didn't matter it came from a particular place.
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,632.512,635.805,"Well, it wasn't extraordinary amount of heat in the house."
2000.99-8508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,640.778,643.008,"Well, would it have mattered whether it was in the cellar or in the roof?"
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,643.669,645.221,It may or may not have.
2000.99-8508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,645.221,662.122,"--Well, it seems to me, would it have been a violation for the police... I think they did use in the search warrant here the fact that the utility bills for this home were much higher than surrounding homes."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,669.557,695.884,"We haven't raised that as an issue, Your Honor, and I think this Court's holdings in Miller and Smith versus Maryland seem to say that if someone has records that are being held by a third party, they don't have an expectation of privacy that those records might not be searched, so the fact that they were able to subpoena and obtain Mr. Kyllo's energy records I don't think is a matter that we've raised as--"
2000.99-8508,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,695.884,704.51,May I ask you if you think the... that that information in those records would have been adequate probable cause to get a warrant to use the device in this case?
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,704.51,706.353,"--We don't believe that it would, Your Honor, no."
2000.99-8508,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,706.353,711.916,"So that really the question before us is not just procedural, but whether or not they can use these devices at all?"
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,711.916,712.724,That's right.
2000.99-8508,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,715.687,716.919,And would the--
2000.99-8508,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,716.919,721.23,"--And if they had enough probable cause to use the device, they probably wouldn't need the device?"
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,721.23,733.1,"Well, that's absolutely true, and I think that's the same argument that was used in Karo, that if we need probable cause to use this to monitor the beeper, then we'll effectively use this."
2000.99-8508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,733.1,733.211,Let's go in the house and look.
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,733.211,735.494,So the court said that's not a good enough reason.
2000.99-8508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,735.494,736.502,"Well, could it vary?"
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,756.368,769.516,"I think anytime that the Government is seeking to capture information from a private place like the home, and they cannot do it with their own unaided human senses, then they may not use technology to do the same thing."
2000.99-8508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,769.516,794.232,"Suppose your choice was exactly that, that you... when faced with that dilemma, the court holds that you can use it without any warrant, and how would you prefer as a fallback, you need at least a warrant but less cause than to rummage in the home itself or is that so fixed in the law there is really just the absolute dichotomy?"
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,794.232,802.848,"Well, I think the Court has repeated so many times that to enter the home or to search the home that you need a warrant--"
2000.99-8508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,802.848,806.081,"Well, I know that, and what you'd have to say is it's probable cause not to enter the home."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,809.333,833.879,"--Well, I think that's a very dangerous road to go when we start talking about imagers and technology because what it's capturing really is molecular information that migrates through our walls and therefore if we are now saying that we can capture that kind of information without a warrant, we can reduce our whole world to that type of wave and molecule, and our walls mean nothing because our walls cannot contain that kind of information."
2000.99-8508,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,833.879,851.681,"Mr. Lerner, could you just explain to me what this thermal imaging revealed that was not revealed by the utility records which you say under our precedent it was permissible for the police to obtain?"
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,851.681,875.637,"Well, utility records give you generalized information about someone's electrical use, and we actually did have quite a complete hearing about those records and heard from utility industry people, and people's energy bills vary quite dramatically depending, frankly, on how many women live in the home versus men, how many times you do laundry, who is taking showers, things that you plug in."
2000.99-8508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,886.824,887.555,Mr. Lerner--
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,887.555,888.126,In this case--
2000.99-8508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,888.126,894.25,--you say that you can't use... look into the home with anything other than the unaided senses.
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,910.691,914.273,"--The Court hasn't really addressed that point yet, so that's going to be a very difficult question when it comes up."
2000.99-8508,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,914.273,919.936,--But you're saying we ought to address it right now because that ought to be our standard of what is reasonable expectation.
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,920.958,934.108,"My standard is if it is unavailable to the unaided eye, simply because there is a window and you can see deep inside that window that no one else in the normal course could have seen with some high powered technology--"
2000.99-8508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,934.108,935.37,But eyeglasses are okay?
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,935.37,936.258,--Eyeglasses are fine.
2000.99-8508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,936.258,936.759,Okay.
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,940.193,947.258,"Well, eyeglasses give you normal vision, and they are an accepted way of repairing disabled vision--"
2000.99-8508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,947.258,948.227,Why should--
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,948.227,951.87,"--but when you start to use technology, that takes us beyond the human senses, now the Court has said--"
2000.99-8508,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,951.87,952.391,--How about--
2000.99-8508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,952.391,953.56,--Why is that relevant?
2000.99-8508,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,953.56,960.355,"I mean, you're saying some things that take us beyond the human senses are okay, eyeglasses, binoculars, maybe not."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,972.984,988.696,"--Well, the line is drawn there because the privacy is predicated upon what someone can knowingly or unknowingly expose, and once we're in the level of technology, people have no way of knowing when they are voluntarily exposing something."
2000.99-8508,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,992.198,1008.898,"So you're saying that reasonable expectation is in part based on fact, what do you, in fact, expect, and that informs, should inform the standard of reasonable expectation, is that the nub of what you're saying?"
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1008.898,1009.158,--Yes.
2000.99-8508,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1010.75,1013.771,"What about a dog sniff, how about a dog sniff?"
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1013.771,1015.954,How about a dog sniff?
2000.99-8508,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1015.954,1021.797,"Yeah, we've used dog sniffs to detect something that the human nose doesn't detect, haven't we?"
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1025.798,1026.089,Right.
2000.99-8508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1060.652,1063.264,"How about a policeman with 10/10 vision, is that okay?"
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1063.264,1064.514,With 10/10 vision?
2000.99-8508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1064.514,1066.557,"Yeah, I guess that's better than 20/20, I don't know."
2000.99-8508,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1067.127,1076.071,"--Mr. Lerner, you were explaining to me, and I haven't quite grasped it, why the utility records wouldn't tell you the same thing."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1081.056,1097.876,"The thermal imaging will give you a more specific impression such as here it showed three distinct, evenly spaced circles of light at the peak of the roof from which they could conclude that this is very similar to other marijuana growing that they have seen."
2000.99-8508,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1132.197,1133.719,And the imaging will tell you that?
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1133.719,1142.415,"The imaging will give you specific heat impressions from various places in the home, coming through the wall, telling you what's on the other side of the wall."
2000.99-8508,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1142.415,1147.518,May I ask to what extent your theory depends on the sophisticated nature of the equipment?
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1161.429,1166.973,"Well, that would be a different question than the use of technology."
2000.99-8508,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1166.973,1167.484,Why would that be different?
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1167.484,1174.516,"Because they would be intruding on the curtilage, where they physically invading and touching the wall, I'm not sure that they're--"
2000.99-8508,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1174.516,1179.401,"Well, say the houses were only six feet apart and they could stay on their side of the boundary line."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1179.401,1193.342,"--I'd say then that is something that would be permissible because it's something that is akin to our normal human senses, that they could determine how hot the wall was by feeling it."
2000.99-8508,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1193.342,1194.133,"No, not feeling it."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1203.357,1211.932,"Well, obviously I don't think that we would prohibit things like thermometers or watches or things that we typically use in our daily lives."
2000.99-8508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1211.932,1212.933,But a drug sniffing dog you couldn't?
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1215.885,1217.237,Right.
2000.99-8508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1217.908,1219.227,"In your view, you couldn't do that?"
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1219.227,1219.978,"--that would be a really different question, yes."
2000.99-8508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1219.978,1224.323,Why don't your reasonable expectations of privacy include technology?
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1242.316,1242.843,Right.
2000.99-8508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1242.843,1258.554,"And so also you know there are things such as thermal image, and so if you're really concerned about that degree of privacy, I'm sure there are means of preventing the heat escape from the house, and therefore preventing that technology from being used."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1262.978,1271.404,"We don't have to assume that we do, Your Honor, but technology has the ability to penetrate into our private lives, and that's the problem."
2000.99-8508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1271.404,1276.456,"Yes, it does and we have the ability to protect our private lives as well if we really have expectations of privacy."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1276.456,1302.534,"So that what I'm... I guess our position is that the burden really is improperly placed on the citizen to anticipate what type of technology the Government may come up with, and perhaps you're correct that if it's sufficiently sophisticated rather than something that's very common and ordinary, then it shouldn't be the burden of the citizen to anticipate what they can't particularly know or may not know, and then take safeguarding measures."
2000.99-8508,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1302.534,1320.667,"Well, are you saying, in effect that if thermal imaging becomes very common and every school kid has a $5 thermal imager, that at that point it really would be unreasonable not to expect that the Government was going to use to it figure out what's going on in the house?"
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1320.667,1323.767,I'm not saying that because I think once we--
2000.99-8508,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1323.767,1325.64,What's the effect of sophistication?
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1325.64,1333.454,"--Well, at this point the effect of sophistication is that it is not commonly used by normal people in their every day life."
2000.99-8508,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1333.454,1336.225,"Yeah, but in my example, the school kids have all got thermal imagers."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1340.56,1342.63,"I would hope not, Your Honor."
2000.99-8508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1342.63,1343.08,Why not?
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1361.784,1366.556,"Well, we can now... we have the ability to wiretap everybody's telephone."
2000.99-8508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1366.556,1368.098,"Yeah, yeah, but you don't expect--"
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1368.098,1368.387,But we don't do that.
2000.99-8508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1368.387,1369.538,--your phone to be wiretapped.
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1369.538,1369.809,That's right.
2000.99-8508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1371.569,1373.472,But you do expect people to walk around with binoculars.
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1373.472,1373.762,Right.
2000.99-8508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1373.762,1376.033,So why doesn't that make the difference?
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1376.033,1381.846,"Well, the only difference between the wiretap issue is because this Court has said you can't do that."
2000.99-8508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1383.686,1385.679,"Well, isn't there another difference other than what the Court said?"
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1390.301,1391.113,And I agree with that.
2000.99-8508,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1391.113,1395.705,We do expect quite often people to walk around with binoculars.
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1395.705,1404.181,"We may expect people may walk around with binoculars, but that does depend on the vantage point and where a person is located as well."
2000.99-8508,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1424.633,1445.538,"Okay, then if that's the case, then the criterion of sophistication is not sufficient because if that's the case, then when thermal images are no longer regarded as sophisticated, when every kid has one, you are saying we still may, in fact, find that there is a Fourth Amendment value that is offended by admitting this stuff into evidence."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1446.95,1447.641,That's right.
2000.99-8508,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1447.641,1452.964,--you're getting... I think you're dropping your sophistication point as being determinative.
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1458.199,1477.882,"That is not the value, that's correct, and unfortunately we do have already technology that the Court has already approved, such as field glasses and flashlights and illumination devices and things of that nature without analyzing it under Katz or the vantage point or the normalcy of people using it, and that's what Justice Breyer's bringing up."
2000.99-8508,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1482.403,1488.598,"Well, do you think a flashlight comes under the head of something that's totally unexpected?"
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1500.566,1503.597,"A dark corner of someone's home, Your Honor?"
2000.99-8508,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1503.597,1506.52,"No, suppose outside someone's home."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1506.52,1510.903,"We're not saying that they would have any expectation of privacy outside, in hiding."
2000.99-8508,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1510.903,1514.185,"Well, how would a flashlight... you mentioned the term flashlight."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1516.727,1524.754,"Well, it is a technological device that provides illumination that aids the human senses."
2000.99-8508,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1527.826,1531.609,"Well, there is a Brandeis opinion from the '20s that says you can use a bright light, I think."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1531.609,1543.567,"Yes, there is the Lee case, Your Honor, in '27 did say that flashlight, search lights, actually it was on a boat, and it provided illumination of boats already out in the public view."
2000.99-8508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1550.953,1553.374,But you can't shine it into the window of a house?
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1553.374,1555.605,--The Court hasn't said that you can shine it into the window of a house.
2000.99-8508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1555.605,1556.105,And you think you can't?
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1556.105,1561.148,I think that it would depend on the vantage point and what the person has knowingly exposed and things of that nature.
2000.99-8508,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1561.148,1574.939,"Well, no... what do you mean, it would depend on the vantage... a policeman sees an open window, he suspects that this house has contraband in it, the window is left uncurtained, he shines a flashlight inside and sees stolen goods."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1574.939,1585.345,"Well, I don't think that an officer can just walk up to anyone's home and start shining a flashlight into their home without a warrant."
2000.99-8508,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1589.138,1594.941,Does it have anything to do with the range of normal and expected uses of the device?
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1647.467,1648.659,Yes.
2000.99-8508,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1648.659,1655.762,"That is its only principal use outside of heat loss surveys, the penetration of privacy?"
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1655.762,1657.664,"It is used in a number of industrial processes, Your Honor."
2000.99-8508,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1665.299,1667.872,But outside of that kind of use--
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1667.872,1668.683,Yes.
2000.99-8508,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1668.683,1676.987,--are there other sort of benign uses that are neutral so far as law enforcement might be concerned?
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1676.987,1681.191,"Well, our expert said that the number of uses are probably unlimited."
2000.99-8508,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1689.616,1693.948,"In any case, that's not a criterion for distinguishing between thermal imaging and flashlights."
2000.99-8508,0,33892,kenneth_lerner,,1693.948,1697.06,If I'm... I'd like to reserve the rest of my time unless there's another question.
2000.99-8508,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1697.06,1697.991,"Very well, Mr. Lerner."
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1700.182,1711.199,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, thermal imaging senses heat gradients on the exterior of a surface, in this case the structure was a house."
2000.99-8508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1762.395,1768.979,"But, you know, all of that could have been said but for a change of senses about Katz."
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1807.144,1824.595,"Justice Souter, I think that Katz is fundamentally different in the respect that what the bug picked up in Katz was sound waves, which is what we hear with, and it amplified them and exactly reproduced what Mr. Katz was saying inside the booth."
2000.99-8508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1824.595,1832.441,"Yeah, but it was the wave after it got through the phone booth, just as what infrared is picking up is the wave after it gets through the roof or the window."
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1832.441,1840.524,"No, I think what the infrared imager is picking up, and the record in this case again corroborates this, is heat leaving the house."
2000.99-8508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1842.066,1845.72,What's the difference between heat leaving the house and the sound wave leaving the phone booth?
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1845.72,1850.261,"--Well, there are a number of sources for the heat that will leave the exterior of the house."
2000.99-8508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1855.116,1855.965,But so what?
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1861.529,1871.377,"--No, but what is picked up and what is discerned is the exact reproduction of the words that the person is speaking, and that is the invasion of privacy that Katz was concerned with."
2000.99-8508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1890.477,1900.605,"No, but the reason they're doing the thermal imaging is not to determine whether there is any heat being left by the sun's radiation that is reflected back in the nighttime."
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1926.37,1937.54,"--Well, Justice Souter, I think that it's not only considerably less sophisticated, but it is also picking up something that is very different in character from the words that people speak within a particular place."
2000.99-8508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1967.269,1982.47,"Okay, but if somebody wants to spend his time in a house lying under high electricity using sun lamps, isn't that just as much the person's own business as what he speaks in the phone booth?"
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1982.47,1988.005,"But the critical point here, Justice Souter is the thermal imager doesn't tell you that he's lying in the house under sun--"
2000.99-8508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1988.005,1994.476,"It doesn't tell you that because it at this point is not sophisticated enough to do it, but it takes you one step in the way."
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2019.926,2027.159,"--It doesn't get you in that way in the same mechanism that Katz does, which is by exactly reproducing it."
2000.99-8508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2028.26,2028.551,Right.
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2032.093,2032.311,--Exactly.
2000.99-8508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2033.723,2037.547,"But the object is the same, and the datum that is being used is the same."
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2037.547,2045.101,--But there's nothing wrong with the police attempting to use techniques from outside the house that will allow them to draw inferences about the inside of the house.
2000.99-8508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2045.101,2046.513,"Yeah, well, that's the question."
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2082.427,2095.306,"I think that the argument that I'm trying to present, Justice Souter, is more complicated than that because it's really focusing on the core question of whether there are reasonable expectations of privacy in heat loss, and in order to assess that--"
2000.99-8508,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2095.306,2096.799,It's not in heat loss.
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2150.741,2154.394,--And what you're doing in your bathroom is not picked up by the thermal imager.
2000.99-8508,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2155.326,2169.715,"It couldn't tell, for example... I thought the thermal imager could tell if I go into the bathroom... I happen to like a sauna, and I turn on every shower, and I have... it really is hot and steamy, and there we are."
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2171.845,2175.569,"--If you fog up the windows, you could probably actually see that from the street."
2000.99-8508,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2175.569,2175.989,"No, no, I don't have any windows."
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2184.324,2185.596,I guess a modern Finnish thermal imager--
2000.99-8508,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2185.596,2187.707,--Can it pick it up or not?
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2187.707,2199.374,"--I think that what the record in this case shows you is that it might be able to pick up exterior heat on the outside of the house, and it will not tell you what's going on inside the house."
2000.99-8508,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2199.374,2204.177,"It'll just tell you it's hot in there, which happens to be just the thing they want to know."
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2225.003,2232.199,"I do but I think what it overlooks is that the record in this case, the video in this case is particularly instructive."
2000.99-8508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2268.03,2268.651,Okay.
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2279.857,2280.588,"Well, the thermal--"
2000.99-8508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2280.588,2286.062,The whole point of using the device is to tell you something more than you can get from the utility records.
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2286.062,2297.401,--The whole point of using the device to try to cross corroborate various pieces of information so that you can better establish probable cause for the search warrant that was ultimately obtained.
2000.99-8508,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2297.401,2303.415,"Well, the utility records wouldn't tell you what the electricity was being used for, as somebody suggested earlier."
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2311.172,2316.795,"Most of those activities probably will make heat, Justice Scalia, but the thermal imager--"
2000.99-8508,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2316.795,2317.596,You missed my point.
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2328.863,2329.912,"--Well, I actually think--"
2000.99-8508,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2329.912,2332.145,"Which is what is needed to grow marijuana, I gather."
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2332.145,2353.488,"--I realize that... the point that you're making but I actually think that the physics of it are that if you use more electricity, probably a lot of it will end up as heat, but the point that the thermal imager gives you is real time information, that there actually is what appears to be anomalous heat that is coming out of this house compared to its neighbors."
2000.99-8508,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2365.325,2377.434,"May I ask this question about... would you agree that Katz would apply if the imager would tell you whether it was a marijuana operation, a hot shower or a sun lamp?"
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2377.434,2386.67,"I would, Justice Stevens, if what it is doing is, in effect, revealing the activities that are inside the house, yes."
2000.99-8508,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2386.67,2405.783,"So your distinction is that Katz would have been decided differently... or there would have been no search in Katz if they just revealed the decibels of noise as opposed to the specific conversations, and you're saying here they're revealing the quantity of heat without really telling you what the source of the heat is?"
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2405.783,2414.509,"Well, I think Katz may well have come out differently if what was being learned was nothing more than you could actually see through the booth, which is that somebody was using the booth."
2000.99-8508,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2414.509,2421.454,But your distinction is based on the particularity of what is learned rather than the sophistication of the equipment?
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2421.454,2422.454,"That's right, and I want to--"
2000.99-8508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2422.454,2423.455,Then I'm... I'm sorry.
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2423.846,2440.465,"--We're very clear about this for Justice Souter and Justice Breyer's questions, if the thermal imager functioned like an x ray machine or if it functioned to be able to reach inside the house and pull out the sounds and listen to what was going on, then we don't dispute that it would be a search."
2000.99-8508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2448.37,2494.03,"But don't you also have to agree that even on your theory, you are one step removed from the distinction that you want to draw because you're saying if the only thing that Katz revealed was the decibel level, that would have involved no Fourth Amendment interest, but here something more than what you want to characterize as the amount of heat or the amount of heat loss is being revealed because the image is revealing a pattern, it is revealing something about the physical locations in which the volume of heat loss is occurring in a measurable way, so we're learning something more than just the equivalent of decibel levels."
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2494.03,2499.516,But what we're not learning is what activities are going on or where they are going on in the house.
2000.99-8508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2499.516,2499.766,Right.
2000.99-8508,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2499.766,2502.247,It depends on how you define activities.
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2506.989,2508.211,You do learn that.
2000.99-8508,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2508.211,2510.652,There is a lot of heat generating going on in that house.
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2521.258,2535.918,"At that level of generality, coupled with inferences because you don't learn that directly from the imager at all, you don't learn directly from the imager at all that unusual amounts of heat are being generated."
2000.99-8508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2572.823,2584.04,"But you are saying, then, that the expectation of privacy depends on whether there is this one to one correlation between what is picked up and the ultimate conclusion drawn for it."
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2603.233,2605.184,"I think it's several factors, Justice Souter."
2000.99-8508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2636.258,2647.735,"But it is picking it up in a way, as Justice Breyer pointed out earlier that clearly reveals a fact about what is going on inside, and that fact was not known from utility records."
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2647.735,2651.058,It complements the utility records.
2000.99-8508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2652.648,2656.551,"Well, it's doing something more than just confirming that there is energy use going on."
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2668.119,2675.235,"--It's not showing that Justice Souter, because we don't know the composition of the insulation within the house, we don't know the configuration--"
2000.99-8508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2675.235,2692.996,"Oh, we can't draw a conclusion with absolute certainty, but if we make the assumption that the house has not been whimsically insulated so that on the east end of the roof there's lots of insulation but when they got to the west end, they had run out or said, what the heck, let's let the heat escape."
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2706.494,2716.461,"--The ultimate inference that we would like to draw, of course, does but the question is whether the data that we are collecting from which we draw that inference constitutes a search."
2000.99-8508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2722.034,2730.369,"All right, then you're saying there is no search when an electronic device fails to reveal the ultimate conclusion that is being used as evidence."
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2730.369,2737.906,"--I would hesitate to say categorically that that is so, but I think--"
2000.99-8508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2737.906,2740.387,"I would, too, but I think that's your argument."
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2740.387,2749.263,"--I think that my argument in this case depends on the nature of heat, what the imager actually detects, and the fact that we need to draw a series of inferences."
2000.99-8508,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2749.263,2753.354,This is certainly not what the prosecuting attorney told the magistrate.
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2794.964,2798.827,"Well, I think there are several critical differences, Justice Kennedy."
2000.99-8508,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2806.093,2808.594,"Well, most people talk, too, so--"
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2808.594,2819.36,"Most people talk, and when they talk within the four walls of their house, unless they have the windows open and they're screaming out the window, will make an assumption that they cannot be heard by people who are standing on the street."
2000.99-8508,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2819.36,2820.642,--I think that's somewhat of an issue.
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2821.593,2837.322,"Well, in addition, the fact that heat is generated in a structure is largely a product of the power that's going into the structure, the electrical and other utilities that are brought into the structure, and there's no secret about that information because it comes from the utility company."
2000.99-8508,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2855.254,2855.544,Same for conversation.
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2862.73,2864.21,"Well, I don't think that it's neutral."
2000.99-8508,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2864.911,2868.895,I mean... or neutral as a way of distinguishing the two cases.
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2868.895,2886.837,"--Well, there's a fairly significant difference between cases where the Court has said somebody has publicly exposed their activities to view and therefore doesn't have any reasonable expectation of privacy, and the very question of whether heat loss is a private enough fact in the first place."
2000.99-8508,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2886.837,2904.24,"Mr. Dreeben, the Ninth Circuit seemed to rely on a theory of it's like garbage thrown out, that when the homeowner has waste heat, it's somehow discarded, and there's no privacy interest left in it."
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2908.642,2909.193,I don't think that's--
2000.99-8508,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2909.193,2912.124,--that was a little hard to understand.
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2912.124,2917.148,"--Well, I don't think it's the strongest analogy, although there are cases where I think the analogy would fit."
2000.99-8508,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2922.441,2923.362,Abandonment.
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2923.362,2923.683,--Correct.
2000.99-8508,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2923.683,2930.246,It's hard to say the homeowner had abandoned this heat information.
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2930.246,2960.117,"Well, I think that there are cases in which the analogy would fit better; for example, where there is a very active ventilation system that is specifically attempting to draw the heat out of the house in order to provide a suitable climate for growing the plants that are inside, but the primary rationale that the Ninth Circuit used which is similar to the rationale that I'm articulating here is that the thermal imager doesn't pick up any intimate details or particularly private details about what is going on inside of the house."
2000.99-8508,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2960.117,2975.817,"Mr. Dreeben, what about a more general proposition, that there is no unconstitutional invasion of privacy when the police deduce from what goes on outside the house what is going on inside the house, intimate or not."
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2995.181,2998.532,"Absolutely correct, and I do think that that illustrates--"
2000.99-8508,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2998.532,3006.669,"If you accept that rationale, it seems to me you would decide Katz differently if instead of having the device on the roof of the phone booth they had it six feet away."
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3006.669,3007.788,"--No, I don't think so."
2000.99-8508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3046.273,3063.296,"Okay, but that gets back to I think to the point, that it's the process of inference necessary to reach the ultimate conclusion you want, e.g. marijuana in the house, that makes the difference between a search and a nonsearch and I guess makes the difference between reasonable expectation and nonreasonable expectation."
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3063.296,3082.838,"Certainly if what you are acquiring is information that is not itself the product of a search, as in Justice Scalia's hypothetical, the fact that you can draw inferences, including very detailed and intimate inferences about the inside of a the house doesn't convert the original observation into a search."
2000.99-8508,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3082.838,3083.409,Absolutely right.
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3094.795,3097.177,"Well, I think that the opposite is actually what holds true."
2000.99-8508,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3103.941,3104.61,That's right.
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3168.235,3179.683,"Well, but my seventh grade science classes don't help me very much with this, either, and I think what the Court's cases indicate is that it's not essentially a science question."
2000.99-8508,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3194.702,3195.914,"Right, good, that's exactly it."
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3200.416,3215.345,"--Probably very little, although so far there has been some commercialization of thermal imaging in cars that will help it detect animals in the road and so forth, and there probably will be other uses in the future."
2000.99-8508,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3235.291,3241.885,"But, you see, that distinguishes it from the garbage case, Greenwood, and as I recall, the word abandonment was not used in Greenwood."
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3271.165,3277.417,"No, but the California versus Greenwood analysis is not the only analysis that could be used for expectations of privacy."
2000.99-8508,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3317.104,3330.913,"But if the device became more sophisticated and the police could say, well, it's not just heat in general, we can tell that it's a lamp or a shower, would that be a different case?"
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3330.913,3349.315,"I think it would be a very different case, Justice Ginsburg, because then it would begin to approach an x ray device or some other device that could actually penetrate the barriers of the walls, and there the expectations that would be intruded upon would not be simply heat leaving the house but would be the very detailed activities that go on inside of the house."
2000.99-8508,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3349.315,3351.418,Let me ask you a question.
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3360.813,3374.814,"I think there's information in the search warrant that tends to show that they produce... that they consume an inordinate amount of electricity, and there is testimony that the halide lights that are used for growing marijuana generate a high amount of heat."
2000.99-8508,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3374.814,3380.266,"But they don't tell us what... they don't quantify that, say it's ten times as much the normal use or anything like that?"
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3380.266,3382.287,I don't recall whether there's a direct--
2000.99-8508,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3382.287,3404.633,"Because it does seem to me that the expectation of privacy, say with sound if you had a rock band in the attic, you'd have lesser expectation of privacy that someone can hear it than if you had a soloist or something, and here if you had heat that, you know, really was a tremendous amount of heat you might say well you really didn't expect that to be private, but we don't measure it that way."
2000.99-8508,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3404.633,3407.844,"--The thermal imager doesn't really measure it that way, either."
2000.99-8508,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3498.416,3499.316,"Thank you, Mr. Dreeben."
2000.99-8508,2,33892,kenneth_lerner,,3502.167,3503.459,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2000.99-8508,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3565.575,3566.896,"Thank you, Mr. Lerner."
