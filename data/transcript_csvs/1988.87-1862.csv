1988.87-1862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.974,"We'll hear argument next in number 87-1862, California versus ARC America Corporation."
1988.87-1862,0,42751,thomas_greene,,16.176,18.478,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1862,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,177.799,181.068,And brought solely... and brought solely under state law?
1988.87-1862,0,42751,thomas_greene,,181.068,183.185,"--And brought solely under state law, that's absolutely correct."
1988.87-1862,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,183.185,188.487,"Could the court of... could the... this... there was a settlement here, I guess?"
1988.87-1862,0,42751,thomas_greene,,188.487,189.423,That's correct.
1988.87-1862,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,189.423,190.773,"So, there wasn't a judgment?"
1988.87-1862,0,42751,thomas_greene,,190.773,192.641,That's also correct.
1988.87-1862,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,192.641,204.183,"If the judgment... if it had gone to trial and the judgment had been entered under federal law as well as under state law, what then, about downstream recovery?"
1988.87-1862,0,42751,thomas_greene,,204.183,214.372,"Well, you'd have the downstream purchaser's claim under the laws of a separate sovereign, so you would have them both claiming under... on the basis of the distinct laws upon which they--"
1988.87-1862,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,214.372,215.741,"So, there could be recovery in that case?"
1988.87-1862,0,42751,thomas_greene,,215.741,216.391,--Absolutely.
1988.87-1862,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,216.391,217.574,This case--
1988.87-1862,0,42751,thomas_greene,,226.362,227.012,Correct.
1988.87-1862,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,227.012,234.702,You could still have a state claim for indirect purchaser damages... or did that opinion--
1988.87-1862,0,42751,thomas_greene,,234.702,235.185,If--
1988.87-1862,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,235.185,237.17,--purport to preempt that as well.
1988.87-1862,0,42751,thomas_greene,,237.17,251.33,"--Well, the situation with respect in California, the effect of the Ninth Circuit decision is to be essentially a decision which has the effect of a decision of a sister state, so it does not have precedential force within the state of California."
1988.87-1862,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,259.967,262.452,"Mr. Greene, you're relying on the separate sovereign theory."
1988.87-1862,0,42751,thomas_greene,,284.217,285.934,There would be no preemption of that.
1988.87-1862,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,312.884,313.486,"Well, it wouldn't--"
1988.87-1862,0,42751,thomas_greene,,313.486,315.053,"If the state were to modify its law, it might be possible."
1988.87-1862,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,315.053,321.407,"--It wouldn't in this case, but if the state supreme court said we don't care whether you recovered under the laws of a separate sovereign or not."
1988.87-1862,0,42751,thomas_greene,,326.228,327.178,I think that is absolutely right.
1988.87-1862,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,348.909,365.503,"In this case or in any case, if there's a limited amount of funds because, say, the defendant is judgment proof beyond a certain point, do the direct purchasers have first claim under federal law?"
1988.87-1862,0,42751,thomas_greene,,365.503,372.073,--I think that's more properly a matter that should be assessed under probably the bankruptcy laws of the United States.
1988.87-1862,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,405.93,419.673,"If it were true that indirect purchasers recover, I suppose you could argue in a case where the defendant has limited assets that that would discourage federal suits by a direct purchaser?"
1988.87-1862,0,42751,thomas_greene,,419.673,427.594,We would think that that situation is so unlikely that it really should not be a basis for your decision.
1988.87-1862,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,452.661,457.446,"I must say I... it seems to me that... well, let's just do it on a state-by-state level."
1988.87-1862,0,42751,thomas_greene,,490.267,490.869,Um-hum.
1988.87-1862,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,490.869,500.975,But I don't know why when... when you apply that same... that same intent at the federal level it isn't the case that the federal law just bumps the state law.
1988.87-1862,0,42751,thomas_greene,,518.853,532.779,"Well, I think that the situation post-Illinois Brick is that our state statutes provide for recoveries only if you are injured, in fact, and to basically the extent of your injuries in fact."
1988.87-1862,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,569.352,573.423,"Well, we didn't say... that's not the theory of our decision in Illinois Brick."
1988.87-1862,0,42751,thomas_greene,,591.467,593.836,"Well, I think that's... that's correct, but you also do not--"
1988.87-1862,1,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1048.106,1051.075,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1862,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1169.502,1175.639,Are you suggesting that a state could provide an additional remedy for violation of the Clayton Act?
1988.87-1862,1,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1175.639,1176.491,"I think so, Your honor."
1988.87-1862,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1178.141,1184.745,"Well, you have to... the case would have to go forward in the federal court."
1988.87-1862,1,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1184.745,1194.453,"--I don't know of anything, Your Honor, that would prevent a state from saying that for price fixing we want the measure of recovery under state law to be four fold damages."
1988.87-1862,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1195.07,1203.642,"Now, you're talking about... I just said that... the action in the federal court is solely under federal law, federal antitrust law."
1988.87-1862,1,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1203.642,1204.258,--All right.
1988.87-1862,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1204.258,1208.36,"And so then the question of remedy comes up, and the--"
1988.87-1862,1,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1208.36,1210.646,The states can't govern the remedy for the federal conduct.
1988.87-1862,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1211.498,1211.831,--All right.
1988.87-1862,1,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1211.831,1212.464,But the states can--
1988.87-1862,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1212.464,1215.999,"So... so, you're really talking about a recovery under the state antitrust law."
1988.87-1862,1,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1215.999,1217.332,--That's correct.
1988.87-1862,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1537.257,1541.625,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court:"
1988.87-1862,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1660.886,1665.856,"Well, Illinois Brick didn't deal with state law, did it?"
1988.87-1862,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1665.856,1667.392,"No, it dealt with federal law."
1988.87-1862,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1667.975,1670.844,"Well, I don't know how there can be a conflict."
1988.87-1862,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1670.844,1671.977,--The Illinois--
1988.87-1862,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1671.977,1676.081,"As far as overruling, you can't overrule a case that had nothing to do with an issue."
1988.87-1862,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1676.081,1689.138,--The Court... the states have indicated and the California court has described the legislature's intent in California as enacting the minority opinion or the dissenting opinion in Illinois Brick.
1988.87-1862,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1689.821,1690.59,"Now, I think they did."
1988.87-1862,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1693.625,1708.302,"--Illinois Brick, I submit, respectfully, Justice White, has to do with what mechanisms and devices may affect adversely the effectiveness and the enforceability of the federal antitrust laws."
1988.87-1862,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1714.956,1728.53,"And I take it your position would be the same if this suit had been brought in the state court and... and obviously there couldn't express... couldn't allege any federal antitrust claim, just solely a state law antitrust recovery in that case?"
1988.87-1862,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1728.53,1729.982,"Yes, our position would be the same."
1988.87-1862,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1790.287,1797.443,"Mr. Olson, I would find it helpful if sometime in your argument you could lay out kind of specific facts that show a conflict."
1988.87-1862,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1799.61,1810.1,We will do that because it's important to address the specific ways in which the state statutes affect in this case and generally the federal antitrust remedy.
1988.87-1862,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1907.581,1919.972,"What my question was directed to... and don't feel bound to get to it... is give us an example of the kinds of recovery, so many dollars for this, so many dollars for that, that would show the conflict."
1988.87-1862,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1919.972,1926.31,"--Well, in this case, specifically, there is an express amount of money, based upon settlements."
1988.87-1862,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1945.623,1947.325,"So, you don't represent a defendant."
1988.87-1862,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1949.241,1949.775,That's correct.
1988.87-1862,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1999.941,2006.078,"Well, I suppose... I suppose if the settlement had been clear or the settlements... were there more than one?"
1988.87-1862,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2006.078,2007.964,"Yes, there were seven, I believe."
1988.87-1862,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2007.964,2013.183,"If the settlements had been clear that they were only settling the federal law issue, why--"
1988.87-1862,2,43165,theodore_b_olson,,2013.183,2017.485,"Well, I submit, Justice White, that that is... it's a very interesting point."
1988.87-1862,3,42751,thomas_greene,,3258.506,3259.573,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.87-1862,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3263.308,3266.926,The case is submitted.
