2014.14-86,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.38,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 14-86, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie and Fitch Stores. Mr. Gershengorn."
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,9.38,33.52,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Tenth Circuit imposed two requirements on religious accommodation claims that eliminated liability for Respondent's refusal to accommodate Ms. Elauf here: First, that the applicant herself verbally requested the accommodation; and second, that the employer know, rather than just correctly understand, the need for an accommodation. Neither required --"
2014.14-86,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,33.52,34.08,I don't understand.
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,38.125,40.95,"Your Honor, the testimony -- it -- it's a fair question."
2014.14-86,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,74.19,74.56,"Well, suppose --"
2014.14-86,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,74.56,76.34,Does that subjective -- I'm sorry.
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,96.72,100.72,"That's right, Your Honor. And we think that's what makes this a particularly straightforward case."
2014.14-86,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,118.93,132.48,"But getting back to Justice Scalia's question, I think there's some substantial force to your argument that the employee doesn't have to mention this first. But why -- why do we -- import the term understand instead of know."
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,142.355,147.11,"Your Honor, I -- with respect to -- it's our position it's the Tenth Circuit that's made it confusing."
2014.14-86,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,149.43,153.87,Your position -- your statement that you opened with is -- is that he must understand.
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,159.495,179.34,"So the answer, Your Honor, is we think that there is sufficient knowledge, notice, when somebody understands that -- when somebody assumes that a practice is religious and then acts upon it, that that is sufficient. What the Tenth Circuit said was that is not sufficient, that what is needed is something more approaching certainty."
2014.14-86,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,179.61,193.015,"Well, Mr. Gershengorn, I mean, so that does raise the question if yours is less than certainty, how much less than certainty is it? I mean, suppose I'm an employer, and I say, you know, I don't honestly know, I think."
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,196.175,216.99,"So, Your Honor, I think that if I could explain how these cases come up, I think it will -- the best way to answer your -- it would be the best way to answer your question. The answer is, in a situation like this in which it's an applicant applying for a -- a position, and the employer suspects, thinks, two-thirds, that there's a religious problem -- the -- a religious conflict, the employer has two options."
2014.14-86,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,249.74,251.075,Is that true even if it's --
2014.14-86,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,251.075,251.48,No.
2014.14-86,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,252.41,270.96,"Is that true even if it's under 50 percent? In other words, say that employer says, you know, I really don't know, but I think there's, like, a 50/50 chance or even a 40 percent chance that this person has a religious -- that -- has religious -- that this practice is religious."
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,278.155,282.23,"So I think, Your Honor, that that's what they cannot do."
2014.14-86,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,283.29,286.52,So it doesn't really depend on what the percentage chance is.
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,286.52,287.17,So I think --
2014.14-86,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,287.17,300.83,"It could be certain, it could be less than certain, it could be a lot less than certain, as long as the employer says there's some chance, and I'm not going to hire, or promote, or fire, or whatever, because of that chance."
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,300.83,311.155,"So, Your Honor, I -- I would like to try to separate out two different -- two different situations that a -- could arise, only one of which we think arises commonly."
2014.14-86,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,353.17,377.18,I'm not sure I understand why you're fighting Justice Kagan's question. Isn't the issue the reason that they acted? They refused to hire someone because they had a 1 percent belief that they had a religious -- pardon the pun -- a religious belief that they wouldn't accommodate?
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,377.18,383.77,"So, Your Honor, I don't intend to fight Justice Kagan's hypothetical, and on the facts of this case, I think it's really quite easy."
2014.14-86,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,394.21,396.37,You -- you're -- you're confusing me enormously.
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,396.37,396.64,Okay.
2014.14-86,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,396.64,399.37,Would you tell me what it is you want.
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,399.37,400.09,I want --
2014.14-86,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,400.09,402.23,You just say he understands.
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,413.76,428.22,"So, Your Honor, the test that the courts of appeals have adopted for more than two decades, which is the test that we ask this Court to adopt, is that the employer needs sufficient information from any source about the employee -- about the applicant's religious needs --"
2014.14-86,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,428.22,428.84,That --
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,428.84,432.31,-- to permit the employer to understand the existence of a conflict.
2014.14-86,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,432.31,432.84,To understand --
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,432.84,434.93,That's the test that the courts of appeals have been --
2014.14-86,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,434.93,435.31,I don't care --
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,435.31,435.77,-- for two decades.
2014.14-86,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,435.77,436.3,-- what they've used.
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,437.845,457.22,"But, Your Honor, the reason why I think it makes sense in this case is because if it's sufficient knowledge for you to actually act upon it -- remember, if they -- if -- the critical point here for us is if they had not -- if the employer had not assumed that this was religious, had not believed it, they would have hired her."
2014.14-86,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,461.45,463.68,"Mr. Gershengorn, didn't --"
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,463.68,463.91,What --
2014.14-86,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,463.91,485.825,"-- she -- the person -- the first-line hire, person responsible for hiring, didn't she say to the district manager, I think she's wearing this headscarf for religious reasons, and that's why I'm checking it out with you."
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,495.325,497.12,"That's right, Your Honor."
2014.14-86,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,497.12,511.32,So -- so it seems that the -- the district manager is -- his point of view is headscarfs are out.
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,519.35,524.91,"I think that's right, Your Honor, and that's exactly what Congress said when it enacted these provisions."
2014.14-86,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,524.91,525.37,"No, it didn't."
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,525.37,526.33,They didn't want to happen --
2014.14-86,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,526.33,528.17,There is no law against such a rule.
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,549.92,551.23,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2014.14-86,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,551.23,553.57,We don't allow our employees to wear headscarfs.
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,555.05,556.05,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2014.14-86,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,556.745,564.23,So the mere fact that this -- this supervisor said that doesn't approve a violation by the employer.
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,564.23,565.86,"Well, I don't agree with that, Your Honor."
2014.14-86,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,582.21,585.34,"That's right, but that supervisor did not have that knowledge."
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,585.34,587.04,"Oh, no, Your Honor. That's not correct."
2014.14-86,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,623.32,643.5,"Well, your -- your solution that you suggested is that if there's some doubt the employer should begin a dialogue, I think is what you -- but I think that may promote stereotypes to a far greater degree than what you're objecting to. Let's say you have someone of Middle Eastern appearance who shows up for the interview with a beard. And the employer, like Abercrombie and Fitch, they don't like beards."
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,662.97,666.055,"So, Your Honor, I have two responses that I'd like to say."
2014.14-86,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,709.12,713.95,"Well, is it reasonable for an employer to say, look, I don't want to buy into some problem with a guy who has a beard."
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,724.555,753.49,"So, Your Honor, that's the hard question that I think Justice Kagan was asking, and I do think that's a trickier question. If your policy is not I have a work rule that I'm concerned you won't be able to comply with in the future, then I think, for all the reasons I've said thus far, it's all said. If the question is when someone comes to my office with a beard and I just think they're -- it's unkempt, I don't like it, I'm not going to hire them regardless of whether they could comply, I think that's the situation that presents this, is it one-third, is it two-thirds."
2014.14-86,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,761.68,785.83,"You could avoid those hard questions, whether it's understand, believe, suspect, by adopting the rule that the court of appeals adopted here; and that is, if you want to sue me for denying you a job for a religious reason, the burden is on you to say, I'm wearing the headscarf for a religious reason, or I'm wearing the beard for a religious reason. That -- that avoids all problems."
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,790.39,790.92,"So, Your Honor --"
2014.14-86,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,790.92,796.71,Did the employer tell her -- did the employer tell her that it had this Look Policy --
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,796.71,797.18,And so that --
2014.14-86,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,797.18,804.025,-- that a headscarf would violate? How could she ask for something when she didn't know the employer had such a rule?
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,804.025,808.145,"That's exactly the problem, Justice Ginsburg and Justice Scalia, in response to your question."
2014.14-86,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,828.59,829.42,"Well, wait a minute."
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,837.76,839.93,"But -- but actually, Justice Kennedy, that --"
2014.14-86,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,839.93,841.8,"Again, we're -- we're not factfinders here."
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,841.8,842.26,"No, I understand."
2014.14-86,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,894.47,894.7,To get --
2014.14-86,0,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,894.7,895.025,But --
2014.14-86,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1529.469,1548.505,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court; The premise of the EEOC's argument today, as I understand it, is that Abercrombie acted because of the religious basis for Ms. Elauf's headscarf. That is not correct as a factual matter; and the EEOC's theory, in its brief, does not depend on any such assumption."
2014.14-86,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1564.82,1570.52,They don't have to offer a religious accommodation if they have a reasonable basis not to.
2014.14-86,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1577.245,1589.97,"That -- that's true, they always have the undue burden defense; but absent an undue burden, they must accommodate and they must depart from a religion-neutral policy based on a mere suspicion of a possible conflict."
2014.14-86,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1589.97,1590.37,No.
2014.14-86,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1594.79,1595.27,"Well, I --"
2014.14-86,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1595.27,1598.015,"It's very simple, because you're mischaracterizing it."
2014.14-86,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1625.96,1651.2,"Justice Sotomayor, as -- as an initial matter, their theory in their brief does not depend on any sort of assumption about whether the applicant would later be able to comply with the work rule or not. Under the theory expressed in their brief, even if an employer like Abercrombie had a policy in which the Look Policy applied at the interview, you are being assessed at the interview based on your compliance with our dress --"
2014.14-86,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1651.2,1657.275,"Do you think that the -- do you think that the employee has to say, I am dressed the way I am for a religious reason?"
2014.14-86,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1657.275,1659.69,Not necessarily.
2014.14-86,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1670.58,1670.73,All right.
2014.14-86,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1679.68,1701.39,"So the first is a Sikh man wearing a turban, the second is a Hasidic man wearing a hat, the third is a Muslim woman wearing a hijab, the fourth is a Catholic nun in a habit. Now, do you think the employer has to -- that those people have to say, we just want to tell you, we're dressed this way for a religious reason."
2014.14-86,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1704.24,1713.4,"First of all, Your Honor, one aspect of your hypothetical is not a joke; and that is, that many of these interviews at Abercrombie are, in fact, group interviews."
2014.14-86,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1714.68,1717.015,Are the what? Group?
2014.14-86,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1717.015,1762.2,"Group -- group interviews where there are mul- -- multiple applicants at a time. And so I think the reality is, it's a lot more difficult than the government imagines to start having these individualized dialogues. But going to your point about those sorts of religious outfits, one can certainly imagine cases in which it is more obvious than others that a particular -- a particular garb is likely worn for religious purposes. However, I would direct the Court, if I could, to Joint Appendix 130 and 131, which contain pictures of the sort of headscarf that Ms. Elauf was actually wearing in this case. Those sorts of situations where it's far more ambiguous whether a -- whether a particular outward symbol is religious in nature or not will be far more common."
2014.14-86,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1762.2,1779.185,"Well, that can be the case, but I want to know the answer to the question whether the employee has to say, I'm wearing this for a religious reason, or whether you're willing to admit that there are at least some circumstances in which the employer is charged with that knowledge based on what the employer observes."
2014.14-86,1,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1779.185,1780.25,"No, Your Honor."
2014.14-86,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1789.45,1791.82,"Actually, I didn't think that was the question."
2014.14-86,2,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,1862.99,1872.5,"Justice Breyer, I think what you've just described is a rule for all cases and it's one that is entirely unadministrable for courts, employers, and applicants alike."
2014.14-86,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1872.5,1889.7,"It is -- it is unadministrable to say that if the employer believes, thinks, this woman is religious and needs an accommodation and he's right, well, do something unless you have an excuse. What -- why is that unadministrable?"
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1889.7,1898.02,"Your Honor, I believe that's unadministrable because the EEOC does not explain what level of certainty is required for a belief versus suspecting --"
2014.14-86,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1898.02,1899.95,"Oh no, you have to prove. This -- this is correct."
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1926.505,1935.68,"I don't think this is like any other case, because you're dealing with -- you're dealing with something -- religious belief, which is inherently personal to the individual."
2014.14-86,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1946.81,1947.8,This is -- this is such --
2014.14-86,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1947.8,1961.195,"Now, Mr. Dvoretzky, suppose an employer just doesn't want to hire any Jews, and somebody walks in and his name is Mel Goldberg, and he looks kind of Jewish and the employer doesn't know he's Jewish."
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1973.31,1976.06,That is a disparate treatment violation of Title VII.
2014.14-86,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1976.39,1980.585,"That has got to be against the law, right? It doesn't matter whether the employer -- (Laughter.)"
2014.14-86,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1980.585,1985.38,"It doesn't matter whether the employer knows it to an absolute certainty, right?"
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,1985.38,1990.715,"Absolutely, because in that situation, because what's relevant is the employer's intent."
2014.14-86,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2004.22,2033.7,"Except in Title VII, you would be right if all that Title VII did was prevent religious discrimination, but it makes a religious practice, a refusal to accommodate a religious practice is itself a violation of Title VII. So we have -- it's -- and that was done deliberately, was it not, so that religious practices would have to be accommodated."
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2033.7,2036.98,"Yes, Your Honor, and two points in response to that, if I may."
2014.14-86,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2052.86,2071.64,"But the thing about my question was, is that what this statute does is to say that if you are, in fact, wearing a headscarf for religious reasons, that your neutral policy really doesn't matter, it only matters if you -- if there's an undue burden and you really can't make an accommodation, but except for that, it really doesn't matter."
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2089.095,2102.455,"Your Honor, on -- on that logic, it also would make no difference if the employer had absolutely no idea that the headscarf was worn for religious reasons, because it would still be a religious headscarf and a religious practice."
2014.14-86,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2122.97,2125.295,That's if the employee knows the rule.
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2165.82,2170.85,"Justice Ginsburg, I respectfully disagree with that characterization of what went on here."
2014.14-86,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2180.26,2184.46,Did she testify that she knew they had a dress code? I was not aware of that.
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2184.46,2190.895,"She -- she testified that she knew that she would have to wear Abercrombie style clothes, that's Joint Appendix 23."
2014.14-86,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2194.0,2194.34,But she did.
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2198.47,2198.91,She did.

2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2220.14,2222.215,It -- but --
2014.14-86,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2222.215,2240.4,"-- why would she suspect that if she is qualified and has the personality they're looking for, and is dressed appropriately, that this company would fail to hire her because they refused to accommodate her religious belief."
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2240.4,2248.45,"Justice Sotomayor, she asked a friend who in turn asked another Abercrombie employee, who was not involved in the hiring process."
2014.14-86,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2249.99,2251.505,"No, I think it was a store manager."
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2251.505,2255.08,But a store manager who was not involved in this hiring process.
2014.14-86,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2264.56,2266.51,She did not mention the headscarf?
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2266.51,2268.43,Did not mention the headscarf.
2014.14-86,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2274.41,2276.44,Show me where in the script.
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2283.87,2297.795,"If you look at Joint Appendix 33 and Joint Appendix 100 to 101, that's Cooke's testimony, that she read a summary of the Look Policy and gave Ms. Elauf the opportunity to ask any questions."
2014.14-86,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2298.18,2302.19,"Okay, but there was no mention of a headscarf in what she read."
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2302.19,2304.67,It did not specifically mention the headscarf.
2014.14-86,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2315.92,2329.92,"So let's say that somebody comes in for an interview and this person is -- has the look, if you wanted to, you know, draw the person who has the look, this is the person who has the look, looks just like this mythical preppy or -- (Laughter.)"
2014.14-86,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2329.92,2332.59,-- somebody who came off the beach in California.
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2349.895,2360.965,I don't think Abercrombie needs to make that assumption about what the person will do later in order to make a judgment based on the person's appearance at the interview.
2014.14-86,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2392.32,2393.59,Or a yamulke.
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2403.215,2411.86,"That's right, and what that shows is that religion is not the basis for the action here, rather, Abercrombie at most was completely indifferent to --"
2014.14-86,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2411.86,2413.89,"No, but that doesn't work in a case like this."
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2428.21,2436.83,"Mr. Chief Justice, for purposes of an intentional discrimination claim, it does matter that you would treat everybody the same, and that's the theory the EEOC is pursuing here."
2014.14-86,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2436.83,2443.615,"No, no, no, but as I understand it, it's intentional discrimination because you failed to accommodate."
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2443.615,2449.98,And I would submit that that is an incomprehensible understanding of what intentional discrimination means.
2014.14-86,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2451.155,2456.78,"Again, how we get into all that, if you want to add something to it, it seems we're in a kind of minutia."
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2533.15,2543.01,"Because, Your Honor, in this particular context, having a standard like correct belief or suspecting a possible conflict will inevitably lead employers --"
2014.14-86,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2543.01,2545.18,"I'm with you with ""suspect."""
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2545.18,2546.98,That is -- suspect --
2014.14-86,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2546.98,2556.805,"I'm with you only where they correctly believe that, dah, dah, dah, or understand dah, dah, dah, or no."
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2564.909,2581.17,"The -- the reason they're not -- Justice Breyer, the reason that they're not good enough is that there is no way that the employer can know about a religious practice unless it either -- unless it is -- that information is traceable to the employee."
2014.14-86,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2590.9,2613.305,"Well, isn't that -- isn't that what Ms. Cooke says she did? She said she saw her in a scarf and that she assumed that it was worn because of religious beliefs, so she acted on a stereotype that some, I guess, if you wear a black scarf, it's because of a religious belief."
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2613.305,2617.29,"Your Honor, I don't believe that she acted on that stereotype."
2014.14-86,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2624.465,2635.47,"No, he hired her because -- didn't hire her because, under the Look Policy, he believed you could not accommodate that religious belief."
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2635.47,2638.0,I think the --
2014.14-86,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2638.0,2640.38,Or that religious practice.
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2640.38,2649.135,"I think the reason that he didn't hire her, Joint Appendix 134, is that she simply was not compliant with the Look Policy."
2014.14-86,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2649.135,2649.49,Okay.
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2659.08,2659.38,"Well, I --"
2014.14-86,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2659.38,2661.94,It's pretty hard to think of a case where it wouldn't be.
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2670.09,2678.53,The case that the government gives as an example is one in which an employer learned of an applicant's religious practice from the employer's -- from the applicant's reference who was -- the applicant's --
2014.14-86,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2678.53,2680.71,And the applicant's reference didn't know the applicant?
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2680.71,2682.49,The applicant's reference did know the applicant?
2014.14-86,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2682.49,2682.69,Okay.
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2684.07,2687.275,And so that is traceable to the -- to the applicant.
2014.14-86,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2688.98,2715.885,"What's the difference in your -- I mean, I'm a little -- I'm still very confused. You don't think that there could ever be discrimination based on a general neutral policy, because what does it matter if she told him that this was because of religious belief? If he's only firing her or not hiring her because of the Look Policy, then he hasn't discriminated."
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2715.885,2716.68,"No, Your Honor."
2014.14-86,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2726.73,2729.035,I am so totally confused.
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2737.225,2738.07,That's right.
2014.14-86,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2756.02,2757.185,We've already gone through this.
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2800.875,2802.4,That -- that's right.
2014.14-86,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2817.99,2828.305,"If it's going to be a requirement for the job, then doesn't the employer have an obligation to tell the employee what the job requirements are?"
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2828.305,2830.52,"No, Your Honor, not under Title VII."
2014.14-86,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2842.77,2847.125,This is what I don't understand about your position with respect to this particular case.
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2855.54,2858.62,The Look Policy itself does not apply at the interview.
2014.14-86,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2859.36,2872.225,So what -- on -- there would be no reason for not hiring the individual involved here unless you assumed that she was going to wear a scarf every day.
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2897.785,2901.97,"Justice Alito, that has not been the EEOC's theory of this case."
2014.14-86,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2923.37,2934.65,"Why would they ask anything about nonreligious? Title VII doesn't require accommodating baseball caps, but it does require accommodating to religious practices."
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2947.635,2957.52,"The -- the premise of Justice Alito's question, as I understood it, is that Abercrombie only didn't hire this person because the headscarf was religious."
2014.14-86,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2969.36,2977.4,So why would that be so when you just said they don't require people at the interview stage to conform to the Look Policy?
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2977.4,2980.81,"On its face, the Look Policy itself does not require that."
2014.14-86,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2985.26,2989.295,You were about to tell us what the EEOC's theory of the case was.
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,2996.035,3009.395,I think their theory of the case was that there was a duty to accommodate a religious practice anytime an employer has a correct understanding or a suspicion of that practice.
2014.14-86,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3062.61,3065.735,So what's the difference between that and having no --
2014.14-86,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3065.735,3067.61,I don't understand what you were about to say.
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3069.42,3090.795,"The only way that employers can protect themselves under the EEOC's approach is by training their managers to stereotype about possible religious beliefs because a judge or jury might later find that Abercrombie or an employer correctly understood, or must have correctly understood, under an objective test which they don't disclaim in their amici briefs."
2014.14-86,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3090.795,3114.755,"But you're essentially saying that the problem with the rule is that it requires Abercrombie to engage in what might be thought of as an awkward conversation, to ask some questions. Now, people can disagree about whether one can ask those questions in a way that's awkward at all, but you're saying we should structure the whole legal system to make sure that there is no possibility of that awkward conversation ever taking place."
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3144.83,3148.065,"Justice Kagan, the problem is not having awkward conversations."
2014.14-86,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3157.5,3164.5,They -- Title VII requires them to treat people who have religious practice differently.
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3169.17,3177.94,But Title VII requires that only after -- as the EEOC has said for 40 years -- only after the employee or applicant places religion on the table.
2014.14-86,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3191.94,3192.03,Okay.
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3241.12,3241.73,That's right.
2014.14-86,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3241.73,3241.86,Okay.
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3241.86,3250.02,"And even asking the neutral-sounding sort of question, can you comply with the work rule, even that, is treating applicants differently based on --"
2014.14-86,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3250.02,3251.975,"Well, that isn't the end of the world, perhaps."
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3262.33,3264.04,That -- that is essence of it.
2014.14-86,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3281.71,3291.045,"Frankly, this is such an unusual case because it's very rare that you have an interviewer like Ms. Cooke who's honest."
2014.14-86,3,41249,shay_dvoretzky,,3318.91,3330.51,"Your Honor, I think many, if not almost all Title VII cases do originate without any sort of admission by the employer about what the reason was for not hiring the individual."
2014.14-86,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3339.925,3343.72,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gershengorn, you have five minutes left."
2014.14-86,4,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3343.72,3356.65,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice: I'd like to make just two quick factual points to clear up what I see to be some confusion in the record. First of all, there was some discussion about whether, in fact, you needed to comply with the Look Policy."
2014.14-86,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3411.74,3415.495,Do you want to say a word about what I called his administrative argument?
2014.14-86,4,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3415.495,3422.495,"So, Your Honor, I would. I think the administrative argument actually cuts in our sense -- in our favor in a couple of ways."
2014.14-86,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3478.8,3480.38,"That doesn't prevent a lawsuit, of course."
2014.14-86,4,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3480.52,3481.68,"It doesn't, Your Honor, but --"
2014.14-86,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3481.68,3484.55,"She can sue and then find out in the -- in the course of discovery, right?"
2014.14-86,4,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3484.55,3486.33,"They certainly could, but --"
2014.14-86,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3486.33,3487.955,"And it happens often, doesn't it?"
2014.14-86,4,28556,ian_h_gershengorn,,3487.955,3489.52,"No, Your Honor, I'm not sure that it does."
2014.14-86,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3532.48,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
