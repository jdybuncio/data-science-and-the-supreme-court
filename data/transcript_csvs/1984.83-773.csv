1984.83-773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.987,We'll hear arguments next in Oregon v. Elstad.
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,9.872,20.312,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case requires close analysis of an extraordinary conclusion of a lower court."
1984.83-773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,192.125,202.147,"Wouldn't it be more accurate, Mr. Attorney General, perhaps to say there was no cat let out of the bag, because it was not a full confession, was it?"
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,202.147,203.381,It was not a full confession.
1984.83-773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,204.466,206.635,It was an acknowledgment of presence.
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,206.635,207.535,--That is correct.
1984.83-773,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,227.298,231.0,What do you think the Oregon Court of Appeals meant when it used the phrase
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,233.618,237.154,--We think that it simply misapplied the analysis that should apply to these cases.
1984.83-773,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,306.232,313.237,"General Frohnmayer, may I ask about the voluntariness of the confession after the Miranda warnings were given?"
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,318.439,319.224,That is correct.
1984.83-773,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,319.224,325.478,"Now, is there anything to indicate that he knew that the first statement would be inadmissible if it were offered in trial?"
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,325.478,332.049,"There's nothing to show that he knew that the first amendment bore on anything he was to... that the first admission bore on anything that he would say, Justice Stevens."
1984.83-773,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,332.049,337.353,"In order for it to be voluntary, I suppose he ought to have the same degree of knowledge as if he had the advice of counsel."
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,338.736,339.905,Not necessarily.
1984.83-773,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,341.005,348.493,"I suppose counsel would have told him, if he had counsel available, that that first confession is not admissible and now you decide whether you want to confess or not."
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,349.51,349.81,--No.
1984.83-773,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,369.824,378.78,"Do you think his second confession would be equally voluntary, whether or not he knew that the first confession of first inculpatory statement would be inadmissible?"
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,378.78,379.613,"--Yes, we do."
1984.83-773,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,379.613,380.463,You do?
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,386.101,387.452,We'd say that it could be voluntary.
1984.83-773,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,401.093,414.853,"Well, at trial, didn't you claim that there was no custody at the time of the first statement?"
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,418.238,418.855,"No, it was not."
1984.83-773,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,419.707,421.774,So you conceded the Miranda violation from the outset?
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,421.774,430.545,"--Well, the Miranda... I don't know that it was conceded so much because the prosecution never sought to admit the first statement, Justice White."
1984.83-773,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,433.747,444.455,"My question is, you wouldn't have advised him that the first statement was inadmissible because it may have been admissible if there was no custody."
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,444.455,447.991,"--Well, clearly, if there was no custody, there would have been no Miranda violation."
1984.83-773,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,461.417,465.803,But we have to proceed on the basis that there was a Miranda violation in the first instance here.
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,465.803,469.255,--I believe that that's the state of the record to which we're bound at this point.
1984.83-773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,469.255,473.474,"It may not be important or significant in any way, but isn't there another factor here?"
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,479.978,480.845,Yes.
1984.83-773,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,535.382,542.952,"I gather that the expression ""cat out of the bag"" is not original with the Court of Appeals to argue?"
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,542.952,543.669,No.
1984.83-773,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,543.669,568.103,"Indeed, you're familiar, I guess, with our Darwin decision back in 391 where Justice Harlan, if he didn't actually use the expression, did say... as I recall it in similar circumstances... that the problem with the second confession is that because of what he'd said the first time, the accused might think that he had little to lose by repetition."
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,590.183,590.483,Yes.
1984.83-773,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,600.74,601.074,Yes.
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,603.276,613.965,"Interestingly enough, in a contest, it is always Bayer that is cited for the proposition, but what is seldom realized is that the second... the ultimate confession was found admissible in the Bayer case."
1984.83-773,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,613.965,616.934,"Well, wasn't what Justice Harlan said in Darwin?"
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,618.452,619.902,"Yes, but it doesn't control this case."
1984.83-773,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,765.096,787.379,"But it's still, too, isn't it, as Justice Stevens suggested to you earlier, that the accused might think... he wouldn't know that his first statement was going to be... was not admissible for failure to give Miranda violations, and he went ahead and repeated it the second time because he thought he had nothing to lose?"
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,787.379,795.752,"Well, it is always a possibility that a defendant's confession can be induced by things which he either knows or may believe that the police know about him."
1984.83-773,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,825.454,842.297,"Well, I guess the McMann case has some bearing on this discussion, does it not, where even a misunderstanding on the part of the defendant as to his initial confession did not invalidate his subsequent guilty plea?"
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,842.297,842.714,Yes.
1984.83-773,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,894.331,902.187,What if there were a causal connection between the second statement and the first unwarned statement?
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,904.371,913.227,"--Our position as to the conclusion of the case would be the same, for this reason: that in fruit of the poisonous tree cases, this Court has always said that there is a two-part analysis."
1984.83-773,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,958.941,963.576,"Well, what would you say if the first statement was coerced?"
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,966.527,968.979,"Oh, if the first statement were coerced, that would raise a very different problem."
1984.83-773,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,969.479,971.581,Why would it in terms of your analysis?
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,971.581,974.383,--Because that would raise a question as to whether the Miranda.
1984.83-773,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,974.383,986.525,"There would only be causation... you might just that, arguably, there was causation then; that the first... the threat of coercion carried over to the second statement."
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,986.525,1000.601,"Yes, but that's squarely within the thrust of the Westover case, the companion case to Miranda, where the waiver of the Miranda warning is invalid because the defendant... the effects of the first confession had not warn off before the second."
1984.83-773,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1006.421,1013.925,"Well, what if the second confession were voluntary, but the first is coerced Do you... what action should be taken?"
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1017.229,1019.662,"--It could be both, Justice O'Connor, but we take--"
1984.83-773,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1019.662,1024.883,What are you going to do with Lyons v. Oklahoma?
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1024.883,1028.168,"--Lyons v. Oklahoma is... well, we believe--"
1984.83-773,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1028.168,1037.458,"A coerced confession, and a voluntary one followed, and the voluntary one was held perfectly valid by this Court."
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1037.458,1048.748,"--But the Lyons case, the Bayer case, and the Westover case, the companion case to Miranda, are not successive statement cases in the sense that we are dealing with here."
1984.83-773,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1052.283,1068.245,"Why wouldn't you say that even if the first statement is coerced, the second one is admissible if you can honestly find it to be voluntary; and hence, that the prior coercion didn't carry over and induce the later--"
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1068.245,1071.281,"--I think that one can say that, and I think that that's the analysis--"
1984.83-773,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1071.281,1079.72,"--It wouldn't be under your analysis, which is voluntariness of the second statement is crucial to your analysis."
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1079.72,1082.089,"--Voluntariness of the second... yes, because that's the only one that's admitted."
1984.83-773,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1082.089,1085.706,"As long as that's true, it shouldn't make any difference whether the first one is coerced."
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1085.706,1100.05,"Well, that may point up perhaps a slight difference between the position taken by the State of Oregon and that taken by the United States in this case, which is the position just advanced as a hypothetical by yourself, Justice White."
1984.83-773,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1126.533,1133.854,"In the Lyons case, the facts in there were about as bad as you can get."
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1152.749,1154.168,"I agree with that, Justice Marshall, and--"
1984.83-773,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1154.168,1156.887,And they admitted the second confession.
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1156.887,1166.909,"--Our view is that in light of the Westover case, decided subsequently to Lyons, that it's questionable whether this Court would stand for that at any time."
1984.83-773,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1197.297,1221.012,"Mr. Attorney General, getting back just one second to the ""cat out of the bag"" analysis, I take it it's consequences could have been avoided here, at least before they gave him the second Miranda warnings, had said to him, look, forget what we said this morning; whatever you said this morning will not be admitted against... and then they gave him warnings, then he went on and made the statement."
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1228.983,1236.422,"Well, it might have cured it at the peril, perhaps, of creating a mischief worse than that gratuitous piece of police legal advice might have created."
1984.83-773,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1236.422,1249.58,"My next question was going to be, I suppose you think it's pretty impractical to ask the police to go around saying, look, fella, we treated you badly this morning; forget it all and we'll never offer that against you, it'll never be admitted."
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1252.681,1258.752,"Well, we think it might well do a great deal of mischief, because it confuses the role of the police officer with that of the criminal defense lawyer, first."
1984.83-773,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1261.72,1265.588,"Well, it would cure the taint, wouldn't it?"
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1265.588,1268.04,It could well confuse the defendant.
1984.83-773,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1268.04,1270.992,"That still would cure the taint, whether it confused him or not."
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1270.992,1271.959,"Well, in the limited sense, yes."
1984.83-773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1329.277,1356.329,"You could assume for your purposes, I take it, that the fact that the cat had been let out of the bag, to a degree, assuming that there was a cap involved there, and that that circumstances exerted some psychological influence on the man, leading him to make the second statement more completely, and still stand on its admissibility."
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1356.329,1357.129,--Absolutely.
1984.83-773,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1453.224,1458.711,Why wouldn't that be true if they actually physically assaulted the defendant at the time of his arrest?
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1465.65,1474.989,"Because that may not be enough, by itself, to indicate that the restoration or the proper balance between the police and the individual has always been recreated."
1984.83-773,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1474.989,1478.441,What do you mean by the proper balance between... I don't understand what that means.
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1478.441,1486.214,"Well, by the proper balance, we take to understand the meaning why the Miranda warnings are given in the first place, and why this Court elaborated that doctrine in 1966."
1984.83-773,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1514.248,1517.0,But why isn't the Miranda warning always sufficient to do that?
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1531.076,1532.843,"Well, I think that gets to the point."
1984.83-773,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1551.156,1555.025,I simply don't understand the difference between the two cases under your submission.
1984.83-773,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1556.641,1561.095,"--No, I seriously fail to advance that contention."
1984.83-773,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1566.916,1568.216,Mr. Babcock.
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,1568.216,1578.557,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, what police misconduct are we talking about by way of deterrence?"
1984.83-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1827.415,1838.89,"Is it your position that that much, that incident you described, was a violation in and of itself of the Fifth Amendment?"
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,1838.89,1841.175,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1841.175,1848.012,So you think that the Miranda warning requirement is constitutionally mandated in other words?
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,1848.012,1849.629,"Under these facts, yes, ma'am."
1984.83-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1849.629,1856.601,Despite the language in the court's opinion in Quarrels in other cases to the effect that it's not?
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,1856.601,1858.385,"Well, I'll be candid with you."
1984.83-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1880.766,1886.204,Don't you think they really used the warrant?
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,1891.189,1892.274,--The only time in the record--
1984.83-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1892.274,1895.726,Didn't they think they had a right to go into the house with an arrest warrant?
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,1895.726,1905.498,"--The only time... the only time... on the record, this is in the record... that the warrant comes into play is that Officer McAllister... this is in the transcript--"
1984.83-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1905.498,1908.283,"Well, they wouldn't have even gone to the house without the warrant."
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,1908.283,1909.0,"--Yes, they had the warrant."
1984.83-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1909.0,1910.035,"Well, I know."
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,1912.187,1915.556,"Well, they were using it as a backup in their back pocket."
1984.83-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1924.245,1931.649,The State doesn't challenge the fact that he was in custody and that there was a Miranda violation in the house.
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,1931.649,1933.601,--The district attorney conceded all of this.
1984.83-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1933.601,1935.784,I don't know why--
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,1935.784,1936.367,Pardon?
1984.83-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1936.367,1938.836,"--What's the point, then, in going through all of this?"
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,1938.836,1951.979,"Because it's very important, as I understand the times that you've applied the poisonous tree doctrine, it's very important to be concerned about the prophylactic or the deterrence value of that rule."
1984.83-773,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1961.568,1964.953,You've got to show that the tree is more poisonous than most trees?
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,1964.953,1966.572,--Very poisonous.
1984.83-773,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1966.572,1968.672,What has it got to do with this case?
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,1968.672,1978.213,My argument here is that the manipulation of the warrant and the getting the statement out of him is tied right together with the advice of rights that was given at the police station.
1984.83-773,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1978.213,1984.45,"Is there any doubt that he was under arrest when they took him by the arm and said get dressed, we're going down to the station?"
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,1984.45,1988.336,"I think factually, that once they took him to the living room, he was under arrest."
1984.83-773,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1988.336,1993.39,"You don't think he had any doubt about it, or anybody in the house had any doubt about it?"
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,1997.441,1997.824,No.
1984.83-773,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2001.745,2003.178,"Well, that may be--"
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2003.178,2005.28,I'm just saying that it's important what's going on--
1984.83-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2005.28,2008.415,--But he was arrested when they took him out of his bedroom.
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2008.415,2009.499,--No.
1984.83-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2009.499,2010.684,"Well, what did you just say?"
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2010.684,2014.636,I said that the only time they mentioned the arrest warrant was with the mother--
1984.83-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2014.636,2018.921,"Didn't you say he was, in effect, under arrest when they took him down to the living room?"
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2018.921,2021.14,"--Factually, as a matter of law."
1984.83-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2021.14,2021.69,"Well, all right."
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2021.69,2023.592,He was never told that.
1984.83-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2023.592,2035.217,"Supposing that he had been arrested in the sense that he was not free to leave, and three hours later they told him that they had a warrant for his arrest, and only then."
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2039.268,2043.238,"Arrest isn't important, only as it relates to advice."
1984.83-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2061.034,2065.736,But I thought you said that he was arrested when he came from the bedroom.
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2073.725,2074.142,No.
1984.83-773,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2140.986,2148.556,Isn't it equally an interpretation that anything you say from now on can be used against you?
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2148.556,2151.175,"I don't dare use the phrase, but is it ""double entendre""?"
1984.83-773,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2164.249,2166.132,Did he testify?
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2166.132,2166.868,No.
1984.83-773,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2169.903,2172.955,"Well, what are you telling us about what was in his mind just out of the clear blue?"
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2172.955,2180.008,"Well, I'm only arguing that until the presumption is rebutted by the Attorney General's office, that you can--"
1984.83-773,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2180.008,2182.21,You've been talking about what was in his mind--
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2182.21,2182.81,--Yes.
1984.83-773,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2182.81,2185.429,--But that's your testimony.
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2185.429,2193.701,"Well, I'm just saying, though, that when he says ""I was there"", and he's looked into the police car, that you can, as the judge--"
1984.83-773,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2193.701,2194.851,Don't put me in now.
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2196.22,2207.426,"--I'm saying that he has no knowledge and he's induced, when he gets to the police station, after the cat has been let out of the bag, to go ahead and give the full confession."
1984.83-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2256.74,2266.614,"Well, but didn't that case hold that the prosecution need not show that a person who consents to a search knew that he could refuse?"
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2266.614,2267.748,Yes.
1984.83-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2332.973,2339.144,"Mr. Babcock, strictly speaking, the ""I was there"" statement was never offered, was it?"
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2339.144,2340.412,--No.
1984.83-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2340.412,2346.483,"So when you say he hasn't been given an opportunity to object to the use of that statement, that statement was never used against him."
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2346.483,2347.083,Yes.
1984.83-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2375.669,2402.319,"Well, but are you suggesting by kind of negative implication from Schneckloth v. Bustamonte that, although the Fourth Amendment does not require that a person be told he has a right to consent before something is admissible, to refuse consent... somehow, the Fifth Amendment, you cannot show consent unless you have affirmatively told the person that his prior confession cannot be used against him?"
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2402.319,2403.169,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2407.723,2412.942,"Yes, but our Court has never adopted such a rule as a per se rule."
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2412.942,2414.46,--This would not be per se.
1984.83-773,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2420.198,2426.018,"But the Oregon Court of Appeals gave the impression it was laying down a rule broader than just this case, I thought."
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2426.018,2432.588,I think the Court of Appeals... I differ from what the Attorney General says about that case.
1984.83-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2492.627,2508.839,"Well, how do you distinguish McMann, where the defendant didn't know that his confession was inadmissible, and yet he was allowed to enter a valid guilty plea without understanding the effect of his confession?"
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2508.839,2512.374,Did he have a lawyer?
1984.83-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2512.374,2513.641,"Yes, he did."
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2513.641,2517.695,"Well, I don't know anything about that case, but I would say that there you've got good attenuation."
1984.83-773,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2532.019,2538.858,I notice you filed your brief on June 18th... at least that's marked.
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2564.557,2580.816,"I don't know enough about that case, Your Honor, except I would only say that at some point, when you're able to conclude from the record... and this is a very rare case... you won't be able to do it in most instances... that there is custody and that advice should be given--"
1984.83-773,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2580.816,2589.672,"Well, there was pretty good custody in the supermarket because at least one, perhaps two policemen had guns pointed at him when they said, ""Where is the gun""?"
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2589.672,2593.724,--And was that for the officer's protection?
1984.83-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2614.371,2614.99,They executed it.
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2616.773,2618.692,--They never executed the warrant.
1984.83-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2618.692,2619.908,"Well, you mean they never told him,"
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2621.893,2624.428,"Well, but that kept them from giving advice."
1984.83-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2624.428,2628.713,"That may be, but they nevertheless arrested him."
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2628.713,2629.33,I'm sorry.
1984.83-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2629.749,2631.015,They nevertheless arrested him.
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2631.015,2632.182,Without advice.
1984.83-773,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2632.182,2637.253,"You agree he was arrested, whether they referred to the warrant or not."
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2639.688,2643.473,I noted you agree that there was an arrest.
1984.83-773,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2646.825,2649.894,It's been conceded by the other side that--
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2649.894,2650.879,"--No, it hasn't, Your Honor."
1984.83-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2650.879,2657.15,--It has been conceded that we treat this case as though he were in custody when the first statement was made.
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2669.457,2672.076,"I'm sorry, Your Honor: the amicus brief didn't."
1984.83-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2672.076,2688.352,"Well, I think we're dealing with what the parties have... how the parties have framed the issues, and it certainly would be my understanding that the starting point is to say, okay, a Miranda warning should have been given in the living room before the officer said,"
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2691.088,2692.756,Total agreement.
1984.83-773,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2692.756,2695.692,"When you refer to the amicus brief, there were two."
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2696.675,2698.394,"The Solicitor General's, Your Honor."
1984.83-773,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2698.394,2704.647,"Counsel, you've been arguing it for 15 or more minutes, and I warned you 10 minutes ago."
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2711.134,2714.169,"Well, I think there's only two arguments, Your Honor."
1984.83-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2746.04,2750.944,"Well, you're arguing for a new, more extensive Miranda rule."
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2757.182,2760.8,"Only where there has been a constitutional violation, Your Honor."
1984.83-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2761.217,2762.067,"Well now, wait a minute."
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2782.748,2783.749,--At the house?
1984.83-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2783.749,2784.232,Yes.
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2784.232,2785.299,Yes.
1984.83-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2785.299,2796.557,"It's not a constitutional violation, is it, to ask someone something without the Miranda warning... if it's determined to be essentially voluntary and not coercive?"
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2796.557,2799.175,"But, see, there was no advice given at the house, Your Honor."
1984.83-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2800.025,2800.711,"Yes, right."
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2802.277,2804.079,--And that's constitutional.
1984.83-773,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2804.079,2808.781,"Well, how can you say that in the face of Michigan v. Tucker and Quarrels?"
1984.83-773,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2808.781,2817.137,"Well, Michigan v. Tucker, I would say I have a difficult time with that, in the sense I don't see that as a Miranda case, because the man gave an alibi defense."
1984.83-773,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2890.102,2899.125,Mr. Attorney General.
1984.83-773,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,2899.125,2900.075,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.83-773,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2956.461,2957.579,That's very helpful.
1984.83-773,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,2988.365,3002.775,"Except that under either reading, this Court of Appeals decision should be reversed because if it is a core constitutional violation, the core of the constitutional violation was cured by the giving of the warrant."
1984.83-773,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3002.775,3021.737,"Well, see, my problem is, if you regard it as a constitutional violation, then you have some difficulty, at least it seems to me, saying that it's any different from point of view of shifting burdens and causation and all that, between this case and one in which the man was actually physically beaten, because in either event it's the same constitutional violation."
1984.83-773,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,3029.925,3051.523,"Well, I think, respectfully, there's integrity in either case because even before the Miranda violation was... the Miranda doctrine was violated, this Court examined a number of cases in which there had been an earlier coerced confession in which a cure had been effected by removal of the defendant from time or place which caused the recreation of the voluntary condition for the confession."
1984.83-773,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3108.109,3109.209,That's not correct.
1984.83-773,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,3120.433,3125.821,"--Well, in this case at least, the defendant did not have the means that required him to have--"
1984.83-773,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3125.821,3128.454,But I don't think you can say it's totally unfixable.
1984.83-773,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,3128.454,3130.037,--Thank you very much.
1984.83-773,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3130.037,3130.537,"Thank you, gentlemen."
