1960.31,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,15.326,"Number 31, Thomas Michalic, Petitioner, versus Cleveland Tankers."
1960.31,0,27075,harvey_goldstein,,16.832,21.088,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of this Court."
1960.31,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,323.534,327.243,Did that testimony that you rely on acquitted in the jury trial?
1960.31,0,27075,harvey_goldstein,,327.243,330.004,"That is part of the testimony, sir, that I do rely upon."
1960.31,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,330.004,333.788,"Was -- this is at 11, this wrench keeps slipping off, is that it?"
1960.31,0,27075,harvey_goldstein,,333.788,334.805,That is -- that is correct.
1960.31,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,335.439,337.226,And what else besides that?
1960.31,0,27075,harvey_goldstein,,337.226,349.2,"The fact that he stated that the wrench was battered and beaten, the fact that it was stated that the wrench is worn, the fact that it was stated that the wrench was old, the fact that the wrench was stated to be all-chewed up on the end --"
1960.31,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,349.2,349.363,"Did he say ""all chewed --"
1960.31,0,27075,harvey_goldstein,,349.363,350.394,And not very good.
1960.31,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,350.394,353.719,Where does -- where does it say “all chewed up”?
1960.31,0,27075,harvey_goldstein,,353.719,358.908,"On page 10, I believe, sir, of the record."
1960.31,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,358.908,359.663,"Oh yes, I have it."
1960.31,0,27075,harvey_goldstein,,368.108,375.57,"The petitioner's testimony and one witness by the petitioner, and I will get to that witness' testimony in a moment."
1960.31,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,590.356,607.618,"What was he to understand that what happened is that the petitioner, while attempting to lose these nuts with this wrench, pounding against the handle with a mallet, knocked it out off his hands, it slipped off the nut and fell on his toe, is that it?"
1960.31,0,27075,harvey_goldstein,,607.618,610.728,"With -- with one minor point, sir."
1960.31,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,610.728,611.74,Yes.
1960.31,0,27075,harvey_goldstein,,611.74,618.082,He doesn't -- he does not claim that the hitting of the mallet against the wrench knocked the wrench out of his hand.
1960.31,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,623.236,625.81,"Well, you don't stand by that?"
1960.31,0,27075,harvey_goldstein,,627.571,633.277,"Yes, he is holding onto the wrench, but it was the slipping -- it was the slipping of the wrench off the nut itself --"
1960.31,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,633.277,633.456,It was against the nut and it slipped.
1960.31,0,27075,harvey_goldstein,,633.456,634.996,That caused the wrench to slip.
1960.31,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,634.996,640.886,"Had slipped off the nut, as in here, it was knocked out off his hands, at the same time, it fell on his toe."
1960.31,0,27075,harvey_goldstein,,640.886,650.927,"That is correct, but it was the -- he claims that it was the slipping of the wrench off the nut that caused the wrench to slip out of his hand not the mere fact that he simply let go of the wrench."
1960.31,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,702.307,703.326,I don't quite get that.
1960.31,0,27075,harvey_goldstein,,705.733,712.178,"No, no I would assume on the side, sir, in order to loosen the nuts in an opening position."
1960.31,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,712.178,713.8,"Well, what does the evidence show?"
1960.31,0,27075,harvey_goldstein,,717.868,719.044,"I don't know, sir."
1960.31,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,723.449,724.762,But who was wheeling the mallet?
1960.31,0,27075,harvey_goldstein,,724.762,725.253,He was.
1960.31,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,728.728,730.733,And you don't know what -- was he --
1960.31,0,27075,harvey_goldstein,,730.733,730.89,Well --
1960.31,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,730.89,732.062,-- putting it this way or (Voice Overlap) --
1960.31,0,27075,harvey_goldstein,,732.062,743.61,"My -- my impression of the -- of the record was simply, sir, that he was holding the mallet this way and striking -- holding the wrench this way and striking with the mallet with his left hand I would assume --"
1960.31,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,743.61,743.904,And it --
1960.31,0,27075,harvey_goldstein,,743.904,747.33,-- in an effort to move the wrench in this direction and loosen the nut.
1960.31,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,747.33,752.833,"And the theory is that the worn end, or whatever it was, slipped off because it didn't have sufficient grip?"
1960.31,0,27075,harvey_goldstein,,752.833,753.816,"That is correct, sir."
1960.31,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,754.64,764.072,We'll recess.
1960.31,0,27075,harvey_goldstein,,764.072,771.182,"Thank you, sir, Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court."
1960.31,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,865.57,867.224,Did you present that question?
1960.31,0,27075,harvey_goldstein,,867.224,869.437,"Yes, sir, I did."
1960.31,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,869.437,872.39,In the petition for certiorari?
1960.31,0,27075,harvey_goldstein,,872.39,884.672,"Yes, sir, I'm -- without remembering the exact language, I'm sure I did."

1960.31,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1283.785,1289.688,How did (Inaudible)
1960.31,0,27075,harvey_goldstein,,1289.688,1294.75,Because they were supposed to be special wrenches for the use of the pumproom in a special toolbox.
1960.31,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1301.641,1302.305,All of them?
1960.31,0,27075,harvey_goldstein,,1302.305,1304.006,All the same.

1960.31,2,27075,harvey_goldstein,,3066.861,3075.63,"Although, of course, I might add that the plaintiff never did drop his cause of action for unseaworthiness, that was always in the case."
1960.31,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3095.298,3097.439,Under the Jones Act --
1960.31,2,27075,harvey_goldstein,,3097.439,3097.463,It --
1960.31,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3097.463,3099.307,We can rule only for negligence and --
1960.31,2,27075,harvey_goldstein,,3099.307,3099.83,"That's correct, sir."
1960.31,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3099.83,3104.166,This is all tied up in one cause of action in your complaint.
1960.31,2,27075,harvey_goldstein,,3107.994,3108.112,For -- for unseaworthiness.
1960.31,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3108.112,3110.063,And there's no cause of action for unseaworthiness.
1960.31,2,27075,harvey_goldstein,,3110.063,3114.849,"Actually, it was two causes of action though, not put as two separate --"
1960.31,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3114.849,3115.048,No.
1960.31,2,27075,harvey_goldstein,,3115.048,3120.857,"Causes in the complaint, but there was a statement that the vessel was unseaworthy."
1960.31,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3120.857,3129.758,"Because, I suppose, this is a case where their questions involved was whether these tools were or were not defective, that is whether --"
1960.31,2,27075,harvey_goldstein,,3129.758,3129.799,That --
1960.31,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3129.799,3130.924,-- the evidence was sufficient to show that the --
1960.31,2,27075,harvey_goldstein,,3130.924,3131.444,I -- I would think so.
1960.31,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3131.444,3133.844,"That they were defective and I suppose, in this case, there's no difference if the tools --"
1960.31,2,27075,harvey_goldstein,,3133.844,3137.383,"It -- it wouldn't -- as a practical matter, I don't think it would make much difference."
1960.31,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3138.133,3139.577,You're right.
1960.31,2,27075,harvey_goldstein,,3139.577,3142.036,Go through a certain testimony very quickly.
1960.31,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3181.14,3196.958,"The Court of Appeals did consider it and still affirmed the judgment and thereby, you implicitly say that they -- that -- or you say that their implicit ruling was that it should have been admitted rather than excluded, don't you?"
1960.31,2,27075,harvey_goldstein,,3196.958,3198.98,"That is correct, that is correct."
1960.31,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3198.98,3207.581,"But what they are saying, in effect, isn't it, that even if it had been admitted, they were still no -- there was still not enough evidence to take a case to the jury."
1960.31,2,27075,harvey_goldstein,,3207.581,3211.325,"That -- that is correct and my claim, of course, is that they were wrong in that statement."
1960.31,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3362.994,3364.638,Who was the trial judge?
1960.31,2,27075,harvey_goldstein,,3364.638,3366.726,"Judge Cannel, I believe."
1960.31,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3366.726,3366.842,Cannel.
