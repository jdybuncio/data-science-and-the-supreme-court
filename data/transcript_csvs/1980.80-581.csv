1980.80-581,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.686,We'll hear arguments next in Commonwealth Edison et al. v. Montana.
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,86.512,90.965,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,243.042,252.179,"Well, Mr. Rogers, are you suggesting that the State of Montana could not have doubled its severance tax at any particular time?"
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,252.179,254.195,"No, we're not."
1980.80-581,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,283.276,286.369,"In any event, there was no challenge to the lower rate periods?"
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,286.369,287.477,--None.
1980.80-581,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,297.802,302.659,"According to the courts below, have you conceded that a 50 percent tax would be?"
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,302.659,303.8,"--No, we have not, Your Honor."
1980.80-581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,343.455,352.482,But then isn't that going to make it a case-by-case adjudication in every situation where the federal courts decide whether a tax is or is not?
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,352.482,355.527,"No, I would not think so, Your Honor."
1980.80-581,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,413.427,416.785,"That's really all you want, is a chance to prove your case?"
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,416.785,417.362,That is all.
1980.80-581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,460.846,468.482,But wouldn't the same have been true 20 or 30 or 40 years ago in Oklahoma or Texas with respect to a severance tax on oil?
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,468.482,474.23,"Well, I really can't answer that question, Your Honor."
1980.80-581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,498.361,504.14,Does a state have to make a claim that it needs the money in order to exercise the taxing power?
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,504.14,527.411,"Well, as we read Complete Auto, and Washington Stevedoring, the Court has held that there are four prongs to the test: one, the nexus test; one, the apportionment test, neither of which come into play here; third, the discrimination test, and this case clearly shows the discrimination here."
1980.80-581,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,568.204,572.565,"Well, why isn't it being paid by Montana consumers too?"
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,572.565,581.125,"Well, it is to some extent, of course, but it's... they get so much money back from the remainder of the tax, it's for... let me say this, Justice White."
1980.80-581,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,584.858,588.967,"Well, it's probably resulted in lowering of some other taxes or at least--"
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,588.967,590.496,It has--
1980.80-581,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,590.496,591.34,--they've had some increases?
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,591.34,598.244,"--It has resulted in considerable lowering of taxes, and they plan in the years ahead not to have to pay any taxes at all."
1980.80-581,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,657.47,660.031,What if we agreed with you?
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,675.854,676.166,--Yes.
1980.80-581,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,676.166,680.023,And that therefore you ought to have a chance to prove that it's too high?
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,680.023,680.632,That's exactly right.
1980.80-581,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,680.632,688.315,"But then, the premise for that is that it may be that 30 percent is too high."
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,689.784,690.768,That's right.
1980.80-581,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,690.768,692.736,And how do we know that?
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,692.736,694.361,"Well, we'll--"
1980.80-581,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,694.361,697.688,You're going to... you would convince the Court of that?
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,697.688,699.016,--We're going to convince the Court of that.
1980.80-581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,708.901,712.291,"Well, the question is, what standards can we establish?"
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,712.291,716.759,"Oh, I think, Your Honor, that you have established a standard, a fairly related standard."
1980.80-581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,760.116,765.176,There are people in Montana who are paying taxes.
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,765.176,769.83,"--Yes, of course, but they get back so much in the rest of it that, as I said, they've very happy to pay for it."
1980.80-581,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,769.83,773.906,"Mr. Rogers, I agree with what I think you're arguing."
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,789.728,790.713,"No, Your Honor--"
1980.80-581,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,790.713,794.586,You want a hearing which will determine how much your tax is to be?
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,794.586,797.07,"--No, Justice Marshall, that is not."
1980.80-581,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,803.301,804.629,Assuming that's true--
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,804.629,813.39,"--that it should be fairly related to the cost and services provided by the states, a rough equivalence."
1980.80-581,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,814.64,817.046,--Will the Court be asked to fix a rate?
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,817.046,818.857,"--No, Your Honor, we think that--"
1980.80-581,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,818.857,821.34,"Well, will the Court be asked to fix a line?"
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,821.34,825.449,"--Well, what we would expect, Your Honor, is as follows."
1980.80-581,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,830.821,834.398,I'd love to have the right to fix my own rate of taxes.
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,834.398,837.209,--I guess we all would.
1980.80-581,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,837.209,841.865,Mine would be on a scale of one to ten minus two.
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,841.865,851.688,"In this case there was no legislative history, no attempt by the Legislature, really, to justify the amount of the tax."
1980.80-581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,884.581,894.046,Isn't there some language in the Supreme Court's opinion about its fear of the consequences of strip mining and of the process of restoration?
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,894.046,905.26,"--Yes, but in this case, as I have said, the state has already provided for reclamation cost, plus the fact that the amount of land that's involved in this is very small."
1980.80-581,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,915.131,920.426,"Well, a fair proportion of it doesn't belong to Montana anyway, does it?"
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,920.426,926.33,"No, about 75 percent of this coal is federal coal."
1980.80-581,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,926.33,931.234,And so the restoration is performed under federal leases?
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,931.234,932.031,Yes.
1980.80-581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,948.117,966.048,"You can say that under the Commerce Clause that the tax may well be invalid, but to say there's no ""justification"" for the tax strikes me as a misapplication of constitutional principles, to say they have to justify a tax."
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,966.048,970.344,Maybe I should amend that to say that there was no justification made for it in the Legislature.
1980.80-581,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,997.788,1001.911,"Mr. Rogers, what sort of expenditures in your judgment would justify it?"
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,1012.673,1026.059,"--Well, I think that because of the other taxes that they've already imposed on the mining of coal, the taxes would have to be in some way related to the impact of additional mining."
1980.80-581,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1031.572,1052.876,"You'd say that the limiting principle is that the tax revenues must somehow or other be related to the expenditures of the state that are fairly related to mining, but the tax may not support any other public purpose like unemployment compensation or public parks, environmental matters, or?"
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,1052.876,1056.125,"--No, Justice Stevens, I would not say that."
1980.80-581,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1070.713,1071.729,880 thousand.
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,1071.729,1072.445,What'd I say?
1980.80-581,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1075.835,1083.035,That's how many people there'll be there if they can keep all this money.
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,1083.035,1083.645,That's right.
1980.80-581,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1157.349,1160.316,"Before you sit down, though, let me ask one other question."
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,1168.798,1171.985,"Well, there are two arguments, I think, Justice Stevens."
1980.80-581,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1195.427,1207.923,"But don't you agree that if Congress passed a statute that specifically approved the Montana tax, that you would lose this case?"
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,1217.138,1219.731,"Yes, I sure wouldn't be here; yes."
1980.80-581,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1222.37,1223.417,"No, probably not."
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,1223.417,1224.105,--Do you think so?
1980.80-581,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1224.105,1231.757,But Congress can certainly eliminate the constitutional issue if it wants to.
1980.80-581,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,1231.757,1232.882,"Oh, yes: surely, surely."
1980.80-581,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1280.644,1292.779,Mr. Attorney General.
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1292.779,1295.965,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1392.85,1405.374,"Mr. Greely, does Montana follow the procedures of most federal civil rules for the states, all well-pleaded allegations in the complaint are deemed true on a motion to dismiss?"
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1405.374,1408.342,"That's true, but that's the allegations in the complaint."
1980.80-581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1411.856,1418.76,But you would have to concede that all of the allegations in the complaint well-pleaded are true since the--
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1418.76,1419.822,All factual allegations--
1980.80-581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1419.822,1420.494,--Facts; facts.
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1420.494,1421.087,--but not conclusions of law.
1980.80-581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1436.127,1439.204,"Mr. Attorney General, let me put a hypothetical question to you."
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1470.301,1476.532,Are you talking about a state tax as a substitute for all other state taxes?
1980.80-581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1499.711,1502.32,But one tax on just one category of taxpayers.
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1504.224,1515.221,"Well, assuming there was no other discriminations or anything else, I think that that would be something that could feasibly, if that was the decision of the legislature, could feasibly be upheld."
1980.80-581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1517.0,1518.391,"--Well, the courts can inquire into it."
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1530.043,1532.323,"Oh, I suppose that that's possible, certainly."
1980.80-581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1546.503,1564.856,"Well, it would be not an abnormal process for legislators of a state, particularly, to say, let's put as much as the traffic will bear on the outsiders and relieve the local citizens of our state."
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1578.913,1579.32,"Well, that's true."
1980.80-581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1599.998,1610.322,"In other words, in that respect it's different from the case that was argued previously, where there's a difference in the tax on the material taken out of the state?"
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1610.322,1612.916,"Yes, absolutely."
1980.80-581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1621.022,1637.279,"Well, Mr. Attorney General, under the Complete Auto case, would a tax be subject to judicial review of any kind at some point as it got larger and larger and larger?"
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1642.685,1663.536,"It's understandable that the Complete Auto test and the Commerce Clause test have nothing to do with the rates of the tax, and we have contended, as we did in the lower courts, that we could tax 100 percent, 1,000 percent, not because we want to or that that would be an intelligent thing to do, because obviously there's market limitations and there's other limitations."
1980.80-581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1672.531,1673.031,Is that because you--
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1673.031,1679.732,"--bringing in revenue... quit bringing in revenue and actually maybe precluded the activity, where you might possibly have a due process clause."
1980.80-581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1679.732,1682.683,--But you think this is just a local activity that you then--
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1682.683,1683.167,Absolutely.
1980.80-581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1683.167,1689.572,--and that Complete Auto isn't even implicated because this isn't a tax on commerce?
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1689.572,1691.024,"Well, if Complete Auto is--"
1980.80-581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1691.024,1691.477,Yes.
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1691.477,1692.836,"--Yes, that's essentially correct."
1980.80-581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1694.726,1700.099,"But if we disagreed with you on that, as... I take it the United States doesn't agree with you on that."
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1700.099,1709.938,"Well, we're citing Heisler for the proposition that essentially that a severance tax which is a local activity is not a burden on interstate commerce."
1980.80-581,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1721.199,1726.197,The United States suggests that Complete Auto does apply but the test is just satisfied.
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1726.197,1744.737,"Well, I think if you apply the facts of our case to Complete Auto, that we meet the tests of Complete Auto, in fact, the appellants have conceded that; for the fact that they say that we do meet that test, and that our rate, if we had a rate, a lower rate, that there wouldn't be a problem whatsoever."
1980.80-581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1798.028,1815.833,"Mr. Greely, couldn't a state decide in connection with purely local activity not to actually forbid it, but that it simply didn't like the activity and taxed it, say, at a rate of 75 percent?"
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1815.833,1820.783,I think that certainly taxes are a way of discouraging activities.
1980.80-581,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1836.184,1850.835,"In Complete Auto, the tax there was a state tax imposed... as I remember, and you correct me if I'm mistaken... upon what was concededly an instrumentality of interstate commerce."
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1850.835,1851.506,Correct.
1980.80-581,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1851.506,1856.581,"And the question was the constitutional permissibility of any tax at all, was it not?"
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1856.581,1863.564,It was a question of whether or not the states could tax involving interstate commerce.
1980.80-581,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1863.564,1863.845,"Tax it at all, at all."
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1863.845,1864.298,Right.
1980.80-581,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1865.657,1874.059,"And here, as I understand it, the petitioner concedes the constitutional power of the state to impose a severance tax."
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1874.059,1874.528,--That's correct.
1980.80-581,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1874.528,1875.575,And the question is how much.
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1875.575,1878.792,That's the question they're asking this Court to determine.
1980.80-581,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1878.792,1881.308,And it's a different question or maybe--
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1881.308,1882.26,But they're asking this Court to determine that question.
1980.80-581,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1935.411,1941.438,"--General Greely, let me just take a step further the question the Chief Justice asked you."
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,1962.509,1970.442,I don't know.
1980.80-581,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1989.544,2005.648,"Well, it would be precisely the same challenge here, that under the last prong of the Complete Auto Transit case that there is some integrity, that requirement of some relationship between the tax and something the state does and I don't know exactly what that prong means either, but if it means something--"
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,2005.648,2014.504,"--Yes, in answer to your question, I think that even though we can't say maybe exactly what it means, I don't think that it would be a meaningless test."
1980.80-581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2093.487,2114.432,"--Suppose... hypothetically, again... it could be shown that the entire cost of the services which the state gave to five taxpayers engaged in extracting natural resources was $500,000 and that the taxes imposed on them were $100 million."
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,2120.211,2131.048,There possibly could be judicial curiosity but I don't believe that that factual a situation would require a striking of the tax under the Commerce Clause.
1980.80-581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2135.061,2136.359,"Well, what about--"
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,2136.359,2155.696,"And no tax, to my knowledge... I mean, there's general, this is a general excise tax, this is for the general... there's no, there has been no indication by the state Legislature that the reason for this tax is just to take care of those dangerous things that may happen to the State of Montana because of the impact of coal mining."
1980.80-581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2178.233,2199.738,"--Then add to my hypothetical what Mr. Justice Stevens suggested, that all other taxes on all other residents of Montana were repealed and Montanans paid no tax and all the tax was thrust upon five companies or six companies engaged in extracting coal and oil."
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,2206.815,2232.241,"Well, I would suggest that if the tax could not otherwise be questioned, when all the rest of the taxes... I don't believe that by eliminating other taxes that you suddenly make one tax unconstitutional; I don't know exactly what the connection would be."
1980.80-581,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2232.241,2233.71,You might have an Equal Protection Clause problem.
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,2233.71,2234.209,Possibly.
1980.80-581,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2308.304,2311.006,"General Greely, help me out on one detail."
1980.80-581,1,35943,michael_t_greely,,2321.828,2347.427,"There is a... we have what we call the Coal Board, which is a Board appointed by the Governor, and they have authority to distribute a certain amount of money, and applications are made from the local governments in the area where the strip mining takes place, and those applications for grant monies are determined by the Board and money would be given to those localities for various things such as schools, fire and police protection, education, or whatever."
1980.80-581,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2364.203,2379.526,"No, your time has not expired, Mr. Attorney General, but this is your... Mr. Rogers."
1980.80-581,2,45998,william_p_rogers,,2379.526,2381.011,"Well, I'll just take a minute."
1980.80-581,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2643.445,2646.384,"Mr. Rogers, may I ask you a question before you conclude?"
1980.80-581,2,45998,william_p_rogers,,2661.909,2667.484,"Well, I don't know the answer specifically to uranium but the answer to your question is, yes, there are records."
1980.80-581,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2674.449,2678.603,How many states control the copper of the United States?
1980.80-581,2,45998,william_p_rogers,,2678.603,2681.991,"I don't happen to know that, but they are not so many."
