1985.84-1944,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,35.137,"Mr. Lauber, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,35.137,38.458,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1985.84-1944,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,248.376,258.198,"Mr. Lauber, had he waited until January 2, '77, he'd get the full... we wouldn't have a case here, would we?"
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,258.198,266.537,"That's right, because after the new law was enacted that abolished the old gift tax exemption, and everything was then governed by the unified credit."
1985.84-1944,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,282.847,283.497,"$45,000."
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,283.497,287.765,"--Well, it was 45, right, including the five little ones."
1985.84-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,291.869,294.655,He'd have had to use it all up to avoid paying the tax.
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,294.655,305.126,"I think not all, because the credit is dollar for dollar against the tax, whereas the old exemption you only get a number of cents on the dollar equal to your marginal rate."
1985.84-1944,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,409.261,410.563,You say it isn't clear.
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,414.815,417.4,"Well, it really, you would think it's something--"
1985.84-1944,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,417.4,417.934,It's an unfair question.
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,417.934,419.952,--Congress would have thought about.
1985.84-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,594.265,602.188,"Mr. Lauber, weren't the full amount of the gifts included in his estate?"
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,602.188,605.957,"That's correct, Justice White, all $45,000 were included in his estate."
1985.84-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,605.957,607.742,Because they were gifts in contemplation of death.
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,607.742,608.475,Right.
1985.84-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,608.475,610.042,So they were subject to the estate tax.
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,610.042,611.061,That's right.
1985.84-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,611.061,618.165,"Whereas if they hadn't been in contemplation of death, it wouldn't have... they wouldn't have been included in his estate?"
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,618.165,619.917,That's correct.
1985.84-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,621.883,643.515,"Suppose the law had never been changed, and under the old law what would happen in a gift in contemplation of death where somebody made a gift in contemplation of death and took his exemption and paid some tax and then he had to pay his estate tax, too?"
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,643.515,649.502,"--Well, under the old law, if he had made the gift in contemplation of death and say he claimed the $30,000 exemption and paid no tax--"
1985.84-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,649.502,650.319,Yes.
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,650.319,662.777,"--You then have the property included in the estate, subject to estate tax, and he would basically have wasted the specific exemption, claimed it, but aside from the time value of money by deferring the tax he wouldn't really have gotten a great tax benefit."
1985.84-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,662.777,665.628,"What if he had made $60,000 in gifts?"
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,665.628,666.763,And paid tax?
1985.84-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,666.763,669.732,"And paid tax, and then it's all included in his estate."
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,669.732,673.534,Then he'd get a credit against the estate tax in the amount of gift tax paid.
1985.84-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,673.534,681.357,"Well, don't you think that makes some difference in this case, that he can't be double-dipping?"
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,687.261,690.213,"Well, no, that's not right, Justice White, because don't forget that the unified credit--"
1985.84-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,690.213,696.983,"Well, what good did his gift tax credit do him if all of his property is included in his estate?"
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,696.983,699.069,"--Well, he got several things from it."
1985.84-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,702.871,703.521,That's right.
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,703.521,705.055,Which would have had to have been otherwise paid.
1985.84-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,705.055,705.688,Yes.
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,705.688,710.09,It was deferred until several years later.
1985.84-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,719.43,719.898,That's right.
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,719.898,721.148,--paid by his estate.
1985.84-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,724.584,731.088,"What you're talking to is you're dealing with the estate and you say the estate has to reduce its credit by $6,000."
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,731.088,735.992,"Right, an account of the tax benefit that Mr. Hirschi got from the gift tax."
1985.84-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,735.992,744.48,"Well, he certainly didn't get the benefit he would have had if it hadn't been in contemplation of death."
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,744.48,745.148,Well that's true.
1985.84-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,746.014,749.251,Because he now has to face the estate tax.
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,749.251,750.117,--That's right.
1985.84-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,785.973,802.583,"Well, it just seems to me that because these gifts were included in his estate, he's not exactly in the same position to have his exemption reduced as somebody who really got the benefit."
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,802.583,808.32,"Well, that's the statutory argument that the Appellees make, and perhaps I should just go right into that."
1985.84-1944,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,808.32,810.989,"Before you do, because I want to be sure I understand."
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,816.793,818.278,"Well, his estate, the group."
1985.84-1944,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,818.278,820.461,Combining him and the estate as one for the moment.
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,843.876,844.659,That's right.
1985.84-1944,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,844.659,856.653,"So the net result is he pays less tax, he and his estate together pay less tax, than would have been paid, because he paid no gift tax before and the estate tax would have been higher?"
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,856.653,867.641,"If Congress had never amended the law, the figures we're comparing, what would have happened if he had... if Congress had never changed the law at all, enacted our provision--"
1985.84-1944,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,867.641,868.092,That's right.
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,868.092,869.06,--the tax under those rates--
1985.84-1944,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,869.06,870.593,He's better off than if the law had never been passed.
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,874.98,875.53,--Right.
1985.84-1944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,885.286,897.126,"You do agree that it would be appropriate to address the statutory question because by doing that we could avoid theoretically the constitutional issues, do you not?"
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,897.126,899.145,No.
1985.84-1944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,900.461,901.145,"Well, if they prevail."
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,901.145,902.263,"--Yes, if you rule for them."
1985.84-1944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,902.263,904.347,"So it's appropriate to address it, I suppose."
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,904.347,905.732,"We agree with that, Justice O'Connor, yes."
1985.84-1944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,905.732,912.386,"And I gather it's your theory that the word ""allowed"" does not mean benefited--"
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,912.386,913.905,That's right.
1985.84-1944,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,913.905,914.888,--in substance.
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,917.907,925.594,What the statute says is that you've got to reduce the credit by any amount allowed as a specific exemption under prior law.
1985.84-1944,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,957.798,959.032,In an income tax case?
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,959.032,959.765,--Pardon me?
1985.84-1944,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,959.765,960.734,An income tax case?
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,960.734,961.917,That was an income tax case.
1985.84-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,992.769,1001.825,"But I take it you would treat this taxpayer like the taxpayer who made the same gifts, except that they were not in contemplation of death?"
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1001.825,1003.094,--Exactly right.
1985.84-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1003.094,1007.646,"And both of them would be reduced $6,000?"
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1007.646,1008.148,Right.
1985.84-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1021.605,1032.596,"If you're only going to reduce it $6,000, the fellow whose gifts were not in contemplation of death, his estate taxes would be substantially lower."
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1032.596,1034.632,"--Right, rather than only marginally lower, as his--"
1985.84-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1034.632,1035.932,Very much lower.
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1035.932,1040.602,"--Overall, Congress has reduced everybody's estate tax in 1976."
1985.84-1944,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1097.538,1098.838,"$6,000 worth."
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1098.838,1099.64,"$6,000."
1985.84-1944,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1354.79,1362.196,"Mr. Lauber, excuse me for interrupting you, but I'd like to know whether you think we have to decide both the statutory and the constitutional issue."
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1365.581,1366.798,"--No, sir, it didn't."
1985.84-1944,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1366.798,1372.152,"If we reverse on that issue, would we have to go any further?"
1985.84-1944,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,1372.152,1377.288,"You certainly have the option, if you reverse the constitutional holding, to remand it to let the district court consider."
1985.84-1944,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1447.066,1449.602,Mr. Sutkowski.
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,1449.602,1452.87,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1985.84-1944,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1479.853,1481.353,What page are you reading from?
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,1481.353,1483.205,--Page 2 of the Government's brief...
1985.84-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1635.071,1640.975,That's... I suppose you could call this both a statutory and a constitutional argument.
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,1640.975,1644.893,"Statutory in the sense that it focuses on the word ""allowed"" and ""allowable""."
1985.84-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1644.893,1645.343,Right.
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,1645.343,1653.383,"And in the Court of Claims, incidentally, Your Honor, they misquoted the statute as suggesting the word ""allowable"" in the first instance."
1985.84-1944,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1669.242,1677.598,"Well, the Government says it was allowed because the taxpayer did not have to pay a gift tax at the time."
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,1677.598,1686.187,"--By virtue of an event arising after the transaction, namely Mr. Hirschi's death, and by virtue of the Government--"
1985.84-1944,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1686.187,1694.91,"Well, but at the time the gift was made the Government says he did not then have to pay a gift tax; therefore, it was allowed."
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,1694.91,1696.476,--That's correct.
1985.84-1944,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1696.476,1698.162,And what's your response to that?
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,1698.162,1702.965,It was never allowed in the committee sense of the word.
1985.84-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1705.248,1706.267,It was later disallowed--
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,1706.267,1707.917,"--Well, now they disallowed."
1985.84-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1707.917,1710.935,--by taking it into his estate.
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,1710.935,1729.533,"And the relevant committee reports provide that the taxpayer was to have benefited from the use of this transitional rule, suffered no detriment, not been penalized, but was to have been benefited by the invocation of this election."
1985.84-1944,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1778.68,1780.749,"Well, but that wasn't adopted, was it?"
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,1780.749,1781.516,"No, it was not."
1985.84-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1878.329,1894.924,"May I ask, do you agree with the first submission that the Government makes, that if the statute had never been passed and if he died within the three year period, he and the estate together would have paid a larger tax than they do?"
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,1894.924,1896.974,"I'm sorry, would you repeat that question, please?"
1985.84-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1896.974,1904.546,They say that what you're really saying is you didn't get as much of a benefit out of the new law as if the arrangement had been a little different.
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,1918.972,1928.078,"That's correct, except that we did suffer a detriment of $6,000 more than a similarly situated taxpayer who had not died under the same set of circumstances."
1985.84-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1928.078,1936.548,"Well, but it's also true, is it not, under the old law that if the donor had lived more than three years he would have been discriminated against?"
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,1938.117,1939.117,"No, he would not."
1985.84-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1940.219,1943.004,Because the gift then wouldn't have been included in the estate.
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,1943.004,1951.859,"--Under the new law, Your Honor, my understanding of the operation of the new law for transactions occurring after 12-31-76, there was a conclusive presumption."
1985.84-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1972.856,1976.058,"Yes, but you don't get the credit because you took the exemption."
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,1976.058,1978.308,"Well, that's correct."
1985.84-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1983.095,1993.436,"What I'm suggesting is the harm, the differentiation between the person who dies within three years of the gift and one who dies more than three years later, was true under the old law and is true under the new law."
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,1997.588,1999.606,"That's not necessarily true, Your Honor."
1985.84-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2009.379,2011.931,But he wouldn't have been a similarly situated taxpayer.
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,2012.564,2013.85,"Well, by virtue of his death that's correct."
1985.84-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2013.85,2019.202,"If you call a taxpayer who dies within the three years similarly situated to one who dies later, then you're absolutely right."
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,2019.202,2040.683,"My concern would be, Your Honor, what sort of rationale legislative purpose could be ascribed to the drawing of a distinction between an alive and a dead taxpayer, especially in light of the committee reports that suggest that this taxpayer had the right to make this election and avail the taxpayer of a benefit and then, having made the benefit, was deprived of $6,000 in additional property."
1985.84-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2042.917,2057.943,"Well, the difference between somebody who dies in three years and someone who doesn't is not the Government would deduct $6,000 from both of them, but the difference would be in the estate tax."
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,2068.699,2070.084,"--Well, it depends upon what system we're visiting about here."
1985.84-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2070.084,2073.219,We're talking about it under the new law.
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,2073.219,2074.852,"Under the new law, the three year rule was conclusive."
1985.84-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2077.187,2077.754,Exactly.
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,2077.754,2086.71,"Except that in our situation, because we were within the transitional period, we suffered a double tax."
1985.84-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2271.265,2272.865,May I ask you a question on that point?
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,2287.074,2306.819,"This Court is Milliken suggested that if the change was in the mere rate, which was essentially that sort of case... that is, if you're speaking of a situation where we had the transfer in contemplation of death issue available to us and we're merely changing rates--"
1985.84-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2306.819,2307.987,"No, I'm not suggesting changing rates."
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,2315.224,2317.443,--I do not think they could constitutionally in the gift tax area.
1985.84-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2317.443,2317.843,You don't.
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,2317.843,2324.363,The reason the gift tax area differs from the other two areas I think is quite obvious.
1985.84-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2337.257,2340.392,"He also makes a judgment about how long he's apt to live, too."
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,2340.392,2342.225,And how much money the taxpayer needs.
1985.84-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2342.225,2355.734,"And if he had real good reason to figure he'd live, say, three and a half years, so he said he's go ahead and do it, and then Congress changed the rules on him and made it four years instead of three, he would have been cheated in exactly the same way that you described."
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,2355.734,2357.034,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2362.722,2371.011,"See, in both cases the liability would be determined on the basis of events that had occurred without regard to the amendment."
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,2373.013,2379.167,"--Well, the test that counsel has alluded to is that we look to the facts and circumstances in existence at the date of death."
1985.84-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2543.389,2545.074,"They may have attempted to, but they--"
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,2545.074,2547.609,I suppose that's why we're here.
1985.84-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2547.609,2550.728,"--In the long run, in the long run it didn't work."
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,2550.728,2551.595,"Yes, it didn't work."
1985.84-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2583.716,2587.268,He just probably thought he was healthier than he was.
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,2587.268,2593.372,"Well, unfortunately I have yet to find an individual who knows when the grim reaper will be--"
1985.84-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2593.372,2594.355,Let alone a lawyer.
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,2594.355,2595.707,--Let alone a lawyer.
1985.84-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2603.43,2604.88,Or an accountant.
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,2604.88,2606.382,"--Well, I think they know most of it."
1985.84-1944,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2608.898,2611.3,It didn't work out here.
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,2611.3,2630.497,"In the case... in the Government's brief, they suggest that the astute taxpayer, the knowledgeable taxpayer, should have waited until November 15th of that same year, with a view toward comparing the relative advantages and disadvantages of making this election."
1985.84-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2857.525,2859.325,May I ask one more question.
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,2866.73,2868.399,"The net result, yes."
1985.84-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2868.399,2871.534,So that's the amount in dispute?
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,2871.534,2884.675,"I only wish it were for 60 and 600, and perhaps, if it were 500, the constitutional and statutory arguments would be more momentous."
1985.84-1944,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2891.029,2895.247,"Think of how many lawyers would have been here if it was $600,000."
1985.84-1944,1,23193,edward_f_sutkowski,,2895.247,2899.583,"You haven't seen Hafner yet, Your Honor."
1985.84-1944,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2899.583,2904.12,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Lauber?"
1985.84-1944,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2904.12,2905.353,One very brief point.
1985.84-1944,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2924.683,2933.539,"He would still have to... he would get his unified tax cut by $6,000."
1985.84-1944,2,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,2933.539,2935.308,"Right, that would happen."
1985.84-1944,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2957.437,2962.705,"Thank you, gentlemen The case is submitted."
