1978.78-690,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.036,We'll hear arguments first this morning in Reiter against Sonotone Corporation.
1978.78-690,0,33283,john_e_thomas,,8.336,11.965,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please this Honorable Court."
1978.78-690,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,45.264,46.095,Mr. Thomas --
1978.78-690,0,33283,john_e_thomas,,46.095,46.299,Yes.
1978.78-690,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,46.299,50.251,You may find it more convenient to elevate the lectern --
1978.78-690,0,33283,john_e_thomas,,50.251,50.531,"Oh, I'm --"
1978.78-690,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,50.531,57.009,"Just with the crank, each of the other way."
1978.78-690,0,33283,john_e_thomas,,57.009,70.957,"The outline of my argument points this morning would be first of all, I'd like to classify the Eighth Circuit opinion as it may as one of policy contrary to the warnings of this Court in antitrust decisions."
1978.78-690,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,168.732,178.357,"Mr. Thomas, if you -- why didn't the Congress simply say any person injured rather than injured in his business or property?"
1978.78-690,0,33283,john_e_thomas,,178.357,192.137,"Well, Your Honor, that Senator Hoar's Section 7 amendment I guess to Senator Sherman's initial proposal, and at that time, Senator which I believe did basically read that way."
1978.78-690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,500.593,505.532,"Mr. Thomas, do you suggest that the words business or property are used in the disjunctive?"
1978.78-690,0,33283,john_e_thomas,,508.691,512.913,"Yes, Your Honor in my brief I believe or and I know it was repeated in the amicus."
1978.78-690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,532.58,537.12,"Well, this is property could -- isn't property always a business?"
1978.78-690,0,33283,john_e_thomas,,537.12,537.397,Excuse me?
1978.78-690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,537.397,542.986,Could you ever be injured in your business without also being injured in your property?
1978.78-690,0,33283,john_e_thomas,,542.986,557.766,"Yes, I would say it does have to be a commercial transaction in our market place, in our free enterprise competitive society, where it's just general distraction to trees for example, from pollution, no."
1978.78-690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,560.8,571.396,"You mean if conspiracy somehow rather by slowing down scientific progress is -- cause damage to a lot of trees, that wouldn't be injury to property?"
1978.78-690,0,33283,john_e_thomas,,571.396,572.396,"Yes, but not --"
1978.78-690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,572.396,573.332,"Not on business, I see."
1978.78-690,0,33283,john_e_thomas,,573.332,574.225,"Right, exactly."
1978.78-690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,574.225,580.446,"But what if you're a lumber company, would that be an injury to your business then?"
1978.78-690,0,33283,john_e_thomas,,580.446,586.067,"Then, we get into the target area question Your Honor which Judge Larson did describe and did find here."
1978.78-690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,590.043,599.551,"Well, maybe it isn't that important, but I just didn't quite understand how one could have an injury to his business that was not also an injury to property?"
1978.78-690,0,33283,john_e_thomas,,599.551,602.159,"Oh, an injury to business, not an injury to property?"
1978.78-690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,602.159,609.111,"Yes, there was not also under your theory clearly also an injury to property and so I wonder how significant the disjunctive is?"
1978.78-690,0,33283,john_e_thomas,,609.111,609.997,Oh.
1978.78-690,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,630.747,642.932,"Mr. Thomas, suppose that it in the course of an antitrust conspiracy, someone like your client who was not in business is slandered."
1978.78-690,0,33283,john_e_thomas,,647.752,650.133,"No, absolutely not."
1978.78-690,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,664.144,665.164,In business.
1978.78-690,0,33283,john_e_thomas,,665.164,668.492,"-- business pursuit, yes Your Honor."
1978.78-690,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,835.865,840.332,"The only question I have Mr. Thomas, do you think Illinois Brick case has anything to do with this case?"
1978.78-690,0,33283,john_e_thomas,,840.332,842.23,Wow!
1978.78-690,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,894.57,896.488,"Probably, no questions at this stage --"
1978.78-690,0,33283,john_e_thomas,,896.488,905.579,Thank you very much.
1978.78-690,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,905.579,907.196,Mr. Shenefield.
1978.78-690,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,907.196,910.253,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.78-690,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1079.185,1086.012,Business or property exclude that would not have been excluded if it simply uses the word injury.
1978.78-690,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1086.012,1087.403,Physical injury?
1978.78-690,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1128.158,1135.144,"Wouldn't -- if such a violation occurred make the business less valuable, and therefore hurt his property?"
1978.78-690,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1135.144,1135.389,You would not have (Voice Overlap)
1978.78-690,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1135.389,1137.34,"I don't know if this is crucial, but it has --"
1978.78-690,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1137.34,1137.81,I agree.
1978.78-690,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1143.511,1150.027,"Well if you're presumably pursuing under Section 4, you try to get some money, you have to prove actual damages in order to have something to treble?"
1978.78-690,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1150.027,1154.238,"You have to have a foregoing business opportunity that is calculable, that's correct."
1978.78-690,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1154.238,1159.779,And I gather that you can be injured in your property without being injured in your business.
1978.78-690,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1159.779,1160.9,And I think that's the essence --
1978.78-690,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1160.9,1161.767,That's this case?
1978.78-690,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1161.767,1172.015,"That's this case and that's the essence of this Court's decision in the Chattanooga case in 1906, it's the essence of the decision in Pfizer with the foreign government was not in any business as such."
1978.78-690,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1172.015,1176.949,And the property interest here is being deprived of too much money?
1978.78-690,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1176.949,1188.833,"The property interest is in being overcharged, having money diminished as the result of violation of antitrust laws as the court described in the Chattanooga case."
1978.78-690,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1266.351,1269.135,"When you say consumer, you mean all of the purchaser?"
1978.78-690,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1269.135,1278.341,"I mean -- in this case, an ultimate purchaser, a direct purchaser in this case, Illinois Brick is non-implicated in this case because you have a direct purchaser."
1978.78-690,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1282.528,1284.738,"The Illinois Brick issue was not here, is it?"
1978.78-690,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1284.738,1286.65,That's correct.
1978.78-690,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1287.721,1291.644,There's a difference of opinion as to its applicability as you know.
1978.78-690,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1291.644,1296.202,But there is -- this plaintiff was a direct purchaser.
1978.78-690,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1297.467,1300.894,The issue here is not an Illinois Brick --
1978.78-690,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1300.894,1303.751,That's correct.
1978.78-690,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1303.751,1317.723,"Given the understanding of the reach of the Commerce Clause in 1890 by the people who enacted the law, it's really sort of unrealistic to talk about whether they actually thought about this particular kind of action, isn't it?"
1978.78-690,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1320.034,1320.153,Well --
1978.78-690,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1320.153,1322.991,"Again, that may not be dispositive here, but --"
1978.78-690,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1322.991,1332.557,"They didn't discuss class actions obviously, but there is language in the debates of discussing consumer actions, individual rights, the rights of individuals to recover."
1978.78-690,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1332.557,1337.345,"Taking quid that if time for that to surface, hasn't it?"
1978.78-690,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1337.345,1342.511,It was not until Rule 23 and until the class action procedure was developed.
1978.78-690,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1346.482,1347.832,For large purchasers?
1978.78-690,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1347.832,1349.243,"For very large consumers, that correct."
1978.78-690,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1349.243,1350.76,Municipalities or --
1978.78-690,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1350.76,1351.217,That's correct.
1978.78-690,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1351.217,1352.198,-- foreign governments?
1978.78-690,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1352.198,1353.951,That's correct.
1978.78-690,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1490.35,1507.366,"Mr. Shenefield, it just ran through my mind that you said does it make any sense, did it make any sense for Congress to say in substance that if a citizen has a claim that worth over $10,000.00, he can raise it -- raise the federal question federal court but he only has a $10.00 claim he may not?"
1978.78-690,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1509.628,1515.279,I would hate to be examined on which aspects of the congressional letters has made sense and which did not.
1978.78-690,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1515.279,1522.917,"But there is a difference I suppose, the practical difference between a suit by a city for a million dollar pipe purchase and a $10.00 purchase by an individual."
1978.78-690,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1522.917,1539.856,"It seems to me that if you have no plaintiffs here, if you have a retail sale in which there was an antitrust violation and there is no plaintiff whatsoever, that you come inevitably to the conclusion that Congress simply could not have intended that kind of a situation."
1978.78-690,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1539.856,1577.108,"Do you recall, Mr. Shenefield, the legislation that was introduced within recent years, two or three at most, it was called the toothpaste amendment that -- because one of the illustrations was that all of the consumers of a particular brand of toothpaste could tack their claims, mass their claims at 75 cents per tube, and achieve federal jurisdiction under the same concept you're presenting here today."
1978.78-690,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1581.663,1583.189,"I'm not, but the --"
1978.78-690,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1583.189,1588.737,It was called the toothpaste amendment because that's the way the debate in the Congress evolved.
1978.78-690,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1588.737,1606.822,The most recent congressional utterance on this subject specifically that we know about is the parens patriae amendments in 1976 where at least this Court found a new procedural device for achieving old and existing substantive rights was being created.
1978.78-690,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1606.822,1625.412,"Do you see any difference, any basic difference between massing the claims or tucking the claims of consumers of toothpaste and doing so with reference to hearing aids or electric toothbrushes or whatnot?"
1978.78-690,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1625.412,1647.227,"Well, whether or not there is a philosophical difference, in my view, there's a clear legal difference because of the statute and the scheme of enforcement of antitrust laws, where the private remedy was designed to promote enforcement, to supplement enforcement, where it was more than simply a compensatory device, where the deterrent effect of enforcement --"
1978.78-690,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1647.227,1659.695,Wouldn't there be a deterrent effect if “X” millions of people are allowed to 10 cent per toothpaste rebate?
1978.78-690,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1685.298,1692.678,"I don't think I'm not familiar with the proposed amendment, but I don't think that amendment could have been in the context of antitrust laws."
1978.78-690,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1692.678,1694.723,"Well, there's no jurisdictional limitation --"
1978.78-690,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1694.723,1694.937,That's correct.
1978.78-690,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1694.937,1699.138,-- or minimum on any view private antitrust jurisdiction.
1978.78-690,1,33011,john_h_shenefield,,1699.138,1700.728,That's correct.
1978.78-690,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1723.073,1728.807,Very well.
1978.78-690,2,46204,warren_spannaus,,1730.6,1730.969,Thank you.
1978.78-690,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1931.779,1935.735,"Do you say parens, Mr. Warren Spannaus, you mean parens patriae?"
1978.78-690,2,46204,warren_spannaus,,1935.735,1938.017,"Yes, sir, parens patriae, excuse me Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1978.78-690,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1938.017,1939.801,"Its derivative, isn't it?"
1978.78-690,2,46204,warren_spannaus,,1953.75,1962.107,"Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that certainly could be -- we would have some very difficult problems under Footnote 14 of the Illinois Brick case."
1978.78-690,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1969.375,1980.63,"That you as parens patriae say that State of Minnesota could recover for Mrs. Reiter's lost, eventhough she could not herself?"
1978.78-690,2,46204,warren_spannaus,,1980.63,1982.348,We would argue that weight.
1978.78-690,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2171.185,2193.859,"Your colleague referred to the Eighth Circuit opinion as being basically a policy decision, given the background in this whole area, is this not something Congress could correct very, very swiftly if the Eighth Circuit is wrong in the statute?"
1978.78-690,2,46204,warren_spannaus,,2193.859,2196.939,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, it --"
1978.78-690,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2196.939,2207.178,Or if they thought that the Eighth Circuit was perhaps correct but they wanted to enlarge their remedies.
1978.78-690,2,46204,warren_spannaus,,2207.178,2217.181,"I think that it's clear Mr. Chief Justice, I think it's clear from the legislative history that Congress has always felt that this -- that consumers did have the right to bring this actions."
1978.78-690,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2233.393,2244.075,"Well, were often -- its often suggest that that we should -- the court should take steps because the legislative process is will put on the slow side."
1978.78-690,2,46204,warren_spannaus,,2247.476,2249.378,"No sir, Mr. Chief Justice, it's not."
1978.78-690,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2299.552,2305.937,"General Spannaus, your brief is joined by 49 states?"
1978.78-690,2,46204,warren_spannaus,,2305.937,2306.978,Yes Mr. --
1978.78-690,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2306.978,2310.584,Is Pennsylvania --- which is the missing one?
1978.78-690,2,46204,warren_spannaus,,2310.584,2316.027,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, the only state who was not participating is the State of Georgia."
1978.78-690,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2316.027,2319.664,Does that imply they're on the other side of the case?
1978.78-690,2,46204,warren_spannaus,,2319.664,2320.671,"No, it's not."
1978.78-690,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2340.199,2344.148,"He is frequent litigator here, I wonder?"
1978.78-690,2,46204,warren_spannaus,,2344.148,2346.385,He is a fre --
1978.78-690,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2346.385,2349.289,"Of course Georgia recovered once as a consumer, isn't it?"
1978.78-690,2,46204,warren_spannaus,,2352.061,2352.254,That --
1978.78-690,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2352.254,2353.455,Maybe he doesn't need the statute --
1978.78-690,2,46204,warren_spannaus,,2353.455,2356.373,"Mr. Justice Stevens, that's probably the reason he figures he can do it on his own."
1978.78-690,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2368.548,2370.57,Mr. Wilheim.
1978.78-690,3,33478,julian_r_wilheim,,2370.57,2375.096,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-690,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2531.565,2541.398,"Well, Mr. Wilheim, is the thrust of your argument then that if this were a price fixing case that plaintiff would have standing?"
1978.78-690,3,33478,julian_r_wilheim,,2541.398,2542.287,"No, sir."
1978.78-690,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2542.287,2543.407,"Then, what's the point of it?"
1978.78-690,3,33478,julian_r_wilheim,,2543.407,2560.253,The point is I do not want this Court to have a psychological view that these are these bad things call price fixers as distinguished from other violations of the antitrust laws which for example would come under the Sylvania case under the rule of reason.
1978.78-690,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2560.253,2562.987,But the merits of the case aren't before us at all here are they?
1978.78-690,3,33478,julian_r_wilheim,,2562.987,2566.851,"No, the merits are not before you know, should they be at this moment."
1978.78-690,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2578.893,2585.611,"But Mr. Wilheim, if we should adopt the rule that you urge us to adopt, it would apply to price fixers."
1978.78-690,3,33478,julian_r_wilheim,,2591.207,2593.981,"True Justice Stevens, but what all I am saying at this point, --"
1978.78-690,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2593.981,2595.167,You're not one of that class?
1978.78-690,3,33478,julian_r_wilheim,,2595.167,2601.711,-- is that I don't want the Court to get the impression that they are dealing with these bad fellows called price fixers.
1978.78-690,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2601.711,2606.253,"Nevertheless, you're the spokesman for those bad fellows on that issue we have to decide."
1978.78-690,3,33478,julian_r_wilheim,,2606.253,2609.151,"Which is not based on price fixing, it's based on --"
1978.78-690,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2609.151,2615.651,"Yes, but you're still the spokesman for the price fixers because the way we decide the case will depend -- will determine how those people can act."
1978.78-690,3,33478,julian_r_wilheim,,2615.651,2619.612,"Inferentially, I presume that if you go to the white world that is true."
1978.78-690,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2619.612,2622.432,You better take the hard facts and meet them square-on.
1978.78-690,3,33478,julian_r_wilheim,,2622.432,2630.469,"Now, we're dealing with the statute that is now 90 years old."
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3287.988,3290.79,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.78-690,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3355.774,3360.72,"Well generally, it doesn't mean retail purchasers in common parlance today?"
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3360.72,3362.018,"That maybe, Your Honor."
1978.78-690,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3365.187,3366.06,What is it?
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3367.058,3368.957,Consumer is anyone who buys and consumes goods --
1978.78-690,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3368.957,3370.291,Any purchasers (Voice Overlap)
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3370.291,3371.734,That's correct.
1978.78-690,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3372.203,3380.675,"Every purchasers are consumer, either for his own use or in the -- for use of the purchase product in the manufacturer of other products or whatever, he consumes it, and --"
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3380.675,3382.165,That is correct Mr. Justice Stewart.
1978.78-690,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3382.315,3384.973,-- whether it's a bar of soap or thousand tons of steel.
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3384.973,3385.861,That is right.
1978.78-690,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3438.723,3442.577,"In that case, Hawaii was not suing as a purchaser, was it?"
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3442.577,3444.246,"It was, but that was not the issue before the Court."
1978.78-690,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3444.246,3444.962,That's the point.
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3445.849,3446.316,That's right.
1978.78-690,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3453.52,3455.563,And through its citizenry generally.
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3455.563,3466.976,"And this Court as a threshold question had to determine, what is business or property is an injury to the general economy of the State of Hawaii, an injury to business or property."
1978.78-690,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3504.853,3508.964,But that was a state and almost by definition of the state.
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3512.748,3513.504,"However, Mr. Justice Stewart --"
1978.78-690,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3513.504,3516.618,"If it buys shoes, it buys it in its commercial capacity for --"
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3516.618,3517.617,The states always has standards --
1978.78-690,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3517.617,3519.635,-- its people in prisons or whatever.
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3519.635,3520.428,That's correct.
1978.78-690,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3526.926,3530.655,"Yes, they never buy a dress to wear."
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3530.655,3533.848,They may buy a dress for nurses who work for a state hospital.
1978.78-690,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3533.848,3534.295,Precisely.
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3534.295,3536.188,That is correct.
1978.78-690,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3568.349,3575.604,"Mr. Kaplan, what if Mrs. Reiter here had alleged he need the hearing aid to adequately perform as a lawyer."
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3578.58,3596.613,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, if Mrs. Reiter had alleged that she purchased the hearing aid in order to carry out her profession or her chosen occupation, she would be buying it as a tool for her business or profession, which would then be protected under Section 4 of the Clayton Act."
1978.78-690,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3606.507,3615.222,Though it's really just unemployed consumers kind of bit of --
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3615.222,3616.411,That is not the distinct.
1978.78-690,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3764.882,3771.146,(Inaudible) I thought all antitrust was to protect the consumer.
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3771.146,3773.675,"Mr. Justice Marshall, there is no question."
1978.78-690,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3775.574,3784.435,I don't -- I have yet to find anybody sells being anything protecting me --
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3784.435,3794.283,"In response to the question (Voice Overlap) Mr. Justice Marshall, the concern of the antitrust laws is to protect the consumer welfare."
1978.78-690,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3840.168,3842.685,I'm not protected if I'm overcharged?
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3842.685,3844.099,You are protected Mr. Justice Marshall --
1978.78-690,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3844.099,3846.093,I mean I just don't know how well of I am.
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3846.093,3849.834,Let me tell you how well (Voice Overlap) let me tell you how well of you are.
1978.78-690,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3849.834,3855.057,"Yes, that's -- I'll be interested in that."
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3855.057,3858.531,There are several ways that you are going to be protected.
1978.78-690,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3867.003,3868.341,"Well, who pays for the attorney?"
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3869.865,3876.694,"You have to go to an attorney sir and if he collects for you in the injunction action, he will now be entitled to cover (Voice Overlap); that's right."
1978.78-690,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3876.694,3879.36,Still an injunction that Mrs. Reiter is going to get.
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3879.36,3881.403,She will get an injunction stopping this practice --
1978.78-690,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3881.403,3883.511,"Well, that's she's already got the hearing aid."
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3886.091,3890.724,The other remedies Mr. Justice Stevens are that the parens patriae action is available to her.
1978.78-690,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3890.724,3895.043,"And so, she cannot go to the Attorney General and convince him to bring a parens patriae?"
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3900.271,3900.586,Well --
1978.78-690,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3900.586,3902.932,Does she have to go through all of these to get her $9.00?
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3902.932,3906.655,Let me just address that question if I may Mr. Justice Stevens.
1978.78-690,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3918.856,3919.834,Minuscule to whom?
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3919.834,3921.762,Minuscule in terms of total dollars --
1978.78-690,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3921.762,3922.92,To whom?
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3927.67,3928.257,Mrs. Reiter --
1978.78-690,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3928.257,3933.89,-- somebody -- it might not be -- that might be whether she eats the next day or not.
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,3933.89,3937.566,It may have a direct impact upon her economic situation.
1978.78-690,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4018.395,4023.698,Suppose she bought an oriental rug or perhaps she bought a house and didn't like the commission she was charged.
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4037.403,4048.656,"That is correct Mr. Justice Stevens and I believe that we have to look at what is the intent and the object of the antitrust laws, is it just the compensating people, or is it to deter antitrust violations?"
1978.78-690,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4048.656,4055.811,So what kind of deterrent would remain for a conspiracy among retail Oriental rug dealers if your view prevails?
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4056.813,4061.026,"The parens patriae action, the thread of government action both in United States and --"
1978.78-690,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4061.026,4062.365,How many of those have succeeded?
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4065.272,4067.814,"I'm sorry Mr. Justice Stevens, I don't have the number."
1978.78-690,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4067.814,4069.024,There are many out there?
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4069.024,4069.869,I don't know.
1978.78-690,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4069.869,4076.1,"Well, is there a difference Mr. Kaplan between merchandise which is fungible and merchandise which is not?"
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4090.849,4094.005,"Mr. Chief Justice Burger, it certainly is a one of a kind item."
1978.78-690,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4130.779,4140.225,"Well Mr. Kaplan, have you been reading the papers till last year for which you realizes this Court doesn't have to reach on popular results."
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4145.407,4151.993,The opposition Mr. Justice Rehnquist is certainly relied upon Chattanooga as a controlling case.
1978.78-690,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4198.022,4203.73,"We would at least have to divide -- disavow what you considered to be dictated in the case, would you not?"
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4203.73,4210.976,"No because in that case, you did not have the non-consumer purchaser."
1978.78-690,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4234.297,4243.555,"So, you read as a gloss on the language any injury to business or property that it must be suffered by a business consumer?"
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4243.555,4244.378,No.
1978.78-690,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4286.618,4289.2,"But it was his business, it wasn't his principal business maybe."
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4289.2,4302.98,"It was strictly an investment just as, Mr. Justice Stewart, if you or I bought a stock, it would not be our business or even an ancillary business of buying stocks, it's an investment it strictly something that we do."
1978.78-690,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4307.308,4319.075,"I wonder if you are really fully dealt with the Chattanooga case because as I recall the case, Mr. Justice Holmes first indicated that he did not have to rely on the fact that the city was in the business of supplying water."
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4326.342,4327.044,And the property --
1978.78-690,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4327.044,4330.811,-- which seems to me that take the commercial aspect out of the analysis.
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4330.811,4336.742,"Well, I don't think that you can divorce the property aspect Mr. Justice Stevens from the decision."
1978.78-690,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4337.819,4339.834,But he specifically did as I remember it.
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4341.204,4347.095,I don't believe Mr. Justice Stevens that he defined the term property in that decision.
1978.78-690,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4457.359,4459.688,"Well, the rather considerations beside is that --"
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4459.688,4460.59,"Yes, there are."
1978.78-690,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4460.59,4462.093,-- in Illinois Brick.
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4462.093,4463.588,There are certainly where Mr. Chief Justice.
1978.78-690,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4495.445,4501.869,"And this is just the one you're talking about this defendant, the Beltone?"
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4501.869,4502.396,I'm sorry?
1978.78-690,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4502.396,4505.241,Are you talking about the Beltone case in this?
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4505.241,4506.095,Beltone case?
1978.78-690,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4506.095,4509.041,"Beltone, yes."
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4509.041,4510.579,That is correct.
1978.78-690,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4517.96,4520.975,Before or after his one?
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4520.975,4522.51,Prior to.
1978.78-690,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4526.767,4529.865,You assumed that I agree with you that its importance --
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4529.865,4530.22,No.
1978.78-690,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4557.669,4564.28,"Mr. Kaplan, could you explain for me again why you think Congress use both words?"
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4564.28,4569.882,In order to demonstrate that there must be a commercial or business interest involved.
1978.78-690,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4584.644,4586.361,That's an injury to business?
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4586.361,4587.934,That wasn't his business.
1978.78-690,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4587.934,4589.43,"Well, it was an injury to business."
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4589.43,4591.552,But not to his.
1978.78-690,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4619.47,4628.33,"It's a strange way to cover just the things you want to say is to say property, if all that we're trying to do is to cover the things you just mentioned, that's a strange way of doing it."
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4630.083,4633.571,"Well certainly, we all wish we knew why they said what they said."
1978.78-690,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4641.753,4645.59,Do you think Congress intended then to cover something besides business?
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4645.59,4649.012,"They intended to cover property interest, something that was commercial."
1978.78-690,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4649.012,4649.872,And the answer is yes?
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4649.872,4650.83,No.
1978.78-690,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4656.212,4659.415,"So, it does cover something besides business?"
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4659.415,4662.184,"It covers commercial property interest, yes."
1978.78-690,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4662.184,4664.999,"So, it does cover something besides business like I say, yes it does?"
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4664.999,4665.615,"Yes, it does sir."
1978.78-690,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4665.615,4667.253,"So, the answer is not no?"
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4667.253,4668.232,The answer is not no.
1978.78-690,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4673.881,4683.623,"I wasn't quite sure you start to answer why the Pfizer case wasn't important or didn't control, and I never quite understood the end of your answer, you just started discussing --"
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4683.623,4692.753,"In the Pfizer decision, Mr. Justice Stewart looked to legislative history and didn't find any help to the legislative history."
1978.78-690,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4724.129,4729.724,Do you think your argument applies to foreign governments who buy drugs for non-commercial use?
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4729.724,4738.658,"Mr. Justice Stevens, I can't conceive a situation where any government would buy in a non-business or non-proprietary capacity."

1978.78-690,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4749.12,4749.738,Would they have to --
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4749.738,4751.083,"Yes, they would."
1978.78-690,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4752.191,4755.62,"If I bought bandages for my family, I would not be?"
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4755.62,4756.41,That is correct.
1978.78-690,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4756.41,4757.438,What's the difference?
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4757.438,4760.776,The difference being that you are not a state or a government purchaser (Voice Overlap)

1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4778.214,4780.398,That is correct.
1978.78-690,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4789.823,4793.327,"Yes, but where is the business in the King Ranch thing?"
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4793.327,4796.596,There is no business there.
1978.78-690,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4796.596,4797.704,But they couldn't until night?
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4797.704,4799.411,That's right.
1978.78-690,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4799.411,4806.34,"But if they set up a business there and they own the McDonalds, then they become --"

1978.78-690,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4816.731,4817.407,"So, your --"
1978.78-690,4,22587,elliot_s_kaplan,,4817.407,4821.336,"Then, they would be in the business, that's correct."
