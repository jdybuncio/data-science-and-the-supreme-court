1979.79-602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.809,We'll hear arguments first this morning in Agins against City of Tiburon.
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,12.391,15.538,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.79-602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,26.798,33.835,"You -- you observed more the volume of the briefing than the controversy, Mr. Kanner?"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,33.835,37.797,"The amici have indeed been prolific, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,88.006,99.911,"Mr. Kanner, let me ask you a -- a question about the procedural posture of the case, because of my lack of familiarity with California law."
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,114.621,115.605,"Not quite, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,118.906,120.39,You wouldn't live with -- with leave.
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,120.39,127.025,"Yes, that was the declaratory relief count and the plaintiffs then declined to amend instead on that -- on that part of the pleading."
1979.79-602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,127.025,146.641,"Well -- well, what I'm puzzled about is, do we have any way of knowing whether ultimately, your client would be allowed to build one house per acre on this 5-acre tract or only one house on the entire 5-acre tract?"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,146.641,148.913,There is no way of knowing that and that is --
1979.79-602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,148.913,150.452,"There -- there was a way, wasn't there?"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,150.452,150.91,I beg your pardon?
1979.79-602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,150.91,154.847,"There was a way, wasn't there, the administrative remedy?"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,154.847,158.951,"Well, there was no administrative remedy on this ordinance, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,179.506,181.14,Unusable for any purpose?
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,181.14,182.109,For any purpose.
1979.79-602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,182.109,183.669,Can't you build one house on it?
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,183.669,193.857,"Well, we suggest, Your Honor, that we cannot and because again, Your Honor, it has been a disadvantage precisely, because of the procedural posture mentioned by Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1979.79-602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,224.208,233.631,"Does the City of Tiburon have a zoning commission, before whom you could've gone and asked leave to build one house per acre?"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,233.631,234.989,I presume they do.
1979.79-602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,291.553,306.665,"But we don't know what this point then, whether if you had followed some sort of zoning board or adjustment board procedure, you might or might not have been allowed to build one house per acre?"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,306.665,307.372,That is correct.
1979.79-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,308.914,309.611,Suppose --
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,309.611,310.654,"-- may I -- yes, sir?"
1979.79-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,310.654,311.253,Could I ask you?
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,326.039,326.335,That is --
1979.79-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,326.335,332.849,This belies plaintiff's claim that development of their land is forever prevented and that's the -- that's what the Supreme Court in California says.
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,332.849,338.351,"That was directed, Your Honor, to the second count, to the declaratory relief count and under California or law of remedies --"
1979.79-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,338.351,340.041,You won't care whether it was directed to.
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,346.563,350.45,"Well, this Court and Nectow verus Cambridge, said, “The quite, the contrary.”"
1979.79-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,377.051,386.986,"So, you -- you say, we should just -- that we -- that we just shouldn't accept the statement as to what the zoning ordinance does to you?"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,386.986,388.76,On -- that's not quite our position.
1979.79-602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,448.133,453.268,"When you say the zoning traditionally, impair a value of property for --"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,453.268,454.018,Of course.
1979.79-602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,454.018,454.737,-- owners?
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,454.737,463.218,"That's -- that's a point of some importance by this -- an allegation of this complaint not that the value has been diminished, which incidentally ought to be enough."
1979.79-602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,473.08,473.514,"Well, are you telling the --"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,473.514,474.018,-- value and --
1979.79-602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,474.018,474.03,-- Court now that --
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,474.03,475.346,-- utility.
1979.79-602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,475.346,484.472,"-- that there was anything to prevent you from making an application to build five houses, one on each acre?"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,484.472,485.374,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,485.374,485.42,But --
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,485.42,487.313,The practicalities of the matter.
1979.79-602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,487.653,489.214,"How -- how do you know, unless you did it?"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,489.214,496.618,"Well, with -- there is a -- a fairly well settled body of state law and federal law that is and to the extent the federal courts have considered it."
1979.79-602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,534.995,544.149,"You say this is almost then as if, the legislature had said, “You're 5-acre is zoned as a park and nothing -- nothing should be built on it.”"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,544.149,556.46,"Just about, may I invite Your Honors' attention to page 32 of the appendix in the jurisdictional statement which contains some of these standards as the ordinance puts it."
1979.79-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,594.638,606.411,"These are economic reality, we'll just -- we'll just mean that you cannot develop, develop, but even if you could build one house per acre, that you're -- that just won't work."
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,606.411,614.91,"Well, I -- what we are saying, Your Honor, is that there is no way in which the -- there is going to be one house per acre."
1979.79-602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,617.456,617.494,Well --
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,617.494,618.122,-- complaint.
1979.79-602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,618.122,633.117,"-- it me, an illegal sense in which -- which your theory or complaint boils down to is it, on the allegations in your complaint, instead of having the demurrer sustained, it should have been overruled and a trial on the facts should have been held."
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,633.117,634.664,That's precisely our position.
1979.79-602,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,667.325,670.513,You want us to change the procedures of California courts?
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,670.513,672.068,"No sir, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,672.902,678.521,"Well, I thought you said, they wouldn't let you put on evidence and that is your compliant."
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,678.521,679.624,We are --
1979.79-602,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,679.624,680.119,Isn't that your complaint?
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,680.119,681.087,Our complaint is that they would --
1979.79-602,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,681.087,682.857,"So, you want us to change that?"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,682.857,684.641,"No, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,691.702,693.051,Like what?
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,693.051,697.542,"Deprivation of property without due process, taking a property without just compensation."
1979.79-602,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,697.542,704.396,"I don't just -- I just don't understand how you get to that, how you get that before us, if it's not in the record?"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,704.396,705.062,"I beg your pardon, Your Honor?"
1979.79-602,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,705.062,709.824,I don't say you get anything before us that is not on the record?
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,709.824,714.578,We were denied the opportunity to have a day in court to put on this evidence.
1979.79-602,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,714.578,718.955,You did have some day -- you're in Court.
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,722.087,723.589,"Well, it wasn't a summary judgment."
1979.79-602,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,726.234,729.579,"(Voice Overlap) in summary judgments, you don't get to put your evidence in either, do you?"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,729.579,733.993,"Well, of course, but had the matter gone as far to summary judgment, there are at least it would --"
1979.79-602,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,733.993,734.173,Would you --
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,734.173,735.681,-- have been evidentiary facts before the courts.
1979.79-602,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,735.681,739.53,"You wouldn't have been complaining then, I think you're complaining about the procedure."
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,739.53,740.887,"Oh, no, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,749.737,751.378,Did you make an offer to proof?
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,751.378,755.428,"There was no opportunity ever to make one, because this was on a general demurrer."
1979.79-602,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,755.428,758.685,Were you -- were you handcuffed?
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,758.685,760.572,"Your Honor, under California law what --"
1979.79-602,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,760.572,764.557,"I said, did you offer to make an offer of proof?"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,764.557,765.233,"Your Honor, that is not --"
1979.79-602,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,765.233,765.583,Did you ask --
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,765.583,767.76,-- permitted under California law.
1979.79-602,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,768.585,772.485,"Well, then you're complaining about California procedure."
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,772.485,776.089,"Well, may I make -- may I use a hypothesis, Your Honor?"
1979.79-602,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,800.158,804.373,That's a rock and this case is an orange.
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,804.373,806.696,"[Laughter] Well, may I point out this."
1979.79-602,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,810.259,811.153,(Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,811.153,827.271,"-- we were never -- perhaps, only that, but we were never permitted to put on evidence or even to plead in amended form any additional facts to show that in fact, this ordinance deprives the owner of all reasonable use and value."
1979.79-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,827.271,834.221,"You would have tried to prove that this -- that under this ordinance, you could -- that the land was unusable?"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,834.221,835.359,"Yes, we --"
1979.79-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,835.359,835.463,And --
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,835.463,836.517,"-- and only could've tried, we looked down --"
1979.79-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,836.517,839.665,You would -- you would have just as an economic matter or you just couldn't --
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,839.665,841.283,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,842.479,850.413,"And as so in effect, this was a -- this was a device, and a -- and an effective device to maintain open spaces --"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,850.413,850.675,Precisely.
1979.79-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,850.675,851.75,-- without paying for it?
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,851.75,853.49,That's precisely what happened.
1979.79-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,868.974,874.238,Did you ask the -- did make you make this argument before the California court?
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,874.238,875.009,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,878.901,879.054,"Well, I know, but did you --"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,879.054,879.629,And that is the record before the Court.
1979.79-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,879.629,889.706,"-- did you -- did you say that you were, you were denied -- being denied due process by not -- not being able to put on your proof?"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,889.706,892.412,"Oh, yes, Your Honor, that was the -- that was the -- my argument."
1979.79-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,892.412,894.559,What did the Court say about that?
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,894.559,896.27,The Court has simply said that --
1979.79-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,896.27,897.134,Did they ignore it or what?
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,897.134,900.141,-- it didn't care to deal with that.
1979.79-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,928.117,934.254,"Mr. Kanner, maybe I'm missing something here, but if I understand correctly, the first cause of action was action for damages?"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,934.254,935.075,"Inverse condemnation, yes Your Honor."
1979.79-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,935.075,937.089,"And they held, there is no such remedy as in (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,937.089,937.9,That is correct.
1979.79-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,937.9,939.291,"So, they didn't grant you leave to amend."
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,944.545,945.282,On its face.
1979.79-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,945.282,947.588,"Now, where in this -- and you were given leave to amend, (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,947.588,948.137,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,948.137,949.008,-- but you declined?
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,949.008,949.548,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,949.548,956.857,What allegation in the second cause of action do you principally rely on as indicating that you could prove that you can even build five houses?
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,956.857,957.51,The second cause --
1979.79-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,957.51,958.439,No one here could allege that?
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,958.439,964.38,"The second cause of action was not amended for that very reason, Your Honor.There isn't really much to be said, but under --"
1979.79-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,964.38,966.825,"But then, you concede you could build five houses?"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,966.825,967.735,"No Your Honor, we do not."
1979.79-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,967.735,969.407,"If you haven't alleged you couldn't, I don't understand --"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,969.407,972.157,"Well, that's what I'm trying to respond to, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1005.225,1007.291,It could never pleaded that.
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,1007.291,1008.409,"Well, that was -- that was --"
1979.79-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1008.409,1008.556,Do you say is the (Voice Overlap) --

1979.79-602,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1009.12,1011.784,-- California law they would not allow you to plead that theory?
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,1011.784,1015.601,"Well, were not allowed to plead any evidentiary facts of course."
1979.79-602,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1016.377,1018.585,You don't even plead the conclusion.
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,1018.585,1019.055,"I beg your pardon, Your Honor?"
1979.79-602,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1019.055,1022.035,"You don't even plead the conclusion, as I read the second cause of action."
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,1022.035,1026.415,"Well, the second cause of action, Your Honor, is only directed to the face of the ordinance."
1979.79-602,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1058.94,1073.138,"There is no way in California that you could've -- other than asking for money damages, there's no way as a matter California law on which you could've filed some kind of a complaint in which you said, there's an ordinance here that says I can build five houses, but I really can't build the five houses?"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,1073.138,1073.289,That's what --
1979.79-602,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1073.289,1075.267,No way you could -- you could tender that issue.
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,1075.267,1079.259,"Well, there was a way to tender it the way we did and that been fact."
1979.79-602,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1079.259,1079.778,But you didn't question --
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,1079.778,1082.16,"They inverse condemnation, indeed, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1096.527,1115.278,"Mr. Kanner, supposing that this Court were to hold that California under our -- the Federal Constitution has the perfect right to withhold the remedy of inverse condemnation, so has it grant you the right to establish the unconstitutionality of the particular ordinance."
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,1118.734,1119.778,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1119.778,1127.299,"Where -- where in -- in the record, may I ask, or in the jurisdictional statement or appendix, is your complaint?"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,1127.299,1130.885,The complaint as contained in a joint appendix Your Honor.
1979.79-602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1130.885,1131.591,What color --
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,1131.591,1147.579,"It is -- begins at page 3, that's brief --"
1979.79-602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1147.579,1158.217,"Oh, thank you."
1979.79-602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1158.217,1169.973,"Suppose, Mr. Kanner, that your friends on the other side had come in, in their brief and tendered on behalf of the city, assurance that you could build one house on each of the 5 acres --"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,1169.973,1170.174,Well --
1979.79-602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1170.174,1172.364,-- would you still be here making these arguments?
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,1172.364,1173.228,"No, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1193.286,1196.442,How about one house for the entire 5 acres?
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,1196.442,1198.771,That is a matter of physical impossibility.
1979.79-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1310.802,1321.251,"Well, I understand you to say awhile ago that if it were stipulated that -- that you could build five house, one house per -- per acre, that you wouldn't be here?"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,1321.251,1322.353,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1322.353,1325.64,Because then you would say the economically feasible to develop to property?
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,1325.64,1326.493,That is my understanding --
1979.79-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1326.493,1328.176,And there would be no taking?
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,1328.176,1331.55,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1331.607,1334.473,But you're -- but you're never applying for that?
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,1334.473,1334.667,Well --
1979.79-602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1334.667,1336.228,You never sought to get to --
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,1336.228,1345.031,"Well, Your Honor, again, we get back to the point of we have here an extensive record of city commitments suggest the exact position."
1979.79-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1379.711,1382.688,And what's -- what's the clear-cut case of utility?
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,1390.797,1391.544,In --
1979.79-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1391.544,1391.73,-- with the authority.
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,1391.73,1394.764,"-- in California, that's quite a major undertaking which in this case it cause --"
1979.79-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1394.764,1403.073,"Well, let's assume whatever it is -- let's assume you -- why do you say it would be futile?"
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,1403.073,1410.334,We -- because we have here longstanding city announcement that of commitment to the acquisition of this property for its open space (Voice Overlap) --
1979.79-602,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1410.334,1414.711,So you do -- you think they would just turn you down to -- to build five houses?
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,1414.711,1415.532,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1512.405,1514.929,Your client was reimbursed for his expenses and then --
1979.79-602,0,25570,gideon_kanner,,1514.929,1519.844,There was reimbursed for the attorney's fees and -- and litigation expenses.
1979.79-602,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1540.606,1544.626,"Very well, Mr. Kanner."
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,1546.0,1548.135,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.79-602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1583.419,1613.532,"Mr. -- Mr. Shute, let -- let me refer to you to part of a page 13 of the joint appendix where the allegation is that the -- number seven that the ordinance and question is arbitrary, capricious and reasonable and therefore, constituted so taking their property without payment of just compensation violation the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment, in prohibiting such."
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,1642.338,1656.355,"Well, Your Honor, I think the answer lies in the fact that the California Supreme Court took judicial notice at the zoning ordinance and under California law and federal cases who have done the same, in effect, considered the terms of the zoning ordinance to be a part of the complaint or a part of the record before the Court."
1979.79-602,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1674.205,1685.699,"What do you have to say about Mr. Kanner's suggestion that an application to build five houses, one per acre, would've been utterly futile?"
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,1685.699,1688.4,"I think, Your Honor, that's an incorrect contention."
1979.79-602,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1705.065,1706.295,The master plan for how many units?
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,1706.295,1707.64,For the -- up to five units.
1979.79-602,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1707.64,1708.981,Just for the 5 acres?
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,1708.981,1718.872,"Because the zoning ordinance calls for a maximum density of one home per acre, which if the land values are such as has been alleged, would certainly, yield very substantial values."
1979.79-602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1739.339,1749.44,"But did the city in this response, make any defense that you haven't even taken this before the zoning board or the land development board, whatever you have."
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,1758.439,1774.411,"Actually, an alternative ground of the demurrer was a lack of jurisdiction which under California law, the doctrine of exhaustion the administrative remedy is jurisdictional.And one of the grounds of the city's demurrer was the court lack jurisdiction precisely because of the failure to exhaust administrative remedies."
1979.79-602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1774.411,1788.894,And was it up -- is -- is it your contention that it was -- the demurrer was sustained because of that reason or that the Supreme Court of California upheld the Superior Court's ruling because of that reason?
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,1788.894,1799.465,"I think, Your Honor, that it implicitly did in the sense that it also refused to speculate as to how many units might be appropriate by court action prior to administrative of action."
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1811.45,1824.57,"Until -- until there had been some attempt to -- to get a plan approved, you couldn't really tell how the ordinance was going to be applied?"
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,1824.57,1825.19,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1825.19,1829.477,"And hence, the only issue that was left was the facial validity."
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,1829.477,1830.864,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1830.864,1848.959,"Well, how much -- is it your position that the city could've waited five or 10 years for them to get a master plan approved and meanwhile, these owners could have been a kind of held in suspense until the master plan was finally approved?"
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,1848.959,1850.211,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1855.119,1860.379,"So, the owner can simply submit a master plan for his 5 acres to the zoning board?"
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,1860.379,1868.659,"That's correct and a further point I would make, Your Honor, is under the California Government Code and they have the numbers transverse, 65950."
1979.79-602,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1887.839,1888.963,After what period of time?
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,1888.963,1892.044,"After a one year period, but that's on a statewide basis."
1979.79-602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1898.829,1916.927,"Mr. Shute, I wonder if you'd comment on Mr. Kanner's reference to subparagraph (e) on -- on page 32 of the jurisdictional statement, “Permanents of open space that the part about land to be preserved as open space shall be maintained as permanent open space by dedication of the city of fee title or scenic easements and the like.”"
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,1916.927,1921.512,"Well, Your Honor, I would -- I respond to that in two ways."
1979.79-602,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1953.859,1960.51,"Well, if the city can call the dedication pursuant to that paragraph, would there be compensation paid for the debt which was dedicated?"
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,1960.51,1964.229,"Well, no."
1979.79-602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1970.194,1970.434,Yes.
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,1970.434,1976.847,"-- and part dedications, dedications for roadways and such as that have generally been held to be non-compensable."
1979.79-602,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2017.948,2032.85,"Well, Mr. Shute, you're simply answering the questions posed to you by members of the Court, but really, aren't all these things matters for the -- for a trial court, and isn't that -- doesn't that show why a demurrer was improper?"
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2072.3,2078.639,"Because, Your Honor, the California Supreme Court took that demurrer together with the city's zoning ordinances and pointed out that the --"
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2078.639,2078.856,"Yes, but not all of us --"
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2078.856,2080.324,-- ordinance has allowed use.
1979.79-602,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2080.324,2091.176,"But you're -- you weren't referring the zoning ordinances, you were referring to all sorts of other permutations and combinations and possibilities."
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2095.437,2096.286,"Well, to show --"
1979.79-602,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2096.286,2099.566,(Voice Overlap) that the allegation of the complaint is -- is factually mistaken.
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2099.566,2105.269,"I think there's a very strong policy here, of protecting zoning and land use regulation affirm --"
1979.79-602,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2105.269,2110.443,"Well, the Constitution imposed a very strong policy, have not taken anybody's property without paying for it."
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2110.443,2111.619,"That's quite correct, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2111.619,2121.038,"If they -- if they allege -- if the owner alleges that it has been taken, a -- a demurrer is not a satisfactory responsive, it seemed to me."
1979.79-602,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2128.66,2143.132,"Is that -- is that issue somewhat moved from the case, by your friend's concession, which at least I understood him to make that he understands, he can build one house on the 5 acres?"
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2143.132,2144.845,"I think that's correct, in terms of substantive process."
1979.79-602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2144.845,2147.323,I thought it was five houses on the 5 acres?
1979.79-602,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2147.323,2149.496,"No, he -- his response was that he knows."
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2156.274,2163.261,"And his further response as I recall was that if he -- if they were allowed to build five, they would -- that would satisfy their expectations."
1979.79-602,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2185.972,2196.011,"Mr. Shute has the -- which it -- as of right now, can the appellants apply for a master plan (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2196.011,2196.603,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2196.603,2197.7,They -- they can do that right now?
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2197.7,2200.174,They could have throughout this proceeding.
1979.79-602,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2200.174,2202.175,And regardless of what happens in this case?
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2202.175,2203.629,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2204.506,2207.374,"Well, what are we here for?"
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2207.374,2216.381,"It might -- I -- I believe the Court maybe interested in some of the issues raised by the complaint, but we respectfully submit that most of those issues really aren't raised in this case."
1979.79-602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2216.381,2220.167,"Mr. Shute, just to get one thing in -- through my head."
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2229.312,2234.88,"They passed the ordinance and also, Your Honor, there was the imminent domain action, which was filed and terminated."
1979.79-602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2234.88,2236.813,But that's -- that's all over.
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2239.034,2239.61,That's correct.
1979.79-602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2239.61,2253.846,"So, the only legal -- only -- only significant, only step that has any legal effect that's outstanding now on their property is the ordinance itself and so the question really is whether the ordinance on its face, constitutes a taking, is that?"
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2253.846,2254.329,That's correct.
1979.79-602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2254.329,2262.47,"And that's what the Supreme Court said, “If you read the ordinance the way we read it,” the California Supreme Court, they're still free to build some houses if they file appropriate plan?"
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2262.47,2263.406,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2275.584,2275.739,"Well, I suppose --"
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2275.739,2276.681,-- and further observes that it could --
1979.79-602,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2276.681,2290.057,"-- I suppose you would concede that if a zoning ordinance said you can build one house in 5 acres of real estate, in the center of Manhattan Island that would basically be a taking, because everybody knows that's economically impossible."
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2290.057,2291.429,"I think that's correct, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2291.436,2298.261,"In the complaint and the -- the allegation in this complaint is that this zoning ordinance is equivalent of that, as I understand it."
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2298.261,2299.772,With the exception that the character of the area --

1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2304.086,2312.232,"I respectfully submit, no, Your Honor, because the allegations of the complaint themselves indicate the nature of this land, the high values of the land for residential use."
1979.79-602,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2322.192,2333.057,"Well, you would concede I suppose, if the City of Tiburon had -- had taken this property and just moved in and turned it into a public park, that there would've been an action for a so-called, “inverse condemnation”."
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2333.057,2334.5,"Well, that would have been you're a classic case --"
1979.79-602,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2334.5,2335.273,Would you concede that?
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2335.273,2339.382,"-- of physical invasion and that requires compensation, but there's a world of difference between that kind of --"
1979.79-602,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2339.382,2343.161,"Well, the -- the complaint in this case says there isn't any difference."
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2343.161,2343.826,But those are the --
1979.79-602,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2343.826,2346.511,And isn't that a matter then for evidence.
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2346.511,2352.974,"To the extent the complaint equates this zoning with a physical use, it's really making a legal argument and not -- not a factual argument and that is why we think --"
1979.79-602,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2352.974,2362.425,"Well, what if the zoning ordinances the City of New York said, if you own -- said to an owner of 5 acres of unimproved land, you can build exactly one residence on there, in the middle of New York."
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2381.763,2391.302,"I think in a circumstance such as that, it might be appropriate to go beyond the demurrer stage and that is why I've concentrated on the facts, because I don't believe that that can be fairly said of the facts of this case."
1979.79-602,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2391.302,2413.717,"Mr. Kanner, a while ago -- Mr. Justice White, put a question to your friend and summarized what the highest court of California has said namely that is -- is clear said the Supreme Court of California that they can build from one to five houses on this property."
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2419.698,2429.251,That is what the Court held and it's our position that the -- that establishes the facial validity of the ordinance by indicating a substantial use and the potential for up to five homes.
1979.79-602,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2434.201,2447.815,"Under California law, if -- if there had been no appeal taken here, could the -- the owners have applied them for five buildings on the 5 acres?"
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2447.815,2448.593,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2448.593,2469.285,"And if the decision was thought to be arbitrary in the sense that it was done for subsurface purpose of keeping this property completely open, destroying its value as he said, would that be within the reach of litigation in California courts?"
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2469.285,2476.176,"Yes, it would, Your Honor, because following the exhaustion of administrative remedies, all issues tendered in that proceeding would be before a court for review."
1979.79-602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2481.861,2505.214,"Do you -- you say, basically the validity of the Supreme Court of California's judgment can be sustained on the exhaustion of I'd mean, the failure to exhaust administrative remedies regardless of whether or not, the complaint should've -- could've been demurred to on the merits so to speaks, saying there was no taking?"
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2505.214,2506.157,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2509.178,2510.479,Do you think it was?
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2510.479,2516.478,"I think it implicitly was because the Court construed the facial validity of the ordinance which under California law, can be attacked --"
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2516.478,2516.587,Now --
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2516.587,2517.417,-- by declaratory relief.
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2517.417,2518.993,-- we say as applied issue.
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2518.993,2522.869,"And did not reach, the as applied issue, which is an aspect of exhaustion."
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2531.144,2538.814,"So, say -- if you say -- if - if owner applies for -- files this plan and says, “I want to build five houses.”"
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2549.897,2550.01,Yes.
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2550.01,2552.088,-- because this is economically impossible.”
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2552.088,2554.677,That's correct.
1979.79-602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2598.534,2602.368,Was the ordinance passed before or after the appellants acquired their property?
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2602.368,2606.713,It was required -- passed after they acquired the property.
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2606.713,2609.263,What is the nature zone prior to that time?
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2609.263,2620.543,"Your Honor, the zoning prior to that time is not alleged in the complaint and the best I can do is to go somewhat outside the record and point out and then one of the amici briefs said the conservation foundation they included as an appendix."
1979.79-602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2627.376,2634.505,Which would've automatically entitled them to build one house per acre or five houses on these 5-acres?
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2634.505,2635.24,"Well, yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2656.886,2670.411,But do you think the California Supreme Court has held in this opinion that this ordinance is valid even if the city will permit only one house on this line?
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2670.411,2672.029,Following completion of the administrative --
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2672.029,2672.42,Well --
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2672.42,2673.381,process?
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2676.133,2687.489,"Well, that -- it seemed to say that the ordinance is valid because it will allow one to five, which seems to include that it's valid even if -- even if the city allows only one house (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2687.489,2697.501,"Well, I think -- it -- more, it includes the idea that it might allow up to five and looking it at that way, it would be valid and we don't know until the process is completed."
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2704.188,2718.627,"Well, I take that the city's position is that however, since it passed this ordinance said it -- that the ordinance would be valid, even if it permitted only one house on this land."
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2718.627,2730.169,"Well, Your Honor, I would think that the city would be astute and fair enough to realize that if the good case was made in the planning process, that one home was totally uneconomic that they would allow additional homes."
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2732.324,2732.712,You'd rather --
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2732.712,2733.632,-- this process go forward.
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2733.632,2738.114,You'd rather decide maybe to take the land and pay for it?
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2738.114,2745.58,"I think we are through with that, but possibly, yes."
1979.79-602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2926.396,2936.722,"Well, does -- does that mean that any claim -- any cause of action for monitory damages is suspect, because it has a, “chilling effect”?"
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2936.722,2942.189,"I think, Your Honor, in the circumstance such as these zoning ordinances where you're dealing with a regulatory act that --"
1979.79-602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2942.189,2947.154,"Well, all state actions in effect, are regulatory actions, aren't they?"
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,2947.154,2953.489,"I think that where a State moves or local agency moves by eminent domain, it's not a regulatory act."
1979.79-602,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2992.891,3001.602,I have trouble with your eminent domain being legislative and attributable.I thought it was judicial?
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,3001.602,3008.638,"Well, I think that the -- that the decision to proceed in eminent domain is a legislative decision and then the process of determining --"
1979.79-602,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3008.638,3009.787,(Voice Overlap) piece of paper.
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,3009.787,3010.479,That's correct and of course the --
1979.79-602,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3010.479,3016.399,Therefore -- then that's the end of the legislative (Inaudible)
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,3016.399,3028.891,But the key aspect is that the choice to expend public funds by beginning the proceedings starts with the legislative body.
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3030.53,3037.865,"Well, let me, you say there was a -- the question was reduced to a facial attack here."
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,3050.274,3050.851,Well --
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3050.851,3057.304,-- whether the ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to this piece of property?
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,3057.304,3059.002,"That's correct, but still the ordinance says --"
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3059.002,3067.535,"I know, but let's assume the judgment -- let's assume the Supreme Court had -- had ruled in -- in the plaintiff's saver."
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,3074.961,3076.107,That's correct.
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3076.352,3081.764,It's just about this piece of -- just about this piece -- about this piece of property.
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,3117.988,3127.333,"Well, Your Honor, I respectfully disagree I think that what the Court was saying is a guaranteed minimum of one and anything above that, the city might grant in taking that as a totality."
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3132.454,3132.582,And --
1979.79-602,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3132.582,3136.321,"Well, did -- did the Court say that in -- that that was what troubled me."
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,3168.202,3179.916,"I don't think that the -- in fact, I know the Court's opinion does not discuss administrative remedies, but I think implicit in the Court's ruling was the notion of, “We will take today the facial validity of this ordinance.”"
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3179.916,3180.658,But the only --
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,3180.658,3186.649,And we will not anticipate how many units might be approved because that is something which would require the completion of its planning process.
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3186.649,3197.68,"But if you were a prospective buyer and read or if -- if somebody came around to ask you to buy this piece of property and you said, say “Well, what can I use it for?”"
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,3228.623,3228.885,"Well, I think --"
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3228.885,3230.544,Within under the zoning ordinance?
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,3230.544,3230.716,There just --
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3230.716,3237.027,Until somebody goes through this -- this operation and finds out whether you can build five or four or three?
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,3237.027,3240.349,That's why -- that's why I think the allegations of the complaint are so important.
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3251.013,3251.897,Up to one unit?
1979.79-602,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3261.944,3269.644,"Well, as I read the California Supreme Court's opinion again, the very point that Mr. Justice White called attention to before."
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,3308.293,3309.705,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3318.084,3320.91,Let me ask you this -- let me ask you this.
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,3353.9,3355.565,"I don't dispute that Your Honor, but I think --"
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3355.565,3357.672,It would be how many X?
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,3358.554,3360.275,I'm not in an appraiser and a land expert.
1979.79-602,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3360.275,3362.52,"You may not -- well, that's it."
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,3366.758,3372.079,"That's true, but I think the -- the regulatory authority is entitled to say, “Here's a piece of land with many variables."

1979.79-602,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3382.86,3388.295,"And so what they are expected to do is apply for the five before the complaint, is that (Voice Overlap) --"
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,3388.295,3390.889,"That's -- that is correct, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3390.889,3397.457,"There'd been something like 29 or 30 briefs filed in this case, how many of them do you think, I have to read to understand the issue?"
1979.79-602,1,23253,e_clement_shute_jr,,3398.45,3401.853,"Of course, just my brief, Your Honor."
1979.79-602,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3403.822,3406.749,Mr. Kanner?
1979.79-602,2,25570,gideon_kanner,,3406.749,3408.276,May it please the Court.
1979.79-602,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3421.84,3439.501,"Well, that's perhaps because of the way you undertook to set this litigation in motion, instead of asking for what is provided under California -- under the city's ordinance, an opportunity to get five sites and you passed that opportunity and plunged right in to the total litigation."
1979.79-602,2,25570,gideon_kanner,,3439.501,3453.135,"Well, may I respectfully point up and call to the Court's attention the basic American seminal case, Euclid versus Ambler, whereat 272 U.S. 386."
1979.79-602,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3589.443,3596.551,(Voice Overlap) that's -- that's -- they -- they were there talking about whether you could get damages and --
1979.79-602,2,25570,gideon_kanner,,3596.551,3597.702,That's right.
1979.79-602,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3597.702,3606.396,"I -- as I read -- as I read that -- the opinion it's on the assumption there was a taking, can you get a -- can you get damages or are you limited to do an injunction."
1979.79-602,2,25570,gideon_kanner,,3606.396,3606.608,Well --
1979.79-602,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3606.608,3614.37,"And they reached that issue and we don't -- and if we agree there is a taking here, I suppose we don't even reach this part of the case."
1979.79-602,2,25570,gideon_kanner,,3614.37,3619.915,"Well, but yet, that was the -- that is what made Agins versus Tiburon the landmark California case."

1979.79-602,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3621.45,3625.964,-- maybe -- maybe but you can't -- but we don't do our -- we don't --
