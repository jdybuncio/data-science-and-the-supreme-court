2008.07-1239,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.32,"We will hear argument first in Case 07-1239, Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council."
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,8.454,26.833,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The ability to locate and track an enemy submarine through the use of mid-frequency active sonar is vitally important to the survival of our naval strike groups deployed around the world and therefore critical to the nation's own security."
2008.07-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,81.468,105.499,"General Garre, when you address the injunction, do you mean the injunction as originally ordered by the district court or are you taking account of the modification made by the Ninth Circuit, and would you say that the three points you just made would apply as well to the injunction as modified?"
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,105.499,108.201,"Certainly we would, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.07-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,139.238,140.138,Say it again?
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,140.94,151.795,The Ninth Circuit framed its modifications in terms of a partial stay of its decision affirming the district court's preliminary injunction.
2008.07-1239,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,159.801,163.77,"That's the temporary stay pending certiorari, right?"
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,163.77,164.205,Right.
2008.07-1239,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,164.205,174.144,I think what Justice Ginsburg was talking about -- and she can correct me if I am wrong -- were the modifications from the initial preliminary injunction and the modified preliminary injunction.
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,174.144,203.097,"Well, yes, we are here complaining about the restriction on the 2200-yard shutdown requirement, where if a marine mammal comes within 2200 yards of a naval vessel part of one of these strike groups it has to shut down sonar operations, as well as the 75 percent powerdown requirement when significant surface ducting conditions are present regardless of the presence of marine mammals."
2008.07-1239,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,203.097,206.532,You mentioned the effect on naval operations.
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,225.677,239.686,The record -- and here I'm referring to the environmental assessment and the opinion of the National Marine Fisheries Services in the petition appendix and the joint appendix -- indicates that no marine mammal will be killed as a result of these exercises.
2008.07-1239,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,286.401,287.517,Just as to dolphins?
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,287.517,294.757,"The vast majority of those disturbances, some almost 90 percent, pertain only to dolphins."
2008.07-1239,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,294.757,299.042,And what percentage is that of the total population in the area?
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,299.042,307.564,"Well, I think that the statistics I have indicate that there are more than I think 500,000 dolphins on the western coast there."
2008.07-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,364.936,374.709,You didn't mention the 564 exposures that were typed Level A in the environmental assessment.
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,374.709,380.946,"With respect to beaked whales, Justice Ginsburg, that's correct."
2008.07-1239,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,411.965,414.05,"In lay terms, what does that mean?"
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,420.338,431.145,"--In most cases it means that there's an alerting response, they hear the sound and they go in the opposite direction, as one who hears a noise that disturbs them would ordinarily do."
2008.07-1239,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,441.334,444.453,"It doesn't necessarily mean that there's a physical injury to them, does it?"
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,444.453,444.955,No.
2008.07-1239,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,444.955,447.005,It means that they may just swim in a different direction.
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,447.005,447.607,That's right.
2008.07-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,458.113,470.686,"I thought the 564 number was Level A, which I also thought meant exposure resulting in severe harm."
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,470.686,473.222,"It is confusing, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.07-1239,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,519.786,522.721,"May I ask this question, Mr. Solicitor General."
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,528.875,545.937,"Yes, there is, because we're not here arguing that, at this point, that we had no duty to prepare an environmental impact statement because of the intervening event of the Council for Environmental Quality's emergency circumstances alternative arrangements determination."
2008.07-1239,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,550.722,551.39,Let me follow that.
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,559.311,575.123,"Yes, it's one of the alternative arrangements that the Navy agreed to, is that the environmental impact statement which has been under way will be completed by January 2009 with respect to all activities in the Southern California Operating Area."
2008.07-1239,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,590.8,597.453,"Why didn't you -- I mean, you emphasize the level of detail and comprehensiveness of the environmental assessment that the Navy prepared."
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,606.725,623.521,"Because the Navy devoted its best resources to this and in good faith, as is indicate bide the 293-page environmental assessment, concluded that there would not be a finding of significant environmental impact, and at that point everyone agrees an environmental impact statement is not required."
2008.07-1239,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,623.521,624.471,Suppose you have to do it.
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,633.059,639.965,"It's going to be completed by January 2009, Justice Breyer, under the alternative arrangements that have been approved--"
2008.07-1239,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,639.965,641.032,So we're talking about two months.
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,641.032,642.334,"--Well, at this point we are."
2008.07-1239,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,667.133,677.405,"I take it that you're are here because you find the decision of the Ninth Circuit, and I take it of the district court, prejudicial for the government on an ongoing basis; and what are the principal reasons for that?"
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,677.405,681.042,"Because of its impact on national security, Justice Kennedy."
2008.07-1239,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,681.042,682.875,And what particular errors?
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,693.517,696.802,"I think there are three fundamental flaws, as I indicated."
2008.07-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,707.36,714.93,Where was the statutory authority suspending the obligation to provide an EIS?
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,722.766,724.718,--I think we would point to a couple of things.
2008.07-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,739.944,741.663,"No, but that's not the question I am asking."
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,752.887,754.271,--Well--
2008.07-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,754.271,762.077,"That's what -- as I understand it, that's what you're arguing in effect, as an intervening -- as of intervening legal significance."
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,766.345,777.753,"--The statutory authority that we find in NEPA for the CEQ's regulation providing for alternative arrangements is -- first, it's acknowledged by this Court that CEQ has rulemaking authority."
2008.07-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,782.906,783.223,Okay.
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,793.512,806.106,"Well, let me -- I'll answer the question, but let me be clear: The government's position is that we are complying with NEPA by -- by complying with the alternative arrangements provided by the Council on Environmental Quality."
2008.07-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,806.106,813.193,"But you -- I mean, the claim is that you weren't complying with it at the time the request for an injunction was brought, and everything else is consequent on that."
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,840.677,847.016,"And I would point, Your Honor, to the language in NEPA that says it should be complied with to the fullest extent possible--"
2008.07-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,847.016,847.383,That--
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,847.383,847.883,--and I would--
2008.07-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,847.883,848.649,--seems to cut against you.
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,849.449,865.31,"--Well, that language, coupled with -- which seems to us to suggest that compliance to the fullest extent possible would depend on the circumstances, coupled with the fact that NEPA doesn't impose, doesn't say what the consequences of noncompliance would be--"
2008.07-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,865.31,865.794,"Okay, but--"
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,865.794,866.21,--but other--
2008.07-1239,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,866.21,871.464,"But why -- I don't know if this is Justice Souter's question, but why CEQ?"
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,883.689,897.366,"--Well, this Court has acknowledged in numerous cases, Methow Valley and in the Public Citizen case a few years ago, that NEPA gives CEQ rulemaking authority, and that this Court gives substantial deference to the CEQ's rules."
2008.07-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,897.366,899.082,Rulemaking to do what?
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,907.571,909.423,"To implement the statute, that's right."
2008.07-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,973.58,991.041,"But what good is it if, as I understand it, the whole training program will be over in December, and then the environmental impact statement, which was supposed to come first, is going to come after the whole project is concluded?"
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,991.041,1005.568,"Well, it has -- it's important because the environmental impact statement that's going to be completed pertains not only to COMPTUEX and JTF exercises that will be completed in the Southern California Operating Area in the future, but all activities."
2008.07-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1008.337,1009.722,--Let me -- let me switch back.
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1062.673,1064.056,I think--
2008.07-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1064.056,1075.997,"And I guess my question is, to the extent that there was an emergency, wasn't the emergency created by the failure of the Navy to take any timely action?"
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1126.08,1128.382,"--For several reasons, Justice Souter."
2008.07-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1135.703,1137.138,"Well, it was a gap of less than month, right?"
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1137.138,1141.857,"I believe -- I believe that's right, but there was a gap and there's no -- I don't think there can be any--"
2008.07-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1141.857,1147.493,"And how long does it -- how long does it take -- going back to Justice Breyer's question, how long does it take to prepare an environmental impact statement?"
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1148.593,1148.826,"--Well, I--"
2008.07-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1148.826,1149.276,"--It takes more than a month, doesn't it."
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1149.276,1150.026,--Sure.
2008.07-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1150.392,1150.792,Okay.
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1150.792,1151.126,But I don't think--
2008.07-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1151.126,1157.03,"And the Navy knew more than the 1st -- earlier than the 1st of February that it was going to engage in these exercises, didn't it?"
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1157.03,1167.488,"--It did, and it also knew that it was in the process of finalizing an environmental impact statement that it prepared in good faith, a 293-page statement, which concluded that there would be--"
2008.07-1239,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1167.488,1168.654,An environmental assessment.
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1168.654,1172.689,"--An environmental assessment, that's right, with the finding of no significant environmental impact."
2008.07-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1195.055,1202.494,"Sure, but they wouldn't have been in the situation in January of 2008 if they hadn't been in the situation I described in February of 2007."
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1206.946,1207.979,Well--
2008.07-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1207.979,1210.581,--in 2007.
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1210.581,1217.753,"--Well, with respect, I don't think that a 293-page environmental assessment with the kind of detail and support that this assessment has--"
2008.07-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1217.753,1232.596,"--Look, the problem you face -- and maybe you're being whipsawed -- is that you are effectively estopped from the argument that no EIS is necessary by the fact that you have agreed to these alternative arrangements."
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1253.443,1254.093,"--Well, that's right."
2008.07-1239,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1263.549,1266.567,That's exactly what Justice Kennedy started to ask.
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1284.863,1287.648,"The other two are: One, the injunction."
2008.07-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1302.074,1313.132,"Didn't both the circuit and the district court, although they mentioned that, in fact find that it was -- I forget what their phrase was -- beyond question."
2008.07-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1313.132,1314.75,"Near -- ""near certainty""."
2008.07-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1314.75,1315.2,"""Near certainty""."
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1315.2,1317.234,"They did, Justice Souter, and we think--"
2008.07-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1317.234,1318.369,There is no -- there is no harm.
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1324.523,1328.308,"--Well, I don't think that a court could say that, Justice Souter, for a couple of reasons."
2008.07-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1340.382,1350.59,"Well, we -- we may, but so far as the case is concerned we may -- and we frequently do -- say there -- there -- that certainly there's no harm in this case, the error was harmless."
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1350.59,1356.511,"And, two, the finding, which is a sentence in the district court decision repeated by the court of appeals, of"
2008.07-1239,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1373.403,1373.703,Let me ask you--
2008.07-1239,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1373.703,1374.153,"Mr. Garre, could I ask you a question?"
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1374.153,1374.537,Yes.
2008.07-1239,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1374.537,1391.214,"If this were not a Navy case with all of the implications of the Navy, but an ordinary case in which it was demonstrated that an EIS had to be filed, would it not be normal -- normal action to enjoin the -- the government action until the EIS was filed?"
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1407.808,1409.993,"I don't think it is, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-1239,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1419.516,1422.8,--Would the irreparable injury have to -- and this just repeats Justice Stevens's question.
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1433.608,1434.225,You do.
2008.07-1239,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1434.225,1438.845,Do you have authority for that in the -- are the circuits unanimous on that point?
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1438.845,1444.333,"Well, I don't have authority for that precise proposition because I don't--"
2008.07-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1444.333,1445.933,"Well, yes, you do, but it may not be in the circuits."
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1454.855,1455.522,--Well--
2008.07-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1455.522,1461.009,And -- and the only injury that -- that follows from the mere failure to file an--
2008.07-1239,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1465.079,1465.512,"Then, let's -- let's assume standing."
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1468.698,1471.4,"--I -- I think that that's right, Judge Scalia."
2008.07-1239,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1471.4,1482.291,"Well, I wouldn't -- look, you have an EIS for the reason that the agency itself, once it reads it, might decide to do something else."
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1509.025,1522.166,"Clearly, the purpose of the requirements under NEPA are to ensure that the agency has -- is making an informed decision, and here I don't think there is any question that the Navy was after its 293-page assessment."
2008.07-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1523.349,1527.07,"But that -- in effect, you are saying the EA is the equivalent to an EIS."
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1527.07,1528.87,"--No, I'm not, Justice Souter."
2008.07-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1529.439,1530.622,What is the difference between them?
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1536.426,1537.326,"--That's right, but then--"
2008.07-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1537.326,1548.65,"So that without the EIS, the Navy is acting in -- in a state of -- of some degree of ignorance greater than would be the case if -- if it had done -- done the EIS."
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1548.65,1550.602,--I -- the EIS--
2008.07-1239,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1550.602,1555.32,"And that, I presume, is the harm that the -- that the statute is intended to prevent."
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1555.32,1559.874,--But it is not a likely -- they have not shown a likelihood of irreparable injury.
2008.07-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1559.874,1572.432,The EA demonstrates in your view that the EIS would -- would very likely say that this -- this action by the Navy is okay.
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1584.089,1585.206,"Well, we agree with that."
2008.07-1239,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1598.233,1611.157,"Are there any authorities in the circuits which would indicate that irreparable injury is not required when there's standing, when an EIS is required, when an EIS has not been prepared, and when the government is ready to proceed?"
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1615.045,1629.035,"--Justice Kennedy, I haven't completed that -- that research with respect to all of the circuits, but I am confident in saying I am not aware of a decision in which a court has said that the irreparable injury requirement does not have to be met or is automatically met."
2008.07-1239,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1629.035,1635.006,The whole theory of the -- of the environmental impact statement is that we don't really know what the harm will be.
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1640.76,1643.778,"And it may be easier in some cases than others, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-1239,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1648.599,1653.92,"But you're really arguing that an -- that a temporary statement is enough, will always be enough."
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1653.92,1656.336,"--We're not taking that position, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-1239,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1660.49,1668.262,"In all -- in all of these cases it is controverted, or in most of them, whether an EIS is either necessary -- is even necessary."
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1678.785,1679.535,I think that's right.
2008.07-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1680.487,1681.987,I thought that you were not suggesting--
2008.07-1239,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1681.987,1686.557,"But there is a finding that it is necessary, and here we have that finding as I understand it."
2008.07-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1686.557,1697.013,--And you are not suggesting that -- that there is a probability of success on the claim that you had to file an environmental impact statement.
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1697.013,1698.449,--We -- we are contesting that.
2008.07-1239,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1703.602,1703.968,Yes.
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1705.619,1708.154,"If I misspoke, I apologize."
2008.07-1239,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1726.016,1727.384,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-1239,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1727.384,1727.918,Thank you.
2008.07-1239,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1727.918,1738.574,Mr. Kendall.
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,1738.574,1749.564,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The fundamental question in this case is a very traditional question of equity jurisprudence."
2008.07-1239,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1769.461,1782.186,Isn't there something incredibly odd about a single district judge making a determination on that defense question that is contrary to the determination that the Navy has made?
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,1782.186,1785.155,"Justice Alito, I submit not, and here is why."
2008.07-1239,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1838.039,1841.991,I didn't see evidence to the contrary on two important points.
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,1921.343,1935.786,"Justice Breyer, the response in the record appears in the after-action reports of the eight prior exercises in Southern California."
2008.07-1239,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1965.005,1967.074,"What do you mean, despite the complete absence?"
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,1967.074,1970.542,"--Because surface ducting conditions are, as it happens, quite rare."
2008.07-1239,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1970.542,1971.726,That's the whole point.
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,1981.334,1982.3,Right.
2008.07-1239,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1982.3,1988.32,"Now, what they are saying is, when you do run into that situation you've got to train people to deal with it."
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,1995.724,2008.734,"Well, the question before the court was balancing the requirement that the Navy comply with the law and the environmental harms against the Navy's interest."
2008.07-1239,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2010.267,2012.103,"Well, with one important qualification."
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2031.682,2032.716,--That's quite right.
2008.07-1239,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2041.538,2044.324,"Well, I thought that would have been the whole ball game until I read your brief."
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2063.904,2065.504,--I respectfully disagree.
2008.07-1239,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2067.623,2068.456,"Oh, yes, yes."
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2075.276,2077.378,"--Well, I also disagree on that point."
2008.07-1239,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2089.919,2090.638,Yes.
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2090.638,2092.521,--But that's the question.
2008.07-1239,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2092.521,2094.257,That's what the district court relied on.
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2105.231,2109.6,The district court did reach the question of whether the Navy could train.
2008.07-1239,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2146.975,2149.76,"That's what I can't -- look, I don't know anything about this."
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2188.552,2192.254,There was also prior exercise in Hawaii.
2008.07-1239,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2235.115,2235.665,Generalities.
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2249.09,2253.844,"--If I may proceed then to the safety zone specifics, because that's the other issue."
2008.07-1239,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2316.317,2323.421,It would have increased exponentially the area that the Navy had to scrutinize to determine if there were marine mammals there.
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2323.421,2324.173,Incorrect.
2008.07-1239,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2324.723,2327.209,"Well, the increase -- you keep saying it's just 1,000 yards."
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2335.629,2337.581,--But think about how this is being done.
2008.07-1239,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2347.955,2350.288,And there are people in airplanes?
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2350.288,2350.657,Yes.
2008.07-1239,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2350.657,2351.59,Not just straight ahead.
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2351.59,2359.328,There are people in airplanes and they are looking down and they can see as much as they can see within that area.
2008.07-1239,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2372.988,2377.992,"I guess my question was, that increases the area exponentially that has to be scrutinized."
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2380.51,2396.786,"Because they argued -- and perhaps I misunderstood, Mr. Chief Justice, that you were referring to their argument -- which is not that the area was exponentially larger and that creates difficulties of observation; they argued it would create an exponentially greater number of shutdowns."
2008.07-1239,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2542.264,2545.902,Where in the record -- this was the question I asked General Garre.
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2550.186,2556.94,"--The evidence of the prediction of the Level A takes, in the--"
2008.07-1239,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2556.94,2561.327,"Well, what does Level A take -- maybe can you put this in lay terms."
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2566.648,2576.604,--It is in the -- there is a table on page 223 of volume 1 of the joint appendix.
2008.07-1239,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2647.517,2653.021,This is -- I want to give you a chance to say what's so terrible about what they're doing.
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2688.427,2699.335,--The important thing here is that the Navy is focused on having it its way or no way.
2008.07-1239,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2699.335,2700.768,"Well, that's very unfair."
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2710.876,2728.671,"No -- I agree, although the reason I believe that they conceded those is that the record was -- was so overwhelming on each of those points, they hadn't even put in evidence to suggest that those measures would cause them any problem."
2008.07-1239,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2730.721,2742.812,"The other ways it struck me how the district court relied on the fact that the Navy had taken actions to protect marine mammals in the past to say well, there can't be any problem with adding more protection."
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2745.764,2751.768,"--Well, if I can -- if I can answer that this way."
2008.07-1239,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2776.585,2782.389,They had already taken actions unilaterally to protect marine mammals.
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2783.456,2784.072,--Right.
2008.07-1239,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2784.072,2786.008,But they were taking some actions.
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2786.008,2786.841,That's right.
2008.07-1239,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2849.831,2850.95,How does the basic thing work?
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2869.078,2875.066,"--You know, the whole point of the armed forces, I think is to--"
2008.07-1239,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2875.066,2878.684,"You see the point, I am trying to give you a -- overstating it."
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2878.684,2886.022,--I think the point of the armed forces is to safeguard our freedoms causing the least damage possible to our environment.
2008.07-1239,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2888.806,2893.543,"You go on a bombing mission, do they have to prepare an environmental impact statement first?"
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2893.543,2893.86,No.
2008.07-1239,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2893.86,2894.343,No.
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2894.343,2895.027,They don't.
2008.07-1239,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2895.027,2895.562,How does it work?
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2895.562,2904.918,"We have never, ever contended that any of our proposed restrictions should apply to combat at all, and it doesn't."
2008.07-1239,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2945.66,2949.178,I -- I didn't assert that they are -- that they are the same thing substantively.
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2973.061,2973.794,That--
2008.07-1239,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2973.794,2975.163,And that's how they started.
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,2986.637,2989.137,--That focus is not an element of our case.
2008.07-1239,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3009.401,3014.455,Can I -- can I derail you a little bit to get back to the balance of equities question?
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,3042.704,3049.258,"--Well, I -- with respect I think the district court spoke in several different opinions."
2008.07-1239,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3063.602,3073.91,Suppose it's still fair to say that on all of those it focused most of its attention on likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm rather than a balancing of the equities.
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,3073.91,3082.849,"Well I would disagree in one respect, which is the court was very focused on which measures to impose and which measures not to impose."
2008.07-1239,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3124.79,3126.692,I think that's -- I think that's quite right.
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,3154.009,3155.778,--There's a good reason why she didn't balance that.
2008.07-1239,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3193.403,3204.776,"Do you -- how much deference, if any, do you think the district court was obligated to give to the Navy on that military issue about whether the training would be effective?"
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,3207.978,3208.663,No.
2008.07-1239,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3251.99,3262.88,"Even the district -- even the district court recognized, in the words of her opinion, that it would propose ""a substantial challenge"" -- that's a quote -- for the Navy to shift the regime that she imposed in the injunction."
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,3262.88,3281.276,"--That's right, and it will in fact pose a challenge and the proof is then in the pudding, which is that the Navy has now conducted 13 out of 14 exercises, the last 8 of which had been conducted under this regime as modified by the circuit."
2008.07-1239,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3289.365,3299.589,"By the time this case got back to the court -- the district court a second time, the President had made a determination that this was in the paramount interest of the United States."
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,3327.007,3327.64,Yes.
2008.07-1239,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3416.715,3417.667,Excuse me.
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,3429.89,3432.842,"It always does, and the question is just somewhat different."
2008.07-1239,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3535.207,3541.544,"That's unfortunately contrary to what our opinions have said, which was quite clearly that procedural ----"
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,3547.365,3548.883,--Can I--
2008.07-1239,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3548.883,3553.019,The whole country can complain about the failure to issue an EIS.
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,3555.304,3560.441,--I was only responding to Justice Kennedy's question as to what the circuits have said.
2008.07-1239,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3562.81,3564.593,I don't see why you backed down on this.
2008.07-1239,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3566.945,3570.98,"Mr. Kendall, you wanted to respond to some comments by the Solicitor General."
2008.07-1239,1,39665,richard_b_kendall,,3578.351,3582.038,That's very kind.
2008.07-1239,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3618.511,3619.694,"--Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-1239,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3622.36,3624.329,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-1239,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3711.935,3714.018,Can I -- before you sit down.
2008.07-1239,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3736.968,3739.403,It pertains to beaked whales as well.
2008.07-1239,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3779.563,3779.963,"--Thank you, counsel."
