2008.07-1209,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.837,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 07-1209, Peake v. Sanders et al. Mr. Miller."
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,7.837,11.022,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2008.07-1209,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,53.135,54.651,Why do you say that?
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,61.622,77.166,--The principal reason that it was understood is because the uniform practice in the courts of appeals as of 1988 was to place upon challengers to agency action the burden of showing prejudice from the error.
2008.07-1209,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,93.26,98.414,"You basically have four cases in the courts of appeals to support that proposition, right?"
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,98.414,102.449,"--Well, Your Honor, it's considerably more than that."
2008.07-1209,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,140.591,144.644,"Well, but this is -- I mean, it's kind of the -- it's the first notice."
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,154.0,170.01,The reason that in a great many cases there's not going to be prejudice from error of the kind at issue here is that the VA has an informal nonadversarial system that provides multiple layers of review and many opportunities to correct the effect of any official notice error.
2008.07-1209,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,176.914,182.234,"Well, can we go back to the question that was first posed?"
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,200.629,201.814,--That's correct.
2008.07-1209,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,215.657,221.728,"When was Congress aware of this, when the Administrative Procedure Act was passed, you mean?"
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,221.728,227.298,"--No, the statute at issue here is part of the Veterans Judicial Review Act of 1988."
2008.07-1209,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,244.824,250.712,"Can I -- can I ask you to clarify exactly what you mean by the ""burden"" of showing prejudice?"
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,299.443,300.895,That's -- that's correct.
2008.07-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,319.272,320.122,That's in O'Neal.
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,321.072,321.558,That's right.
2008.07-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,321.558,331.664,"--which most of the Court joined, and the reason that it says it is because it just confuses everybody, at least me, to talk about ""burden"" in this context."
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,435.647,440.818,"To clarify, the reason that we have used the language of ""burden"" is simply--"
2008.07-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,440.818,442.051,I'm not criticizing you for that.
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,448.389,449.824,--I appreciate that.
2008.07-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,473.523,482.128,"The theory is he didn't know anything about this, got no notice whatsoever, so he didn't know that he's supposed to produce some more information or he'll lose."
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,483.012,491.334,"--But in order to -- in order to connect that error -- I mean, that's -- that's an identification of an error under the Veterans Claims Assistance Act."
2008.07-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,493.27,505.661,"But you connect it by saying normally a veteran who isn't that knowledgeable -- not everybody is a genius in law -- when he doesn't get a notice that tells him you got to produce something more or you lose, he might forget to produce something more."
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,506.361,507.946,--If he has something more.
2008.07-1209,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,529.193,538.299,"Well, usually, when you have an appellate court -- you know, it's a hard question, they're easily divided, the case is resolved on the basis of the standard of review."
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,552.059,564.782,"Because I think in a case where the -- like these, where plaintiff has not identified anything that they would have done differently, it isn't a close case with respect to the question of prejudice."
2008.07-1209,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,583.094,598.17,"Well, what if what they would have done differently is get a different medical test, or done something like that, or had the doctor in the prior testing who prepared the diagnosis look at something that they didn't have them look at before?"
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,616.232,624.988,"--Well, depending on the state of a record -- the record in a particular case, that might be sufficient to show a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different."
2008.07-1209,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,629.642,659.911,"But if the government has the obligation at the very first to tell the veteran what the veteran must produce to substantiate the claim and the government doesn't do that, why shouldn't it be the responsibility of the government to say to the court: This is what -- if we had done what we were supposed to do, this is what we would have included in our notice."
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,678.991,691.315,"Well, I mean, had the government complied -- to take Simmons's case as an example, when the VA sent her the notice letter, her claim was for an increased rating."
2008.07-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,791.248,791.631,So -- so fine.
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,839.129,845.899,"With respect, Your Honor, I don't think that that's a fair description of the effect of the rule adopted by the court below."
2008.07-1209,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,845.899,849.601,"Well, but suppose then we look at O'Neal, we read the first paragraph."
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,866.796,883.59,"I think in this case is a good illustration about why that sort of grave doubt you are describing doesn't arise in a case like this, where at no stage of the proceedings has the claimant offered anything that they would have done any differently."
2008.07-1209,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,896.448,901.136,"Maybe I'm not following as well as I should, but it seemed to me you are suggesting there was no error here."
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,901.136,904.671,"--No, that there -- there certainly -- there was an error."
2008.07-1209,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,904.671,905.921,And what was the error?
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,905.921,930.155,"The error was that the initial letter that was sent to her describing what the evidence needed to -- that she needed to submit in order to establish her claim, misidentified that evidence; it described the elements of a general claim for service connectedness; it didn't specifically explain what was needed to establish an increased rating claim."
2008.07-1209,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,930.155,936.725,Are you saying that that error was not prejudicial because the earlier information she had received gave her everything she needed?
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,936.725,949.117,The principal reason why that error was not prejudicial is because the only way that she could have received benefits for an increased rating claim is if there were evidence that her hearing had become worse.
2008.07-1209,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,958.306,965.578,"Well, if that's the case, why wasn't that statement you just made sufficient to discharge your burden of showing no prejudice?"
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,965.578,979.386,"The -- the fact -- I mean, I -- we believe that it should have been, but under the rule as imposed by the courts below, it clearly wasn't."
2008.07-1209,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1001.001,1011.79,"You know, it's easy -- it's easy to look back and view this in sort of abstract legal terms, but we are dealing with lay people who are trying to get something from the government, which is always a difficult thing."
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1034.805,1043.911,"Well, because -- there are two responses to that: The first is it's important to keep in mind the stage of the proceedings at which this inquiry was relevant."
2008.07-1209,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1083.655,1101.265,"And as between the two courts, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, do we owe either of them -- maybe not deference in the Chevron sense -- but some deference just because of their expertise in dealing with these claims?"
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1105.967,1112.454,I'm not -- not aware that this Court has ever suggested that it would be--
2008.07-1209,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1112.454,1115.073,"--I mean, would -- it's -- it's an issue of law, so I take it it's de novo."
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1115.073,1117.958,"--Yes, it is -- and it's certainly that, and it is--"
2008.07-1209,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1117.958,1128.248,"But in -- in the exercise of that review, don't we have to give some weight to the determination of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims which sees these claims all the time?"
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1155.698,1177.111,"--No, and I think that by adopting language from the APA, using the same language that applies to all kinds of judicial review of agency actions, Congress strongly suggested that it didn't want a unique rule for judicial review of VA determinations."
2008.07-1209,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1185.55,1187.419,May I ask a factual question?
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1195.572,1200.909,"--When I said they were represented by counsel, I meant in the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, not at the administrative--"
2008.07-1209,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1200.909,1201.526,I see.
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1205.428,1213.117,"--In the -- in the administrative proceeding, the restrictions on payment of counsel have now been relaxed at the Board of Veterans' Appeals stage."
2008.07-1209,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1221.222,1223.139,"There can be counsel, but is it really typical?"
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1223.139,1229.226,"--I -- the don't know the statistics on that, because that -- the statute is quite recent."
2008.07-1209,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1229.226,1239.784,"That would be a dramatic change, because years ago, I remember a case in which the Court upheld a $10 fee limit on the notion that these people didn't need lawyers at all, which struck me as a little strange."
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1241.151,1264.399,"Well, in any event, that is no longer the case at the board level, and even those claimants who do not have counsel, the great majority of them, I think about three-quarters at the regional office level and 98 percent at the board level, are represented by some sort of non-attorney representative, either service organizations like the American Legion, or many States have organizations that assist claimants."
2008.07-1209,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1274.457,1279.845,"Mr. Miller, could you help me out on how the system works in -- in practice in a different way?"
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1304.626,1320.32,"--There -- if you're talking about after the initial decision from the regional office, there is not an automatic right to a remand, but there is an automatic right to a de novo review by a more senior official at the regional office--"
2008.07-1209,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1320.32,1321.338,With new evidence?
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1321.338,1321.972,--Yes.
2008.07-1209,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1334.18,1334.646,Okay.
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1378.175,1392.184,"Well, I guess to the extent that the delay in adjudicating the claim is a kind of prejudice, it's not a prejudice that would in any sense be cured by a remand for further proceedings, which will just result in further delay."
2008.07-1209,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1392.184,1394.018,If the -- I'm sorry.
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1395.22,1408.378,"I would just add that the -- the effective date of the claim, which is the date as of which benefits are awarded, is the date that the claim was filed, so there wouldn't -- you wouldn't be losing money when you -- except for the--"
2008.07-1209,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1408.378,1410.646,"No, but you are going to have to go through another stage of litigation."
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1455.175,1459.727,--The -- the government has a very strong inducement to follow the statutory obligation.
2008.07-1209,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1461.328,1464.797,"Well, it may have a strong inducement, but I'm talking about a stronger one."
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1480.826,1491.265,"--Well, I suppose that's right, but I think in a lot of cases -- I mean, the VA in all cases strives conscientiously to comply with its statutory obligations."
2008.07-1209,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1521.851,1525.955,"Well, that's -- I mean, that's the essential problem with common law adjudication."
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1527.973,1534.144,"--But it's a problem that is particularly acute here, given the volume of claims that the VA has to--"
2008.07-1209,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1534.144,1535.827,What is the experience?
2008.07-1209,0,22857,eric_d_miller,,1554.457,1563.044,"--The claim, when remanded from the Court of Appeals for the Veterans -- for Veterans Claims, goes back to the board."
2008.07-1209,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1570.55,1571.617,"Thank you, Mr. Miller."
2008.07-1209,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1573.686,1594.749,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would like to make three points: First, because notice is integral to the system that Congress designed, the VA's failure to provide notice is likely to prejudice the veteran."
2008.07-1209,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1618.965,1620.983,"Well, why is that -- why is it a speculative enterprise?"
2008.07-1209,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1651.954,1661.31,"Two reasons, Justice Alito: First, it's not clear even in the Veterans Court that the veteran will have notice of what's required, a point I would like to address."
2008.07-1209,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1701.971,1708.624,What if you have the situation -- and I think actually your -- your co-Respondent's case illustrates this better than yours.
2008.07-1209,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1761.092,1768.329,"Well, the answer is, first of all, that we don't know how the process would unfold once the veteran has notice."
2008.07-1209,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1777.935,1778.887,Excuse me.
2008.07-1209,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1794.396,1795.88,"--Well, for a few reasons."
2008.07-1209,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1796.598,1800.05,"You say it's a de novo, right, at this next level?"
2008.07-1209,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1800.05,1806.788,"--First of all, it's unclear whether the veteran would even have notice even at that point."
2008.07-1209,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1824.5,1828.617,"In your case, did the -- your client attend the initial hearing?"
2008.07-1209,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1828.617,1834.705,There was a medical examination that she didn't attend.
2008.07-1209,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1846.013,1853.852,"Well, what's the first time that your client knew that this claim was going to be processed at a particular time or the first time your client knew it had been denied?"
2008.07-1209,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1861.791,1866.76,She was -- she later informed the agency that she had changed her address.
2008.07-1209,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1872.146,1878.9,"I'm just trying to -- it seems to me, at the first hearing, if she in fact is there, they say, well, now you have to give us some notice."
2008.07-1209,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1885.74,1888.025,"--Well, there's not necessarily a hearing."
2008.07-1209,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1897.131,1898.348,Is there usually an initial hearing?
2008.07-1209,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1898.348,1898.798,--No.
2008.07-1209,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1901.0,1901.516,Okay.
2008.07-1209,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1901.516,1903.702,So there's no hearing unless the veteran requests it.
2008.07-1209,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1918.561,1919.661,"And so, why not just say that?"
2008.07-1209,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1923.781,1924.715,--Well--
2008.07-1209,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1924.715,1926.817,And then the judge again won't be in doubt anymore.
2008.07-1209,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1977.266,1984.904,"--I agree that burdens only matter in a handful of cases, but it makes sense to put the burden on the government for a number of reasons."
2008.07-1209,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1984.904,1998.329,"It certainly does because it makes sense to tell the government: Government, you have to come up with every possible, conceivable factual scenario and prove there wasn't a man from Mars who came in, and -- you know, that doesn't make sense."
2008.07-1209,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,1998.329,1999.296,But that's not what we ask for here.
2008.07-1209,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2043.125,2050.714,"I know all this, and why don't you just tell the judge that and say: Look at my client, Judge, look at my client."
2008.07-1209,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2073.061,2088.923,"--The reason is that it's helpful to have presumptions to deal with the typical case where we have in our case a first element notice error, a question where the veteran does not even know what evidence he needs to put forward."
2008.07-1209,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2098.795,2108.385,"No court is going to accept as a showing of prejudice the idea that, here, look at my client, you know, as a layperson didn't know what to do."
2008.07-1209,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2109.669,2113.038,"I don't think it would be, and that's why it makes sense to have a general presumption."
2008.07-1209,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2136.487,2147.01,"What's wrong with Mr. Miller's response that, at the very first level of review, you can start all over; at that point you know precisely why your claim was denied?"
2008.07-1209,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2147.01,2159.685,"Well, again, there are various levels of review, but the notice to start that first level of appellate review does not necessarily give the veteran the notice that she is entitled to."
2008.07-1209,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2160.052,2160.835,"Well, that was my question."
2008.07-1209,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2167.623,2167.989,--Exactly.
2008.07-1209,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2226.645,2238.119,"Does the -- notice can be given -- skipped entirely, as it was in Simmons' case, or notice could be given but it's defective."
2008.07-1209,1,19630,christopher_j_meade,,2271.407,2279.946,"The question of whether the notice is okay or not, is a question for the Veterans Court, a factual finding."
2008.07-1209,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2356.279,2357.798,"Thank you, Mr. Meade."
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2370.356,2370.956,Thank you.
2008.07-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2398.625,2425.276,"It seems -- what I was trying to get to, which I don't see how to quite get there -- it seems to me that if something really went wrong, if there's -- there's no notice, that, veteran, you have to put in some material, or you are going to lose, if there's no notice of that, and he really didn't get any notice during all this cooperative process, then I think the Veterans Court is right."
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2482.529,2487.849,"--I don't believe you should, and if my case could be used as an example--"
2008.07-1209,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2487.849,2495.687,Your case is one where the veteran did get what they call the first-level notice?
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2495.687,2496.705,--Correct.
2008.07-1209,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2496.705,2505.978,So if Justice -- the implication of Justice Breyer's question is that your client would lose because your client did get the first-level notice.
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2508.18,2509.897,That's correct.
2008.07-1209,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2538.616,2539.266,But why doesn't it make sense in your case?
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2609.045,2617.734,"--Well, two answers to that, Your Honor: The first is the government makes a proposition that all we need to do is offer an explanation."
2008.07-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2646.135,2648.17,Why is that such a tough thing to do?
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2676.19,2677.857,The statutes stop you from doing that.
2008.07-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2677.857,2678.24,Stop you?
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2685.545,2690.264,"Yes, but in all due respect, I think the Veterans Court got it wrong."
2008.07-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2692.616,2699.972,"Between me and the Veterans Court, as to who knows best how to work this system, it's 10 to 1, and it's not me."
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2701.488,2702.122,--Okay.
2008.07-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2726.289,2737.061,"What they've decided there is if there's no notice at all, no, you don't have to have a proffer, because it's up to the agency to do just what you want."
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2753.607,2756.059,"--Well, there's -- there's really no analysis to it."
2008.07-1209,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2765.08,2782.876,"Well, the -- the statute says -- and this is consistent with Justice Breyer's line of questioning -- that the Veterans Court, the Court of Appeals, the Veterans Court of Appeals, shall give due account to the notice -- to the rule of prejudicial error."
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2801.588,2822.084,"--Well, I guess you would have to reconcile the more specific statute that -- that deals with only being able to submit evidence or any other material at the time -- at the time of the agency adjudication."
2008.07-1209,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2850.084,2859.792,"Your position -- your position seems to be not that the government should have to show prejudice, but as applied to a case like yours, that there's an irrebuttable presumption of prejudice."
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2875.819,2876.552,"--No, Your Honor."
2008.07-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2902.786,2904.219,"Yes, but I don't understand that."
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2933.805,2935.757,--Well--
2008.07-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2935.757,2937.14,"I mean, that doesn't seem--"
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2937.14,2941.042,"--he wouldn't get the money, okay, because all -- we are talking about a remand, not an--"
2008.07-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2941.042,2941.677,--I know.
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2949.081,2949.515,--Correct.
2008.07-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2949.998,2954.135,So then why is it a big deal that you summarize what you're going to produce in the brief?
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2955.235,2962.075,"--Well, Let me answer it this way: Let's assume we do make proffers, as you suggest, at the Veterans--"
2008.07-1209,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2962.075,2963.025,"If you want to call them ""a proffer""."
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,2966.192,2969.144,"--Well, in a legal sense I consider it the same thing."
2008.07-1209,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3015.375,3025.315,"You started earlier, at one point, to say how this actually worked out in your case."
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,3027.35,3028.733,How--
2008.07-1209,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3028.733,3030.385,How it makes a difference in your case.
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,3030.385,3031.169,--Sure.
2008.07-1209,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3077.7,3083.77,"So why wasn't that enough for you to establish prejudice, regardless of who had the burden?"
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,3083.77,3090.257,To make that allegation on -- at the court of appeal that I would have gotten this?
2008.07-1209,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3090.257,3090.807,Uh-hmm.
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,3090.807,3093.292,"Quite frankly, I don't know if I would have gotten it."
2008.07-1209,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3094.542,3102.481,"Well, you would phrase the prejudice in terms of what you would have done but you weren't able to do and what you can now go back and do if it's remanded."
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,3117.175,3121.895,"Your Honor, in a way, the -- the third prong of the Federal Circuit's analysis does that."
2008.07-1209,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3164.222,3172.927,"Do you know where this first level, second level -- I'm looking at the statute on page 98a of the petition."
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,3184.802,3188.104,Well--
2008.07-1209,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3188.104,3198.729,"""As part of that notice, the Secretary shall indicate which portion of the information and evidence is to be provided by the claimant and which portion by the Secretary. """
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,3205.716,3211.302,"--Well, they haven't enumerated it, Your Honor, as such, but analytically it breaks down to that."
2008.07-1209,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3235.068,3237.77,"I thought that was taken out, the fourth one."
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,3238.904,3240.556,"--Not to my knowledge, Your Honor."
2008.07-1209,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3240.556,3243.091,And tell me what that is.
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,3244.491,3246.876,"No, it's in 3.159."
2008.07-1209,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3255.648,3268.991,"Well, it just tells that -- that the Secretary requests the claimant provide any evidence in the claimant's possession that pertains to the claim."
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,3268.991,3270.091,Correct.
2008.07-1209,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3270.091,3273.793,That's fairly straightforward.
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,3273.793,3280.966,"It's not as important as -- as the first, second, and third elements of the statute, for sure, Your Honor."
2008.07-1209,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3280.966,3282.649,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-1209,2,36251,mark_r_lippman,,3282.649,3283.199,Thank you.
2008.07-1209,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3283.199,3285.685,"Mr. Miller, you have four minutes remaining."
2008.07-1209,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3285.685,3290.904,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-1209,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3326.345,3330.547,So you think it's perfectly clear from that what gaps need to be filled in?
2008.07-1209,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3330.547,3332.581,"--In many cases, it would be."
2008.07-1209,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3341.337,3345.741,"Now, at that point, is the claimant disentitled to have a lawyer?"
2008.07-1209,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3345.741,3347.641,--No.
2008.07-1209,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3355.531,3362.851,"But at the point they get the notice and they are trying to evaluate the significance of the notice, they are not entitled to a lawyer?"
2008.07-1209,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3362.851,3370.94,"--If you are referring to the statement of the case, by the time they receive the statement of the case they would be at a stage of the proceedings where they could get a lawyer."
2008.07-1209,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3370.94,3373.725,"Well, no -- I--"
2008.07-1209,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3373.725,3375.427,"But what about the notice, the original notice?"
2008.07-1209,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3375.427,3376.277,They--
2008.07-1209,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3376.277,3377.377,They don't have a lawyer at that point?
2008.07-1209,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3379.712,3384.283,"--Oh, if you meant the original notice required by the -- the statute, no."
2008.07-1209,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3384.283,3388.652,"--No, at the point -- at the point where the statute requires original notice, they are not entitled to a lawyer."
2008.07-1209,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3388.652,3389.102,Correct.
2008.07-1209,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3389.102,3389.854,We -- we agree on that.
2008.07-1209,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3399.441,3399.957,Yes.
2008.07-1209,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3399.957,3411.749,"--But whether -- I -- I guess the -- the situation that I am concerned with is, the person up to that moment not only does not have, but is not entitled to have, a lawyer."
2008.07-1209,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3457.145,3458.929,I think that--
2008.07-1209,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3458.929,3460.847,You can see where I am going with the argument.
2008.07-1209,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3460.847,3461.114,--Yes.
2008.07-1209,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3480.428,3486.415,"No, but there's -- it seems to me that there are two points at which the veteran is at a disadvantage."
2008.07-1209,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3504.06,3524.457,"Yes, and a -- and a claimant who in the Veterans Court can say, you know, I didn't understand and as a result I failed to present the -- because of the defective notice and my lack of understanding of the statement of the case, I didn't present this important piece of evidence, and here's how it would have been material, in that case, they would be entitled to a remand."
2008.07-1209,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3525.007,3529.909,"When you have been saying ""entitled to a lawyer"", do you mean entitled to a lawyer or allowed to have a lawyer?"
2008.07-1209,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3529.909,3530.778,--Allowed to retain counsel.
2008.07-1209,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3533.563,3534.93,You can finish your--
2008.07-1209,3,22857,eric_d_miller,,3534.93,3551.19,"--I was just going to say that, given the volume of cases that the VA confronts, there is a serious harm to the system in unnecessary remands that have to be given priority over other cases and that divert resources from the adjudication of meritorious claims."
2008.07-1209,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3551.19,3552.24,"--Thank you, counsel."
