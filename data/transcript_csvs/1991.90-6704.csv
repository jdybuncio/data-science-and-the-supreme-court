1991.90-6704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.17,"We'll hear argument now in No. 90-6704, David Dawson v. Delaware."
1991.90-6704,0,17923,bernard_j_odonnell,,9.272,11.891,"Good afternoon, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-6704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,99.764,102.366,"Well, why do you say particularly with respect to the punishment of death?"
1991.90-6704,0,17923,bernard_j_odonnell,,115.708,117.275,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1991.90-6704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,123.629,126.664,You're not relying on death as different here?
1991.90-6704,0,17923,bernard_j_odonnell,,127.183,129.533,"No, sir, not with respect to this claim."
1991.90-6704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,129.533,140.174,"--Question presented, Mr. O'Donnell, has the qualification that the murder here had no racial motivations or connections."
1991.90-6704,0,17923,bernard_j_odonnell,,149.179,155.249,"Under that circumstance, Chief Justice Rehnquist, the State could use that as an aggravating factor."
1991.90-6704,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,155.249,158.968,"So that's one limitation, isn't it, on your very broad proposition?"
1991.90-6704,0,17923,bernard_j_odonnell,,158.968,159.435,"Yes, it is."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,1546.944,1550.496,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-6704,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1583.353,1586.638,Now the stipulation didn't show that this was a racist prison gang.
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,1592.942,1593.892,"--No, I did not."
1991.90-6704,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1593.892,1597.494,"Oh, well your prosecutor continued to argue that this was a racist gang."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,1599.512,1607.202,"Well, what it says is is that the Aryan Brotherhood refers to a racist prison gang, a white racist prison gang which was founded in California."
1991.90-6704,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1674.394,1677.346,Does the record show that any minority members were on the jury?
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,1677.346,1678.298,"Yes, it does."
1991.90-6704,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1678.298,1680.198,And what does it show in that regard?
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,1680.198,1682.666,It shows that there was one black juror.
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1797.725,1803.129,"May I ask you, what does... what does the membership in the White Aryan Brotherhood tell us about his character?"
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,1803.129,1807.933,"It tells us two things: one, a general sense of lawlessness, and two--"
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1807.933,1808.999,"Well, now how do you get that?"
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,1808.999,1810.416,--Because it's a prison gang.
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1812.218,1817.288,"But racist prison gang... you think the word gang implies lawlessness, does it?"
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,1817.288,1821.423,"Yes, and I think that is what the trial judge thought, and actually that's what the supreme--"
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1821.423,1824.208,"And is that the argument that the prosecutor made, that it implied lawlessness?"
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,1827.394,1833.481,"--No, what he argued goes to the second part of what the Aryan Brotherhood deals with."
1991.90-6704,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1883.497,1898.673,"Well, Mr. Fairbanks, are you assuming that we take judicial notice of what the beliefs are of members of the Aryan Brotherhood chapter in Delaware?"
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,1902.56,1904.46,"No, I think that the--"
1991.90-6704,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1904.46,1919.837,Because the stipulation is so bare bones that I didn't find any evidence connecting the petitioner's membership in the brotherhood to lawlessness or a rejection of rehabilitation.
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,1922.872,1931.045,"--Well, the stipulation is something that Dawson agreed to, and it is subsumed within the notion of a white racist prison gang."
1991.90-6704,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1932.597,1935.799,"Well, you keep saying that, but it's a California gang that's white racist."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,1939.651,1942.036,"--Well, but I--"
1991.90-6704,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1942.036,1945.238,"And the prosecutor, just as you're doing here, continues to argue that he's a racist."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,1948.357,1950.309,"--Well, he agrees that he is a racist."
1991.90-6704,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1955.777,1958.728,Was his closing argument after the argument given by the State?
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,1958.728,1959.33,Yes--
1991.90-6704,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1959.33,1959.93,Thank you.
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,1959.93,1961.263,"--it was, it was sequential."
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1981.776,1988.513,"Well, would it have been permissible to just have... you have the two first... to simply put in evidence that he was a white racist, period."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,1992.215,1996.936,"--Well, I'm not sure how you determine how he votes, given secrecy of the ballot."
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1996.936,2001.923,"Well, say he stipulated that he was going to vote for this particular individual who's a white... alleged to be a white racist."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2001.923,2003.023,I think--
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2003.023,2005.042,"And he supports white racist causes, generally."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2005.042,2006.075,--I think--
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2006.075,2007.244,Would that be sufficient to put in?
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2007.244,2019.219,"--I think that what you have to look at is not Dawson's per se rule, which simply works on the syllogism of if he can attach a speech or association element, it's excluded."
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2026.372,2027.288,"Well, but there are two parts to it."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2041.648,2042.532,Yes.
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2042.532,2056.242,"But then the second half of it, and the one that was emphasized by the prosecutor, that he stipulates that he is a member of a white racist group, a group that believes the white race is superior to all other races, and for political and other purposes he subscribes to those beliefs."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2059.86,2062.812,I think if it speaks to a characteristic that is--
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2062.812,2063.562,"Well, you know what it speaks to--"
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2063.562,2064.045,--then it's relevant.
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2064.045,2065.145,--I've told you exactly what it is.
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2065.145,2068.966,"Yes, and I think it does speak to a characteristic that is relevant to... to sentencing."
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2068.966,2072.668,So that it would be sufficient to just identify him as a white racist?
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2072.668,2075.453,He is... he is fundamentally at war with his society.
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2080.94,2085.058,"Well, some people... there are a lot of people, unfortunately, in this society who share those values."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2085.058,2086.291,--That's right.
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2086.291,2092.611,"And if they can all be... that can be a... say it's not a capital case, just say a sentencing guideline case."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2105.569,2109.989,"Yes, because it says something very specific about his character, his rejection of--"
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2109.989,2111.039,"Well, what does it say about his character?"
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2111.039,2120.095,"--I think it says... it says that he... is that he judges people not on the basis of who they are, but based on the basis of race."
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2124.916,2131.57,"You could also put in, for example, that he hates Catholics, period; or he hates a certain, certain religion."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2132.253,2137.907,"If he has... I think that religious or other prejudices, they are available, too."
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2139.592,2140.409,"--Well, what's the difference?"
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2147.68,2152.149,--But that's not... well... it is part of his character that is not acceptable.
1991.90-6704,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2152.149,2156.951,"Well, isn't it equally true, then, that you could put in evidence that he's a socialist?"
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2168.643,2171.045,I'm not so sure that I go that far.
1991.90-6704,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2171.045,2171.311,Why not?
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2171.311,2172.813,Because I'm not sure that--
1991.90-6704,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2172.813,2177.365,Be at war with society... aren't socialists at war with the property structure of the United States?
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2177.365,2181.003,--I don't think in the same... in the same sense that racism is.
1991.90-6704,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2181.003,2182.403,"Well, now--"
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2200.347,2204.368,I would think that if it speaks to a relevant criteria in sentencing--
1991.90-6704,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2204.368,2207.653,"Well, that's what I've told you, I've told you what the thing is."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2207.653,2212.538,--And I think that the violent overthrow of his society speaks to a relevant sentencing trait.
1991.90-6704,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2218.342,2219.128,Well--
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2232.701,2233.501,"That's true, as--"
1991.90-6704,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2233.501,2237.422,"But that makes you a bad guy, and therefore your sentence can be increased?"
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2237.422,2241.707,"--But here, it wasn't just the beliefs in a vacuum."
1991.90-6704,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2249.163,2260.705,"I thought we were on a line of hypothetical questioning whether you could introduce the fact that the person was a racist, independent of... let's not retreat back to the fact that he's in a gang."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2267.275,2270.826,"--I think that is a matter which is not, per se, excluded."
1991.90-6704,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2290.324,2291.524,What about if he's sexist?
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2296.378,2300.096,I'm not sure how broad sexist is defined.
1991.90-6704,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2300.096,2302.032,"--That's not quite as bad as being a racist, is that?"
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2302.032,2310.452,"What I'm saying is, is that you don't have the judges picking and choosing between what is good and bad character before--"
1991.90-6704,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2310.452,2311.07,That's what I worry about.
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2315.105,2319.909,"--No, what I'm saying is there is not a per se... a per se rule which excludes all of this."
1991.90-6704,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2365.688,2368.39,Now you're saying it's not relevant to character?
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2370.39,2372.092,"No, I'm saying that it is relevant to character."
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2394.056,2397.576,"Mr. Fairbanks, let me just be sure I have not misunderstood your position on one point."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2406.099,2406.615,--Yes.
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2406.615,2408.332,Now why would it be impermissible?
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2408.332,2413.336,"Because at that point, Government is deciding what groups are good and what groups are bad."
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2416.838,2420.09,"In other words, it's a judgment a jury can make, but the legislature cannot make."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2420.09,2421.942,--Because the jury... because the--
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2421.942,2424.061,Then why do you draw the... they're both speaking for the Government.
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2424.061,2431.881,"--Well, because at the... at the latter stage, they are looking at it not just as, as an aggravating circumstance."
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2436.785,2446.657,"Well, what if the legislature looks at it in the same full context, and they just say this is always an aggravating circumstance, because it always illustrates bad character?"
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2446.657,2452.978,"Because it... I suppose, because at that point he is, he is made eligible for death because of that--"
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2452.978,2453.663,"Well, say it isn't death."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2478.029,2479.196,--We think not.
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2479.196,2480.148,You think not?
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2480.881,2484.683,"Because we think that on that point, the legislature is making value judgments."
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2487.051,2491.955,But why can the jury make a value judgment that's impermissible for the elected representatives of the whole people?
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2491.955,2494.038,--Because that's the jury function in this instance.
1991.90-6704,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2501.561,2503.194,"Yeah, but the jury doesn't elicit this information."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2512.017,2512.619,That's right.
1991.90-6704,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2523.725,2534.965,"Suppose the judge says, in my moral judgment, members of the Aryan League are, by reason of their beliefs, are more deserving of the death penalty than people that are not members."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2538.6,2542.554,That is... that is similar to what the sentencing judge did in Barclay.
1991.90-6704,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2542.554,2547.256,What... and you would permit that?
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2547.256,2565.052,"I think that that... membership in a... in a racist group does speak to a relevant character trait, and the judge can make... take that into consideration when he considers all the aggravating and mitigating circumstances."
1991.90-6704,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2565.052,2571.823,"Again, I don't see how that's any different from the hypothetical Justice Stevens put to you where the legislature tells the judges what to do."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2576.625,2589.267,"Well, because what this Court has said in the context of death penalty... penalty hearings, is that what that jury is supposed to do is to render a moral judgment based upon the character and propensities of the defendant and the circumstances of the offense."
1991.90-6704,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2599.408,2616.519,"Your position is if... if the defendant at the sentencing hearing can show that he went to dancing class in prison, and that's a mitigating thing, you should be able to show something like this, maybe some of the jurors will think it's... it's a point against him?"
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2616.519,2622.84,"Yes, I think... and that's... and that ultimately is what his... his final position, as articulated in his reply brief is."
1991.90-6704,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2634.648,2647.289,"So I take it, under some circumstances, you would say the State would be entitled to put in evidence that although he belongs to the Boy Scouts, he's an atheist?"
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2647.289,2668.635,"Justice White, I think that... I'm not sure what... what, from the... from the State's point of view, what membership in the Boy Scouts says about somebody, and nor am I sure what atheism says about somebody."
1991.90-6704,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2668.635,2685.914,"Well, supposing the defendant doesn't put in any of this evidence, but the State thinks that... the State thinks that in this... in this particular county, evidence that he's a Catholic would be very unpopular with the jury."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2685.914,2691.317,And that is material that the Delaware supreme court has made clear would not be admissible.
1991.90-6704,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2693.852,2699.94,Because no reasonable juror could think that he was a bad person for that reason?
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2699.94,2708.112,"--Because what it is doing is interjecting an arbitrary factor to appeal to prejudice or bias, and that there is a limitation to this."
1991.90-6704,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2709.112,2716.968,"What if he tries to introduce evidence that he's a good, God-fearing man, goes to church every Sunday... you pick your denomination, I don't care."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2718.534,2722.02,--This Court has held that that is... that that is relevant--
1991.90-6704,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2722.02,2724.805,"So the jury can say, gee, this is a good, God-fearing man, so we'll let him live."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2724.805,2725.322,--That's correct.
1991.90-6704,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2728.34,2734.243,"But you say you couldn't produce evidence that he's not a good God-fearing man, that he's an atheist?"
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2734.243,2740.314,"Well, because it does not speak to a... to a factor that is... that is relevant--"
1991.90-6704,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2740.314,2741.749,I don't see why the one does and the other doesn't.
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2756.843,2774.57,"--Well, I think that is what occurs, and may very well occur in death penalty cases up to now... that is, is that the jury has before them, the characteristics that the defendant puts in which are not related to conduct, which are First Amendment material."
1991.90-6704,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2775.537,2782.826,"So if you're going to keep out the bad stuff, you have to keep out all the good stuff too, to be... because the bad people who don't have it are being prejudiced by the fact that they don't have it."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2783.909,2787.194,"--Yes, if this is a First Amendment claim, which is what Dawson says that it is, yes."
1991.90-6704,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2866.146,2875.502,"And your position is, wholly aside from that stipulation, you should be able to introduce this evidence as relevant to character?"
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2875.502,2877.036,"Yes, I think that is correct."
1991.90-6704,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2877.036,2886.041,"Did the State really offer to prove that the... that this prison gang was the kind of a gang described in Barclay or in, what is it, Abel?"
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2905.438,2914.127,"No, what... what happened, what the sequencing of events were, is that the prosecutor was... began with a proffer."
1991.90-6704,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2926.951,2929.086,And what did he say the witnesses were going to testify to?
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2929.086,2940.375,"That the... there were two main, and central characteristics, but that the individual from the Bureau of Federal Prisons was going to come in, and he was going to be our expert."
1991.90-6704,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2940.375,2942.91,And he was going to say what the Aryan Brotherhood was all about?
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2942.91,2945.512,"Yes, and what he said was, is they have two main characteristics."
1991.90-6704,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2957.919,2959.105,Do what?
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2959.105,2960.805,Violent escape attempts.
1991.90-6704,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2960.805,2978.583,"Well, I suppose that if that evidence had gotten in... maybe I misunderstood your colleague on the other side that he thought that maybe if that had been admitted, it would have... it should be upheld, that kind of evidence."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2981.619,2984.237,It's... he's sometimes hard to pin down.
1991.90-6704,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2991.659,2994.278,So the State really got in trouble by the exclusion of the testimony?
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,2994.278,2994.778,--That's right.
1991.90-6704,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3007.019,3010.638,"But the State lost something by that sterile presentation, too."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,3021.262,3021.779,Absolutely.
1991.90-6704,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3029.0,3032.035,But what... what difference does it make what the State proffered?
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,3041.073,3041.759,--That's right.
1991.90-6704,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3045.294,3049.429,Having accepted the stipulation are crying foul--
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,3050.762,3058.183,"Chief Justice, what I'm crying foul is, is that... is being attacked for the stipulation."
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3058.183,3063.253,"Yes, but he accepted the stipulation as a substitute for keeping all this evidence out."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,3071.192,3073.544,"Well, the proffer actually does go farther than that."
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3085.602,3086.935,Aryan Brothers must take flight.
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,3087.804,3096.826,That is... that connects to the second of the two principal goals of the Aryan Brotherhood that Mr. Aaron was going to testify to.
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3096.826,3101.045,"Because neither of those goals had anything to do with white supremacy, did they?"
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,3106.516,3109.218,"No, I don't think that is the key to the prosecutor's closing argument."
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3121.358,3127.845,"But his conduct in prison, and what he really is, why don't you put in evidence of what he did in prison, instead of what organization he belonged to?"
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,3127.845,3147.359,"--Because the organization... just like his joining AA, his going to AA meetings... I mean he has a right to say that, not because he's proven that he has actually been rehabilitated, but that he goes to those meetings as offer... as an offer to show that he is making attempts at rehabilitation."
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3218.289,3225.943,"That's not the syllogism I understood him to mean... he said if you can't make it a statutory aggravating circumstance, how in the world can you make it a nonstatutory aggravating circumstance."
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,3227.943,3242.786,"--Now, well, what I think he's saying is if you cannot punish it as... if you can't criminalize it you can't... or regulate against it, is why you can't consider it when you talk about his character."
1991.90-6704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3266.651,3269.62,And membership in this organization proves lack of remorse.
1991.90-6704,1,39249,richard_e_fairbanks_jr,,3272.238,3276.709,"--No, I am saying, and what the Delaware supreme court said is two things."
1991.90-6704,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3289.449,3290.968,"Thank you, Mr. O'Donnell."
1991.90-6704,2,17923,bernard_j_odonnell,,3293.837,3295.987,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.90-6704,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3343.651,3375.472,"As I understand you on your direct argument that you thought that if there was... if the judge... if there was evidence offered about the... what this group was all about, that it really... it really was a... a criminal enterprise, and did incite escapes, would that evidence be admissible?"
1991.90-6704,2,17923,bernard_j_odonnell,,3375.472,3378.257,"Well, unless he adopted and advocated the escapes."
1991.90-6704,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3379.024,3380.543,"Well, now, say that again?"
1991.90-6704,2,17923,bernard_j_odonnell,,3380.543,3385.68,"--Unless he advocated, or if part of it was that he was engaged in a conspiracy to commit the escapes--"
1991.90-6704,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3385.68,3395.369,"All the... all that was offered was that he's a member of this group, and this group believes and is actively engaged in the... in criminal activities."
1991.90-6704,2,17923,bernard_j_odonnell,,3400.44,3400.923,"--No, no it is not."
1991.90-6704,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3409.128,3416.282,--So you have to really... you have to really show that he participated in these criminal activities?
1991.90-6704,2,17923,bernard_j_odonnell,,3416.282,3419.484,"Your Honor, it was shown in this case that he escaped."
1991.90-6704,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3423.888,3424.555,"Well, just answer my question."
1991.90-6704,2,17923,bernard_j_odonnell,,3434.178,3436.713,--Yes.
1991.90-6704,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3436.713,3437.663,Um-hum.
1991.90-6704,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3437.663,3456.359,"Mr. O'Donnell, you introduced evidence of group membership, right... AA... now, I guess if you say that a person can't be sentenced on the basis of his membership, I guess you would logically have to say he shouldn't be sentenced because of his nonmembership either."
1991.90-6704,2,17923,bernard_j_odonnell,,3467.465,3470.083,"No, it does not, Justice Kennedy."
1991.90-6704,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3470.083,3472.25,I mean what I'm suggesting is that there's just no end.
1991.90-6704,2,17923,bernard_j_odonnell,,3478.689,3486.342,"It is not just because belonging to AA is not a belief, and the judge is not exhorting him to inflict punishment because he does not belong to AA."
1991.90-6704,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3486.342,3486.992,It's not a belief?
1991.90-6704,2,17923,bernard_j_odonnell,,3493.013,3496.565,"They are beliefs, yes."
1991.90-6704,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3499.0,3500.117,"Thank you, Mr. O'Donnell."
