1965.656,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,27.196,"Number 656, Barbara Elfbrandt, Petitioner, versus Imogene R. Russell et al."
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,28.578,33.86,"Mr. Chief Justice Warren, Justices of the Court."
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,150.293,156.253,"Mr. Morgan, the oath is simply the oath that appears on page 9 of your brief."
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,156.253,157.62,"Yes, it is, Mr. Justice."
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,157.62,163.931,"And that's an oath that is very similar to, if not identical with the oath that all federal officeholders taken."
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,163.931,165.509,It's a traditional oath of our society as --
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,165.509,167.624,Traditional oath for Government employees?
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,167.624,168.582,Yes.
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,185.379,187.61,But it is the statutorial form (Voice Overlap) --
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,187.61,188.62,It is.
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,188.62,188.706,And that's the --
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,188.706,188.835,One which (Voice Overlap) --
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,188.835,190.344,-- only oath involved here.
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,190.344,193.025,It's the only oath.
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,199.323,215.102,"Well, I suppose your case would be the same whether or not there was an oath, if they -- if Section (e) just said “if any” -- or just -- if it just took out “having taking a form of oath or affirmation proscribed by this.”"
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,215.102,215.666,Exactly so.
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,215.666,216.765,With your case would be exactly the same.
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,216.765,217.192,Exactly.
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,217.192,218.049,You're attacking (e).
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,219.143,219.822,Exactly.
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,219.822,220.403,Is that it?
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,220.403,220.965,Yes.
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,220.965,223.507,"Yes, fine."
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,223.507,238.46,"At the same time, the state legislature also passed a anti-subversive -- a subversive law which is practically per verbiage of Section (e) of the provisions which I've read to you."
1965.656,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,287.285,287.672,We'll recess now.
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,287.672,294.141,"Yes, (Inaudible)."
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,338.866,340.52,She's a Quaker?
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,340.52,343.664,She is a Quaker.
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,343.664,350.584,"But I gather it wasn't to the taking the oath which she objected because she had the choice of affirming, didn't she?"
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,350.584,351.299,Exactly.
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,351.299,351.587,"So, wasn't she (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,351.587,361.638,"And, had previously signed an oath, an affirmation, oath in terms of the paycheck because the vouchers contained -- printed on them an affirmation clause."
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,361.638,370.535,"And she has -- she's making no attack here on the basis of the First Amendment, the protection of free exercise of religion, is she?"
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,370.535,378.026,"No, not -- and particularly because it's a class action in terms of what would then be available to all the employees of the State of Arizona."
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,378.026,380.503,And anybody has the choice of affirming rather than taking an oath.
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,380.503,382.806,"Exactly so, yes."
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,568.334,578.599,"But whether or not -- whether or not the State of Arizona had good reason or no reason to pass this law as -- that question as such isn't really the business of this Court, is it?"
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,578.599,603.239,"I think when -- yes, I think it is, under -- even under your decisions, on the basis that when the Court sets back and allows the state to operate in a way to place a limitation on freedom of assembly and freedom of speech, then the burden is upon that state to show its -- the need to do this."
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,603.239,605.114,"Well, is this --"
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,605.114,605.578,And where is the need --
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,605.578,615.638,"If the operation of this law results in the violation of some of these constitutional rights then it does and under that extent, pro tanto it's invalid."
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,639.572,643.399,In that light I would agree and concur with you in your interpretation of the matter.
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,672.624,672.987,"Now, that's --"
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,672.987,675.107,Whether it's a junk case.
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1241.345,1243.723,Are we clear that no hearing is available here?
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,1243.723,1254.473,There is no hearing available in the State of Arizona to -- other than a tenured school teacher and we are not here as a tenured school teacher.
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1257.262,1261.491,Your -- the person who brought this suit is a tenured --
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,1261.491,1261.672,No --
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1261.672,1261.828,-- school teacher on --
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,1261.828,1262.749,-- not at the time --
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1262.749,1266.515,"-- on behalf of herself and other similarly situated, isn't it?"
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,1266.611,1267.332,She was not --
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1267.332,1269.082,-- and all other govern -- Arizona employees.
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,1269.082,1270.936,"Yes, she was not tenured at the time."
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1270.936,1271.741,She is now.
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,1271.741,1272.489,She is now.
1965.656,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1274.819,1276.701,May I ask you this question.
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,1276.745,1277.549,"Yes, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1965.656,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1277.549,1293.397,"-- in the record that shows whether at the time a prospective state employee takes this oath, there is any reference to or notice of the statute?"
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,1293.397,1294.347,Yes.
1965.656,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1294.347,1295.148,When -- how does that (Voice Overlap) --
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,1295.148,1321.334,The law itself establishes the way it will be printed and if you'll -- the statute itself Mr. Justice Fortas provides that the Section (e) will be typed up and printed along with the oath itself and get the law itself.
1965.656,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1323.854,1326.563,"Well, don't take your time."
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,1326.563,1331.1,It's in our brief and it's in the state's brief.
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1557.933,1572.289,"Now, I suppose a state can, if it wants to, decide that it doesn't want to have its own employees, people who are either dangerous or unstable, would you agree with that?"
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,1572.289,1573.862,"Yes, and further stay the law."
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1573.862,1591.144,"And, if somebody doesn't want to -- if somebody is, falls into one of those categories and for that reason can't take this oath without committing perjury, he doesn't need to refuse to take the oath."
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,1600.429,1602.82,I think that's inaccurate.
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1636.461,1641.194,"Well, this person obviously doesn't like public employment under condition of it in Arizona."
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,1641.194,1641.669,"But, let's as --"
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1641.669,1643.618,There are many other states which don't have --
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,1643.618,1643.782,Fine.
1965.656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1643.782,1644.407,-- have these conditions.
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,1644.407,1650.474,But let's assume that with that condition there's due process.
1965.656,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1727.079,1748.691,"Well, how about the phrase in the law that says -- requires as a condition to its punitive application or disqualification that the person must have had knowledge of said unlawful purpose of the organization."
1965.656,0,45403,w_edward_morgan,,1750.179,1751.262,Yes.
1965.656,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2288.567,2289.964,Mr. Haggerty.
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2289.964,2292.029,May it please the Court.
1965.656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2412.196,2416.503,"Yes, but it's suggested that's the very vice of the statute."
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2416.503,2428.278,"If nothing can be accomplished by the statute, if no right which previously existed was taken away and no new right is created, thus the status of the person has not changed."
1965.656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2428.278,2428.325,But if a --
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2428.325,2430.915,He can be fired from public employment for being a democrat or a republican.
1965.656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2430.915,2449.035,"I gather, after you sign this oath, you sign it and after you -- you not only promise what is stated in the oath and you not only disclaim what is stated in the oath, but you disclaim also that you're not a member, for example, of any of these organizations at that time."
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2449.035,2450.595,At the time that it is taken.
1965.656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2450.595,2453.676,"It doesn't refer to the future, except in terms of a promise."
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2463.262,2465.142,If you have a concomitant fact that (Voice Overlap) --
1965.656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2465.142,2476.523,"Now, just what if you didn't know what this was all -- what these organizations really were and you refused to sign the oath because you didn't know and the statute didn't give you a hearing?"
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2476.523,2478.921,What purpose could a hearing do?
1965.656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2500.018,2504.021,"Well, somebody must know or you wouldn't lose your job over it."
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2504.021,2505.217,You can't lose your job until you --
1965.656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2505.217,2505.613,And it's also had at least --
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2505.613,2508.43,-- have been convicted in a court of law as a part of the criminal process.
1965.656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2508.43,2513.946,The employee might be put to a little clearer choice though by a hearing.
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2513.946,2519.462,He can only be fired if he were convicted of committing perjury.
1965.656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2519.462,2520.765,"No, no (Inaudible) --"
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2520.765,2522.826,He can't be fired by the agency.
1965.656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2522.826,2524.269,"Well, if he signs the oath?"
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2524.269,2525.229,"If he signs the oath, he can't be --"
1965.656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2525.229,2525.305,"Oh, I know but --"
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2525.305,2525.864,-- touched by the agency.
1965.656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2525.864,2528.84,"-- he doesn't sign the oath, he can certainly be fired."
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2529.006,2530.157,They cannot be paid.
1965.656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2530.157,2534.611,"Even if the reason he didn't sign it is that he didn't understand what his choices were, namely --"
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2534.611,2535.603,He cannot be fired.
1965.656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2541.682,2544.209,"You draw the difference, if you want to between those two things."
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2544.209,2545.975,"Well, it have been precisely drawn in this case."
1965.656,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2554.742,2557.755,Isn't there a Communist Party in Arizona?
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2557.755,2558.728,I frankly do not know.
1965.656,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2560.546,2560.731,Isn't that --
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2560.731,2561.779,But there is no organized party in Arizona.
1965.656,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2561.779,2563.773,Do they have a law?
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2563.773,2564.59,Pardon me?
1965.656,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2564.59,2566.665,Is it against the law to have one?
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2566.775,2566.929,Yes.
1965.656,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2566.929,2567.942,-- Arizona?
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2567.942,2568.124,Yes.
1965.656,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2571.587,2573.949,"Well, what Communist Party is --"
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2573.949,2574.36,Pardon me?
1965.656,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2574.36,2578.069,What Communist Party is referred to in the statute?
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2578.069,2580.666,The Communist Party of United States.
1965.656,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2580.666,2584.698,"Well, is there a Communist Party of the United States now?"
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2584.698,2587.173,"There's some question as to that, I suppose, as a factual matter."
1965.656,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2604.585,2639.384,"Suppose a man belonged to some organization that had been cited by the Un-American Affairs Committee of the Congress and he was -- he had no knowledge himself as to this being a communist organization, but it was cited by that committee as being a communist front organization or some other communist organization and he was working for the state and he was afraid he might go to jail for perjury if he signed the thing."
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2645.715,2649.295,He will be in the same position as you placed the Union official in the Douds case.
1965.656,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2653.759,2666.453,"Well, I know, but it's never been definitely proved in any court that this organization is cited by the Un-American Affairs Committee is a communist organization, is communist-controlled, or anything else."
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2669.899,2674.9,"He cannot be convicted unless he knows that it is -- well, the fact as it has been cited by a committee is of no bearing."
1965.656,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2682.331,2682.902,"Well, suppose it was --"
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2682.902,2683.429,-- hearing.
1965.656,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2683.429,2706.407,"Suppose it was so when it had been put on the list by the Attorney General and he claims that it isn't and he want -- as far as he knows, and he wants to know whether he can continue his employment without taking that oath because there's no one to tell him whether that -- whether he'd be in danger or not."
1965.656,1,37985,philip_m_haggerty,,2706.407,2718.008,"There are times, I suppose, in any criminal Act where your chance of being proved guilty or innocent depends upon your knowledge and your convincing the jury of your particular knowledge."
