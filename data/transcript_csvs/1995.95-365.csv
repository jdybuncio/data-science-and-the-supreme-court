1995.95-365,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.11,We'll hear argument next in Number 95-365... the spectators are admonished to remain silent until you get outside the courtroom.
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,24.756,25.467,Thank you.
1995.95-365,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,72.528,77.322,"I see the petitioner's name, Mr. Smith, is James Griffin Lane."
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,80.655,81.574,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-365,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,120.29,136.492,"Mr. Smith, may I refer you to the statute, section 505(a)(2), dealing explicitly with remedies?"
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,141.153,141.984,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-365,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,141.984,158.925,"And it says the remedies set forth in title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 shall be available to any person aggrieved under the statute, and the civil title VI in includes compensatory damages, I believe, is that right?"
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,158.925,159.887,"Yes, Your Honor, that is correct."
1995.95-365,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,159.887,173.755,"And then it goes on and it says, any person aggrieved by any act or failure to act by any recipient of Federal assistance, or Federal provider of such assistance."
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,185.201,189.555,"Yes, Your Honor, it is, and we believe--"
1995.95-365,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,189.555,196.278,"Well, if it is, then does the statute cover it and you don't have to go through all this implication?"
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,196.278,207.776,"--Well, as we argued in our reply brief, we believe even if you read 505(a)(2) alone, in isolation, because the Department of Transportation is a Federal provider--"
1995.95-365,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,207.776,209.869,How do we know who's a Federal provider?
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,224.658,237.227,"--It did not, Your Honor, and as we've argued in our brief, we believe that Congress when it amended 504 and also provided in 505(a)(2) for this--"
1995.95-365,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,237.227,241.652,Can you give me a hand here and use the U.S.C. sections?
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,249.896,250.326,--Yes--
1995.95-365,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,250.326,254.259,"794a(a)(2) would be the remedy section, right?"
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,254.259,254.457,--That's correct.
1995.95-365,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,254.457,259.832,"And the general liability section would be 794(a), right?"
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,259.832,261.673,"That's correct also, Your Honor."
1995.95-365,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,282.958,284.19,Is there a definition anywhere?
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,284.19,289.62,"--There is not a definition that I'm aware of, Your Honor, of Federal provider anywhere in the statute."
1995.95-365,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,319.781,325.625,Would you call the Department of Transportation a Federal provider with respect to the Merchant Marine Academy?
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,325.625,364.01,"No, Your Honor, we would not, because of this Court's decision in Paralyzed Veterans, which indicates that funds that are actually provided to an entity that the Federal Government manages itself, which is what DOT does here, effectively, for the Merchant Marine Academy, then the Merchant Marine Academy is not a recipient of Federal financial assistance, but DOT would remain a Federal provider for purposes of the question Justice O'Connor was asking, but our view is that you shouldn't read Federal provider in that narrow sense here."
1995.95-365,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,433.145,435.416,"Mr. Smith, why is that so extraordinary?"
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,451.547,465.567,"--Well, certainly, Your Honor, but I would suggest to you there's no suggestion anywhere in the statute, or in the legislative history, that Congress was assuming that the APA was going to apply to the situation precisely for the reason that we're here now."
1995.95-365,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,465.567,479.435,"I'm not talking about the APA applying, but is it... am I not right that 702, in its broad waiver of sovereign immunity, is hardly limited to cases arising under the APA."
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,485.319,491.025,"I believe that is right, Your Honor, that wouldn't change the contention that I'm trying to make here."
1995.95-365,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,491.025,491.564,Why wouldn't it--
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,492.385,492.645,Sorry.
1995.95-365,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,492.645,501.461,--It would mean that there's always a suit under the APA to get the Government to comply with obligations imposed upon the Government by law.
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,506.884,508.666,"I believe that is right, Your Honor."
1995.95-365,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,508.666,518.64,"Okay, so then the only question is, is there in addition provided by this statute a suit for money damages, which the APA does not provide?"
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,518.64,537.925,"Does it not provide, and our contention is what Congress is trying to do here was to equalize the remedies available for all entities covered by section 504, including the Federal Government, and that is what it was doing in 505(a)(2), or 29 U.S.C. 794a(a)(2)."
1995.95-365,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,537.925,552.815,"Well, it's truly remarkable, then, with the sections coming right in sequence, that different language is used in 505(a)(2), 794a(a)(2), than the section right before it."
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,554.858,566.254,"Our contention is that they mean the same thing, but our contention also is that if they don't mean the same thing, that Federal provider is something narrower, that we are still entitled to damages in this case."
1995.95-365,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,582.016,585.206,"Well, who's the Federal provider in your case?"
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,585.206,593.384,"The Federal provider in our case is... within the meaning we've now been discussing it, Your Honor, is the Department of Transportation."
1995.95-365,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,593.384,599.147,But I thought a moment ago you said that would not be the Federal provider with respect to the Merchant Marine Academy.
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,599.147,601.738,"That is right, Your Honor."
1995.95-365,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,629.605,630.446,What is that act?
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,630.446,633.689,"--504 of the Rehabilitation Act, Your Honor."
1995.95-365,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,633.689,635.041,"No, I mean, you say it's committed an act."
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,635.311,635.652,"Oh, sorry."
1995.95-365,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,639.733,641.936,--I thought the academy discriminated.
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,642.197,665.351,"--Well, Your Honor, we, of course, brought our action against all three levels here, and because the Department of Transportation effectively manages the Merchant Marine Academy through MARAD, which is another intervening entity, DOT is ultimately responsible in our view, which is why we brought the action against the Secretary, for the conduct here."
1995.95-365,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,665.351,672.715,"Could the Secretary have ordered the admission, or the continued student status of your client?"
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,672.715,675.777,"Oh, absolutely, Your Honor."
1995.95-365,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,675.777,679.801,The Secretary could have reversed the decision of the Maritime Academy?
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,679.801,682.062,"Presumably so, Your Honor."
1995.95-365,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,696.45,723.949,"Mr. Smith, the distinction that you're making, the... you say that 502(a)(2), provider, covers the Department of Transportation because it provides, but in this particular case it's in its capacity as executive agency, not as provider."
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,755.259,756.17,"I agree with that, Your Honor."
1995.95-365,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,769.06,778.035,"If you don't get that from the word, Federal provider, in 505(a)(2), where do you get that explicit waiver of damages, or clear waiver?"
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,778.035,781.618,"--Well, we get it in part from 505(a)(2), Your Honor."
1995.95-365,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,827.989,837.366,"Mr. Smith, can I suggest a different reading of 794a(a)(2), and you tell me why it would not make sense."
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,907.383,907.744,It--
1995.95-365,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,907.744,908.613,Why isn't that the way to read it?
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,908.613,921.553,"--It isn't clear in that case, Your Honor, what the duty then is in 504(a), 794a, that the Federal provider as you're now defining it was violating."
1995.95-365,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,921.553,936.923,The Federal provider cannot deny funds to an otherwise eligible private provider of assistance to the public on the ground that those funds are going to be spent on handicapped facilities.
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,936.923,939.014,If that--
1995.95-365,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,939.014,949.729,"If it's denied that, you know, this is an extravagant expenditure, building this ramp for wheelchairs or what not is an extravagant expenditure, and we will not provide funds for that, you would have a cause of action against the Federal provider to get those funds."
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,949.729,959.887,"--In that event, Your Honor, Congress has imposed a duty on executive agencies not to discriminate."
1995.95-365,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,959.887,960.498,Yes.
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,960.498,964.95,But it's not provided the same damage remedy for that kind of discrimination--
1995.95-365,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,964.95,965.21,Right.
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,965.21,967.213,--as the kind you just now described.
1995.95-365,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,967.213,981.612,"Right, because it knew that, you know, damages can get out of hand, especially against a deep pocket like the Government, and the only kind of damage actions we're going to allow are damage actions for the amount of money that would have been provided under the assistance program."
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,981.612,1007.468,"Even if that reading is a plausible one, Your Honor, and I think it is not because of the anomaly of there being two kinds of obvious discrimination and for one you're suggesting a remedy, a damage remedy is provided and for the other not, I would still contend to you that any doubt about Congress' intention on the point you've just raised is resolved again by the Equalization of Remedies Act."
1995.95-365,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1007.468,1017.416,But that Equalization of Remedies Act seems to me to be devoted primarily to making the States liable in response to our Atascadero decision.
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1017.416,1044.992,"I agree with that, Your Honor, that that was the impetus for the 1986 act, but section 2 of that act as we read it, and we don't understand the Government to deny this, section 2 of that act, by its own terms, equalizes the remedies between the States, which we know includes damages, with all other defendants who are subject to a suit for a violation under all of the statutes named in section 1."
1995.95-365,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1044.992,1067.488,"Well, but what it's saying, section 2 is saying is that you're going to have the remedies available against a State that are available against other entities, and you draw from that kind of a negative inference that since damages are available against the State, therefore they must be available against these other public entities, too?"
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1067.488,1070.159,"Well, not a negative inference, Your Honor."
1995.95-365,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1091.334,1091.685,But it doesn't--
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1104.351,1111.606,"Well, Your Honor, if... I would say that any public entity here includes the Federal Government."
1995.95-365,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1111.606,1115.249,But your reading makes public and private superfluous.
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1129.889,1132.092,If that--
1995.95-365,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1132.092,1142.398,"So the State equalization clause wants to pick both of them up, and that's why it has public and private in it, knowing that there may be a difference."
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1142.398,1143.089,--Well--
1995.95-365,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1143.089,1145.19,Maybe public doesn't refer to the United States.
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1147.983,1160.292,"--Well, Your Honor, the reason I think it has to refer to the United States is because the United States is certainly an entity that is covered by section 504, which is listed in paragraph (1)."
1995.95-365,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1160.292,1172.23,"But even if it does, I don't know why it follows from your... anything further follows from your argument than if the Federal Government does not have to provide a general damages remedy, then by virtue of this particular provision the State wouldn't have to provide one."
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1199.726,1201.919,"Let me try to respond, Your Honor."
1995.95-365,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1209.022,1209.643,Mm hmm.
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1209.643,1233.959,"And I would urge that, since the States are subject to a damage remedy, and since the purpose of this provision was to equalize that remedy with the remedies available against any public or private entity other than a State that is subject to suit under section 504, necessarily public entity in that phrase has to include the Federal Government."
1995.95-365,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1233.959,1246.928,"I'm assuming that it does, but the... what you refer to as being equalization, as I understand the statute means that the States cannot provide less than the other entities to whom they are compared."
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1259.475,1280.419,"Well, if I follow you, Your Honor, that would mean that we would have differing remedies, as Justice Kennedy was suggesting, that the public and private entity may be subject to, but if that were the case, it's difficult for me to see how we are to choose between them with regard to what remedies the State is going to be subject to."
1995.95-365,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1280.419,1285.852,"Why isn't it just saying, you're entitled to the best remedy there is, it's private entity just as though public wasn't there."
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1319.995,1328.461,"Well, the answer to that, Your Honor, is, as the Chief Justice pointed out, the purpose of this provision was to respond to Atascadero."
1995.95-365,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1339.067,1352.106,"Wouldn't it be logical, though, even if the trigger is a case that's dealing with State immunities, for a Congress filled with lawyers to think, well, we know the Feds are also immune, while we're dealing with governmental immunity we should take care of both?"
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1352.106,1357.59,"--Well, they might have, Your Honor, and of course, I wish they had, or I wouldn't be here now."
1995.95-365,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1390.252,1399.527,Your argument is that this language reflects the understanding by Congress that all public and private entities were liable for money damages.
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1426.886,1427.775,"No, no, I'm thinking."
1995.95-365,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1450.782,1451.34,--If I could ask you one more thing--
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1451.34,1451.811,Certainly.
1995.95-365,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1451.811,1463.139,--Is your case helped at all by the fact that it's recognized... I think it's recognized that back pay is permissible in a suit against the Government?
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1468.094,1488.225,"Well, we think it's helped, Your Honor, because of the overall implausibility of the proposition that Congress would have provided everything that it did here, which is to say it provided that the Federal Government would be subject to the action, that attorney's fees would be available, that injunctive relief would be available--"
1995.95-365,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1488.225,1489.475,"Well, I guess what I'm saying is--"
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1489.475,1491.097,"--that back pay would be available, but not damages."
1995.95-365,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1491.097,1496.661,"--is the Government right in saying, or at least in implying that back pay is simply an equitable remedy?"
1995.95-365,0,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,1496.661,1515.394,"Well, I think not, Your Honor, because the Court dealt with that in the Franklin case, that very distinction that was being drawn, and said the effect of the ruling there was to make the States liable to pay money damages, even when it was called equitable relief in the form of back pay."
1995.95-365,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1515.394,1517.995,"Very well, Mr. Smith."
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1519.737,1528.333,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-365,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1539.759,1544.932,"Well, what about the section that appears to make a Federal provider liable?"
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1544.932,1560.394,"--Your Honor, for the several reasons I think that members of the Court were suggesting, we interpret that not to extend to Federal executive agencies, programs or activities conducted by Federal executive agencies under section 794."
1995.95-365,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1561.886,1572.212,"Well, do you agree that Congress did waive sovereign immunity for purposes of money damages insofar as the money is... the assistance is provided by a Federal provider?"
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1572.212,1578.176,"--We... no, we do not agree that damages are necessarily available against a Federal funder."
1995.95-365,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1609.515,1615.231,"Well, it does say the remedies set forth in title VI are available against a Federal provider, doesn't it?"
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1615.231,1629.028,"Yes, and title VI remedies against Federal providers, Your Honor, include things such as remedies for the fund recipient, when the fund recipient is challenging the cutoff of funds or action by the Federal fund provider."
1995.95-365,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1640.356,1651.843,"Well, why would Congress want to waive sovereign immunity if the Federal Government is a Federal provider of assistance but not if it does it directly, as an executive agency?"
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1653.436,1661.019,"--We think what Congress is trying to do in subsection (a)(2), Your Honor, was make section 504 like title VI and title IX."
1995.95-365,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1723.042,1730.336,"Ms. Brinkmann, I still don't understand why you exclude damage remedies against the Federal provider."
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1739.823,1762.076,"I think the question would be, Your Honor, the way to analyze it is to see what remedies are available under title VI, and I think calling it damages, what makes me hesitate, I think it would be a question, for example, under Bowen v. Massachusetts whether or not there could be some monetary relief, perhaps as an injunctive, requiring the agency either to provide funds or not provide funds, but it's not a damages remedy--"
1995.95-365,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1762.076,1769.091,--So it's not saying... 794a(a)(2) in your view does not say that money damages are available.
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1774.384,1775.166,"--That's right, Your Honor."
1995.95-365,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1775.166,1775.636,--in your view.
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1780.539,1781.06,Perhaps.
1995.95-365,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1831.473,1836.696,"Well, is the Department of Transportation a Federal provider of assistance?"
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1836.696,1841.21,--We don't believe so under the broad definition of that subsection (a)(2).
1995.95-365,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1864.304,1866.204,Is that the source of your concession?
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1873.2,1873.7,--Yes.
1995.95-365,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1873.7,1877.692,Where does the waiver of the sovereign's immunity as to those come from?
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1877.692,1881.235,"Your Honor, I don't think it's necessarily something the Court needs to resolve in this case."
1995.95-365,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1903.371,1904.6,Does that cover back pay?
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1906.8,1908.373,--The A... no.
1995.95-365,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1908.373,1909.084,It says nonmonetary.
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1909.084,1909.742,It is.
1995.95-365,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1917.619,1920.501,But that's not the waiver that's contained in 702.
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1922.872,1923.263,Yes.
1995.95-365,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1923.263,1951.469,"It does not include back pay, so you still have to explain where you get a cause of action against the Government for back pay, and it's... it doesn't satisfy me to say we don't have to worry about that in this case, because I for one think that where there has been a general grant of suit against the United States, I don't think we have to further insist that there be a specific grant of suit for money damages."
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1956.785,1960.118,"Well, Your Honor, there are several opinions of this Court that I think hold to the contrary."
1995.95-365,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1962.028,1963.288,That was a discrete item.
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1964.229,1964.569,Yes.

1995.95-365,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1997.674,1999.083,--(b)... yes.
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1999.083,1999.363,Yes.
1995.95-365,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2058.833,2062.545,"Ms. Brinkmann, may I call your attention, or ask you a question about the 1986 statute?"
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2062.545,2063.195,Mm hmm.
1995.95-365,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2063.195,2073.842,"In your view, is the Secretary of Transportation and/or the Merchant Marine Academy a public entity other than a State within the meaning of that statute?"
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2073.842,2078.605,"My first answer, it doesn't matter, but I'll answer directly then explain why."
1995.95-365,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2078.605,2079.737,"Well, I think it matters, so let's have an answer."
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2079.737,2086.532,"Looking at the history of that provision, Your Honor, we believe that the intent would not include Federal--"
1995.95-365,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2086.532,2087.641,So you're answer's no.
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2087.641,2088.533,--executive agencies of the Federal Government.
1995.95-365,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2096.147,2099.96,Your answer is not consistent with the plain meaning of any public entity.
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2099.96,2100.721,--Your Honor--
1995.95-365,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2100.721,2103.703,But you say you have to look at legislative history and you figure they didn't mean to include--
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2103.703,2104.114,--Right.
1995.95-365,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2104.114,2105.464,--Federal agencies.
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2105.464,2113.977,"We acknowledge that, Your Honor, and if the plain language has to be interpreted to include the Federal Government, we don't believe that that makes any difference, as members of the Court were pointing out."
1995.95-365,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2122.743,2123.304,Correct.
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2123.304,2123.985,--and their injunctive--
1995.95-365,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2123.985,2132.411,"But is it not quite clear that Congress intended there to be a damage remedy against States and, therefore, must it not have made the assumption Justice Scalia described a little earlier?"
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2139.888,2145.341,"--Now, we would say that there were damage remedies available against private entities that were receiving Federal financial assistance."
1995.95-365,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2145.341,2147.912,"Well but, here's the problem, Ms. Brinkmann."
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2178.913,2180.022,I just don't think it--
1995.95-365,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2180.022,2181.214,--and it's easy to apply (a)(2).
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2192.34,2196.414,"--I look at the word, or, Your Honor, private or... public or private entity."
1995.95-365,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2217.078,2227.477,"Well, it says to the same extent as such remedies are available for such a violation in the suit against any public or private--"
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2227.477,2227.787,--Right.
1995.95-365,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2227.787,2228.218,"--entity, but--"
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2228.218,2232.91,"I think the problem you're suggesting would arise if it said public and private, but it says public or private."
1995.95-365,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2234.112,2235.24,"--Well, which one of the two do you pick?"

1995.95-365,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2246.897,2248.459,"Well, we'll have a lawsuit about that, I suppose."
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2248.459,2250.931,"--Your Honor, I don't think that that is the--"
1995.95-365,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2250.931,2252.122,Well--
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2252.122,2264.459,"--necessary interpretation for purposes here, and under the Court's authority for the explicit nature of a waiver we would again contrast to this the explicit waiver for compensatory damages for employment discrimination."
1995.95-365,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2264.459,2275.588,"--Ms. Brinkmann, supposing Congress just originally, without having any... passed a statute saying that all public entities shall be liable for damages if they violate the handicapped act."
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2278.781,2281.311,"Yes, I think it probably would, Your Honor."
1995.95-365,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2281.311,2289.426,So you think a generic term like all public entities would be a sufficient waiver for... to include the United States?
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2291.267,2291.938,It may well be.
1995.95-365,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2296.232,2301.495,"--Well, I would... ordinarily I would think that our cases would not support what you say in your answer."
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2301.495,2301.996,I--
1995.95-365,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2301.996,2311.851,"They're simply referring to where you could be talking about local governments, State governments, that to make the United States liable it requires something more specific than public entities."
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2311.851,2313.313,--I agree with Your Honor.
1995.95-365,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2333.194,2333.575,"What if it said, all entities?"
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2335.445,2336.166,"No, Your Honor."
1995.95-365,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2338.049,2339.489,Because there are so many entities in the world.
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2339.489,2341.051,I think it's because of the Court's--
1995.95-365,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2341.051,2343.412,"If it says all public entities, it does suffice."
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2345.022,2366.006,"--But I think the Court has made clear that for the Federal Government, normal presumptions that you might... might arise from words like use of legal remedies, in Lehman, or to be responsible to the same extent for reasonable attorney's fees as private parties in Shaw, those don't mean the same thing against the Federal Government unless Congress expressly makes that clear."
1995.95-365,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2366.006,2366.386,Isn't the--
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2372.571,2385.0,"The Court in Darrone addressed the issue, Your Honor, of whether under 504 an employment discrimination suit could be brought against recipients of Federal funds."
1995.95-365,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2442.255,2446.199,"Do I understand that there was a back pay element in this $75,000?"
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2446.199,2447.518,"--No, Your Honor."
1995.95-365,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2449.871,2453.362,May I ask you another question about the 1986 statute?
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2471.705,2472.146,Yes.
1995.95-365,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2472.146,2473.258,Do you think that's probable?
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2473.258,2474.908,"I do, Your Honor."
1995.95-365,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2480.511,2482.144,It's not concerned about State fiscs?
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2482.144,2483.856,"--Apparently not, Your Honor."
1995.95-365,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2485.296,2488.859,"Ms. Brinkmann, when did the States become liable under title VII?"
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2488.859,2491.293,--Under title VII.
1995.95-365,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2491.293,2492.712,1972.
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2493.023,2495.143,"1972, according to the Chief Justice."
1995.95-365,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2495.143,2496.866,--And when did the Federal Government agencies become--
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2496.866,2498.776,"I think it was a couple of years after that, Your Honor."
1995.95-365,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2498.776,2504.47,--So it s not so unusual to impose an obligation on the States and still keep the Feds free.
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2504.47,2504.79,Right.
1995.95-365,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2529.457,2531.598,I want to just pursue Justice Stevens' point.
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2569.252,2569.793,I don't--
1995.95-365,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2569.793,2570.414,Or at all?
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2570.414,2572.014,--I don't think they necessarily thought about it.
1995.95-365,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2582.892,2584.993,I'm not saying whether what they did was good or bad.
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2592.917,2593.447,--Your Honor--
1995.95-365,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2593.447,2597.671,"--and you also have language that permits the award, why isn't that good enough?"
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2597.671,2610.599,"--I guess what... I'm trying to address that, Your Honor, by pointing out that one thing Congress did under section 504 was for the first time, to my knowledge, bring programs and activities conducted by Federal agencies under this type of prohibition."
1995.95-365,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2637.447,2642.221,"Ms. Brinkmann, I hate to bring you back to back pay, but I didn't understand your explanation."
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2648.065,2648.894,That's right.
1995.95-365,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2648.894,2655.229,"--But 794a(a)(1), what you're referring to as 504, and I wish you'd refer to the code sections--"
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2655.229,2655.7,I'm sorry.
1995.95-365,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2655.7,2661.964,--because I... does not incorporate section 706.
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2668.109,2668.379,Yes.
1995.95-365,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2668.379,2669.14,--(f) through (k)?
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2669.14,2669.338,Yes.
1995.95-365,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2671.591,2672.3,706--

1995.95-365,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2695.814,2696.335,--Gotcha.
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2697.316,2697.596,Okay.
1995.95-365,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2729.637,2735.922,Is the reason for the exclusion of back pay in the '91 act the fact that it's already included?
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2735.922,2737.241,--Yes.
1995.95-365,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2738.453,2742.446,"Ms. Brinkmann, may I go back to what is probably a simple point about the '86 act?"
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2783.263,2784.394,"We think that's right, Your Honor."
1995.95-365,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2784.394,2788.138,"Without the congressional intent, there wouldn't be an answer in the text?"
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2788.138,2795.371,I think the plain interpretation of that sentence would be that in... are available such a violation in a suit against such a public or private entity.
1995.95-365,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2809.73,2814.144,"Logically you could say, well, I'm not subject to that remedy because somebody else is not."
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2830.864,2833.127,I think that would be further support for our interpretation.
1995.95-365,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2841.415,2841.855,"Well, but--"
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2841.855,2842.613,It would have been a provision--
1995.95-365,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2842.613,2857.403,"--But that in effect, that, just going back to Justice Breyer's point on that, I suppose your ultimate answer on that is, it may be as illogical as the devil, but the fact is, if you're going to be starchy about requiring waivers of Federal sovereign immunity, illogicality is not enough to do it."
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2861.727,2863.367,"--Frankly, Your Honor, I don't think we need to."
1995.95-365,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2864.949,2867.32,"--But if we think you do, is that the Government's position?"
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2867.32,2868.101,I'd think so.
1995.95-365,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2948.964,2962.723,"Ms. Brinkmann, would you explain once more what the Government is willing to concede 794a(a)(2) does allow by way of monetary damages?"
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2962.723,2977.072,"It allows acts... remedies that are available under title VI, and this Court has never directly addressed whether a Federal provider is subject to a direct suit under that provision."
1995.95-365,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2983.086,2985.558,What do you mean by a Federal provider?
1995.95-365,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,2986.767,2987.158,Yes.
1995.95-365,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3022.922,3024.003,"Thank you, Ms. Brinkmann."
1995.95-365,2,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,3026.705,3027.626,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1995.95-365,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3114.331,3120.386,"Well, it... except that it seems to me that it simply poses two opposing canons of interpretation."
1995.95-365,2,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,3143.419,3147.543,"Well, I'm not asking you to choose, Your Honor, because I think we serve both."
1995.95-365,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3159.591,3165.215,"What about Ms. Brinkmann's argument that when Congress did waive immunity in 501, it pregated it."
1995.95-365,2,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,3168.678,3173.54,"I think that... I think the 501 provision actually supports us, Your Honor."
1995.95-365,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3231.79,3232.831,"Thank you, Mr. Smith."
1995.95-365,2,46282,walter_a_smith_jr,,3232.831,3233.051,--Thank you.
1995.95-365,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3233.051,3234.217,The case is submitted.
