1999.99-5,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.726,"We'll hear argument now in No. 99-5, United States against Antonio J. Morrison and Christy Brzonkala v. Antonio Morrison."
1999.99-5,0,30617,julie_goldscheid,,13.745,18.111,"Mr.... Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-5,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,76.217,81.56,"Ms. Goldscheid, were all of these instances instances of gender based violence?"
1999.99-5,0,30617,julie_goldscheid,,81.56,82.643,Not--
1999.99-5,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,82.643,87.847,"As I understand it, this law doesn't apply to any... to any rape or any... any violence against women."
1999.99-5,0,30617,julie_goldscheid,,92.703,94.459,--That is absolutely correct.
1999.99-5,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,99.135,108.141,"Now, all of these... all of these instances that you're referring to that have such an effect on interstate commerce, are they all instances in which you have somebody who just hates women and is doing it for that reason?"
1999.99-5,0,30617,julie_goldscheid,,108.141,110.332,"--Perhaps not each and every instance, but Congress--"
1999.99-5,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,110.332,110.567,Most of them?
1999.99-5,0,30617,julie_goldscheid,,110.567,115.407,--Congress looked at the record as a whole and explicitly made a finding.
1999.99-5,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,126.285,134.966,"Well, that's nice, but... but the instances on which that finding was based that you're now alluding to don't... aren't limited to... to gender based violence."
1999.99-5,0,30617,julie_goldscheid,,134.966,137.222,The finding that Congress made was rational.
1999.99-5,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,137.222,137.477,I know.
1999.99-5,0,30617,julie_goldscheid,,141.179,144.542,The evidence that supports the finding was in the record.
1999.99-5,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,151.662,152.586,"Well, let me... let me ask a--"
1999.99-5,0,30617,julie_goldscheid,,152.586,153.03,They cited the case of Meritor.
1999.99-5,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,153.03,153.984,--a similar question.
1999.99-5,0,30617,julie_goldscheid,,185.063,190.337,This case is entirely distinct from the hypothetical that you propose because by--
1999.99-5,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,190.337,190.636,"Oh, I'm aware of that."
1999.99-5,0,30617,julie_goldscheid,,192.707,209.282,"--By requiring discriminatory... a showing of discriminatory motivation in each instance, the Congress specifically removed these cases from the kind of constitutional shoals that the Court in Griffin v. Breckenridge was worried about."
1999.99-5,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,209.282,222.035,But the justification for the statute that you're now giving us is a justification that would allow general Federal criminal laws on all subjects because all crime affects interstate commerce.
1999.99-5,0,30617,julie_goldscheid,,222.035,223.013,As we--
1999.99-5,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,223.013,224.386,Is that not... is that not so?
1999.99-5,0,30617,julie_goldscheid,,224.386,231.726,"--It's entirely possible that all crime might affect interstate commerce, but that does not lead necessarily to the conclusion that--"
1999.99-5,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,231.726,231.941,Well--
1999.99-5,0,30617,julie_goldscheid,,231.941,236.361,--a general tort law of the type you suggest would be constitutional.
1999.99-5,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,239.445,239.599,--I don't see why.
1999.99-5,0,30617,julie_goldscheid,,261.209,264.069,--And we are not suggesting that Congress would have that authority.
1999.99-5,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,264.069,264.518,"Oh, I think you are suggesting that."
1999.99-5,0,30617,julie_goldscheid,,289.662,292.034,"Two responses to your question, Your Honor."
1999.99-5,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,311.973,323.352,That... that would be a good response to an objection that Congress was being discriminatory in selecting only this area of... of crime and not the entire area of crime.
1999.99-5,0,30617,julie_goldscheid,,332.391,336.168,--And that point goes to the second part of my response to your earlier question.
1999.99-5,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,336.168,336.473,Good.
1999.99-5,0,30617,julie_goldscheid,,336.777,338.371,I'm sorry.
1999.99-5,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,359.998,361.33,Where do you get that principle from?
1999.99-5,0,30617,julie_goldscheid,,377.356,383.719,--Congress certainly does have the authority to... to preempt State law in areas in which it has power.
1999.99-5,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,383.719,390.071,So then what difference does it make that this exercise of Commerce Clause power happens not to preempt State law?
1999.99-5,0,30617,julie_goldscheid,,396.312,407.579,The inquiry derives from this Court's concern in the Lopez decision about obliterating the distinction between what is truly national and what is truly local.
1999.99-5,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,471.388,477.595,"Well, presumably Congress could also, under your theory at least, legislate in those areas too."
1999.99-5,0,30617,julie_goldscheid,,491.822,506.385,"It might have an effect on commerce, although that scenario... if you're suggesting a scenario that... where the Federal Government would propose to overtake, say, wholeheartedly a divorce law, that would be stepping into the shoes--"
1999.99-5,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,506.385,509.658,Make it just an alternate forum as here.
1999.99-5,0,30617,julie_goldscheid,,519.065,531.329,--It might well be a harder question because you are talking about an area that is more traditionally within State concern as compared to discrimination which is historically within the realm of the Federal Government.
1999.99-5,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,542.461,555.144,"But the... but the case of marital distribution would also be based on discrimination, that is, a documented legislative history that shows that women are getting the short end of the stick in marital property distribution."
1999.99-5,0,30617,julie_goldscheid,,555.144,565.247,"--And if there were such a legislative record, that would certainly be a closer case to what we have here than an over arching, overall regulation of divorce law."
1999.99-5,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,565.247,565.861,All right.
1999.99-5,0,30617,julie_goldscheid,,580.181,582.312,It would be very different from our scenario here.
1999.99-5,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,584.058,585.206,"Well, different enough to be unconstitutional?"
1999.99-5,0,30617,julie_goldscheid,,585.206,586.887,--I... I think the answer would be yes.
1999.99-5,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,587.526,588.878,And is the criterion tradition?
1999.99-5,0,30617,julie_goldscheid,,588.878,591.408,--It would be several things.
1999.99-5,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,611.191,611.675,"Thank you, Ms. Goldscheid."
1999.99-5,0,30617,julie_goldscheid,,611.675,612.583,--Thank you.
1999.99-5,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,612.583,614.684,"General Waxman, we'll hear from you."
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,614.684,629.972,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-5,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,651.9,662.85,"General Waxman, is the Government supporting this... the constitutionality of this legislation both on Commerce Clause grounds and on section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment?"
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,662.85,667.012,"Indeed, we are, Mr. Chief Justice, and I'm prepared to make the Government's argument with respect to both."
1999.99-5,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,671.587,673.024,Let me just comment.
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,696.899,697.548,Okay.
1999.99-5,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,697.548,705.363,"--aspect of the case, can you address the questions the Court was asking about murder statutes and why this should be different?"
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,705.363,707.099,Yes.
1999.99-5,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,707.099,707.938,Just with reference to commerce.
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,707.938,711.087,"Yes, I will do it just with respect... with reference to commerce."
1999.99-5,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,834.55,836.76,Whereas this one is squarely directed at commerce.
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,836.76,842.983,--This one is squarely directed at violent conduct as... okay.
1999.99-5,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,946.809,956.718,"Well, the Court has been helped many times by finding some kind of jurisdictional hook that the conduct that took place was carried out in... in interstate commerce."
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,958.68,963.061,--There is no such hook here and quite deliberately on Congress' part.
1999.99-5,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1067.73,1075.635,"Well, of course, in Heart of Atlanta, you... you did have commercial businesses, the running of motels and restaurants and so forth--"
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1075.635,1076.591,"Very, very--"
1999.99-5,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1076.591,1077.584,--as I understand it.
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1077.584,1079.785,"--very true, and we don't step back from that at all."
1999.99-5,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1090.871,1111.104,But your... your approach seems to me would justify a... a Federal remedy for alimony or child support or other things of that... or contract disputes because we now have a record that there's bias in State courts against women.
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1121.396,1122.146,--No.
1999.99-5,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1123.418,1123.807,No?
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1123.807,1124.951,--my theory it would be fine.
1999.99-5,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1138.726,1143.91,It has made findings about bias against women in State courts.
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1143.91,1144.57,--Indeed.
1999.99-5,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1166.443,1171.936,To remedy which in part it gave the States $1.9 billion to... to spend--
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1171.936,1174.985,"--Indeed, as... as part of the package that includes--"
1999.99-5,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1174.985,1175.324,--These States that are... that are just bad actors.
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1175.324,1182.48,"--Yes, as part of this... well, Justice Scalia, I... if I can just respond to your last comment."
1999.99-5,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1213.002,1215.177,"I thought that's what you had just said, that--"
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1215.177,1215.741,"No, no."
1999.99-5,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1215.741,1217.004,--State courts--
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1217.004,1244.206,"There... Congress found, largely by reference to the submissions by 21 State task forces and testimony of State Attorneys General and prosecutors and police, that archaic prejudices and improper stereotypes by people in the criminal justice system in a significant number of cases were affecting outcomes."
1999.99-5,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1279.7,1287.983,"--If we're... if we're talking about archaic stereotypes and so forth, are the plaintiffs going to be any better with juries in Federal court?"
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1291.411,1300.347,"Mr. Chief Justice, they... they may or may not be, and Congress didn't base its establishment of the remedy on a conclusion that they would be."
1999.99-5,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1374.404,1375.612,General Waxman--
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1375.612,1376.559,--in a choice of forums.
1999.99-5,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1376.559,1385.421,"--from what you say, I take it that there would not need to be a jurisdictional peg for the criminal provisions of this act."
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1394.493,1410.788,"I... I'm not... I'm not saying that and I'm not sure that the criminal provisions of the act would satisfy this Court's standard... unlike the civil provisions would satisfy this Court's standard in Lopez without a jurisdictional provision, and here's why."
1999.99-5,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1498.1,1519.04,"General Waxman, can you give us a single opinion in which this Court has suggested that some activities under the Commerce Clause are valid on the part of the Federal Government where they do not displace State action, but would be invalid if they do displace State action?"
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1542.437,1569.729,"Justice Scalia, I was with you entirely until the Court decided Lopez, and I think what the... and I think the reason I was with you is that the Court had never considered the... as it... as it explained, the exercise of Commerce Clause authority in an area in which it wasn't channels or... or instrumentalities of commerce, and under the substantial effects, it wasn't even activity that's economic itself or activity that protects or regulates a market."
1999.99-5,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1589.531,1589.985,Where does it say that in Lopez?
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1608.166,1612.003,"Well, I... perhaps I don't have the... the opinion with me right here."
1999.99-5,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1612.941,1617.657,"Well, if it's the only opinion you're relying on, I... I would really, you know, like to know what language suggests that."
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1618.081,1619.424,--There is language both in the--
1999.99-5,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1619.424,1620.627,--must have signed on to it unconsciously.
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1620.627,1625.614,--There is language both in the majority opinion and particularly in... in the concurring opinion.
1999.99-5,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1743.665,1759.07,"If you defend the scheme as being an analog and the same and therefore not a displacement, then that seems to me to cut against your Fifth Amendment... Fourteenth Amendment argument because you're not adding any additional remedy."
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1761.814,1766.414,"Well, let me... let me shift ground briefly to the Fourteenth Amendment."
1999.99-5,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1777.221,1781.094,"Yes, because you've defended it as saying it's just the same under theCommerce Clause."
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1781.094,1781.423,"--Well, no, no, no."
1999.99-5,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1781.812,1783.264,"And now you get to the Fifth Amendment, you're going to say, well, it's different."
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1783.264,1796.181,"--If I... if I said that it was just... just the same... just the same as what these plaintiffs already have available to them in State Courts, I... I mistook."
1999.99-5,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1818.141,1819.498,"Thank you, Mr. Waxman."
1999.99-5,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1819.498,1819.947,Thank you.
1999.99-5,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1819.947,1822.233,"Mr. Rosman, we'll hear from you."
1999.99-5,2,36591,michael_e_rosman,,1822.233,1845.768,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-5,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1932.901,1963.895,"The Government argues, Mr. Rosman, that... that we're in a new regime after Lopez and that what we should do for non economic matters is not to say that absolutely the Commerce Clause power exists or doesn't exist, but rather it may exist so long as the Government doesn't go too far in displacing State activity."
1999.99-5,2,36591,michael_e_rosman,,1965.518,1978.32,"--Because it's been... as you noted earlier and... and as I just mentioned, it's been the traditional jurisprudence of this Court that the power to regulate is the power to preempt."
1999.99-5,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1984.776,1988.833,"But what if the Federal statute expressly says, this will not preempt State laws whatsoever?"
1999.99-5,2,36591,michael_e_rosman,,1988.833,1990.305,"This statute, Your Honor?"
1999.99-5,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1990.305,1992.975,What if... what if a Federal statute had that provision in it?
1999.99-5,2,36591,michael_e_rosman,,1992.975,1997.975,"Well, the Gun Free School Zones Act had that provision and it was still unconstitutional."
1999.99-5,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2002.914,2008.153,"Well, if that's not significance, then the question of whether there's preemption or not is not significant either."
1999.99-5,2,36591,michael_e_rosman,,2008.153,2009.111,--That... that's correct.
1999.99-5,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2009.111,2009.71,"Oh, okay."
1999.99-5,2,36591,michael_e_rosman,,2009.71,2010.414,It's not significant.
1999.99-5,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2011.952,2022.934,"Well, then this... this Court has had a... what I think is an unfortunate 150 or 200-year history of trying to draw some kind of line, as you are, between local and interstate effects."
1999.99-5,2,36591,michael_e_rosman,,2026.227,2038.022,"Well, we think that Lopez best drew the line between economic conduct... that is to say, conduct which is connected to or arises out of a commercial transaction... and other conduct."
1999.99-5,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2038.022,2062.791,"So, then your view is that if it turns out that, to use one of the Government's examples, people are in their own houses cooking up biological warfare or it turns out that in their own fireplaces, they pollute the air in a way that will, through global warming, swamp the east coast... or, you know, use any of their other imaginative examples... Congress is powerless to act?"
1999.99-5,2,36591,michael_e_rosman,,2062.791,2068.754,"Well, with respect to the first example, Justice Breyer, I think Congress' power to suppress insurrections would--"
1999.99-5,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2068.754,2069.917,"Well, you see my point."
