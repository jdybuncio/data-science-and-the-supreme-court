1971.70-61,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,21.053,"We will hear the Securities and Exchange Commission against the National Committee, Mr. Solicitor General."
1971.70-61,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,21.053,24.161,May it please the Court.
1971.70-61,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,449.943,457.766,"Mr. Solicitor General, I am curious this is brought up only in the reply brief is it not?"
1971.70-61,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,457.766,470.149,"It was referred to in the main brief, I suggest that it is jurisdictional and I simply want to submit it for the court’s consideration on that basis."
1971.70-61,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,719.698,734.626,"Mr. Solicitor General, would it make any difference if the parties could go to the District Court and to court injunction?"
1971.70-61,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,736.29,739.052,"Well that is the remedy, Mr. Justice."
1971.70-61,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,755.946,762.838,So their claim must be that the proxy material was not adequate?
1971.70-61,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,762.838,763.994,Whose claim was it?
1971.70-61,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,763.994,767.351,"The Medical Committee if they went to the District Court, they would claim that the proxy material was not adequate."
1971.70-61,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,767.351,773.709,The Medical Committee’s claim would be that the proxy material was not adequate and was not required to be submitted to the shareholders.
1971.70-61,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,773.709,777.194,"Well, I mean the proxy that was sent out or--"
1971.70-61,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,777.194,780.893,"That the proxy that the Dow had sent out, it was not adequate, yes."
1971.70-61,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,780.893,781.611,It was not adequate.
1971.70-61,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,784.771,805.72,"And that would raise questions under both state law and under the Proxy Rules which would be subject to consideration by the court and another remedy available to the Medical Committee is to sent out its own proxy materials, at its own expense."
1971.70-61,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,824.652,834.364,"So the government is not contending that this Committee does not have a standing or does not have a case of controversy with Dow under the statute, so that there would not be a federal question in the District Court."
1971.70-61,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,834.364,839.311,There may well be a case of controversy with Dow but it is not here because Dow is not in this case.
1971.70-61,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,839.311,844.729,So it is a question that which court should it be and a question of reviewability?
1971.70-61,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,844.729,864.992,"It is in part whether the remedy lies in the District Court as provided in the statute or to put the same thing another way, whether it is appropriate for the Court of Appeals to seek to review something or other here under a petition for review, under Section 25a."
1971.70-61,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,891.798,901.3,Well does the SEC regulations or procedures provide for securing any kind of declaratory relief?
1971.70-61,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,901.3,903.202,"Provide for, I sorry Mr. Justice?"
1971.70-61,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,903.202,905.692,For getting any kind of declaratory relief?
1971.70-61,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,905.692,908.192,"None whatever, Mr. Justice that I know of."
1971.70-61,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,908.192,918.937,"There is no way that Dow, for example, could come in and say we want a declaratory order as to the adequacy of the proxy --"
1971.70-61,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,918.937,926.758,"I suppose the Dow could come in, but the Commission could properly dismiss that on the ground that there is no provision in the statute for such a --"
1971.70-61,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,926.758,929.164,And there is nothing in the regulations?
1971.70-61,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,929.164,932.734,Nothing in the regulations which would authorize that.
1971.70-61,1,40117,roberts_b_owen,,1771.358,1776.133,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.70-61,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2076.947,2081.193,Could the company just ignore that in the sense of defaulting?
1971.70-61,1,40117,roberts_b_owen,,2081.193,2088.449,"If the company always has the option, Mr. Justice, of simply accepting the proposal and putting it in their proxy material."
1971.70-61,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2088.449,2096.9,"No, I mean, when the protest is made with the Commission, suppose the company regard that its so privileged that they just do not want to bother responding?"
1971.70-61,1,40117,roberts_b_owen,,2096.9,2098.356,They have no choice.
1971.70-61,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2098.356,2100.512,"So, they must respond?"
1971.70-61,1,40117,roberts_b_owen,,2100.512,2101.992,One of two things can happen.
1971.70-61,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2109.279,2123.533,"So for an example the request to put it in the proxy was, “Please indicate your choice or President in the next election”, they wanted that put it in the proxy statement, do you mean that the company must respond to that frivolous request?"
1971.70-61,1,40117,roberts_b_owen,,2123.533,2128.058,"No, if you please Your Honor, what happens is this."
1971.70-61,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2327.365,2330.905,"That still leaves the option up to the company, does it?"
1971.70-61,1,40117,roberts_b_owen,,2330.905,2334.315,The company is still free to include or exclude.
1971.70-61,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2657.35,2659.615,Is that not discretionary with the Commission?
1971.70-61,1,40117,roberts_b_owen,,2659.615,2662.389,"Entirely so, Mr. Justice, yes."
1971.70-61,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2697.301,2700.602,We are talking about the practical facts.
1971.70-61,1,40117,roberts_b_owen,,2700.602,2701.158,Indeed.
1971.70-61,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2701.158,2709.428,"But the way this works, as a matter of practical fact if the company does get that kind of work from the Commission that includes the material, does it not?"
1971.70-61,1,40117,roberts_b_owen,,2709.428,2712.117,"Absolutely correct, Mr. Justice."
