1971.70-34,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,63.44,Mr. Selna you may proceed.
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,63.44,66.878,Mr. Chief Justice Burger and may it please the Court.
1971.70-34,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,186.266,192.96,"Now, is the 15,000 acres the large area that you get outlined or is it the white area?"
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,192.96,202.229,"Mr. Chief Justice, the area that is in white is 15,000 acres, Sequoia National Park surrounds it on the three sides."
1971.70-34,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,202.229,210.626,"Well, by the distinction now of the colors, is that white area now part of Sequoia National Park?"
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,210.626,213.21,No it is not Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.70-34,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,221.51,227.842,And the road that you are concerned with will pass from left to right into?
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,227.842,232.431,The road -- the smaller road is an existing road.
1971.70-34,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,244.846,257.482,"And when you say that it serves no park purpose, do you mean that it is -- its only purpose is to serve the white area which is not part of the park."
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,257.482,259.337,That is correct Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.70-34,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,259.337,260.327,Maybe an access.
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,260.327,268.528,That is correct.
1971.70-34,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,407.174,408.879,Does the record show that?
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,408.879,423.987,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, the record contains a letter which is written by a member of the Board of Directors of the Sierra Club in which he in turn refers to his trip to Mineral King."
1971.70-34,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,461.002,467.688,"But there is not any direct testimony by the members of the club anywhere in the record, is it not?"
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,467.688,474.235,"Direct testimony concerning their use Mr. Chief --Mr. Justice Blackmun, no there is not."
1971.70-34,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,474.235,476.642,"This goes back to the days of John Muir, is it not?"
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,476.642,483.014,Yes it does.
1971.70-34,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,682.651,684.843,How old is this club?
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,684.843,686.56,It is over 70 years old.
1971.70-34,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,686.56,688.344,"It has about 78,000 members?"
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,688.344,693.323,"It had, at the time the action was filed, I believe that at this time they are over a hundred thousand members."
1971.70-34,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,693.323,696.103,I was just wondering how far your argument would go.
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,715.994,731.363,"The question of anybody’s standing, Mr. Justice Brennan, all it be an evaluation that the Court would link, I am sorry Mr. Justice Stewart, would ought to be an evaluation which any -- which the Court would have to make on a case by case basis."
1971.70-34,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,731.363,733.69,A lot of what then and on what criteria?
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,733.69,753.193,"A variety of criteria and might be appropriate as the -- has organization been in existence and has it taken a stand over an unextended period of time that is consistent with its stand, has not done anything which -- gives its special expertise in the area that arises to argue about?"
1971.70-34,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,766.397,777.246,I think all of these things would have to be tried out and litigated and decided before one could decide whether or not this organization was a proper party?
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,777.246,777.867,Mr. Justice Stewart it is a --
1971.70-34,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,777.867,802.649,"I might say, I am using my analogy which like all analogies is not very exact perhaps, but of these clubs that charter airplanes across the Atlantic Ocean, even with all enforcement of the schedule to airlines, trying to implement the policing of them they have not -- there has not been very successful policing, has there?"
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,802.649,826.321,No Mr. Justice Stewart but if the concern as I understand it ought to be is that the Court be assured that a case or controversy is presented then while an exhausted trial should not be necessary or an exhausted litigation of the quality of the club’s position should not be necessary.
1971.70-34,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,835.355,861.358,"I do not think even if the club were brand new, if it were a club of an association of people interested, let us say friends of -- friends of bigger highways, that was all -- all in favor of this new highway coming into Mineral King and if they were really friends of great big broad paved highways and they were bona fide, and if they associate to become a party and bring a lawsuit to --"
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,861.358,863.044,It is conceivable that they could.
1971.70-34,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,863.044,877.211,"In the United Church case that you have cited, was not there a suggestion with the principle test of such an organization is whether truly representative of the interest that it seeks to assert."
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,877.211,877.549,Yes.
1971.70-34,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,878.558,883.498,You claim that is Sierra is truly representative of the interest that that it asserts in this case?
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,883.498,884.341,We do.
1971.70-34,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,885.222,891.908,"Now, that would not make any difference whether it was organized last year or 70 years ago, would it not?"
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,891.908,897.32,Except to the extent that if the question is to whether it was truly representative might be reflected in its age and--
1971.70-34,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,897.32,902.486,70 years tends to reinforce your claim or its --
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,902.486,903.55,And the truly representative him.
1971.70-34,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,903.55,905.115,-- the hundred thousand members.
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,905.115,906.75,"Yes it does, Mr. Chief Justice."
1971.70-34,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,906.75,909.981,And why does it have to be an association?
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,934.721,938.822,Mr. Justice Stewart I think that he could.
1971.70-34,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,938.822,940.701,John Muir’s terms are distinguished --
1971.70-34,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,940.701,941.171,Right.
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,941.171,942.677,Could do it.
1971.70-34,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,942.677,957.143,"Now I take, Mr. Selna, in your remark you concede there is some limitations than other than a broad and that a broad general interest of the problems of ecology is not enough."
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,971.463,979.975,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, I am not at this moment familiar with -- whether the Sierra Club has a chapter or an expertise in that area."
1971.70-34,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1186.276,1192.806,Mr. Selna are you telling to us now that there no roads in the Sequoia National Park?
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,1197.993,1209.649,"Mr. Chief Justice, there is a road which is the State Highway that traverses Sequoia National Park and serves the purpose of providing access to the park."
1971.70-34,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1213.792,1217.413,The one that more or less parallels the proposed new road?
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,1217.413,1220.788,"Parallels it, but on an entirely different route."
1971.70-34,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1220.788,1224.711,"Mr. Selna, let me -- I am still struggling."
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,1256.923,1262.43,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, in fact there are private in-holdings in Mineral King."
1971.70-34,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1314.122,1319.576,"But it is -- in this specific case there are private landowners up there, are they not?"
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,1319.576,1320.475,"Yes, there are."
1971.70-34,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1320.475,1329.728,"I was, you can take pot trips out of there and they have have done it and then -- there are outsiders and so on?"
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,1329.728,1331.735,"Mr. Justice Stewart they have been there for many, many years."
1971.70-34,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1331.735,1335.711,Yes.
1971.70-34,0,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,1335.711,1356.128,Now in order to give the highway a park purpose the Government argues now that to see -- that Mineral King really is part of the park at -- that the statute is clear that Congress did not include Mineral King in the park but if it had there would be no need for the highway because the Disney Development could not be built in Sequoia National Park.
1971.70-34,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1821.036,1823.711,May it please the Court.
1971.70-34,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1954.774,1956.925,"Mount Whitney -- Mount Whitney is in the National Park, is it not?"
1971.70-34,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1956.925,1959.569,"Mount Whitney is on the border of the park about here, Mr. Justice."
1971.70-34,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1959.569,1967.934,Right.
1971.70-34,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1967.934,1974.086,We had been under something of a dilemma in preparing this case.
1971.70-34,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2047.413,2056.364,"As you know General, I think the State Michigan enacted the law of giving standing down to citizen and environmental (Voice Overlap)."
1971.70-34,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2056.364,2057.647,Yes Mr. Justice.
1971.70-34,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2057.647,2059.929,And the Bill before Congress is doing the same thing?
1971.70-34,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2059.929,2063.485,"And there are Bills pending before Congress, we referred to them in our brief."
1971.70-34,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2065.126,2067.187,Has is there been report on it?
1971.70-34,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2067.187,2070.875,That would certainly be a relevant and important.
1971.70-34,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2170.762,2179.396,Or would they need only to amend the allegations to say that they continually run -- their members continually run pack trips into Mineral King?
1971.70-34,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2179.396,2181.265,"That would help, but they have not done it."
1971.70-34,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2229.712,2238.417,I have a motion for leave to file a brief of amicus curiae in behalf of the United States Ski Association and the Far West Ski Association?
1971.70-34,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2238.417,2238.899,"Well, I have --"
1971.70-34,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2238.899,2241.512,"In January, I have not -- I do not seem to have their brief, did they file their brief?"
1971.70-34,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2241.512,2254.636,Filed the -- the one I am referring to is the red one which Tulare County is yellow and the red one I believe leave to file was granted by consent of both sides.
1971.70-34,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2489.385,2517.428,"Mr. Solicitor General, in the United Church case which was not treated in this Court, but only in the Court of Appeals, standing was rested on the idea that television and radio broadcasters reach into the private home of every -- virtually every listener everyday and on that ground the listeners were given standing."
1971.70-34,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2519.686,2528.412,"No, Mr. Justice, although I think it is -- I think it is very close to the line but I think it is on the proper side of the line."
1971.70-34,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2578.804,2580.872,"By the way -- by the way, did any of them seek to intervene?"
1971.70-34,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,2580.872,2582.559,"No, Mr. Justice."
1971.70-34,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3184.662,3186.977,"Mr. Solicitor General, we will resume after lunch."
1971.70-34,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3197.531,3203.216,I must conclude my argument on standing.
1971.70-34,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3264.48,3271.107,"Mr. Solicitor General, is not the question whether an injunction, a temporary injunction point of --"
1971.70-34,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3271.107,3273.396,Yes Mr. Justice but that turns in part on the questions of standing.
1971.70-34,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3273.396,3275.03,I understand but --
1971.70-34,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3275.03,3286.951,"Well, on the merits by that, I mean, on whether there was sufficient chance that the plaintiff could win in a trial on the merits that it was appropriate for the Court to grant a temporary injunction."
1971.70-34,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3286.951,3290.54,Because of -- this case is going to be tried if --
1971.70-34,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3290.54,3305.236,"I appreciate that Mr. Justice, but if the Court can conclude that, the legal situation is such that no showing of facts would warrant the issuance of a permanent injunction then there should not be issued a temporary injunction or indeed even less --"
1971.70-34,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3305.236,3311.109,So you are really saying that we should decide these three questions you are going to talk about here?
1971.70-34,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3311.109,3319.05,Only Mr. Justice that they are not serious enough to make it appropriate to grant a temporary injunction without a trial.
1971.70-34,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3319.05,3320.551,We do not have to finally to decide them?
1971.70-34,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3320.551,3344.774,"You do not have finally to decide them, but my position is that it can be readily found that they are not serious enough so as to warrant the granting of a permanent injunction even though there is some chance that after trial it might be that circumstances could be shown which would lead to the other conclusion."
1971.70-34,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3690.617,3691.315,Thank you.
1971.70-34,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3691.315,3699.377,Mr. Solicitor General I have one question and I suppose it is presumptuous of me to ask you at this stage of the case.
1971.70-34,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3727.544,3799.428,"There is a provision in the proposed permit Mr. Justice, which says that the road will not be increased in size and that if it turns out to be inadequate that the State will provide other means for getting into the area and it is possible to do so and this I am told is paragraph 37 of the proposed permit on page 76 of our brief as a condition for granting this permit, permitee which is the State of California agrees that should it ever be necessary in the future to provide for increased visitor capacity in Mineral King, an alternate means of access to Mineral King shall be provided which does not involve access through the park or in the alternatives such excess capacity shall be accommodated through mechanical means in lieu of any further improvement of road access and the only thing that I could think of that the mechanical means is would be helicopters or maybe some other kind of airplanes."
1971.70-34,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3867.436,3869.314,Thank you Mr. Solicitor General.
1971.70-34,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3869.405,3875.126,"By the way Mr. General, you said you have covered the standing question in the footnote."
1971.70-34,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3879.551,3882.555,That I covered standing in the footnote.
1971.70-34,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3882.555,3886.432,In answer to my question about legislation dealing with standing?
1971.70-34,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3886.432,3888.827,Oh! Yes I am sure it is in my --
1971.70-34,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3888.827,3891.084,"Well, would you mind (Inaudible)"
1971.70-34,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3891.084,3892.908,I will find it and --
1971.70-34,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3892.908,3893.503,Thank you.
1971.70-34,1,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,3893.503,3895.298,Thank you.
1971.70-34,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3895.298,3900.356,"Some of you were about out of time, but in view of this enlargement we will give you three minutes."
1971.70-34,2,35052,leland_r_selna_jr,,3900.356,3902.358,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.70-34,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4102.737,4105.075,"Thank you Mr. Selna, thank you Mr. Solicitor General."
1971.70-34,3,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4105.095,4108.212,May I Mr. Justice Douglas’ question?
1971.70-34,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4113.533,4114.082,Thank you very much.
1971.70-34,3,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4114.082,4125.185,And just at the middle of the page and then there is a related reference on page 26 with a footnote following that and I think that is what I had in mind.
1971.70-34,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4125.185,4125.661,Thank you very much.
1971.70-34,3,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,4125.661,4127.14,At pages 17 and 26.
1971.70-34,3,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4127.14,4129.236,Thank you.
1971.70-34,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4129.236,4129.627,Thank you.
