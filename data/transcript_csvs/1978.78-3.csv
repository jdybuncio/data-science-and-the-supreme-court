1978.78-3,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,57.31,We'll hear arguments next in Parham against Hughes.
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,62.596,66.241,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-3,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,122.195,129.269,Would you agree that the charge in legislature could abolish the old claims for deaths by wrongful act?
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,129.269,133.747,That they could abolish all claims for a death by wrongful act?
1978.78-3,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,186.951,195.981,Does it make any difference to your case whether the mother is living or dead or whether the child ever saw the father?
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,195.981,206.516,"Your Honor, I think it makes a tremendous amount of difference because I don't think the Georgia legislature is obligated to absolutely guarantee the father of an illegitimate child the right to participate in the recovery."
1978.78-3,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,258.723,266.773,"Well, is there a constitutional obligation on every state to attune its statutes to fit every conceivable situation that may arise?"
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,266.773,269.699,"No Your Honor, not every conceivable situation that may arise."
1978.78-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,285.59,296.304,"Mr. Greer, as I understand it, some states permit different elements of damages and recovery for wrongful death of children on the part of parents and others."
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,306.707,314.728,"Georgia allows recovery for the value of the life of a child, it's a -- and then its subject purely to the jury's discretion from that point forward."
1978.78-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,314.728,318.239,Could it -- it could include a loss of consortium type of (Voice Overlap)?
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,318.239,325.831,It includes -- instructions have been approved which allow the jury to consider the loss of companionship issue.
1978.78-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,325.831,331.0,So it isn't just a monetary thing that the child would have supplied you with so much money over the year.
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,331.0,342.493,"No Your Honor, as a matter of fact, the Georgia legislature expressly repealed the statute in 1952 that require the contribution by the minor to the support of the parents."
1978.78-3,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,370.4,372.555,Were the parents living together or?
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,372.555,376.15,"No Your Honor, not as much -- no, Your Honor, they were not."
1978.78-3,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,421.417,429.944,"Mr. Greer, let me ask you too, there's a suggestion that a cause of action by the administratrix is pending, is that still pending?"
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,429.944,431.757,Your Honor that action is pending.
1978.78-3,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,470.357,472.469,Are you representing the state?
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,472.469,472.753,No Your Honor.
1978.78-3,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,475.057,479.575,So you haven't -- you're not in the administrative's lawsuit in any way.
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,479.575,479.819,No Your Honor.
1978.78-3,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,479.819,481.026,Why is that being held up?
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,481.787,483.334,Pending disposition of this case.
1978.78-3,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,483.334,490.228,Is it agreed that that -- that the administratrix occupies a secondary capacity to either parent?
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,490.228,491.194,No Your Honor.
1978.78-3,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,500.147,504.099,"Well, why is that case being held up?"
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,504.099,525.585,"I think the -- there would be a prospect of an invalidation of -- well, I can see theoretically how that case could proceed and the question might be who wouldn't be entitled to recovery of the proceeds but the Superior Court of Richmond County chose to enjoin that case pending a decision in this case for fear that it might proceed with that trial and the father might be declared the proper party to maintain the action."
1978.78-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,525.585,528.793,Is there a possibility of double recovery if you prevail here?
1978.78-3,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,528.793,530.79,Your Honor that is an argument that the appellee has made.
1978.78-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,563.393,569.747,Well do you think this Court goes around awarding rights to various -- in the relatives to recover under state statute?
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,569.747,570.161,"No, Your Honor."
1978.78-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,587.385,591.283,How about the options to the various participants in this case?
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,593.024,599.486,"Your Honor, I think that in this case, the father would be the appropriate party if he prevailed in this action."
1978.78-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,604.739,617.633,"Mr. Greer, under Georgia law, the unwed father could legitimate the child by filing a petition in the Superior Court in the county in which the child was born I think, is that correct?"
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,617.633,624.29,"Your Honor that is correct and that is an issue I think the paramount and pollex in this case and with the Court's permission, I would address it now."
1978.78-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,674.985,679.624,"Of course in Trimble, the father had to marry the mother."
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,679.624,680.321,Excuse me?
1978.78-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,680.321,686.331,"I say in Trimble, Illinois law required marriage as a mode of legitimating."
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,691.942,705.414,"Yes sir I do think -- I think the danger of resting a decision of this importance on that issue is -- but I think it would be ironic if you have the relationship, the degree of a relationship that you have between a father and a child in this case."
1978.78-3,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,723.46,730.41,"But he would've been under a legal duty in Georgia, wouldn't he, to support a minor child if he were, if it were clear that he was the father?"
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,730.41,732.768,He is under a legal duty anyway.
1978.78-3,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,733.587,735.318,Not until he's identified?
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,735.318,735.7,Yes sir.
1978.78-3,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,739.138,740.016,"On the father, right."
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,740.016,741.228,Yes sir.
1978.78-3,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,763.199,769.652,Would you be making the same argument if the father had not taken any part in supporting the child?
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,769.652,774.313,"I would never file a petition, no sir, the appeal if he had not had a relationship with the child."
1978.78-3,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,784.064,784.797,So do you mean --
1978.78-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,784.797,794.901,"Suppose you had a mother who had never got anything for the child from the day of birth so she would have a right under the Georgia statute to bring this action, wouldn't she?"
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,794.901,805.764,She certainly does and I think that maybe another problem with the statute that there's not one which the issue in this case address but I think it certainly -- I think it's certainly is a potential problem.
1978.78-3,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,805.764,824.445,"You mean in each case, the Court just got to inquire into the degree how much was contributed to what the personal relationship was between the father and the child in order to make the evaluation on -- that you're pressing under the Equal Protection Clause?"
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,824.445,829.525,"No, and I think that -- I think in the first instance, I wouldn't take it to a complete extreme."
1978.78-3,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,851.537,853.936,"To meet what, to meet equal protection?"
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,853.936,855.668,"Yes sir, to satisfy the Equal Protection Clause."
1978.78-3,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,855.668,862.819,"What do you say is the consequence of the certificate or the paper, whatever it was that you found after the child's birth?"
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,862.819,871.132,"Your Honor, I think that in the present it obviates an argument made by the appellee and that that the state has an interest in avoiding problems with proof of paternity."
1978.78-3,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,892.416,899.392,Would it have been any more difficult to acknowledge that paternity and legitimatize the child at that time?
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,899.392,904.537,"Your Honor, I think -- the point I would make there is the point I made before and I'd like to elaborate on it."
1978.78-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,924.254,931.408,Do you think he'd be equally surprised to find he had an action for wrongful death on a part of the child before he went to a lawyer?
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,931.408,933.203,Excuse me Your Honor.
1978.78-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,933.203,941.457,Do you think he might be equally surprised to find out that he had a lawsuit for wrongful death of the child before he walked into a lawyer's office?
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,941.457,941.966,No Your Honor.
1978.78-3,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,948.877,951.724,"The surprise was to find that under Georgia law, he didn't."
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,951.724,953.455,That was his surprise.
1978.78-3,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,953.455,965.781,"Tell me Mr. Greer, do I understand the colloquy for the last few minutes is suggesting that your argument here is addressed to the statute as applied not facially?"
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,965.781,968.609,"I think it is -- well, I think it is addressed to both."
1978.78-3,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,979.543,991.605,"Well I don't understand why you answered that had there not been evidence here of this -- of the support of this child, you would not have tried to bring the case."
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,991.605,1001.52,"I don't think that I will be in a position to suggest to this Court, to the state or to more carefully tune its alternatives if I wasn't representing a client who would be within those carefully tuned alternatives --"
1978.78-3,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1001.52,1005.186,"You'd have a very hard time proving damages among other things, wouldn't you?"
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1005.186,1005.916,Absolutely.
1978.78-3,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1006.12,1006.828,(Inaudible)
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1006.828,1012.122,-- a major problem you're probably subject to directed verdict for damages in the trial court.
1978.78-3,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1012.122,1013.506,How old was this child at the time of his (Voice Overlap) --
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1013.506,1014.37,Seven years old at the time --
1978.78-3,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1014.37,1014.421,Seven?
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1014.421,1015.37,-- of his death.
1978.78-3,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1015.62,1016.712,At the time of his death.
1978.78-3,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1016.712,1027.503,"Well, I just want to understand as you submit it has two questions to ask, it is that the statute is facially unconstitutional in the Equal Protection Clause, is it?"
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1027.503,1032.672,It is facially unconstitutional and it's unconstitutional as applied to the appellant Parham.
1978.78-3,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1036.624,1038.617,You mean you're making those all these alternative arguments.
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1038.617,1039.305,Yes sir.
1978.78-3,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1039.305,1042.267,"Is gender-based discrimination, I gather."
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1042.267,1046.234,Gender-based discrimination I think is -- requires a little bit of separate attention.
1978.78-3,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1088.729,1090.753,We'll resume there at one o'clock counsel.
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1090.753,1105.623,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1978.78-3,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1105.623,1108.533,"Counsel, you may resume."
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1108.533,1111.547,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1179.606,1188.279,"Mr. Greer, before lunch you said a state -- you felt there is emergence -- propositions require a state to strike kind of a middle ground."
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1202.741,1210.771,Your Honor I think you more nearly approach the situation of Trimble versus Gordon there where you had an existing family unit.
1978.78-3,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1233.542,1241.947,A strong interest but it hadn't been strong enough to lead him to change the child's status to one of legitimacy.
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1241.947,1249.001,"Your Honor, as I said before, I think that that argument is dangerous because it assumed a level of awareness about the necessity of that step."
1978.78-3,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1249.001,1254.909,"You didn't have any trouble going to a lawyer and getting some legal advice after the child's death, do you?"
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1254.909,1263.346,Once the child was deceased I think it would normally in an action where there is apparently clear negligence or where a person feels another person's responsible.
1978.78-3,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1274.782,1276.077,How do we know that?
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1276.077,1276.247,Excuse me.
1978.78-3,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1276.247,1281.141,How do we know that he had done everything that he knew about?
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1281.141,1292.084,"Your Honor, the record establishes that he had executed the birth certificate, that he had given the child his name, that he had supported the child, most of the acts normally associated with the father-son relationship."
1978.78-3,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1295.55,1308.915,Well isn't it an equally possible hypothesis that he is willing to go that far but he didn't want to take the steps to make the child legitimate because it might increase his liabilities and responsibilities.
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1308.915,1317.568,"Your Honor, I do not think that as a logical hypothesis in the present case, for the simple reason, -- I mean the appellee has made the point that maybe he'd rather do support because there were criminal sanctions if he didn't."
1978.78-3,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1333.761,1336.112,The child's mother is dead.
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1336.112,1336.645,Deceased.
1978.78-3,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1337.775,1338.938,Killed in the same accident.
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1347.595,1349.099,Yes Your Honor.
1978.78-3,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1349.099,1351.617,"That would -- been the only way to make the child illegitimate, wouldn't it?"
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1351.617,1354.851,He could've filed a petition for legitimation.
1978.78-3,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1357.925,1358.872,To legitimate the child?
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1358.872,1359.414,Yes sir.
1978.78-3,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1359.414,1360.504,How to -- what?
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1360.504,1367.822,"There is a procedure, statutory procedure in Georgia by which the father may file a petition to legitimate the child if he chooses."
1978.78-3,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1367.822,1370.069,Not just to acknowledge paternity but to legitimate the child.
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1370.069,1370.954,But to legitimate the child.
1978.78-3,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1370.954,1376.859,And the child from bastard he is -- correct word to -- to a legitimate child.
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1376.859,1378.077,"I -- yes, Your Honor."
1978.78-3,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1390.263,1393.714,"Incidentally, the child lived with the mother?"
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1393.714,1397.942,"Your Honor, that -- the record does not reflect that one way or the other."
1978.78-3,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1397.942,1399.828,But the father did support the child.
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1399.828,1400.484,Absolutely.
1978.78-3,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1400.484,1402.246,And you said charged accounts.
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1403.064,1405.793,"Maintained charged accounts, the grocery store says."
1978.78-3,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1405.793,1406.967,In the child's name?
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1406.967,1413.158,That was -- the record does not indicate whether they were in the child's name and that he maintained charged accounts utilized the additional support of the child.
1978.78-3,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1413.158,1414.249,I see.
1978.78-3,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1414.249,1416.746,"But they did not live together, did they?"
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1416.746,1418.485,"No sir, they did not."
1978.78-3,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1418.485,1420.211,Did the record state why?
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1420.211,1423.281,"No Your Honor, it does not."
1978.78-3,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1423.281,1426.247,Or whether she was married to somebody else?
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1426.247,1426.989,"No sir, Your Honor."
1978.78-3,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1428.563,1435.558,"But I suppose under Georgia law, had she been married to somebody else when the child was born, it would've been her husband's child, by presumption at least."
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1435.558,1436.846,Yes sir.
1978.78-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1436.846,1456.346,"Mr. Greer, before -- following up on one of Mr. Justice Rehnquist's questions about the relationship, supposing that the legislature had made a study of the problem that this case illustrates and found that in about 94 and 95% of the cases, the fathers were unknown and unidentified and about 5% of the cases, the fathers did legitimate the child."
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1465.537,1476.817,"Your Honor that is the final point that I'd hope to address before I sit down and that gets in the second area that this Court, the term that this Court has talked off, that is the area of engaging an overbroad generalizations with regard to proclivities and tendencies of the sex."
1978.78-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1476.817,1482.301,"Well supposing it's overbroad to the extent that 2% of the cases that are subject to the statute, is it unconstitutional or not?"
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1482.301,1487.665,"I think if there were -- if there were statistical indications to that regard, I think it may still be unconstitutional."
1978.78-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1488.732,1495.353,Wasn't -- this is the only case that this situation happens and is it still unconstitutional?So (Voice Overlap) --
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1495.353,1499.592,"As applied to this appellant, I think it is Your Honor."
1978.78-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1503.006,1504.845,How do we know whether that's not the fact?
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1504.845,1505.35,Well the point (Voice Overlap) --
1978.78-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1505.35,1514.894,Its certainly is rather unusual for the mother and the child to be killed in the same accident than -- and then have the father both be the father of an illegitimate and one who has a meaningful relationship with the child.
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1514.894,1528.707,"I think in reality Your Honor that the statistics if they were available would be shocking.I think they would reveal that some illegitimate children are raised by their mothers, some are raised by collateral relatives, some would be raised by grandparents, some would be raised by neighbors and friends."
1978.78-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1528.707,1530.161,"But we really don't know, do we?"
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1530.161,1530.322,No sir.
1978.78-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1530.322,1530.474,Supposing
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1530.474,1530.802,Not --
1978.78-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1530.802,1534.76,-- the legislature thought they were at -- the case was with the one I described for you.
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1534.76,1535.191,Excuse me.
1978.78-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1535.191,1541.451,"Supposing the legislature assumed perhaps incorrectly that if a study were made it would -- which show the figures I've described, --"
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1541.451,1541.622,"No, I think that --"
1978.78-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1541.622,1543.041,-- would the statute be unconstitutional?
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1543.041,1550.306,"In the first instance, I think there's nothing to indicate that the legislature or the Supreme Court had at its disposal any statistics even approaching that regard."
1978.78-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1565.03,1575.531,But there's one difference and that is you in effect conceded that in the cases where the father was unidentified and had no relationship there would no -- be no -- nothing unconstitutional about denying recovery.
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1575.531,1594.708,I conceded that a statute which provided for an effort in that area would more nearly comport with reality and the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses because it would more nearly comport with reality because in those cases where he could not prove his paternity or could not prove a contact with the child then the state could justifiably exclude him from participation.
1978.78-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1594.708,1619.766,"You know that's not -- don't you have to only answer that in a sex discrimination case were the basis of review, I take it you urge in somewhat above the near rationality standard, that administrative convenience just isn't at least if -- at least if it's not much very burdensome to individualize that the state shouldn't be permitted to individualize."
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1619.766,1621.709,That has been the position of this Court.
1978.78-3,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1627.136,1631.075,What if the mother had been killed in the accident -- had not been killed in the accident?
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1639.8,1647.811,I think the Court may be the one that would be confronted with that question in an area of legitimate children where Georgia prefers mothers over fathers in the area of legitimate children.
1978.78-3,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1651.87,1657.08,And you would claim here if she survived and brought the action that he could intervene and share.
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1657.08,1666.739,If he could prove -- I think a statute like Maryland's or Washington's is desirable where they require him to prove more than the fact that he's the father that he needs to establish his paternity and a --
1978.78-3,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1666.739,1668.29,"Well, I'm talking about some other statute."
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1676.802,1680.391,"All of the facts of the present case, I think that would be the constitutional answer."
1978.78-3,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1680.391,1686.631,"Well then -- but if the mother and father were married and the child were illegitimate, they would not share under Georgia law, would they?"
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1686.631,1689.071,"Under Georgia law, as it presently exists --"
1978.78-3,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1689.071,1689.969,"The mother gets it all, (Voice Overlap)."
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1689.969,1692.317,But I think it should be that way in both cases.
1978.78-3,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1696.542,1697.777,"Either way, it could be the same."
1978.78-3,0,42757,thomas_e_greer,,1697.777,1700.467,Yes sir.
1978.78-3,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1741.473,1745.309,Very well.
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,1746.209,1749.648,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-3,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1781.279,1783.049,That's not a -- not in a joint suit.
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,1783.049,1784.337,No sir.
1978.78-3,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1784.337,1791.529,"I'm not sure I understand your (Inaudible) that it makes no difference, are you conceding the liability to someone?"
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,1791.529,1794.17,"May it please the Court, I think that that would be the net effect."
1978.78-3,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1805.517,1815.237,So there would be settlement then as I understand you either with the administratrix or with the father if he should prevail here.
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,1817.662,1819.393,"Yes sir, that's my approach here."
1978.78-3,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1845.769,1854.757,"Well suppose that we affirm, is Georgia law clear that the state has a cause of action?"
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,1854.757,1855.41,Yes sir.
1978.78-3,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1859.133,1860.956,So that there's no windfall to your client.
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,1860.956,1863.114,There is no windfall whatsoever.
1978.78-3,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1877.537,1881.107,What would the -- what could the recovery be for in a estate?
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,1881.107,1891.06,The recover for the estate would be the full value of the life of the decedent without deduction for necessities as set forth by demands of an enlightened and impartial jury.
1978.78-3,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1891.06,1894.346,Do you think that's the same measure as might be available to a mother?
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,1894.346,1899.393,It is the same the measure in writing.
1978.78-3,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1899.393,1913.82,"Even though the mother -- suppose both parents were dead and but there's a cause of action available to the estate of the child or the estate of the mother, is that it?"
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,1915.535,1921.592,I'm referring Mr. Justice White to the estate of the child in this instance.
1978.78-3,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1938.861,1947.928,So it isn't -- so the major damage when the mother is suing is not the pecuniary value that the continued life of the child might mean to her.
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,1947.928,1949.025,No sir.
1978.78-3,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1949.025,1970.432,"But you do -- you would have a tougher time with a jury, would you not if neither parent were alive simply having a court appointed administratrix testify than if you had alive mother or father when you're testifying under the issue of loss the value of companionship."
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,1970.432,1985.054,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I certainly can't deny that that is a problem which would present itself but likewise I cannot deny that when a child is dependent upon a parent that increases perhaps the value of that child's life."
1978.78-3,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2003.2,2008.655,Well lots of children have a more meaningful relationship with their parents when they're seven than they do when they're 15.
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2008.655,2016.286,Yes sir.
1978.78-3,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2058.831,2065.188,"Mr. Miller, I take it under Georgia law, the father is not an heir of the deceased child."
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2065.188,2073.157,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, I think that that is a correct statement and I think that it is also correct that the mother of an illegitimate child does not inherit."
1978.78-3,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2118.292,2119.966,Then there would be a windfall?
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2119.966,2122.854,Yes it would be a windfall then.
1978.78-3,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.854,2125.902,I feel the legislature got busy.
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2125.902,2128.706,"Well they don't have much time, it'd be awhile."
1978.78-3,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2212.799,2228.114,Is there any particular reason -- I notice your co-counsel is from -- your opponent is from Carleton which I gather is in Western Georgia and that this suit was filed in the Richmond County Court which I gather is Augusta.
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2231.613,2233.228,"Yes sir, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1978.78-3,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2367.134,2370.699,"Well Mr. Miller, do you represent the maternal grandmother in this case?"
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2370.699,2372.946,"No sir, I represent the defendant."
1978.78-3,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2375.543,2378.646,She is the other plaintiff whose action you said was proceeding?
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2378.646,2379.396,Yes sir.
1978.78-3,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2379.396,2384.889,And you represent the defendant who is being sued for negligence as a result of the wrong -- claim of wrongful death.
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2384.889,2390.403,That's correct.
1978.78-3,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2440.209,2446.996,"Mr. Miller, are you -- some kind of tell me why that's a value to the state?"
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2446.996,2467.335,"A value to the state in my opinion Mr. Justice Marshall, it is a value to the state in that we are able to dispose of litigation without having to look for parents and I realize while it might appear that this Court has rejected that before I think that it is now a valid argument."
1978.78-3,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2467.335,2478.923,Well that would be a valid interest if this were a question of whether or not an illegitimate father could inherit or something like that but you don't have to look for parents.
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2484.852,2485.355,Yes sir.
1978.78-3,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2485.445,2488.062,If he hadn't you would have no duty whatsoever.
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2488.062,2495.481,That's correct but it's not unusual in our state to have more than one person and sometimes several making claims to one source.
1978.78-3,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2505.68,2505.951,That he is --
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2505.951,2507.219,-- that he is the father.
1978.78-3,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2507.219,2507.765,I see.
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2507.765,2510.158,And that means that I've got to defend everyone of them.
1978.78-3,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2521.805,2528.54,Well then this case the father gave his own name to the boy.
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2528.54,2530.708,"That's the way the record appear, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1978.78-3,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2530.708,2532.474,"Well, that's the way the record is."
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2532.474,2534.363,Yes sir.
1978.78-3,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2534.588,2537.48,"So the state didn't have any trouble then, did they?"
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2537.48,2539.929,The state would not have had I do not think any trouble to --
1978.78-3,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2539.929,2541.507,"And you wouldn't need them, would you?"
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2541.507,2542.87,I don't think I would have any trouble locating this man.
1978.78-3,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2542.87,2546.912,So why did the necessity going to this petition business?
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2546.912,2561.611,Because Mr. Justice Marshall I think that what you do if you rule a statute unconstitutional that you would have to extend some law to say that this was a formal acknowledgment and a formal acknowledgment is all that's necessary.
1978.78-3,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2569.586,2572.038,I thought the father here kept the birth certificate.
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2572.038,2572.636,No sir.
1978.78-3,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2575.8,2577.364,But I thought the --
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2577.364,2577.482,-- as a matter of law.
1978.78-3,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2577.482,2583.716,"-- affidavit, it said that the father was the one who went to obtain the birth certificate."
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2585.888,2604.25,I cannot answer that yes or no but I -- the state is by law has placed a burden of obtaining birth certificates not on the past but rather on the hospital or physicians that deliver the child.
1978.78-3,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2612.703,2619.484,"You have a little difference in incentives here as compared to the inheritance cases, don't you?"
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2641.111,2643.637,That's correct sir.
1978.78-3,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2652.847,2657.628,Just like there may be more than one unknown error at the wellhead where oil is found.
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2657.628,2664.14,"Yes sir and as each well is struck, the heirs generally come forward."
1978.78-3,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2664.14,2673.945,"(Inaudible) on page 4 of the appendix, because the natural father, he'd execute the --"
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2673.945,2674.069,Yes sir.
1978.78-3,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2674.069,2675.135,-- birth certificate.
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2675.135,2675.36,Yes sir.
1978.78-3,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2678.438,2679.922,You said the father did.
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2679.922,2680.825,Yes sir.
1978.78-3,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2680.825,2686.355,But what else did the state need more than that?
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2686.355,2688.58,What else did the state need more than that?
1978.78-3,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2688.58,2689.615,Yes sir.
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2689.615,2705.618,The statute says that he has a right to legitimate the child and I don't think that the State of Georgia has to acquiesce and say that that is sufficient acknowledgment of a child to make the child no longer illegitimate.
1978.78-3,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2705.618,2707.946,"Well, he admits it's his child."
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2707.946,2711.119,Yes sir.
1978.78-3,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2711.119,2714.506,"But under Georgia law, that does not make the child illegitimate, is that what --"
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2714.506,2716.017,"No sir, it does not make the child legitimate."

1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2717.987,2719.286,Or marry the mother.
1978.78-3,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2719.991,2724.293,Why do you think you went to the trouble of executing that?
1978.78-3,1,16525,a_montague_miller,,2727.03,2727.38,No sir.
1978.78-3,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2734.473,2740.995,"Mr. Miller, did -- but Mr. Greer tell us that the Georgia law requires unwed fathers to support their children --"

1978.78-3,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2843.704,2844.373,Thank you Mr. Miller.

1978.78-3,2,42757,thomas_e_greer,,2851.934,2860.828,Counsel for appellee makes the point that these facts may be subject to speculation with regards with relationship between the father and child because they were only documented in affidavit.
1978.78-3,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2915.709,2927.591,"Would it make any difference to your case if the father had never seen the child after the child's birth, hadn't filed -- hadn't done anything about the birth certificate on your equal protection argument?"
1978.78-3,2,42757,thomas_e_greer,,2927.591,2930.843,On the equal protection argument?

1978.78-3,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2983.905,2985.002,(Inaudible)
1978.78-3,2,42757,thomas_e_greer,,2985.002,2990.548,There was the implication made by counsel for appellee that this father has only come forward when there's monetary advantage involved.
