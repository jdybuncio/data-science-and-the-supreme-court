2019.18-1086,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.095,9.795,"We'll hear first this morning in Case 18-1086, Lucky Brand Dungarees versus Marcel Fashions Group. Ms. Cendali."
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,9.795,60.505,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court should reverse the Second Circuit because it erred in holding that a defense never previously litigated to judgment can be barred in a case involving new claims. This Court rejected that idea over a hundred years ago in Cromwell and Davis, and as this Court unanimously made clear more recently in Taylor v. Sturgell, the preclusive effect of a judgment is determined by two doctrine: Issue preclusion, which forecloses relitigation of issues actually litigated and resolved, and claim preclusion, which forecloses successive litigation of the very same claim. Applying these long-established principles, the proper rule is a defendant is free to argue any previously unresolved defense it may have to new claims."
2019.18-1086,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,135.805,154.765,"Before we get to that, Ms. Cendali, could you explain why you abandoned the release defense in the first action? You did raise it, and then you dropped it."
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,159.46,167.395,"We don't know exactly why it was abandoned, but it -- the most logical answer is that it would not have been dispositive."
2019.18-1086,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,194.18,207.43500005,"How would it have -- it seems strange when that release said, Lucky, you can't use ""Get Lucky,"" but you're continuing to use it."
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,232.81,235.04,"That's exactly our point, Your Honor."
2019.18-1086,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,267.19,295.61,"I take it from your introductory remarks that you do not agree with the Restatement rule that, although the failure to raise a defense in a prior action generally does not preclude the raising of the defense in a subsequent action, there is an exception where prevailing on the defense in the second action would nullify the initial judgment or impair rights established in the initial action."
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,297.39,298.52,"No, Your Honor."
2019.18-1086,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,309.465,320.03,"Well, I understood you to say that there would be an exception if it was an attack on the judgment, a collateral action attacking the judgment, or if it was the basis of a claim. But this goes further."
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,329.265,340.9,"We agree with the restatement, but, again, it supports us in this case because, to be clear, Marcel is getting and keeping all of the relief it got in the first action."
2019.18-1086,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,362.76,368.48,But suppose the subsequent conduct were identical in all ways to the prior conduct.
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,390.42,391.205,No.
2019.18-1086,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,444.23,454.18,"So if -- if I understand what you're saying, in the case of identical subsequent conduct, if it violates the injunction, then you're out of luck?"
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,454.18,455.25,Correct.
2019.18-1086,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,455.25,465.47,"But if it does not -- if there's no injunction or it does not violate the injunction for some way -- in some way, then you can do whatever you want; is that correct?"
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,465.47,470.32,"Well, you can do whatever you want subject to the fact you might get -- get sued again."
2019.18-1086,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,471.72,472.3,"No, I'm sorry."
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,473.035,474.775,But you wouldn't be precluded.
2019.18-1086,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,474.775,475.31,Yes.
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,475.31,477.15,That -- that -- that is -- that is right.
2019.18-1086,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,488.68,488.95,But that's --
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,488.95,489.26,-- as -- as you all --
2019.18-1086,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,489.26,491.15,-- inconsistent with the restatement rule.
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,494.68,527.13,"Your Honor, perhaps I am not fully understanding it, but -- but my understanding of the restatement rule is based on the idea of -- of attacking the previous action or upsetting the judgment. I think the proper Restatement rule to be helpful here is the Restatement of Judgment Section 18, which makes clear, in a section titled Merger, that defenses that attempt to upset the judgment rendered are barred."
2019.18-1086,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,527.13,527.62,"Well, that's --"
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,527.62,527.94,That's not --
2019.18-1086,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,527.94,532.2,That's one -- that's one section of the restatement that deals with this problem.
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,537.195,537.74,"Well, the --"
2019.18-1086,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,537.74,548.49,"I -- I have a question about interpreting the judgment in the 2005 action, which I think we have to do in order to come to grips with this case."
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,612.415,664.07,"The -- that was discussed in a well-reasoned opinion, obviously not binding on this court, by Judge Leval in Marcel I where he said that because the declaration was phrased in the conjunctive, you couldn't -- it would be sheer speculation to say that that meant that the jury found that it was just use of ""Get Lucky"" by it's -- use of -- of the word ""Lucky,"" the name on our stores for 30 years, was -- was infringing by itself. And we know that from how they tried the case, which is why the -- the district court and everyone understood it is they admit, Respondents admit at pages 9 and 10 of their brief, the focus of the case was not just on the use of ""Get Lucky"" but on the use of ""Get Lucky"" causing confusion with -- because of the commingling of words with ""Lucky"" with ""Get Lucky."""
2019.18-1086,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,664.07,664.72,"Well, I understand."
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,664.72,664.94,That was --
2019.18-1086,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,664.94,665.22,That was --
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,665.22,666.12,-- the argument to the jury.
2019.18-1086,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,666.12,677.245,"That's a -- that's a plausible, maybe the best interpretation of the -- the meaning of the box that the jury checked on the verdict sheet."
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,696.975,697.73,Well --
2019.18-1086,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,697.73,698.78,That's what was held.
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,698.78,726.5,"It -- it held that, yes, that the -- that the contempt ruling by the district court in denying contempt to preside it over the case and is in the best position to know what she was intending to enjoin, and knew that the closing argument to the jury was -- I think it was at 852 of the trial transcript, was -- was what's causing confusion is the use of ""Get Lucky"" with these other marks."
2019.18-1086,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,726.5,766.7,"Can you explain how Lucky -- I take it was represented by other counsel -- allowed that strange question that asked: ""Get Lucky,"" ""Lucky Brand,"" any other use of the word ""Lucky,"" strung them all together and the jury, in order to find that ""Get Lucky"" had been used and infringed, would have to answer yes. How did you -- the judge, I assume, informed the attorney of the questions that would be asked on the special verdict sheet, right?"
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,766.7,776.285,I -- I think that they all understood it because it was consistent by grouping them all together like that with the theory that the case was argued.
2019.18-1086,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,918.035,922.485,"Counsel, you raise a point about the lack of symmetry here that would be created."
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,948.27,960.55,"I think, Your Honor, if I'm understanding your correction correctly, what you're really, as I hear it, talking about the ordinary application of claim preclusion, which means that --"
2019.18-1086,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,960.55,976.05,"Well, no, it's a new claim, you would say, right, because it involves new -- new facts, right, and new infringements but, yeah, there was a cause of action they could have brought, right, you know, a breach of contract claim rather than just a trademark claim, but maybe they shouldn't be allowed to bring that in time 2."
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,976.05,979.595,"Well, that would be a -- a -- another let's-litigate-everything rule so that --"
2019.18-1086,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,979.595,988.715,It would -- it would be quite an extension of claim -- claim preclusion in another direction but it would at least solve the asymmetry problem.
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,988.715,990.695,"Right, but to no good end."
2019.18-1086,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,990.695,991.22,Okay.
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,991.22,1057.34,"I mean, this -- this was a -- I mean, it really seemed like the court in Marcel II was -- was annoyed that prior counsel didn't raise this defense and I can appreciate that. But that doesn't mean that this Court needs to reconfigure the entire law of claim and issue preclusion in this case in this country. But -- and there's no reason to do it, because as the reasons thought in Cromwell in this Court in a very thoughtful opinion by Justice Field in 1877, you know, the Court took the time to -- to survey exhaustively all prior law of -- of -- of what we now call issue and claim preclusion. And while he talked about demand instead of claim, he -- he -- he juxtaposed in his opinion for the Court the two types of preclusion that we deal with today: The idea that once you have litigated a case, you can't -- you're foreclosed from raising defenses to undermine that case's resolution, but if it's something that you haven't litigated, that would not foreclose you in a subsequent case involving new claims."
2019.18-1086,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1057.34,1057.49,Ms. --
2019.18-1086,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1057.49,1058.51,Just --
2019.18-1086,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1058.51,1077.33,"Could I go back and figure out what's going on between the parties? In your reply brief, you say, even disregarding the facts that these are -- that we're dealing with a different time period, we're actually dealing with a different set of -- of -- of claims."
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,1077.33,1077.64,Correct.
2019.18-1086,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1077.64,1087.725,"Because you have stopped using the Get Lucky brand, so that the claims that the Respondent now has against you have nothing to do with ""Get Lucky."" Is that what --"
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,1087.725,1089.52,"That's correct, Justice Kagan."
2019.18-1086,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1089.52,1105.295,"So -- I mean, that would be a kind of narrow and easy way to solve this case if it were true, and if it were not waived in any way, but why did you only bring that to our attention in your -- in -- why did you only make that a central feature of your argument in the reply brief?"
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,1105.295,1135.87,"Because that was sort of to our surprise the -- the focus of their -- I mean, the key thing is that our friends did not defend or cite any cases saying a previous court has ever accepted the thinking of Marcel II whereby a never-litigated defense can be precluded in an action involving new claims. Rather, they focused its brief on saying, well, these are actually old -- old claims."
2019.18-1086,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1258.12,1258.42,Could they --
2019.18-1086,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1258.42,1259.37,Can you tell -- I'm sorry.
2019.18-1086,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1259.37,1259.895,Go ahead.
2019.18-1086,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1260.39,1270.22,"Can you tell me what the theory is, what you think the 2005 settlement -- or 2003 settlement agreement means?"
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,1270.22,1271.12,Sure.
2019.18-1086,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1271.12,1286.725,"Can you sort of -- I can't tell whether you think it means that Marcel has no claims against Lucky Brand for using ""Lucky Brand,"" but you have claims against them for their using ""Get Lucky""?"
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,1286.725,1287.58,No.
2019.18-1086,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1287.58,1288.1,All right.
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,1288.4,1290.18,It -- it doesn't mean that.
2019.18-1086,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1379.52,1387.185,"And so you can use ""Lucky Brand"" and any other trademark you had registered as of that date, to your heart's content?"
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,1387.185,1392.73,"Exactly, Your Honor. And it's that benefit of the bargain that we're being deprived of."
2019.18-1086,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1434.23,1438.66,"Yes, thank you. The other side likens this case to a judgment enforcement action."
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,1447.625,1455.52,What makes something a judgment enforcement action is when they're trying to get the relief they had been previously been awarded.
2019.18-1086,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1479.39,1483.68,You said before a judgment enforcement action and a collateral attack on a judgment.
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,1485.31,1490.305,"They're really -- technically, they're different, but they go to the same thing."
2019.18-1086,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1515.6,1515.755,Sure.
2019.18-1086,0,20721,dale_m_cendali,,1515.755,1523.87,And the -- and the defendant is -- is -- cannot be -- attack a judgment once obtained.
2019.18-1086,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1523.87,1532.265,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kimberly."
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1532.265,1567.29,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Imagine a dispute between two parties is resolved with a final judgment on the merits. Our position is that in any subsequent lawsuit between the same parties, just as the plaintiff is precluded from raising any claims springing from the same cause of action if those claims were available to it in the prior suit, so too the defendant is precluded from raising any defenses to that cause of action if those defenses were available to it in the prior suit. This rule is fair and symmetrical."
2019.18-1086,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1658.11,1658.42,Mr. --
2019.18-1086,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1658.42,1685.24,"Before we -- go ahead. Before we do that, it seems to me that -- that perhaps the most serious difficulty with your case that cries out for an answer before getting to the judgment is that it does require counsel to put forth in the first case every conceivable defense that he or she might have. And I can't imagine a rule that would be -- would make sense."
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1704.22,1711.89,"Your Honor, that would be true only with respect to subsequent suits involving the same nucleus of operative fact, the same claims."
2019.18-1086,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1717.01,1731.995,I don't follow -- I don't follow your argument about same claim because I thought everybody agrees that the claim that Marcel is bringing in the second action is not the same claim.
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1786.65,1793.46,"Your -- Your Honor, it is clear that there's no claim preclusion in this case but it is not because they are different causes of action."
2019.18-1086,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1799.495,1802.27,The course of action means a claim for relief.
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1813.08,1817.53,"So call -- call it a claim, call it a cause of action, call it a common nucleus of operative facts."
2019.18-1086,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1847.45,1848.15,"Well, how -- how do they --"
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1848.15,1848.58,-- in the prior claim.
2019.18-1086,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1848.58,1853.355,"-- not arise from a different nucleus of operative fact? I mean, there are two problems."
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1889.245,1889.62,Right.
2019.18-1086,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1889.62,1908.735,"It's continuing to use its Lucky Brand and the -- and the -- the reference you made to your complaint says it's continuing to use its Lucky Brand in the same way, but it's not using ""Get Lucky."" And that was a core part of the operative facts that gave rise to the first claim, isn't it?"
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1908.735,1912.325,"So, yes, as to one bucket of the claims."
2019.18-1086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1954.4,1954.5,Well --
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1954.5,1955.23,-- of time that was --
2019.18-1086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1955.23,1960.105,"-- except for the fact, counsel, that if it were identical, you would just go enforce the judgment."
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,1986.575,1986.99,Right.
2019.18-1086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1986.99,1994.89,"Which I think of as a legal theory, that's how I think of it, at least, as opposed to a claim which involves the facts, a defense that was available in the first lawsuit."
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2020.485,2020.91,Right.
2019.18-1086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2020.91,2022.11,-- cause of action later in time 2.
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2022.11,2025.01,I want to be sure to come back to Justice Kagan -- Kagan's question.
2019.18-1086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2025.01,2026.85,I think we're asking the same sort of thing from --
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2026.85,2035.005,"Well, let -- let me answer just first as to this -- this question about, well, maybe you wouldn't want to litigate all your defenses in a case involving a small amount in controversy."
2019.18-1086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2036.13,2037.74,"So -- and the same thing's true for a plaintiff, though."
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2049.05,2050.01,"Well, that's exactly right."
2019.18-1086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2052.06,2053.0,Wouldn't want that to be barred.
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2055.315,2059.65,If -- if a plaintiff were barred from raising claims arising from a common nucleus of --
2019.18-1086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2059.65,2065.005,"Bringing a new cause of action, a new legal theory in time 2 for similar but different later --"
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2065.005,2066.89,"No, of course, Your Honor, but, of course --"

2019.18-1086,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2203.685,2206.97,"Is that right? What? I mean, I thought Justice Ginsburg said exactly that."
2019.18-1086,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2214.04,2215.32,But -- but there we are.
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2282.55,2282.93,Yes.

2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2292.84,2301.8,"-- except that it could have been more clear, I think that the first case and second case have to involve the same -- a common nucleus of operative fact such that the claims raised in the second --"

2019.18-1086,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2326.66,2326.91,-- that's true.
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2326.91,2328.18,-- defenses is very well settled.
2019.18-1086,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2328.18,2337.93,"That's not my point. My point is I just read you what you what they said, and that was in a case where there wasn't claim preclusion."
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2341.82,2342.56,But --

2019.18-1086,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2354.82,2356.54,Am I right or not?

2019.18-1086,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2364.09,2364.49,So I am right.

2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2370.08,2370.41,But -- but --
2019.18-1086,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2370.41,2370.83,-- we're talking about.

2019.18-1086,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2394.66,2394.98,But isn't -- -

So that if you have a series of lawsuits about exactly the same thing, let's say failure to pay under an installment contract or failure to pay rent and it comes up month after month, the failure to raise the defense in one of those prior actions can bar the raising of a defense in the later actions."
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2426.91,2427.68,That is precisely right.
2019.18-1086,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2427.68,2433.91,-- the fact that it's a different period of time is not necessarily dispositive if -- unless we reject that body of law.

2019.18-1086,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2452.21,2452.91,All I would want --
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2452.91,2453.31,-- on that judgment.
2019.18-1086,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2453.31,2457.72,-- is a couple of cases that I should read -- I don't read every case in the brief.
2019.18-1086,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2460.47,2465.22,But the -- the -- the -- what cases should I read to say that --
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2465.22,2465.25,I --
2019.18-1086,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2465.25,2467.03,Where you bring an identical --
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2467.03,2467.575,Right.
2019.18-1086,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2494.62,2498.43,But that was because it was all from the same issue.
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2498.43,2499.07,That --
2019.18-1086,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2499.07,2508.875,"Meaning that a -- but we have a contrary case that says when it was two different issues, then you don't have it."
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2508.875,2512.01,"Not issues, Your Honor. I think causes of action."
2019.18-1086,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2513.09,2513.39,"No, no, no."
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2523.94,2525.64,"That was Davis as well, Your Honor."
2019.18-1086,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2526.73,2530.36,"Davis -- but it was different bonds, not from the same issue."
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2530.36,2533.245,"It was the same bonds from the same issue, Your Honor."
2019.18-1086,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2533.245,2535.455,"But, we got two different outcomes, then."
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2535.455,2542.99,"And -- and for reasons unclear to me, the Court said in Davis when you're suing on two different negotiable instruments, you're suing on two different causes of action."
2019.18-1086,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2547.71,2547.9,All right.
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2547.9,2548.8,-- negotiable instruments --
2019.18-1086,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2548.8,2550.965,So let me take it to this case.
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2583.81,2583.95,Um-hum.
2019.18-1086,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2583.95,2598.91,"-- because I read your complaint and it's always in the conjunctive, both of them together, but now it's, in my mind, a different cause of action because you're saying it's the use of ""Lucky Brands"" without --"
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2598.91,2599.345,Right.

2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2599.89,2610.435,"So this -- this is the completion of my answer to Justice Kagan's original question, and it's this: To understand what was at issue in the first case, I think you're right, Your Honor, you have to look at the complaints."
2019.18-1086,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2710.99,2720.265,"So why did you end up both with a preliminary injunction and a permanent final injunction that only enjoined them from using ""Get Lucky""?"
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2720.265,2720.855,We --
2019.18-1086,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2720.855,2729.34,I know you -- there is certainly loose language in the final judgment making it unclear what it was aimed at.
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2729.34,2729.905,Right.
2019.18-1086,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2729.905,2733.6,Except for the permanent injunction.
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2747.76,2748.54,Right.
2019.18-1086,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2748.54,2752.11,"-- trademarks, that it would have enjoined the use of all of them."
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2752.11,2763.95,"And -- and the answer is that the permanent -- the only permanent injunction in this case was the permanent injunction that was entered into interlocutorily, one year before the trial in this case."
2019.18-1086,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2771.94,2774.195,But I don't see the language in the final judgment.
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2779.15,2781.35,And we are not here enforcing the injunction.
2019.18-1086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2783.79,2783.88,And --
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2783.88,2783.94,-- the --
2019.18-1086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2783.94,2791.78,"-- just to be clear about that, I'm sorry to interrupt, but you -- you're not enforcing the injunction and you're not seeking to enforce the final judgment in the first suit either?"
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2791.78,2797.04,In -- only in the sense that one would seek to enforce a declaratory judgment are we doing so.
2019.18-1086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2801.8,2805.03,"This is not a judgment enforcement action, counsel, is it?"
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2805.03,2807.65,I -- I would not call it a judgment enforcement action --
2019.18-1086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2807.65,2807.76,Okay.
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2807.91,2811.8,-- in the sense that a claim is reduced to judgment and they're not paying on the judgment.
2019.18-1086,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2834.37,2837.48,"Well, how -- how does this undermine the prior judgment?"
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2837.48,2844.08,The prior -- it -- it undermines the rights and interests settled by the final -- the final judgment from the 2005 action.

2019.18-1086,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2846.86,2853.66,Was it a right for the -- right to have them not use any brand that contains -- what right was established?
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2853.66,2862.43,It was the 12 marks. It was the parties' relationship to one another with respect to the 12 Lucky Brand marks and the one Marcel Fashions' mark that were at issue in the case.
2019.18-1086,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2876.25,2877.37,Each and every one of them?
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2877.37,2878.2,"Of the 12 marks, yes."
2019.18-1086,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2878.2,2879.34,Each and every one of the 12.
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,2894.21,2898.84,"Well, rhe -- again, I -- the injunction was entered by the district court as a sanction."
2019.18-1086,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2900.43,2903.655,And why didn't you ask for an injunction? If you say --

2019.18-1086,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3055.15,3055.47,All right.

2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3063.59,3078.98,Because a -- we -- we take this judgment in this respect to take basically the form of a declaratory judgment. One doesn't get to return to a court upon obtaining a declaratory judgment attempting to convert it into a injunction.
2019.18-1086,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3078.98,3085.13,"Well, you can apply at the foot of a declaratory judgment for further relief."
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3098.125,3099.2,It can.

2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3132.645,3133.415,Right.

2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3252.55,3253.18,It did hold that they were --
2019.18-1086,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3253.18,3253.52,-- excuse me --
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3253.52,3253.84,-- were the same thing.
2019.18-1086,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3253.84,3256.505,-- goes far beyond that and applies to new claims.
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3281.3,3281.41,Right.
2019.18-1086,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3281.41,3284.69,-- to bring it before. But nobody's ever heard of that.
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3290.195,3301.22,"Your Honor, in fact, the arguments that you just described were at the heart of our arguments in the first case. And if I would, I -- I'd point the Court just to two footnotes from the court's -- the Second Circuit's decision in this case."
2019.18-1086,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3315.69,3318.22,It said related. Related isn't the same.
2019.18-1086,1,62609,michael_b_kimberly,,3318.22,3328.4,"Your Honor, that is, in fact, a statement -- the -- the statement from restatement section 24 is connected, but I think related and connected are substantively the same."
2019.18-1086,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3367.99,3372.64999995,"Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Ms. Cendali."
2019.18-1086,2,20721,dale_m_cendali,,3372.64999995,3406.91,"Thank you. Two series of points, one relating to the question presented on the rule of law, the new rule of law, and one relating to the new claim argument. One of the striking things about Marcel's argument is that there was no defense of the basic principle, as Justice Breyer was saying, that -- that you can have a new -- in the case where there is a new claim, a previously unlitigated, unresolved defense can be excluded."
2019.18-1086,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3406.91,3409.75,But he says -- he points correctly to two cases.
2019.18-1086,2,20721,dale_m_cendali,,3420.08,3420.32,Right.
2019.18-1086,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3420.69,3421.05,And what's --
2019.18-1086,2,20721,dale_m_cendali,,3421.05,3421.26,-- let's talk --
2019.18-1086,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3421.26,3422.755,What's your answer to that?
2019.18-1086,2,20721,dale_m_cendali,,3422.755,3423.85,Right.
2019.18-1086,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3503.155,3505.77,What about the -- what about the rent?
2019.18-1086,2,20721,dale_m_cendali,,3505.77,3507.74,The rent?
2019.18-1086,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3507.74,3526.245,"The -- the landlord sues the tenant for rent on a lease and wins. And then later on, the tenant doesn't pay again, so he -- okay, he, sues him again on the lease and this time the defendant wants to say the lease is invalid and the court said no, you can't, because you should have said that before."
2019.18-1086,2,20721,dale_m_cendali,,3526.245,3534.41,"Because to the extent that that case is -- is a new claim, they should be able to bring that."
2019.18-1086,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3541.58,3544.515,"So that isn't the question, because everybody agrees it's a new course of conduct."
2019.18-1086,2,20721,dale_m_cendali,,3557.77,3563.42,"Well, it -- well, none of the cases, none of the cases cited in their brief, are on -- these facts."
2019.18-1086,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3570.725,3590.225,"Counsel, let's assume that they had actually litigated, you had actually litigated whether the use of ""Lucky Brand"" trademarks, without the use of ""Get Lucky,"" was an infringement on the superior ""Get Lucky"" mark."
2019.18-1086,2,20721,dale_m_cendali,,3636.32,3637.34,Right.
2019.18-1086,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3637.34,3662.695,"And assuming that were the case, you had a full and fair opportunity to litigate your use of ""Lucky Brands"" without ""Get Lucky,"" and the jury found that your use was an infringement, how could you then defend this case?"
2019.18-1086,2,20721,dale_m_cendali,,3662.695,3664.775,May I answer?
2019.18-1086,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3664.775,3665.805,Yes.
2019.18-1086,2,20721,dale_m_cendali,,3665.805,3681.6,"Well, you would defend it because the case sought subsequent relief for subsequent infringements where you would be allowed to present new defenses to that different period of time."
2019.18-1086,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3693.33,3694.43,"Thank you, counsel."
