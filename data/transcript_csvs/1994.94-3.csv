1994.94-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.287,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-3, the Reynoldsville Casket Company v. Carol Hyde."
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,50.055,52.406,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1994.94-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,122.922,125.873,"The accident took place where, in Ashtabula County in Ohio?"
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,125.873,126.514,"It did, Your Honor."
1994.94-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,126.514,129.176,The parties were Pennsylvanians?
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,129.176,129.637,Everybody.
1994.94-3,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,215.313,219.745,"Well, how do you overcome Harper, Mr. Riedel?"
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,219.745,228.269,I overcome Harper by virtue of the constitutional issue.
1994.94-3,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,236.464,242.258,So you think there was no constitutional violation here or in Bendix?
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,245.781,248.074,"--In Bendix, the statute was unconstitutional."
1994.94-3,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,248.074,249.625,"And it is this very statute, is it not?"
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,249.625,251.175,"It is, but not in this case."
1994.94-3,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,251.175,254.106,Excuse me?
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,256.279,256.67,Yes.
1994.94-3,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,256.67,259.541,--was that the statute we're talking about--
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,259.541,260.732,--was unconstitutional.
1994.94-3,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,260.732,261.813,--was unconstitutional.
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,261.813,262.464,Exactly.
1994.94-3,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,275.881,285.608,I thought Harper had indicated that backward-looking relief is required.
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,285.608,292.872,Backward-looking relief for underlying constitutional violation.
1994.94-3,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,309.724,311.895,"Excuse me, I'm really getting confused here."
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,314.025,314.376,I do.
1994.94-3,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,314.376,314.846,Yes.
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,314.846,315.287,Yes.
1994.94-3,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,322.401,334.37,"In that connection, it's my understanding that the only thing that counts in Ohio is the syllabus, that everything else is like a law review article, is that not so?"
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,334.37,334.88,Yes.
1994.94-3,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,334.88,337.001,So that we should look at just this one sentence.
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,351.299,373.806,"That is true, Justice Ginsburg, and what the majority went on to state was that Harper, their reading of Harper, allowed State courts to tailor their own remedy as they determine the manner in which a United States Supreme Court opinion was to be retroactively applied."
1994.94-3,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,437.887,442.12,"Suppose Chevron Oil, where there's still some vitality left to it."
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,445.821,460.671,"--No, and I'd like to talk about that a little later, Justice Ginsburg, as to why, if Chevron is in fact applied, that even if it is applied, it would not achieve the result that the majority found in this case."
1994.94-3,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,612.05,620.266,"Mr. Riedel, is there any choice of remedies in this cas, or is the choice simply between a remedy and no remedy?"
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,620.266,627.211,"In this case, in my opinion, Justice Souter, there is no issue as to remedies."
1994.94-3,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,635.365,640.43,Is it clear that we have old law and new law here?
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,656.89,673.66,"--Well, in terms of courts that must follow this Court's decision, this Court's decision... this Court in 1988 said in Bendix that that statute was unconstitutional."
1994.94-3,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,673.66,678.314,Under settled legal principles.
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,678.314,690.751,"Correct, and between 1988 and when the Ohio supreme court decided this case in February of 1994, those principles had not changed."
1994.94-3,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,690.751,692.804,So you could just--
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,697.897,702.639,"No, I don't, sir."
1994.94-3,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,704.351,713.097,"Couldn't you just as readily, then, answer my question by saying the choice is between applying Bendix and not applying Bendix, those are the only two choices?"
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,713.097,713.518,Yes.
1994.94-3,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,713.518,713.998,Okay.
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,713.998,714.846,Yes.
1994.94-3,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,714.846,725.254,"But haven't... under the Chevron-type approach, haven't we said, if the rule is clearly foreshadowed, it's not a new rule?"
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,733.782,745.76,"That is true, and even if the court... I don't believe that the Ohio court looked at Chevron in a remedial sense as you are talking about, but rather, a choice of law, but if--"
1994.94-3,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,745.76,746.609,"Well, can we talk--"
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,746.609,746.969,--Sure.
1994.94-3,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,746.969,747.46,--about it here?
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,747.46,747.82,Sure.
1994.94-3,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,805.447,816.246,"So that when the lawsuit was filed, the doubt about the validity of this statute was established under clearly settled principles--"
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,816.246,817.004,That it would not--
1994.94-3,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,817.004,823.179,"--but that's different than Chevron, and that's a way of distinguishing this case and Chevron, but you don't seem to want to accept that distinction."
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,823.179,830.404,"--That the... the statute was clearly settled, I believe."
1994.94-3,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,830.404,835.898,"And I'm asking, isn't that different than the Chevron case, but you say no."
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,837.817,852.768,"Well, certainly, you know, the first test of Chevron is the overruling of past... or clear past precedent, or deciding an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed."
1994.94-3,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,863.246,867.148,It was so because this case relied on well-settled principles.
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,876.452,876.813,--Okay.
1994.94-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,882.657,894.005,"On a less profound level, Mr. Riedel, was it just coincidence that both the vehicles involved in this case were from Pennsylvania?"
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,894.005,894.646,I believe so.
1994.94-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,894.646,899.899,Any reason to know why the suit was brought in Ohio rather than Pennsylvania?
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,899.899,901.401,I do not know.
1994.94-3,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,903.982,915.28,Could it have something to do with the statute of limitations and the tolling that would be possible under the old law in Ohio and not in Pennsylvania?
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,915.28,918.872,"--I don't know, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.94-3,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,920.063,923.474,Do you know what the statute of limitations would have been in Pennsylvania?
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,923.474,925.497,I think it is the same as Ohio.
1994.94-3,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,925.497,931.981,"And that's where under any theory the defendant always was, because the defendant is from Pennsylvania."
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,931.981,937.295,"Everybody was from Pennsylvania, and so I believe the statute was likewise 2 years in Pennsylvania."
1994.94-3,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,939.816,941.796,What is the timing sequence?
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,944.208,950.151,Bendix was decided in June of 1988.
1994.94-3,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,982.302,986.446,But then it would have already too late.
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,986.446,987.167,"Yes, ma'am."
1994.94-3,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,989.668,997.001,So the only notice was the district court... the only hint was the district court decision.
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,997.001,999.435,The district court and the Sixth Circuit.
1994.94-3,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,999.435,1002.815,"Well, the Sixth Circuit you said came--"
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,1002.815,1003.526,No.
1994.94-3,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1003.526,1005.708,--when it would have already been too late under the 2-year limit.
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,1005.708,1007.34,Yes.
1994.94-3,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1007.34,1008.141,You said the district court decision--
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,1008.141,1008.85,Yes.
1994.94-3,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1008.85,1010.051,--was 3 days after the accident.
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,1010.051,1010.702,"Correct, yes."
1994.94-3,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1010.702,1015.825,"But that by the Sixth Circuit had decided, more than 2 years had elapsed since the accident."
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,1015.825,1057.913,"That's correct, and so to address what you had asked me earlier about, if Chevron... the Chevron test were applied to this case, which the majority attempted to do, or at least they said they were going to do in Part I of the opinion, clearly, they didn't even address the first issue in Chevron, the clear precedent or the foreshadowing argument, because what the Ohio majority said was, Bendix was the first time that any court of binding authority in Ohio State courts had ruled the tolling statute unconstitutional."
1994.94-3,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1086.491,1089.582,"I'm not following, because June of 1988 was much too late."
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,1089.582,1090.133,--Yes.
1994.94-3,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1090.133,1103.602,"The foreshadowing would have to have been while plaintiff still could have acted on time, so the only thing that could have been... could count, the only decision, is the district court decision."
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,1103.602,1109.706,If the respondent wanted to rely upon the tolling statute and not the statute of limitations.
1994.94-3,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1109.706,1115.229,Had there been a Delaware case that had struck down a statute similar to this?
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,1115.229,1118.792,I believe it was in New Jersey.
1994.94-3,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1118.792,1120.064,"Oh, it was in New Jersey."
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,1120.064,1120.554,Yes.
1994.94-3,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1120.554,1121.733,And what was the date of that case?
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,1121.733,1126.716,"That was, I believe, '83, in that area."
1994.94-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1144.668,1147.332,"Well, that was our case of Searle v. Cohn."
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,1147.332,1147.74,Yes.
1994.94-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1147.74,1154.555,"And we didn't... we simply have pretermitted that question when we gave our decision, did we not?"
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,1154.555,1155.236,Yes.
1994.94-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1212.324,1214.345,Would you refresh my recollection about Chevron?
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,1215.575,1225.032,--Chevron had to do with which statute of limitations were going to apply to a Louisiana--
1994.94-3,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1225.032,1226.574,And was there any constitutional issue in it?
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,1229.365,1230.868,"--I don't think so, sir."
1994.94-3,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1375.604,1381.756,"--But we don't have to even assume that here, because I take it the choice-of-law issue is subject to stipulation."
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,1381.756,1382.578,Correct.
1994.94-3,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1382.578,1383.309,Okay.
1994.94-3,0,45948,william_e_riedel,,1383.309,1383.759,It is.
1994.94-3,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1439.225,1442.608,"Thank you, Mr. Riedel."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1443.369,1445.95,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-3,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1483.755,1486.516,That's the part that relied on the Ohio constitution?
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1486.516,1488.316,"No, Your Honor."
1994.94-3,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1564.277,1565.939,"Well, Mr. Dyk, may I interrupt you there?"
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1599.391,1603.043,"--I don't understand that to be the issue at all, Justice Souter."
1994.94-3,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1603.043,1603.764,Then correct me on that.
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1603.764,1609.688,"The savings statute, [<twenty-three oh five point one five>] is unconstitutional."
1994.94-3,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1612.479,1613.791,So it's not going to be applied.
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1613.791,1615.451,--It's not going to be applied.
1994.94-3,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1616.142,1616.943,What's left?
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1616.943,1634.003,"--What is left is the general principle, applied by the Ohio supreme court and reflected in the State constitutional provision, which provides for tolling the 2-year statute of limitations because of surprise to this plaintiff and other people similarly situated."
1994.94-3,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1636.845,1645.732,But the... isn't the effect of the tolling in effect to come up with a rule which is identical to the savings statute?
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1673.789,1678.293,"Well, Justice Souter, I do not think it has precisely the same effect."
1994.94-3,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1689.68,1692.142,"But in this case, it will in fact have the same effect."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1692.142,1696.345,"It has the same result, but the reasoning is entirely different."
1994.94-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1715.967,1729.605,"Or to put it another way, foreign corporations should be subjected to suit indefinitely, brought by people who were relying on their ability to sue foreign corporations indefinitely."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1729.605,1730.006,--That--
1994.94-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1730.006,1738.223,"I mean, it's just slicing out a small category of the unconstitutional statute, but it's still essentially applying the same statute."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1738.223,1755.253,"--No, Justice Scalia, it is not applying the same statute, it is applying Article I, section 16 of the Ohio constitution, which has been applied routinely in other cases to save causes of action where people were not on notice that they should have brought the case."
1994.94-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1755.253,1762.997,"But here, its effect is to preserve an unconstitutional statute for the benefit of those who are relying on the unconstitutional statute."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1762.997,1763.318,Well--
1994.94-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1763.318,1763.979,That is what it does.
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1763.979,1767.96,"--That is true, but we think that there is nothing unusual about that."
1994.94-3,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1785.253,1792.867,"Mr. Dyk, on the question of reliance interest, this case seems to me different from the Chevron Oil."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1803.454,1807.867,"--Let me see if I can explain, Justice Ginsburg, the situation."
1994.94-3,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1838.227,1842.87,"Yes, but as far as suing in Ohio, the long arm had been long on the books."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1853.438,1855.619,"--Well, I don't think it had become anachronistic."
1994.94-3,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1863.784,1866.555,"But what was the reason, Mr. Dyk, for the tolling provision originally?"
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1871.45,1886.277,"--I think the reasons are articulated in this Court's decisions in Searle and Bendix, that it is sometimes difficult to use long arm statutes, and it is easier for people to use the tolling provision and rely on that, and that's what happened here."
1994.94-3,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1886.277,1889.17,Didn't the tolling provisions come in in a day when there were no long arms?
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1890.902,1913.134,"Yes, they did, but they were interpreted to continue to have validity after the long arm statutes came in, and if a lawyer is sitting in his office in Ashtabula and trying to figure out when he's supposed to bring suit, he looks at the statutory provisions and he says, I have an indefinite period of time to bring suit, because I am dealing with an out-of-State corporation, and then he goes to research the law."
1994.94-3,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1924.513,1938.053,"But you could not take into account the enormous difference between a world without long arms, where you had to put your hands on the defendant in the State, and the time when it was just a matter of sending notice by mail?"
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1938.053,1958.615,"Justice Ginsburg, the statute may not have been desirable policy, the statute may have not been necessary any more, but the statute was there on the books, and people relied on it, and they are, we think, entitled to rely on tolling provisions on the books that have never been questioned in the Ohio courts and that have been routinely applied."
1994.94-3,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1958.615,1961.537,"How about the district court decision, Mr. Dyk?"
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1961.537,1963.168,There were three district court decisions.
1994.94-3,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1987.564,1989.835,"They weren't in Fed Supp, or--"
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1989.835,1996.179,"They weren't in... none of the three was in Federal Supplement, but there was a conflict there in the district courts."
1994.94-3,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2108.063,2114.947,"--Mr. Dyk, why isn't a basic Federal principle of equal treatment applicable here?"
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2140.644,2150.872,"Well, there would not be normally a disparity in the treatment of identically situated people, because this Ohio constitutional provision would apply to any suit that was brought in Ohio."
1994.94-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2174.817,2181.393,"Before you go... I asked, why should we ever rule on the unconstitutionality of a statute of limitations, then?"
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2203.355,2213.543,"--But that happens all the time, Justice Scalia, and that is the law about adequate and independent State ground in this Court which is very similar."
1994.94-3,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2214.031,2214.482,"Oh, but--"
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2214.482,2216.165,--bring cases with Federal issues in them.
1994.94-3,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2219.357,2223.899,"--No, but Mr. Dyk, that goes to the... doesn't adequate and independent State ground go to the choice of law?"
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2294.905,2297.566,"--But Justice Souter, that happens frequently."
1994.94-3,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2301.881,2315.348,"Ah, but Federal habeas I think is a slippery analogy, because in Federal habeas we've already... the very premise in Federal habeas is that there has already been one completed process of direct appeals in which these kinds of issues can be raised."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2329.207,2342.537,"--But Justice Souter, in at least two cases, Chevron Oil and St. Francis, this Court has held it appropriate to toll statutes of limitations under Federal law where there has been surprise."
1994.94-3,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2347.329,2378.381,"Well, I would like to say there's a distinction because of the constitutional rule that we're dealing with here, although I recognize that there have been instances in which the Court has not immediately applied its constitutional rule, but even in those cases, I would suppose that the prospective application to the particular claimant was such that there was not being a denial of all relief simply by deferring constitutional relief."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2384.744,2388.976,"Well, I think that was true in Chevron and St. Francis also."
1994.94-3,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2389.818,2392.589,Which were not constitutional cases.
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2392.589,2404.467,"--They were not constitutional cases, but they arose under Federal law, and I would have supposed, Justice Souter, that the States had greater authority than the Federal courts to define the appropriate scope of their statutes of limitations."
1994.94-3,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2404.788,2405.378,"Well, you... I'm sorry."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2406.398,2413.853,"--Well, I was going to refer to the Chase case, which recognizes that States can go so far as to revive an entirely expired statute of limitations."
1994.94-3,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2425.912,2464.447,"But don't you think the States, the options open to the States are affected by Beam and Harper, because it seems to me that if the Ohio court can do what you want it to do, then all of the professions in Beam and Harper are very hollow, because in fact the statute can apply... the ruling can apply in the first case, the ruling can therefore necessarily be retroactive, because there's no selective prospectivity, but it doesn't make any difference, because the remedial hand can simply take away what the choice-of-law hand hath given."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2464.447,2467.018,"Justice Souter, I don't believe that's true."
1994.94-3,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2486.3,2488.002,"No, it's just saying, we won't honor it."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2488.002,2493.365,"--We won't honor it, but it's not doing anything that's peculiar to the Federal right."
1994.94-3,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2501.32,2513.768,"But ordinarily that sort of legitimate State interest doesn't triumph over, you know, a flat declaration that the thing is unconstitutional from this Court on Federal grounds."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2513.768,2516.04,"But frequently, Mr. Chief Justice, it does."
1994.94-3,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2533.41,2538.596,But the harmless error doctrine is itself a Federal doctrine from Chapman v. California.
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2549.362,2559.099,"But the harmless error doctrine in a State court, in a State case, originates as a matter of State law, and the question is, is it consistent with this Court's rules."
1994.94-3,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2560.318,2570.727,"But even in that instance, Mr. Dyk, the very premise of applying harmless error is that there is nothing that requires a remedy, i.e., a mistake was harmless."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2586.307,2589.828,"--Justice Souter, I take the example of res judicata, for example."
1994.94-3,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2602.577,2624.312,"But those were cases at least, as I was saying about habeas, in which somebody had a shot at raising the issue, and you know, we can argue and give an instance as to whether the person was at fault or negligent, or what-not, for not raising the issue and prevailing, but in any event, there's no such arguable choice here."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2630.076,2631.986,"--Justice Souter, I don't agree with that."
1994.94-3,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2646.926,2652.469,You want them to go in and invite the lawsuit in order to get the benefit of a constitutional remedy?
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2652.469,2658.313,"--I'm merely suggesting that there is a remedy here, that it's not a situation in which there is no remedy available."
1994.94-3,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2688.273,2690.774,"And maybe they should have, but I mean, the two situations are not comparable."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2690.774,2691.995,--I'm not saying they should have.
1994.94-3,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2696.209,2700.02,"Well, you're saying they should have as a basis for justifying Ohio's result."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2700.02,2706.875,"Well, I think that Ohio is entitled to make the choice, as it does routinely and across the board."
1994.94-3,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2712.779,2723.996,"But discriminating or not, it is in effect ruling that the Ohio constitution can make the Bendix decision prospective only in Ohio."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2726.35,2735.018,"That is the effect of it, but not as a choice-of-law matter, as a remedial matter of saying that where people are surprised--"
1994.94-3,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2735.018,2745.613,"Whatever label you put on it, the result is a prospective application of a decision that this Court declared to be fully retroactive."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2745.613,2752.448,"--Well, I do think the label reflects real substance underlying the Ohio rule of decision."
1994.94-3,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2768.458,2770.16,"But that, Mr. Dyk, is what Ohio said."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2798.779,2804.552,"--Yes, and Justice Ginsburg, in the syllabus they rely on Article I, section 16 of the constitution."
1994.94-3,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2849.432,2862.909,"Well, however, you recast the decision, correct me if I'm wrong, I thought it was the statute of law of Ohio that the holding of the case, the case law comes out of the syllabus and not the opinion."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2862.909,2865.851,--The opinion may be used to interpret--
1994.94-3,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2865.851,2866.432,Clarify.
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2866.432,2875.819,"--Clarify and interpret the syllabus, and we agree that to the extent that they said that the Ohio constitution trumps some Federal principle, they were wrong."
1994.94-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2901.915,2912.852,"I suppose there's no reason why such a provision, if it's operative against Federal decisions, couldn't be applied to substantive matters as well."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2934.177,2937.008,"I would have a serious question about that, Justice Scalia."
1994.94-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2937.008,2937.289,Why?
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2938.25,2947.185,"Well, first of all, if a decision of this Court says that a Federal right does not exist, Ohio could not continue to apply--"
1994.94-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2947.185,2955.563,"Not a Federal right doesn't exist, that the State... the State substantive provision is unconstitutional, under which a plaintiff was suing."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2955.563,2970.901,"--And you would have to inquire, under those circumstances, whether the reasons that Ohio gave for preserving the State substantive provision were legitimate or illegitimate, and probably in most cases they wouldn't be legitimate."
1994.94-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2971.692,2976.316,"Well, if they were legitimate, if they were genuinely protecting expectations, I guess you'd have to say its okay."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,2976.316,2981.9,"--I don't think we're arguing, Justice Scalia, that the State in all circumstances can preserve expectations."
1994.94-3,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3013.72,3016.372,"Mr. Dyk, can I ask you a more basic question?"
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,3050.623,3063.542,"Well, I think the question is whether the Ohio supreme court's decision represents an independent constitutional violation, and it is not, we suggest, a violation of the Commerce Clause, it is a nondiscriminatory rule."
1994.94-3,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3071.307,3082.546,"No, but they're arguing, as they did in Bendix, that requiring us to defend, unlike... at a time when a local company would not have to defend, is itself a violation of the Commerce Clause."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,3082.546,3090.73,--But the rule of Bendix rested on the notion of discrimination on the--
1994.94-3,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3090.73,3093.563,"No, Justice Scalia's position rested on discrimination."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,3099.296,3105.46,--But what it held was applying Commerce Clause principles.
1994.94-3,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3132.669,3134.058,But it is for Reynoldsville.
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,3141.825,3160.325,"--But Mr. Chief Justice, I would not have understood that a foreign corporation can claim immunity from all State rules of law simply because it is an out-of-State corporation if it faces a nondiscriminatory rule, and we suggest that the rule of surprise here is a nondiscriminatory rule."
1994.94-3,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3166.099,3170.583,That's just another way of saying it's giving a different reason for the same unconstitutional violation.
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,3170.583,3172.623,"--Justice Stevens, I don't think so."
1994.94-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3191.326,3195.09,But that rule is shaped around the former Ohio tolling rule.
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,3197.36,3197.891,--No--
1994.94-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3197.891,3202.173,You certainly would not allow them to bring the suit later than that rule would have allowed.
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,3202.173,3204.093,"--Justice Scalia, it is not shaped--"
1994.94-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3204.093,3205.275,You measure it by that rule.
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,3205.275,3211.789,"--Justice Scalia, it is not shaped by the tolling rule that was held invalid in Bendix."
1994.94-3,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3222.627,3223.518,You misunderstand me.
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,3242.06,3248.423,"--Well, what it allows you to do is to sue for a reasonable time after the earlier statute was invalidated."
1994.94-3,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3248.753,3252.346,But that's an ongoing constitutional violation.
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,3266.995,3279.033,"--Justice Kennedy, I do not think it is distinguishable on the facts from Chevron, and I do think that applying the Chevron rule here suggests that we should prevail, but in our view the Chevron rule is too restrictive."
1994.94-3,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3297.456,3299.056,"Thank you, Mr. Dyk."
1994.94-3,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,3299.056,3299.677,Thank you.
1994.94-3,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3299.677,3301.607,"Mr. Riedel, you have 7 minutes remaining."
1994.94-3,2,45948,william_e_riedel,,3301.607,3305.07,"Mr. Chief Justice, I will waive the balance of my rebuttal argument."
1994.94-3,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3305.07,3305.65,Very well.
