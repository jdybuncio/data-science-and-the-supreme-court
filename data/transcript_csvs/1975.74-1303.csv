1975.74-1303,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,77.519,"We will hear arguments next in 1303, Bishop against Wood."
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,81.491,83.231,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,184.628,200.776,"Mr. Smith, let me call your attention on page 19 of your petition for certiorari, a part of Judge Jones’ opinion in the District Court where he says in about the third paragraph on that page that the page, that one little sentence paragraph."
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,225.225,233.234,I do not think this case has said that a United States District Judge is a Court of last resort as far as determining what state law is and--
1975.74-1303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,233.234,240.743,"But, here, you have got the District Judge in North Carolina who is presumably a North Carolina practitioner before he took the bench."
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,251.807,266.824,The record is before the Court and we submit there is nothing intuitive about North Carolina law that it is written and whatever it applies is here and we think the Oral Court is manifestly wrong on the record of this case.
1975.74-1303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,266.824,273.99,But do you do want us to reach a contrary result on the question of North Carolina law as to that reached by Judge Jones?
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,273.99,282.682,"Absolutely, we think there is nothing in the record that supports his conclusion that petitioner held his position at the will and pleasure of the city."
1975.74-1303,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,300.187,306.86,"Before you leave that point, the respondent’s brief cites a couple of North Carolina cases at page 11 of their brief."
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,306.86,307.445,"Yes, sir."
1975.74-1303,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,307.445,311.543,In which they say they stand for the proposition that the contract is terminable at will.
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,316.359,353.443,"If Your Honor will please, our view those of cases as having to do with private employment and employment in the absence of one; a personnel ordinance, such as we have here, or anything analogous to it in the way of contract and, two, in the absence of a fixed probationary period with a maturation into a permanent employment classification and, thus, I feel the cases just deal with a common law of employment in the absence of agreement and ordinance to the contrary and are not controlled."
1975.74-1303,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,353.443,356.888,On the basis the statute is giving your plan some kind of--
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,356.888,358.145,"Primarily, yes, sir."
1975.74-1303,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,362.388,375.115,"Mr. Smith, is it customary for the Fourth Circuit in the 4:4 affirmance by an equally divided court for some of the judges to write as the dissenting opinion of--"
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,375.115,380.914,"If Your Honor please, the dissenting opinion was produced by Judge Winter when there was a hearing panel of three."
1975.74-1303,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,389.725,398.891,"When the en banc hearing was granted that washed out everything that had gone before in the panel, did it not?"
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,398.891,401.236,I presume so.
1975.74-1303,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,481.224,487.926,"Now, that, you in fact read into the language that you read to us."
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,517.61,519.275,"That is correct, sir."
1975.74-1303,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,571.056,573.697,In any event or only if requested by the--
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,573.697,578.834,"No, I am not talking about the police discharge notice."
1975.74-1303,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,682.34,683.342,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,683.342,683.983,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-1303,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,691.46,692.9,"You may continue, Mr. Smith."
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,692.9,695.0,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1975.74-1303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,745.009,750.931,"Was this furnished to petitioner in private, more or less, just by a letter or was it publicly announced?"
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,750.931,754.704,"It was furnished privately in a letter, if Your Honor please."
1975.74-1303,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,762.533,764.026,And at the petitioner’s request?
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,764.026,766.353,"Yes, Your Honor, and later on when--"
1975.74-1303,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,766.353,768.759,Be it public record?
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,768.759,772.08,"Well, under North Carolina law, I am inclined to think they would."
1975.74-1303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,790.452,795.306,Is the record available to some new employer if he sought employment after his discharge here?
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,795.306,798.208,"Yes, sir, certainly."
1975.74-1303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,798.208,800.11,There is no prohibition against showing it?
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,800.11,800.569,None whatever.
1975.74-1303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,800.569,803.188,No requirement that it be shown?
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,803.188,809.1,No requirement that it be shown except pursuant to our public records law and I am inclined to think it would be available.
1975.74-1303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,820.11,822.068,"Mr. Smith, while I have you interrupted."
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,822.068,822.249,"Yes, sir."
1975.74-1303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,822.249,835.309,I gather you make this argument as a reason for reversal apart from the finding of the District Judge that he was not a permanent employee even if he were only a temporary employee.
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,835.309,848.19,"Precisely, even if he were only probationary or temporary or did not have any property interest, clearly, if his liberty interest was of a constitutional magnitude, he would be entitled to procedural due process."
1975.74-1303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,848.19,852.263,Because of the nature of the reasons given at his request why--
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,852.263,854.944,"Well the initial reasons, no, Your Honor."
1975.74-1303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,884.422,889.144,"So it was only at that stage, you say, that the liberty interest was implicated?"
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,889.144,908.642,"It was only then that it became disclosed to us, but we must assume that the Chief of Police was telling the truth under oath when he filed his affidavit and we must further assume that he has extra judicial statement not under oath was false, or else he would have been committing perjury."
1975.74-1303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,908.642,911.567,Then that leaves you in this position.
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,930.833,941.53,"I think whenever one reasonably suspects that his liberty interest have been violated, he can go to Court and ask the person who fired him, under oath, to say what the reasons were."
1975.74-1303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,941.53,957.304,"But if your liberty interest has not been violated at the time you file a lawsuit and the violation occurs only as a result of another party’s pleading to the lawsuit that you brought against him, do you think that is on the same pleading as if they publicly announced it at the time of discharge?"
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,957.304,979.728,"Well in response to that, Your Honor, it is well known that a lot of times employers will not be candid with employees to their face and say the reasons but it must be assumed, I think, that for prospective employers and others who inquired about petitioner’s conduct I think it must be assumed that the chief would have given these real reasons."
1975.74-1303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,979.728,984.718,"But is there any evidence that he did, in fact, give them to anybody else before the lawsuit?"
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,984.718,988.321,"No, sir, there is none."
1975.74-1303,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,988.321,991.167,"You are confusing me a little now, Mr. Smith."
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,997.023,1003.455,"I think it could be argued there that it did, but in canter, I am not satisfied that it did."
1975.74-1303,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1026.215,1030.638,"Mr. Smith, what in the affidavit do you contend affected his liberty interest?"
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1030.638,1043.854,"Well, there were four things: disobedience of orders, insubordination, causing low morale, and engaging in conduct unsuited to an officer."
1975.74-1303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1086.505,1091.944,"But there is no evidence in the record that any prospective employer did inquire, is there?"
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1091.944,1093.363,"No, there is no evidence."
1975.74-1303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1105.774,1111.369,Did you have an opportunity to do any discovery?
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1111.369,1117.45,"We engaged in very limited discovery and, I must say, that is one line of discovery I did not pursue."
1975.74-1303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1117.45,1121.606,Are you not supposed to think about it at the time it is in the District Court rather than the time it is up here?
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1121.606,1142.341,"Yes, sir, I concede that neither I or any other lawyer can think of everything in order to be thought of at the trial level and I feel that there are ample reasons for remanding this case for a determination on the merits and that this is one of the things that would come out in the end."
1975.74-1303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1142.341,1148.166,Arnett v. Kennedy have cited to the Court of Appeals in connection with the en banc request?
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1148.166,1157.409,"The Arnett case I believe, Your Honor, had not been decided at the time en banc consideration was granted."
1975.74-1303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1167.262,1168.661,You do not recall the oral argument?
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1168.661,1182.574,"I do recall Judge Russell asking some questions about the Arnett case and I do recall that I was not, at that time, very able to deal with his questions because the case was very new."
1975.74-1303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1182.574,1184.337,"Well, it was reheard en banc, was it not?"
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1184.337,1185.442,"That is right, Your Honor."
1975.74-1303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1185.979,1187.645,It was actually argued.
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1187.645,1188.674,"Yes, sir, it was."
1975.74-1303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1188.674,1193.74,It was actually argued and you think Arnett was or was not cited?
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1193.74,1195.648,Arnett was cited in oral argument.
1975.74-1303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1203.69,1208.124,It cited Arnett even on the petition for certiorari.
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1208.124,1212.148,"My memory is in, but if Your Honor says so, I assume it is great."
1975.74-1303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1236.356,1257.418,"Could be viewed the same that under state law, even if you could only be fired for a cause, that nevertheless by failing to provide any procedure other than notice and reason that that define the procedural entitlement of the employee."
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1257.418,1258.304,"Yes, sir."
1975.74-1303,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1258.304,1260.958,"And that under state law, that is all he is entitled to."
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1260.958,1265.599,"Well, do you think that stands under Arnett."
1975.74-1303,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1429.128,1436.818,Are you saying they are false or they were just not a complete statement of the reason?
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1436.818,1438.546,"Well, it would be--"
1975.74-1303,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1438.546,1439.045,False?
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1439.045,1456.794,"It would be charitable to say that they were not complete, if one asked for a list of all reasons that he is terminated and he is told that he is terminated because of unsatisfactory work and refusal to attend schools, and later on he finds out that he has been terminated for all these things that implicate his morals and his--"
1975.74-1303,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1456.794,1466.265,"Well, are all those detailed things no more than specific ingredients of the generic reason of unsatisfactory work?"
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1466.265,1468.059,"I do not think so, Your Honor."
1975.74-1303,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1486.476,1489.778,There is a stigma that unsatisfactory work is not.
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1489.778,1491.645,Precisely.
1975.74-1303,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1491.645,1498.642,My question is would they not be subsumed under the generic reason of unsatisfactory work?
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1498.642,1499.885,"Well, I--"
1975.74-1303,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1499.885,1513.7,"I am suggesting only that perhaps the responses were not mutually inconsistent but one was just a little particular, so to speak, and the other was a more generic reason."
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1513.7,1516.109,"Well, it is conceivable."
1975.74-1303,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1529.636,1532.828,Are these set of reasons false?
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1532.828,1534.429,"I think so, if Your Honor please."
1975.74-1303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1559.686,1572.506,"Well, under your theory, supposing you have a Sindermann type case, where the plaintiff sues claiming a guarantee of some sort of tenure plus a deprivation of First Amendment rights."
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1607.466,1607.829,"Yes, sir."
1975.74-1303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1625.618,1631.259,It never would have come out unless the employee had brought a lawsuit.
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1631.259,1645.91,"I certainly believe that, Your Honor and I think whenever and however it comes out, if it comes out in such a way as to come within the test set up in Perry and Roth, I think he needs to be accorded his rights."
1975.74-1303,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1645.91,1694.957,"I rather thought that Perry and Roth, it was Perry specifically, that held that if government, the state or federal, terminated an employee upon the purported ground of some stigmatizing reasons such as you are being fired because you embezzled money, that the termination upon that purported and publicized ground is what made it a colorful liberty interests and that what entitled that employee to a hearing to show that although he might have been terminated he did not embezzle the money but here, as my brother Rehnquist suggests, you do not have that situation to describe."
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1702.954,1705.641,But you have an employer who is covering up and--
1975.74-1303,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1705.641,1708.777,And at that point that you brought your lawsuit.
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1708.777,1717.874,"When you have employer who is covering up and concealing the truth and you think he is and you bring him into Court and you get him to tell the truth, I think you ought to be able to benefit by whatever the truth is."
1975.74-1303,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1717.874,1719.696,"If that is the truth, then that is the end of it."
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1721.681,1737.505,"I am talking about the true state of the employer’s mind, the true reasons the employer had, and of course, the due process hearing would determine whether they are in fact true, and we most emphatically deny that any of these charges are true as is set forth in the record."
1975.74-1303,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1737.505,1749.173,"What motive does an employee have, he was given no reason for his discharge, to sue his employer in order to induce his employer to libel, really which is what you are saying that he is doing?"
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1749.173,1757.233,"If he feels he is being terminated because of his liberty interest, I submit that that is a perfectly valid reason for him to go to Court."
1975.74-1303,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1757.233,1761.763,He has been by definition under Sindermann if that was not the reason given.
1975.74-1303,0,37286,norman_b_smith,,1761.763,1770.784,"Well, he thinks that is, although that is the reason, it is not but why should he not be permitted to go into Court and have the parties tell the truth about the situation."
1975.74-1303,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1791.774,1793.824,Mr. Burgin.
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,1793.824,1798.699,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1303,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1961.69,1964.237,"You represent these two individuals, I take it."
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,1965.716,1966.704,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-1303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2019.676,2024.125,What do you mean nominal capacity as representatives?
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2024.125,2032.734,"That they were the agents of the city, Your Honor, they carried out the provisions of the ordinance."
1975.74-1303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2034.636,2044.496,"Well, but if you take Monroe against Pape, a case like that where they held you could not recover against the City of Chicago, this Court held."
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2059.784,2062.655,"Your Honor, we take issue with that point."
1975.74-1303,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2072.917,2076.81,"I would assume this suit, whoever filed it."
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2076.81,2078.273,"Well, the--"
1975.74-1303,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2078.273,2080.264,Who filed the affidavit?
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2080.264,2082.628,The Chief of Police and the City Manager.
1975.74-1303,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2082.628,2084.737,Do you say they are not responsible for that?
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2084.737,2087.288,"They are responsible for the affidavits, yes, sir."
1975.74-1303,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2087.288,2089.273,They are responsible for firing him.
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2089.273,2097.347,They are responsible for firing him only in the sense that they were acting in a representative capacity as only the city could have.
1975.74-1303,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2102.738,2103.266,To fire him?
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2103.266,2104.806,"Yes, sir."
1975.74-1303,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2104.806,2117.978,Are you saying he can call his representative capacity when you are suing them for damages for firing him and I understand the petitioner’s position to be that what he said in that letter might be liable?
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2117.978,2121.875,Well--
1975.74-1303,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2121.875,2124.183,The city would not be responsible to be directly --
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2124.183,2125.193,For the lie?
1975.74-1303,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2125.193,2125.408,Yes.
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2125.408,2128.47,"No, sir, if there was in fact a liable -"
1975.74-1303,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2128.47,2130.36,"But if there was, who would be liable?"
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2130.36,2131.914,"Well, the--"
1975.74-1303,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2131.914,2132.716,"They will be liable, would they not be?"
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2132.716,2136.065,"Absolutely, in his individual capacity."
1975.74-1303,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2136.065,2137.665,But he is not even in this case.
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2137.665,2142.019,He is not in this case in his individual capacity.
1975.74-1303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2151.677,2172.375,"Well, Mr. Burgin, in Judge Jones’ opinion on page 12 of the petition for writ of certiorari, the first paragraph of his opinion says, referring to the petitioner, he seeks an order requiring the defendant to reemploy him and a monetary award of damages consisting of his wages from March 31 ’72 to the date of judgment."
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2172.375,2173.9,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-1303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2173.9,2175.988,Will you not regard that as a prayer for damages?
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2175.988,2176.965,"No, Your Honor."
1975.74-1303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2205.47,2210.806,What is the difference between back pay or back wages and damages in a case like this?
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2210.806,2215.167,"Well in our mind, there is a great deal of difference."
1975.74-1303,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2220.399,2239.062,"Well, that may be true but Judge Jones opinion talks about damages, as I take it, if one of the individual defendants in this case wrongfully and unconstitutionally fired the petitioner he might be liable for damages even though he, not being the city, could not pay “wages.”"
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2239.062,2240.054,That is correct.
1975.74-1303,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2240.054,2242.559,Damages would be measured by the loss of pay.
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2242.559,2251.205,"That is right but we say, if Your Honor please, that that is not what they are asking for."
1975.74-1303,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2265.799,2271.196,"In any event, I hope you are going to save sufficient time to argue the merits."
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2271.196,2272.369,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-1303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2342.565,2355.953,"Would it apply to the state law in response to a request to give the reasons for discharge, the city said they did not have any?"
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2355.953,2357.73,"Yes, sir, I think it would."
1975.74-1303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2357.73,2361.882,So that you could be fired at will without a cause at all.
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2361.882,2362.763,"Yes, sir."
1975.74-1303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2362.763,2363.569,Under the Fourteenth Amendment?
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2363.569,2367.034,"Yes, sir."
1975.74-1303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2367.034,2369.465,Then that is the end of the case.
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2369.465,2370.658,I think so.
1975.74-1303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2371.151,2377.984,"The District Court cannot apply it, employees maybe fired at will?"
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2377.984,2379.885,"I think yes, sir."
1975.74-1303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2387.118,2399.958,"What if, in response to the request that says that you required for inefficiency."
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2399.958,2402.954,Inefficiency?
1975.74-1303,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2423.961,2433.191,What if the answer was you were fired because you are habitually negligent?
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2433.191,2439.971,I still say that that has no more implication than inefficiency.
1975.74-1303,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2593.56,2597.386,What is the answer to the claim of deprivation of liberty?
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2646.474,2654.997,"I concur in that statement completely but I do say that we had, in discharging him, implicated his liberty in no way."
1975.74-1303,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2654.997,2655.69,Different point?
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2655.69,2659.154,"Yes, sir."
1975.74-1303,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2713.256,2734.811,"Getting back to Mr. Justice Stewart’s question, if in the judicial proceeding rather than as the Police Chief testified, really, we discharged him because of embezzlement, you would still say that there had been no invasion of liberty interest."
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2734.811,2736.629,"Absolutely, yes, Your Honor."
1975.74-1303,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2740.657,2745.795,But because they did not tell him the truth when they discharged him for unsatisfactory work.
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2745.795,2752.191,"Well, Your Honor, respectfully I think that that may be an assumption."
1975.74-1303,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2752.191,2754.952,"I am putting you a question, a hypothetical."
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2754.952,2755.387,Excuse me.
1975.74-1303,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2755.387,2757.133,They gave him the letter they gave him.
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2757.133,2757.303,"Yes, sir."
1975.74-1303,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2757.303,2767.486,"But the fact the Chief testified on the judicial proceeding that that was not the reason, the real reason was he was an embezzler?"
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2767.486,2782.208,"I do not think, if Your Honor please, number one: because it is a judicial proceeding, number two: because it would have been brought by the petitioner that the liberty interest would be implicated in that case."
1975.74-1303,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2806.107,2816.203,There are a lot of rumors around town that he had embezzled funds then the Police Chief takes hold of the situation.
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2823.778,2831.375,"There would be no difference in that hypothesis, Your Honor, than the one you posed earlier, in my mind."
1975.74-1303,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2831.375,2839.009,"After the new ordinance was passed, his termination occurred, was it 10 months?"
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2839.009,2843.281,"About two years, a little over two years."
1975.74-1303,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2851.895,2867.098,"Do you say that his rights, his situation, is different from that of a person employed on the same job after the ordinance was passed or are they in the same boat?"
1975.74-1303,1,18312,charles_e_burgin,,2867.098,2897.324,"No, Your Honor, I would say that I have not contend that below this Court, I would not contend that Mr. Bishop is not a permanent employee and that the situation would be the same with regard to the hypothesis that you put to me, if the two individuals had passed the six-month period."
1975.74-1303,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2902.775,2905.505,Very well.
1975.74-1303,2,37286,norman_b_smith,,2906.719,2912.495,"If Your Honor please, I did save some time but I have no particular comment I wish to make."
1975.74-1303,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2922.486,2928.948,"Under the ordinance, the city need not have any cause for discharge at all."
1975.74-1303,2,37286,norman_b_smith,,2928.948,2930.51,I just think he is plain wrong.
1975.74-1303,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2938.094,2943.209,The Judge said that the employee may be discharged at will?
1975.74-1303,2,37286,norman_b_smith,,2943.209,2944.563,The Judge is just wrong.
1975.74-1303,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2953.232,2957.489,He did not say that he could be discharged without cause.
1975.74-1303,2,37286,norman_b_smith,,2964.798,2968.742,I presume that with “at will” and “without cause” is the same thing.
1975.74-1303,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2976.604,2979.24,Without notice.
1975.74-1303,2,37286,norman_b_smith,,2979.24,2982.797,I suppose that is a possible construction but none of this ordinance.
1975.74-1303,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2988.169,2989.599,"If the Judge said that, why are we here?"
1975.74-1303,2,37286,norman_b_smith,,2989.599,2997.912,"Your Honor, I respectfully contend he is wrong and that Judge Winter is right that this Court ought to reverse."
1975.74-1303,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3003.98,3016.398,"I assume, on your reading of the (Inaudible), I take it that you would say that if we agreed with him that you will lose?"
1975.74-1303,2,37286,norman_b_smith,,3016.398,3020.504,"I think if you agreed with everything he said in that opinion, I would lose but--"
1975.74-1303,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3020.504,3024.945,On the liberty.
1975.74-1303,2,37286,norman_b_smith,,3024.945,3027.177,He said that the liberty interests were not implicated.
1975.74-1303,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3031.912,3033.01,"Thank you, Gentlemen."
