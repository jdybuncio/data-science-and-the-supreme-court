1972.71-685,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,14.364,"-- in two consolidated cases, 71-685, Lehnhausen against Lake Shore Auto Parts, and 71-691 Barrett against Shapiro."
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,18.694,25.173,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-685,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,499.303,501.881,I am not quite clear with Attorney General.
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,508.712,509.683,Yes sir.
1972.71-685,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,509.683,516.898,And that in some -- is that in a provision of the an existing Constitution or something that's --
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,516.898,530.948,"Yes, what had happened was that in 1970, the State convened a constitutional convention, and for the first time in a hundred years revised our Constitution completely."
1972.71-685,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,546.732,547.766,That's actually written in the --
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,547.766,549.971,That's actually written into the new Constitution.
1972.71-685,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,549.971,554.239,And automatically will become effective unless the constitution was again amended?
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,554.239,572.107,It will automatically become effective and the provision realizing that a great deal of the financial support of our school system was based on the Personal Property Tax and by far the bulk of it based on the Personal Property Tax and corporations.
1972.71-685,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,572.107,580.105,"And did you say earlier if I may interrupt, there is $300 million raised by the property tax against corporations alone?"
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,580.105,587.516,The total tax now is somewhere in the nature of $350 million.
1972.71-685,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,587.516,589.675,Raised by taxes only against corporations?
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,589.675,597.657,Only by personal property -- of that amount somewhere between $50 and 75 million of it comes from the individuals.
1972.71-685,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,597.657,598.524,Oh.
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,598.524,602.609,And approximately $300 million of it comes from the corporations.
1972.71-685,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,602.609,602.969,Now the first --
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,602.969,607.218,"Back in 1970, we were talking about $300 million for the total package."
1972.71-685,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,607.218,611.082,But now the first step was to eliminate the property taxes against the individuals.
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,611.082,617.026,It was against the individuals which is done by an amendment to the old Constitution at the time the State Income Tax went into effect.
1972.71-685,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,617.026,618.694,Now then when does the next step became --?
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,618.694,634.974,"The next step was a convening of a new constitutional convention which provided that any other taxes that hadn't gone into effect as of the effective date of that amendment, January 1, 1971 that any other taxes would be phased out no later than 1979."
1972.71-685,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,634.974,641.105,"Well, any other could mean only taxes against corporations -- property tax against corporations, could it?"
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,641.105,641.978,That was our contention.
1972.71-685,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,653.965,655.952,"Well, I’m still puzzled Mr. Attorney General?"
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,655.952,656.236,Yes.
1972.71-685,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,656.236,658.353,I still don’t understand.
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,666.386,666.914,Yes we do.
1972.71-685,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,668.991,669.757,Could you give me just the page --
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,669.757,696.914,And --
1972.71-685,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,696.914,698.994,Is that at page four of your brief in that footnote?
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,698.994,700.728,Page four on the footnote.
1972.71-685,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,733.572,740.801,"But this is not self-operative, it requires a law of the general assembly abolishing?"
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,740.801,748.147,"That’s right, the -- it would require that the legislature orderly phase it on and replace it."
1972.71-685,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,748.841,752.8,Suppose the legislature didn’t do what this requires it to do?
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,752.8,757.14,"Well, then we would have complete chaos and then we would have lost the --"
1972.71-685,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,757.14,766.312,"I am familiar, in my own State of Constitutional provisions which have directed the legislature something back in 1947, and haven’t done it yet?"
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,766.312,782.013,"Well, it would have left us in the situation that we would be in today if the arguments in the Lake Shore Auto Parts Corporations upheld that we would have no source of revenue for financing the State, the practical numbers here for example."
1972.71-685,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,792.531,803.963,"I don't -- or has the general assembly has yet introduced any legislation, pursuant to sub-Section C yet?"
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,803.963,821.663,"The most important factor that happened and I think that it should be recognized by this Court and was not involved in the majority of decisions of the Supreme Court is that the State for the first time in history did pass an income tax, to give us a source of revenue."
1972.71-685,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,844.492,847.318,Well are you suggesting that the new income tax --
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,847.318,848.316,Well --
1972.71-685,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,848.316,850.084,-- is that compensating tax?
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,850.084,853.098,It is the vehicle that now exists for the first time.
1972.71-685,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,892.828,915.204,"As I understood, one of the arguments that you have alluded to, but stressed in your brief is that, in terms of trying to collect this tax from individuals, it was totally uneconomic because the cost was more than the reward and that only was it 2% of the total tax came from individuals, and 98% of that from corporations."
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,915.812,917.665,But it varied throughout the State.
1972.71-685,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,944.149,957.368,"You haven’t addressed yourself to the power of the state to have one tax on corporations which is not inapplicable to anybody else, at least you haven't directly from me?"
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,957.368,980.286,"Well, as I mentioned, in our income tax case, our own Supreme Court took cognizance of a number of cases that had existed in the U.S. Supreme Court that said that it is possible to classify as to ownership, that it is possible to do that in a property tax case."
1972.71-685,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1097.156,1106.439,"Mr. Scott, let me ask you a question about the Constitutional provision that Justice Brennan inquired about, which is on the footnote on page 4 of your brief."
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,1124.47,1124.52,Yes.
1972.71-685,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1124.52,1126.732,Even though the legislature does nothing more about it?
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,1126.732,1138.686,"That’s right and so that the incentive of course, on the legislature is that we would have no way of replacing this tremendous volume of revenue for our school district."
1972.71-685,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1161.217,1177.14,"Do I understand Mr. Attorney General that your answer to Justice Rehnquist is that automatically even if your legislature does nothing under Section C, on January 1, 1979, the ad valorem personal property tax, even as against corporations, would this abolish?"
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,1177.14,1178.443,It would violate the Illinois Constitution.
1972.71-685,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1178.443,1181.553,"No, but if your legislature does nothing --"
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,1181.553,1181.887,Yes sir.
1972.71-685,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1181.887,1186.283,"-- as this requires them to do, nevertheless are you saying that the --"
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,1186.283,1187.413,That’s my interpretation --
1972.71-685,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1187.413,1189.532,Alright.
1972.71-685,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1189.532,1201.545,"Mr. Scott, do you know whether other States draw the same distinction between corporations and individuals, whether there doing so has been upheld against the Constitution attack?"
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,1201.545,1208.733,"Well, I think one of the important factors of this case is that all of the States like Illinois are going through this transition."
1972.71-685,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1212.904,1219.229,Are you trying to suggest that Illinois is on the way up the end of the line in getting to this point?
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,1219.229,1221.39,We had a very real problem.
1972.71-685,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1224.665,1245.5,"That’s why I made my statement and I think you are way behind the tax, but coming to my question, do you know of any other State which draws of the same distinction between corporations and individuals in which distinction has been upheld against Constitutional attack?"
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,1245.5,1246.317,"No, I don’t."
1972.71-685,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1247.828,1249.857,I’ll suggest that there are some.
1972.71-685,0,46139,william_j_scott,,1273.506,1255.956,Thank you.
1972.71-685,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1274.526,1289.499,Thank you Mr. Attorney General.
1972.71-685,1,16357,aubrey_f_kaplan,,1291.095,1299.344,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-685,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1322.984,1326.619,"That wouldn't be a federal question, would it?"
1972.71-685,1,16357,aubrey_f_kaplan,,1326.619,1336.96,"Well, I believe that the determination of the validity of a classification as whether or not it’s offensive to the Fourteenth Amendment would be."
1972.71-685,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1336.96,1341.364,But not in respect to what to the State Constitution means and requires?
1972.71-685,1,16357,aubrey_f_kaplan,,1341.364,1360.647,"I believe that whether a State Court determines -- resolves a case in accordance with its own law or completely disregards its own law, it own case law and its own Constitution in deciding a case, is a federal question."
1972.71-685,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1410.594,1424.583,"Your trial Court in this case could have invalidated both under the State and the federal question, but Justice Schaefer as I read his opinion, relied only on the Fourteenth Amendment?"
1972.71-685,1,16357,aubrey_f_kaplan,,1424.583,1426.388,"Justice Schaefer, no Your Honor."
1972.71-685,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1439.649,1444.673,Then we don’t have the federal question?
1972.71-685,1,16357,aubrey_f_kaplan,,1444.673,1464.664,"Well, I think the federal question is, must our litigants deprived of a fair trial and due process of law when a State Court refuses to observe its own case law and its own Constitution which was in effect at the time of the decision."
1972.71-685,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1506.685,1507.404,Mr. Kaplan?
1972.71-685,1,16357,aubrey_f_kaplan,,1507.404,1509.298,I am sorry.
1972.71-685,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1509.298,1524.143,"At the page A-15 of the petition for writ of certiorari, I think it must be at the last page of Justice Schaefer’s majority opinion, he says, “we hold therefore that the discrimination produced by Article IX-A violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."
1972.71-685,1,16357,aubrey_f_kaplan,,1533.152,1533.979,Yes.
1972.71-685,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1533.979,1540.521,Yes but it is not a ruling on the due process question that you now you presenting?
1972.71-685,1,16357,aubrey_f_kaplan,,1540.521,1553.427,Well we are raising it because Justice Schaefer limited his examination of the governing law to Illinois' 1870 Constitution.
1972.71-685,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1746.526,1754.309,"When you say after, you mean after the Amendment was either adopted or it was so far along with that it couldn't be altered?"
1972.71-685,1,16357,aubrey_f_kaplan,,1754.309,1760.671,"Well, the 1970 Constitution had been adopted by the people."
1972.71-685,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1760.671,1763.821,And when was the opinion that you spoke of --?
1972.71-685,1,16357,aubrey_f_kaplan,,1763.821,1766.877,Let me give Your Honor the chronology.
1972.71-685,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2030.042,2042.39,Do you agree with your colleague Attorney General that this is an automatic phase out whether the legislature acts or does not act at the -- before 1979?
1972.71-685,1,16357,aubrey_f_kaplan,,2042.39,2055.981,"Your Honor, I confess, I do not have the answer to that question but I would anticipate that we maybe here in 1971."
1972.71-685,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2055.981,2056.952,1979?
1972.71-685,1,16357,aubrey_f_kaplan,,2056.952,2061.11,"I beg your pardon, 1981 I think is -- about the timing."
1972.71-685,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2061.11,2062.315,On the 1979 problem?
1972.71-685,1,16357,aubrey_f_kaplan,,2062.315,2064.734,Yes.
1972.71-685,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2149.569,2150.546,Very well Mr. Kaplan.
1972.71-685,1,16357,aubrey_f_kaplan,,2151.271,2159.665,Thank you Your Honor.
1972.71-685,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2159.665,2160.705,Mr. Flamm.
1972.71-685,2,15946,arnold_m_flamm,,2160.705,2164.374,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-685,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2258.337,2267.16,"Well, as the practical matter there is much – isn't there something to that argument, that it is much easier because corporations for the most part have got to keep the inventories."
1972.71-685,2,15946,arnold_m_flamm,,2271.495,2281.657,"Well, it is quite true Your Honor, that as a general rule I have mentioned this in our brief that corporate property tends to be more visible and is therefore more easily assessed."
1972.71-685,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2327.93,2342.086,"Mr. Flamm, if that difference which the Attorney General put between downstate and Chicago is correct, that would suggest that it is very largely a matter of visibility rather than corporate versus individual?"
1972.71-685,2,15946,arnold_m_flamm,,2342.086,2347.231,"Well, it is certainly downstate where there are farm property which is relatively visible."
1972.71-685,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2463.625,2478.132,"Do you see any parallel in this situation and the statutes in quite a number of States that exempt the first five or 10 or $15,000 of value of own or occupied property?"
1972.71-685,2,15946,arnold_m_flamm,,2478.132,2489.038,"Well the fact is the first x number of dollars, I don't see any particular problem where I think the Fourteenth Amendment does not prohibit to that exemption."
1972.71-685,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2489.038,2494.665,"(Voice Overlap) Certainly it discriminates against apartment owner, apartment building owners, does it not?"
1972.71-685,2,15946,arnold_m_flamm,,2494.665,2531.987,"Well, I think that another example might be that many states that have for exemptions for persons over 65 years of age and there is a – I certainly would concede that there is some parallel there, but I think the difference is that the exemption for homeowners or for aged homeowners can be justified on the basis, in the case of aged ones that they have no longer a source of income, but it's not simply based on ownership in such but it's based on the fact that older people presumably no longer have a regular source of income yet their tax bills keep going up year after year."
1972.71-685,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2531.987,2534.624,Go back to the homestead exemption.
1972.71-685,2,15946,arnold_m_flamm,,2544.905,2564.534,"Well, if there was a discrimination, of course you say discrimination against corporate ownership of apartment buildings but they would be as I understand it in the same category as an individual owner of an apartment building, the discrimination certainly is against apartment buildings as compared to single family homes but that there is no -- we see no constitutional problem with that."
1972.71-685,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2567.915,2577.915,And also there is difference or treatment between people who rent houses and who own houses for a rental and those who own houses to live in?
1972.71-685,2,15946,arnold_m_flamm,,2577.915,2595.68,"Well I think that is a valid -- that was base on a nature or use of the property and even in the back in the California Railroad tax case 90 years ago, Justice Field specifically recognized that a classification based on the nature or use of the property is a valid one."
1972.71-685,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2617.371,2622.834,"We'll enlarge your time by three minutes to compensate and we remind your friend's, your colleague's time two minutes."
1972.71-685,2,15946,arnold_m_flamm,,2622.834,2632.369,"Well, I must stay that I appreciate the Court's time, I am not a colleague of the Weil & Company because we are opposed on a very important issue over here Your Honor."
1972.71-685,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2632.369,2634.171,This has been in term in a broad sense.
1972.71-685,2,15946,arnold_m_flamm,,2634.171,2637.379,Thank you.[Laughter]
1972.71-685,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3171.733,3176.349,"You agree that, that's the question that was upper decision?"
1972.71-685,2,15946,arnold_m_flamm,,3179.287,3184.359,"Well, under traditional holdings on this subject I think it is."
1972.71-685,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3195.11,3195.194,Yeah.
1972.71-685,2,15946,arnold_m_flamm,,3202.422,3217.961,"Well, Your Honor in -- that's of course a touchy question because I am aware that we face that problem over here and I cannot say with any great confidence that it's not that we have developed the argument in our brief at considerable length."
1972.71-685,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3474.262,3477.136,"There is now in effect in Illinois an income tax, isn't there?"

1972.71-685,2,15946,arnold_m_flamm,,3480.299,3486.165,"Oh no, the income tax has been effect since prior to the adoption of any of this amendment."
1972.71-685,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3486.165,3488.815,That's imposed at varying rates and varying exemptions (Voice Overlap) corporations.
1972.71-685,2,15946,arnold_m_flamm,,3488.815,3491.255,"Well, it's supposed to be a flat rate tax."
1972.71-685,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3499.219,3500.377,But that's not presently effective.
1972.71-685,2,15946,arnold_m_flamm,,3500.377,3519.316,"At presently not effective You Honor, and it's just two minutes I have remaining, I would address myself to one argument that has been made here and has been made the school districts is that somehow chaos would result if the decision below were affirmed that the school districts would lose $300 million."

1972.71-685,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3690.94,3691.615,What page did you --
1972.71-685,3,34169,louis_l_biro,,3691.615,3695.888,"Page 29 of the Attorney General’s appendix, I am sorry."
1972.71-685,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3695.888,3699.221,"Well that is an order, you must have the wrong page."
1972.71-685,3,34169,louis_l_biro,,3699.221,3705.197,It's in the hand book Mr. Justice – not referred to ?
1972.71-685,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3705.197,3707.676,"It begins, the new article classifies personal property?"

1972.71-685,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4040.206,4069.625,"Well, now hasn't the Illinois Supreme Court settled that question when it said that the on page A11 of the petitioner for writ of certiorari, it's a copy of the opinion of Justice Schaefer's opinion, “We conclude that the meaning of Article IX (a) is that has ad valorem taxation of personal property owned by a natural person or by two or more natural persons as joint tenants or tenants in common is prohibited.”"
1972.71-685,3,34169,louis_l_biro,,4074.823,4078.853,"It purports the answer it, it obviously and so far as the Court is concerned."
1972.71-685,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4090.056,4102.057,"And that's a matter of Illinois law and the meaning of that provision in IX (a) and we must take, we hear that's not a federal question."
1972.71-685,3,34169,louis_l_biro,,4106.537,4121.794,I unfortunately came here (Voice Overlap) Your honor and for that reason I touched on it in my brief only to the extent that I felt that it should be brought to this Court's attention.
1972.71-685,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4121.794,4136.183,"Mr. Biro would you consider a partnership to be within the definition annunciated by the Illinois Supreme Court, two natural persons, a formal partnership?"
