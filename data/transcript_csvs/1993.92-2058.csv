1993.92-2058,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,38.635,"We'll hear argument next in Number 92-2058, Hawaiian Airlines v. Grant Norris."
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,70.408,73.938,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.92-2058,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,201.224,211.252,"Mr. Hipp, you seem to be arguing for a different standard under the RLA than that under Lingle and under the National Labor Relations Act."
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,216.965,230.983,"Your Honor, the touchstone for preemption, as in fact the Court recognized in Lingle, is not to apply some procrustean approach, but instead to look at the purposes of Congress in each scheme."
1993.92-2058,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,307.634,332.959,"But I suppose Congress didn't intend to entirely preempt ordinary State laws, even in the transportation industry, having... I guess we've upheld State requirements that the train have a caboose, and one thing and another, and so obviously we have said there is room for application of State law--"
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,332.959,334.261,That's correct.
1993.92-2058,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,334.261,335.871,--even under the RLA.
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,335.871,342.426,"That's correct, Your Honor, and that is because you must address the congressional purposes of the RLA."
1993.92-2058,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,366.121,377.898,"Well, the State perhaps could arguably have made a conscious decision, by the passage of whistleblower statutes, that this is a means of assuring public safety."
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,377.898,398.831,"They can make that determination, but what they cannot do, Your Honor... and this is what the Andrews case in essence holds... is that they cannot take a dispute between an employee and an employer in the airline or railroad industry and convert that dispute into a State law claim, taking it out of the adjustment board process."
1993.92-2058,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,402.717,404.129,"Well, they haven't taken it out."
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,405.752,419.212,"--Well, this raises the specter, again, of what happened when this Court in the Moore case years ago established this concurrent jurisdiction concept, whereby you could go both to State court, and you could go to the adjustment board procedure."
1993.92-2058,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,419.212,425.596,"Mr. Buell, as I understand your argument, you're not arguing that the RLA preempts State law at all."
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,437.614,439.396,"No, Your Honor, that's not correct."
1993.92-2058,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,439.396,439.636,That's not correct.
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,443.009,452.646,The State law does not exist in the situation where there's a dispute between the employer and the employee covered by these mandatory adjustment board--
1993.92-2058,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,452.646,458.161,"Where the dispute concerns an issue of State law, there no longer is a dispute, so you don't have to go to arbitration, then."
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,461.604,462.355,"--No, I'm not saying that, Your Honor."
1993.92-2058,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,462.355,462.766,It is effective.
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,462.766,464.178,"It is effective, correct."
1993.92-2058,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,464.178,464.739,Then it's not preempted.
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,464.739,466.579,"No, I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1993.92-2058,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,473.346,474.317,Does State law apply?
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,476.028,477.508,--The State law--
1993.92-2058,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,477.508,479.06,--to the employment relationship?
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,480.379,493.549,"--Yes, Your Honor, it can, depending upon whether or not it is regulating a dispute between the employer and the employee, on the one hand, or if it is establishing substantive minimum standards."
1993.92-2058,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,496.113,496.501,I'm really confused.
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,506.309,509.441,"Well, Your Honor, let's make this clear, because it is--"
1993.92-2058,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,509.441,523.549,"--Maybe you can make your example specific to this case, and this would be my question: suppose the board finds that Norris was indeed improperly discharged."
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,537.9,544.996,--The board would be free to fashion a remedy to deal with the finding that it made.
1993.92-2058,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,544.996,547.768,The finding is that a discharge was improper.
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,576.588,590.539,"The remedy would be left open to the adjustment board to establish, and that remedy would take into account the State public policies in establishing whatever remedy the adjustment board wanted."
1993.92-2058,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,590.539,596.443,"But as a practical matter, could the... in the absence of a State law, couldn't the board do exactly the same thing?"
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,602.169,606.56,"That's exactly correct, Your Honor, and in fact that is a--"
1993.92-2058,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,606.56,616.728,"Why, then, did Congress add... if I'm correct, why did Congress add a whistleblower provision to the substantive law governing rail employees but not airline employees?"
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,616.728,622.512,"--Well, it was only addressing the railroad side of the equation in the--"
1993.92-2058,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,622.512,628.806,"On your theory, wasn't it equally redundant, equally unnecessary with respect to the rail employees?"
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,628.806,631.477,"--Yes, Your Honor, except for one thing."
1993.92-2058,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,726.771,732.357,"There's no grievance, it seems to me, unless State law applies."
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,751.425,756.127,"--Okay, in that particular grievance he has been disciplined in some way, as you've just described."
1993.92-2058,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,756.127,760.701,"Yes, and he says, this disciplining is in violation of State law, isn't he saying?"
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,760.701,760.932,"Correct, and now--"
1993.92-2058,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,760.932,762.371,"If it's not in violation of State law, it's okay."
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,762.371,766.896,--So now the question is that there's a dispute between the employee and the employer.
1993.92-2058,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,774.793,780.258,"There is no dispute, unless you posit the applicability of State law."
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,786.794,788.634,--State law--
1993.92-2058,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,788.634,792.758,He's not claiming that he has a Federal right to whistleblower relief.
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,792.758,798.96,"--Well, State law provides the floor upon which the adjustment board has to function."
1993.92-2058,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,808.588,811.69,"That's a really gossamer distinction, it seems to me."
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,834.554,853.426,"No, Your Honor, and in fact this is exactly... this is my point, and that is, the adjustment board was established by Congress, and you'll see this in Representative Crosser's statements at the time of the passage of the act: to act like a court, to make the kinds of judgments based upon a range of policy considerations."
1993.92-2058,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,853.426,861.082,"Well, and I take it from what you've just said that among those policy considerations is not the State law."
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,861.082,863.593,The State law may be taken into account.
1993.92-2058,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,863.593,866.915,"Is it just totally arbitrary, then, on the part of the adjustment board?"
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,871.198,873.15,"It is not arbitrary, Your Honor."
1993.92-2058,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,873.15,878.953,"Well then... but... it seems to me every time you've been asked you've said, well, it could be, but it doesn't have to."
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,878.953,880.034,"Well, and the--"
1993.92-2058,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,880.034,886.469,"How... why would the Nevada and Hawaii cases be treated either (a) differently, or (b) the same?"
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,886.469,907.423,"--Well, certainly it would be treated to provide under our contract, because it states that an employee cannot be disciplined for refusal to perform work in violation of Federal or State safety laws, to provide a floor at whatever the State safety law mandated, but it would be up to... and there could be inconsistencies."
1993.92-2058,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,962.581,969.416,But that frankly seems to me to be almost so vague that you can't put your finger on anything.
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,975.46,977.052,They would no doubt come out the same.
1993.92-2058,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,977.052,981.834,So it doesn't make any difference if Hawaii has a statute and Nevada doesn't.
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,981.834,983.026,That's correct.
1993.92-2058,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,983.026,988.269,"So then, the State law must be virtually nonexistent."
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,989.682,995.698,"Well, in the context of a dispute between an employer and an employee, that is absolutely correct."
1993.92-2058,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,995.698,1010.24,"Then you're withdrawing what you said earlier about... you said State law provides a floor, State law policy would be taken into account by the board, now your response to the Chief Justice is State law is irrelevant."
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1014.514,1017.615,"No, I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg, if that's what I suggested."
1993.92-2058,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1048.786,1060.133,"Well, what is the whistleblower protection, and where does it come from... case law, if it comes from statute or... you're rejecting the Hawaii whistleblower act as the source of law."
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1065.548,1070.181,--The source comes from four different locations.
1993.92-2058,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1079.367,1086.063,"What does... well, can you be specific about what the collecting bargaining statute... agreement says about whistleblowers?"
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1086.063,1089.075,"--I'm sorry, what the collective bargaining--"
1993.92-2058,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1089.075,1091.676,You said a source is the collective bargaining agreement.
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1097.752,1105.035,"--In particular, there's a just cause provision in the contract that prohibits employees from being terminated for just cause."
1993.92-2058,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1112.141,1115.303,"Counsel, let me try this one more time, a different way."
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1140.39,1152.959,--My answer would be that you may not do anything in your adjustment board process that would reject the policies in the Hawaii whistleblower protection statute.
1993.92-2058,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1152.959,1164.727,"I'm not talking about the adjustment board process, I'm asking whether or not I may... I must take account of that statute in determining whether or not I will discharge the employee."
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1164.727,1171.63,My answer would be that you should take into account the policies under that statute and... in deciding whether--
1993.92-2058,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1171.63,1173.112,I should under a matter of law.
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1174.714,1175.584,--That you must.
1993.92-2058,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1175.584,1179.966,Then why do the Nevada and Hawaii cases come out the same?
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1179.966,1184.05,Because in one you have provided a floor.
1993.92-2058,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1199.942,1204.897,So there are other sources for whistleblower protection other than State law.
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1204.897,1206.246,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1993.92-2058,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1206.246,1207.187,And what are they?
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1207.187,1215.314,"The sources arise in the contract, in the practice and procedures of the party, in the Federal Rail Safety Act... it is also... is a source."
1993.92-2058,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1215.314,1224.209,"The board would... even though the Federal Rail Safety Act applies only to railroads and not to airlines, the board would simply carry it over?"
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1224.209,1228.081,"Well, certainly the policies involved would be carried over."
1993.92-2058,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1228.081,1228.892,"Well, why?"
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1240.861,1253.95,"My response is that the policies would carry over because Congress, in the legislative history which we cited for you, states very specifically that it understands that this same protection is provided through the adjustment board process."
1993.92-2058,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1253.95,1259.043,May I ask... you started to respond to an earlier question by identifying four sources of law.
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1262.098,1274.697,"And... the agreement, the practices, the State... the policies under State and Federal substantive laws, the policies involved, and that's through a Misco analysis--"
1993.92-2058,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1274.697,1275.237,And how do you--
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1275.237,1275.677,--and finally--
1993.92-2058,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1275.677,1276.178,"--Oh, go ahead."
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1276.368,1277.419,--That was the third one.
1993.92-2058,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1277.419,1277.89,--That's the third.
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1277.89,1285.947,"And then the finally is the Federal Rail Safety Act provides explicit jurisdiction, even for nonunion employees in the rail line... railroad industry."
1993.92-2058,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1285.947,1293.033,"Focusing on the third for a moment, how does that reconcile the Chief Justice's hypothetical, if the two States have different policies?"
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1293.033,1304.42,"As long as they don't have conflicting policies, then whatever the adjustment board decides upon, it would take into account the policies involved and establish a floor for the employees."
1993.92-2058,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1306.132,1307.642,But it wouldn't follow from that that they would come out the same.
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1314.386,1324.383,"Well, certainly with regard to the specific whistleblowing question I think we can, by reference to what Congress has said it understands to be done in the adjustment boards already."
1993.92-2058,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1324.383,1325.365,Where did Congress say that?
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1326.927,1331.402,In... in the legislative history of the Federal Rail Safety Act.
1993.92-2058,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1331.402,1336.173,Of a congressional... of a congressional act applying only to the railroads.
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1336.173,1347.741,"Yes, that's correct, Your Honor, but it was speaking about adjustment board process, and what they took into account, and the adjustment board scope of jurisdiction in the airline and railroad industries are coextensive."
1993.92-2058,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1347.741,1351.564,May I give you a hypothetical that does not have a Federal policy counterpart?
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1366.865,1368.036,In that case--
1993.92-2058,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1368.036,1371.589,And you assume the collective bargaining agreement is silent on this particular holiday.
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1371.589,1372.19,--All right.
1993.92-2058,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1425.736,1426.684,Let me change it just a little.
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1438.237,1439.349,"--No, he could not, Your Honor."
1993.92-2058,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1466.917,1473.422,"The term ""grievances"" is really the heart of the dispute, I suppose, whether grievances include noncontractual disputes as well as contractual disputes."
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1473.422,1474.451,"--That's correct, Your Honor, and I would really ask--"
1993.92-2058,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1474.451,1476.424,You say they must provide relief in that case--
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1476.424,1476.945,--That they--
1993.92-2058,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1476.945,1477.165,--They must.
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1478.908,1482.879,"--and if by that case, it was the wage payment situation--"
1993.92-2058,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1482.879,1488.195,"The holiday case, right, but they need not provide it in the whistleblower case."
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1490.408,1491.507,"--No, Your Honor--"
1993.92-2058,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1491.507,1493.49,"They must provide it in the whistleblower case, too, right?"
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1493.49,1494.9,"--That's correct, Your Honor--"
1993.92-2058,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1494.9,1496.773,The same relief that the State requires.
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1496.773,1499.775,--They... not the same remedy.
1993.92-2058,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1576.579,1580.432,"Norris, in his State lawsuit, did he ask for punitive damages?"
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1580.432,1582.512,"--Yes, he did, Your Honor."
1993.92-2058,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1582.512,1587.637,"Could he get those under the grievance board proceeding, assuming every fact was found in his favor?"
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1587.637,1591.127,The Hawaii court found that he could not.
1993.92-2058,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1621.149,1629.953,"Review for me your answer of... assuming everything was found in his favor, what could the remedy be from the board and how would it differ from the State law remedy?"
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1629.953,1636.087,"--Your Honor, that is addressed at length by the arbitrator in the Joint Appendix."
1993.92-2058,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1691.806,1703.974,"Aren't you doing away with it too, because you are telling us that even in the instances in which there is a preemption, the preemption is somehow softened by this obligation to borrow standards, or to borrow principles?"
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1707.236,1708.388,"No, Your Honor."
1993.92-2058,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1713.062,1714.654,What is the source of--
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1714.654,1715.195,--if you look at the adjustment--
1993.92-2058,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1715.195,1719.679,--I still don't understand the source of the obligation to borrow these standards.
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1719.679,1730.215,"--The source of the obligation is for the court to... I mean, for the adjustment board to function in the nature of a court, to look at and draw upon the policies--"
1993.92-2058,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1730.215,1745.164,"Then why isn't... why wouldn't it be functioning in the nature of the court for the board to say, we think whistleblower legislation is very unwise, and we are not going to recognize any grievance whatsoever that has as its source a whistleblower claim."
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1746.676,1749.329,--If the board... the board might well say that.
1993.92-2058,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1753.201,1754.042,"Well, but I want to know how the review turns out."
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1757.645,1759.267,I would say that it could not say that.
1993.92-2058,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1759.267,1759.998,Why?
1993.92-2058,0,33847,kenneth_b_hipp,,1759.998,1767.553,"And the reason I would say that, Your Honor, is that Congress has recognized already that this has to be dealt with through the adjustment board process."
1993.92-2058,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1767.553,1769.282,"Thank you, Mr. Hipp."
1993.92-2058,1,41735,susan_oki_mollway,,1771.685,1779.89,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.92-2058,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1875.752,1884.828,"Well, if you were to prevail in this case, Ms. Mollway, we would have to cut back some on the Burley opinion, would we not?"
1993.92-2058,1,41735,susan_oki_mollway,,1884.828,1892.215,"I believe, Your Honor, that that cutback... if Your Honor is referring to construction of the omitted case language--"
1993.92-2058,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,2898.295,2915.034,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-2058,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3036.006,3036.947,Why just safety?
1993.92-2058,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3037.838,3040.71,--It can cover wages as well.
1993.92-2058,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3040.71,3041.07,"Well, all terms of employment."
1993.92-2058,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3048.186,3057.833,"There may be other Federal statutes and Supremacy Clause problems at the margins, but as far as the RLA is concerned, the answer is yes, substantive matters such as wages."
1993.92-2058,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3158.925,3161.235,"Some of these, if you had diversity, you could be in a Federal court."
1993.92-2058,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3161.235,3172.152,"That's right, but a diversity action would go forward in Federal court, and to the extent that the proceeding was in a court of the United States then the Seventh Amendment would clearly apply."
1993.92-2058,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3172.152,3186.644,"Well, that's true, but her point is that by excluding that course, by requiring you to go through the arbitration mechanism, you deprive the plaintiff of that option of getting a jury."
1993.92-2058,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3186.644,3187.893,"That's right, and... and--"
1993.92-2058,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3187.893,3189.475,So it's a possible argument.
1993.92-2058,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3191.428,3218.776,"--I think the more important point, and it is important in interpreting Congress' intent, is that even if a person doesn't have a constitutional right to a jury trial in a State court, it's nonetheless an important and valuable right, and so in interpreting the RLA, the Court should consider whether Congress intended to extinguish this valuable right either by totally extinguishing the State's substantive right, or extinguishing the right to a State forum."
1993.92-2058,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3218.776,3223.728,"Do you recognize any kind of deference, or which one goes first?"
1993.92-2058,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3244.605,3260.706,"We don't believe that it has an obligation to do so, although we would certainly think that in certain cases it would be prudent, and that the State court could, without running afoul of either the plaintiff's rights or the RLA, defer to arbitration."
1993.92-2058,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3261.575,3264.446,Could the State court be bound by factual findings in the arbitration?
1993.92-2058,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3264.446,3265.878,--Yes.
1993.92-2058,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3265.878,3272.554,And would the arbitration panel be bound by factual findings in the State proceeding if that terminated first?
1993.92-2058,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3272.554,3298.803,"I believe that's so, and there... and that is where the problem of deferral becomes important, and we think that... but we don't believe that the RLA itself, of its own force, would require a State court to basically defer or stay proceedings pending the outcome of arbitration, at least as long as the plaintiff's claim does not depend on an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement."
1993.92-2058,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3323.03,3330.774,What if the collective bargaining agreement contained a definition of discharge that was not complied with.
1993.92-2058,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3336.677,3353.89,"Well, in this case that issue doesn't arise because the respondent was very clearly discharged after the step 1 hearing, but in general the question of whether a discharge occurs under... for Hawaii whistleblower protection purposes is a question of State law."
1993.92-2058,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3356.492,3368.39,"So that would mean that if an arbitrator determined there was a discharge within the meaning of the collective bargaining agreement, that would not necessarily preclude a different holding in the State court on the same issue decided under a different standard."
1993.92-2058,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3368.39,3369.191,--That's correct.
1993.92-2058,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3405.758,3413.863,"Mr. Seamon, are you representing simply the Solicitor General here, or the views of the National... NRAB?"
1993.92-2058,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3413.863,3420.518,"--We are representing the views of the United States, not one specific agency such as the NRAB, or the NMB."
1993.92-2058,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3424.899,3425.68,Very well.
1993.92-2058,2,40548,richard_h_seamon,,3426.391,3426.541,I thank the Court.
1993.92-2058,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3426.541,3427.473,The case is submitted.
