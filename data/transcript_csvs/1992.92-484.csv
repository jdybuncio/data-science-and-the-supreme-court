1992.92-484,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,13.886,"We'll hear argument first this morning in number 92-484, United States National Bank of Oregon v. the Independent Insurance Agents of America, and a companion case."
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,15.307,17.682,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.92-484,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,164.684,171.743,"You... you can't find the section in the United States Code now, can you?"
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,171.743,182.598,"--Well, it... it is... it is true that in 1952 the compilers of the United States Code replaced section 92 with a statement that says omit it."
1992.92-484,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,189.595,191.751,"And who were they, the compilers?"
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,191.751,200.607,"They... they're... they're an official body whose statements about what the law is, is prima facie evidence of what the law is."
1992.92-484,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,224.924,229.47,"But, in any event, the code has omitted it since 1952?"
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,229.47,232.235,"--Since 1952, the Code has omitted it."
1992.92-484,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,232.235,236.451,And... and yet the banking authorities have continued to say it wasn't?
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,236.451,243.808,After the cod... the second point I'd like to make about that is after the 1952 codifiers decided that the prior codifiers has been wrong--
1992.92-484,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,243.808,244.245,Yeah.
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,244.245,247.682,"--And raised this issue, Congress held hearings on the subject."
1992.92-484,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,269.251,280.34,"Yeah, but... but it would seem to me the banking authorities have any doubt about it would have suggested that Congress, that they... they enact something called section 92."
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,280.34,283.527,"--Well, of course, if that had ever happened, we wouldn't be here today."
1992.92-484,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,283.527,284.885,"Well, that's true."
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,284.885,285.698,But... but... but... every--
1992.92-484,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,285.698,286.51,Is that why they didn't do it?
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,292.898,310.25,"--But the... a... a... as I say, the regulations governing sales of insurance by banks in small towns have been in effect since 1916, have continued in effect to this day."
1992.92-484,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,456.049,459.799,When you say everything in this section was... now you're referring to section 13 of the Federal Reserve?
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,459.799,460.205,That's right.
1992.92-484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,620.393,622.455,"Mr. Wright, can I interrupt you."
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,641.056,642.79,"--Yes... yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,644.273,647.522,"Everything from 77a, on, is... was enacted in 1913?"
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,647.522,649.537,"--Everything from 77a to 79a is... is all the 1913 version, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,649.537,653.067,And we... we... and we have two more... there's a 1916 statute?
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,653.067,653.567,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,653.567,654.989,"And a 1918 statute we have to deal with, right?"
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,654.989,655.628,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,655.628,656.113,Okay.
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,658.019,658.285,Yes.
1992.92-484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,658.285,658.69,Okay.
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,659.268,664.703,"But if I may turn to 1916, that... that is at page 67a of the appendix."
1992.92-484,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,774.549,780.891,So the bracketed numbers in the margins on page 60 and 69 were added by the parties to this... this case?
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,780.891,781.188,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,941.56,952.337,"And is it part of your submission, Mr. Wright, that in the paragraph that's numbered 7 at the very end, where it says"
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,964.144,971.328,"No, Your Honor, because section 7 is, as I... as I tried to say at the start, it's just the same as in 1913."
1992.92-484,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1003.191,1005.862,"Yes, that was my point, since it stood separately, it had to reference the act?"
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1005.862,1006.222,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1093.467,1095.06,"Well, aren't we supposed to accept that, then?"
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1096.357,1097.685,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1992.92-484,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1097.685,1099.386,"I mean, we don't want to know that."
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1101.979,1103.87,"--Well, Your Honor, that's true."
1992.92-484,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1103.87,1109.742,"Well, then, I close my ears, Mr. Wright."
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1138.355,1144.884,"That's... that's... that's probably right, if those... if those closed quotation marks weren't there, I don't think we'd have a problem."
1992.92-484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1144.884,1152.224,And do you think that there were intended to be quotation marks... opening quotation marks in front of section 5202 on the next--
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1152.224,1155.036,"Well, Your Honor, that's the way it appeared on the original bill."
1992.92-484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1155.036,1163.656,"--But, in other words, what we do... if you're to follow you, you would move the closed quote from after United States to an open quote beginning with section 15?"
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1163.656,1168.889,"Your Honor, I think that that's... that that's probably what Congress really meant."
1992.92-484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1178.947,1186.695,But what I'm trying to find out is where should we place the quotation marks where we will best understand your understanding of what the statute really means.
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1186.695,1188.679,If you place them exactly where you just suggested.
1992.92-484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1193.77,1201.142,"And then what do you do with the opening quotation mark after the colon in the third line, before National Bank, do you make that an internal quote?"
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1201.142,1203.594,--I... I moved those to the beginning of section 52--
1992.92-484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1203.594,1203.876,You moved those to the beginning.
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1203.876,1205.093,--Right.
1992.92-484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1205.093,1209.076,"So it says to read as follows, and you don't put any quotes around what is to read as follows?"
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1209.076,1209.342,No.
1992.92-484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1218.87,1221.634,You put a closed quotation mark at the end of the sentence marked
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1225.102,1227.054,"--Well, if you did that, certainly--"
1992.92-484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1227.054,1227.71,It would make it really clear?
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1227.71,1230.381,"--Yeah, that would make it really... I don't think you need to do that, but that would--"
1992.92-484,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1230.381,1231.708,"That would make it even more clear, I think?"
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1231.708,1232.02,"--That would certainly solve matters, yeah."
1992.92-484,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1232.02,1239.237,"But, Mr. Wright, the enrolled bill have the quotation marks as we find it here."
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1239.237,1239.862,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1239.862,1241.016,And that's what the President signed.
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1241.016,1241.36,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1241.36,1243.718,"So we have to accept that, don't we?"
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1245.046,1251.481,"Well, I... I... I think you do, but the enrolled bill also had the text of the provision."
1992.92-484,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1258.446,1263.43,"But so far as the quotation marks argument is concerned, the enrolled bill had them."
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1264.585,1266.693,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1266.693,1270.598,"So, I'm a little bit surprised that you would rest your argument at all on that."
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1270.598,1279.032,My argument is that they were not meant to have interpretive significance and that there is textual ambiguity on the enrolled bill.
1992.92-484,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1334.587,1344.474,"But you would simply win if we sort of followed a rule that when the ambiguity is created as between punctuation and verbal text, the verbal text controls?"
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1344.474,1345.224,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1345.224,1346.411,That's all you need?
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1346.411,1347.145,That's right.
1992.92-484,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1374.431,1385.286,Have our... any of our previous cases dealing with the enrolled bill doctrine indicated that an ambiguity is sufficient to go behind the enrolled bill?
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1385.286,1389.503,"I... I don't... I don't recall any case like that, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1396.906,1411.79,"Well, isn't another way of dealing with it, though, simply to say don't go behind the enrolled bill, but make a choice between the two signals in the enrolled bill, and the verbal signal is the one that controls over the punctuational signal?"
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1411.79,1418.32,There are certainly plenty of cases of this Court saying that punctuation is the poorest guide to Congress's intents.
1992.92-484,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1421.505,1425.036,"Mr. Wright, you may be arguing the other side of that some day."
1992.92-484,0,20411,christopher_j_wright,,1456.835,1460.131,It's... it's hard to imagine every possible future case.
1992.92-484,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1476.281,1477.593,"Very well, Mr. Wright."
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,1480.264,1484.45,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1992.92-484,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1500.836,1502.037,"Well, may I ask you."
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,1508.628,1512.189,"No, Your Honor, I do not think they have any bearing, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1512.189,1516.093,"Well, then, shouldn't we look at the U.S. Code for the period right after the enactment, rather than today?"
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,1516.093,1516.906,"No, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1534.431,1536.492,"Well, let me just be sure I understand you."
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,1543.598,1548.128,"It worked a change in the presumption, Your Honor, not a change in the law, whether it existed or not."
1992.92-484,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1561.966,1564.902,"Well, but changing the presumption, in your view, must have changed the law, too?"
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,1564.902,1565.621,"--No, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1606.776,1609.947,"Do you have a place that we can follow you, Ms. Kappler?"
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,1609.947,1610.385,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1657.881,1668.315,"Ms. Kappler, I can agree with that, but what do you do with the language, 8?"
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,1674.765,1676.451,"Correct... no, Your Honor, it does make sense."
1992.92-484,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1738.973,1745.923,"Well, that makes perfect sense if the provision in which this act appears is the provision which expressly speaks of an amendment taking place."
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,1760.136,1761.089,"No, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1779.536,1783.425,When you say 7 in the margin.
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,1783.425,1786.641,--Now I'm referring to paragraph... what is bracketed number 8.
1992.92-484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1786.641,1786.969,Okay.
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,1786.969,1789.375,It's the paragraph that follows afterwards on page 70a.
1992.92-484,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1826.454,1832.702,"Well, why is it then in the previous paragraph that the statute uses the word the Federal Reserve Act?"
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,1832.702,1837.17,"Well, I will agree, Your Honor, that the... that Congress was not stylistically consistent."
1992.92-484,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1849.743,1872.373,"Well, of course, there's no ambiguity, but there's only... there's no ambiguity because it seems to me very clear that the one is intended to be in 5202, and that's why they say the provisions of the Federal Reserve Act, and the other one is meant to be in this piece of statute that's being amended."
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,1872.373,1877.918,"--Well, Your Honor, the problem, though, is that this piece of statute that's being amended did two things."
1992.92-484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1922.855,1927.509,What did section 5202 deal with before it was amended in 1913?
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,1927.509,1933.819,Section 5202 is derived... its origin is a section of the National Bank Act.
1992.92-484,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1963.01,1965.931,What's that got to do with the relationship between debt to capital?
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,1965.931,1970.523,"--Your Honor, I'm not sure it has a relationship to debt to capital."
1992.92-484,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1971.85,1973.599,"Well, isn't that what 5202 is dealing with?"
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,1973.599,1976.521,"--But 5202, Your Honor, is part of the National Bank Act."
1992.92-484,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2010.757,2031.516,"You may be right that... that paragraph 9 might have some connection with liabilities, but paragraph 8 has no relevance to what 5202 deals with."
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2031.516,2032.578,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2128.835,2138.315,Is this provision that's marked 8 here the only provision in the Federal Reserve Act that applies specifically to national banks?
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2138.315,2144.188,"Paragraph 9 you mean, Your Honor, the one that--"
1992.92-484,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2144.188,2144.796,Yes.
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2145.343,2148.186,"--No, there are other provisions which... which relate to national banks."
1992.92-484,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2175.082,2186.139,Are there... were there other statutes enacted later that applied only to national banks and that were outside of the Federal Reserve Act?
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2186.139,2195.042,"Your Honor, the preexisting National Bank Act, which was codified as such in different sections of the revised statutes, did just that."
1992.92-484,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2205.069,2206.178,But... but... but afterwards?
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2206.178,2206.944,"--I don't know, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2222.173,2223.142,May I ask.
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2228.609,2229.936,"Yes, Your Honor, it does."
1992.92-484,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2229.936,2230.373,Right.
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2230.373,2235.154,And they are deemed repealed with the exact same explanation that is given as to section 92.
1992.92-484,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2235.154,2244.773,And what do you... how do you explain the subsequent statutes that amend this nonexistent provision?
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2246.898,2253.926,"Well, as Mr. Wright has conceded, a subsequent Congress cannot amend a nonexistent statute."
1992.92-484,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2277.714,2291.489,"No, but surely in deciding what a law means, we try to reconcile new laws with old laws, and read them together in such a way that they... that they make sense, one with the other."
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2302.313,2307.248,"Well, first of all, Your Honor, we don't concede that it's possible to read the 1916 act any other way."
1992.92-484,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2386.607,2391.464,"Well, then, was there... there wasn't a committee report on that?"
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2393.292,2394.776,"--It was his testimony, correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2404.067,2410.129,"And do you think you... what if this case had come up before 1952, do you think you could have won?"
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2410.129,2411.425,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1992.92-484,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2412.503,2413.782,And you could have overcome the presumption?
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2413.782,2416.078,"--Correct, Your Honor, because I think the statutes at large are clear."
1992.92-484,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2419.452,2420.765,"I was just curious, who was the chairman?"
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2422.326,2423.561,"It was not, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2467.809,2468.995,May I ask.
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2483.615,2487.002,"No, Your Honor, not the way the Petitioners ask you to do."
1992.92-484,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2488.44,2489.377,"Well, that's the way I asked you to."
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2500.03,2502.856,"--Yes, Your Honor, but the legislative history would get you nowhere here."
1992.92-484,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2513.805,2525.19,"No, but wouldn't it be relevant if there's an absence of any stated reason for repealing these provisions, whereas the discussion makes sense if you... if you treat it the way the Government would interpret it?"
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2526.643,2536.421,"Well, Your Honor, what the 1918 Congress thought it was doing is not relevant to what the 1916 Congress did in enacting the law in 1916."
1992.92-484,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2549.743,2555.694,"And there is no ambiguity in that, that would justify going to legislative history, even if one were so disposed?"
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2555.694,2556.288,"Correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2557.147,2564.049,"But doesn't that simply prove that what the case turns on is not what the 1918 act provided, but what the 1916 act provided?"
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2564.049,2564.94,"--Well, I think that's right."
1992.92-484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2584.105,2594.07,Were there any committee reports at all indicate what would be today a section-by-section analysis of the 1916 act?
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2594.07,2596.007,"No, Your Honor... not to my knowledge, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2651.687,2660.996,Amendments to a nonexistent provision... I suppose those amendments were... passed both houses and they were signed by the President?
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2660.996,2661.807,"Correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2676.442,2682.299,"So, if they'd a said section so and so is amended to read as follows?"
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2682.299,2685.173,"--Correct, Your Honor, that we would be in a very different situation."
1992.92-484,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2685.173,2685.579,Well--
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2685.579,2688.686,"In that... in that instance, as this Court has said time and again--"
1992.92-484,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2688.686,2697.637,"--Well, there... at the same time, however, there wouldn't have been a... by your account, there wouldn't have been a provision to amend."
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2697.637,2707.821,"--Well, I think it turns on the question of whether amended... whether Congress would be constrained by the use of the word amended to read as follows."
1992.92-484,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2716.646,2722.081,So you think there's really... you think there's really a major difference between that way of amending and the way they actually amended it?
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2722.081,2722.862,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2729.498,2729.936,"Well, they didn't reenact new language."
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2738.886,2741.666,--They struck out what they thought was a statute that was already on the books.
1992.92-484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2755.597,2764.844,"Of course, the Town of Ottawa case was talking about something done by the Illinois legislature, and this Court was really just upholding the ruling of the Illinois Supreme Court in that case."
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2769.405,2770.747,"Well, correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2907.739,2910.988,"Did 92 appear somewhere else in that compilation, too?"
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2910.988,2911.394,"--Yes, Your Honor, it did."
1992.92-484,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2953.018,2976.946,"Well, assuming that the Comptroller's own compilation was therefore ambiguous, would it be a fair maybe speculation is the word... that on that assumption that one purpose of the 1918 amendment to 5202 was in fact to clear up that ambiguity, and make it clear that section 92 was in the Federal Reserve Act and not in 5202?"
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2976.946,2978.508,"There was no ambiguity, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2980.695,2996.362,"No, but I mean, if you assume there's an ambiguity created by the Comptroller's own compilation merely by virtue of the fact that section 92 appears in two places, might... well, let's just stipulate that we could describe that as an ambiguity... might that be a purpose... have been a purpose of the 18 amendment?"
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,2996.362,3000.593,"No, Your Honor, because the 1918 act would not have cleared up the ambiguity."
1992.92-484,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3002.093,3007.262,"Well, why wouldn't it have cleared it up by making it clear that section 92 was not part of 5202?"
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,3007.262,3021.71,"--Because then what you would have is two different versions of 5202... one that was enacted that's a stand-alone provision that was amended in 1918, and one that's embedded somehow within the Federal Reserve Act that wasn't changed."
1992.92-484,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3023.382,3028.975,"Oh, you're saying the only way they could have done that would have been unambiguously to take 52 out... 5202 out of the Federal Reserve Act completely?"
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,3028.975,3029.489,"--Correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3036.112,3037.378,Ms. Kappler.
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,3037.378,3037.69,Yes.
1992.92-484,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3037.69,3042.876,"Now, none of these arguments were made in the Court of Appeals?"
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,3042.876,3043.673,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3043.673,3052.605,"And do you concede that the Court of Appeals, nonetheless, had jurisdiction and power to reach the issues?"
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,3052.605,3054.245,I think there's no question that it had jurisdiction and power.
1992.92-484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3086.528,3095.744,"It would be a rather strange doctrine if this Court accept only the arguments of one side or the arguments of the other, and couldn't possibly think the thing through for itself."
1992.92-484,1,16374,ann_mary_kappler,,3095.744,3096.166,"Correct... correct, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3102.194,3104.522,"Very well, Ms. Kappler."
1992.92-484,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3106.301,3108.207,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.92-484,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3130.682,3132.76,"Do we... Mr. Wright, just a technical question."
1992.92-484,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3138.632,3138.882,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3219.647,3232.346,"Mr. Wright, as I understand it, you do not contest the point in principle that Congress may have been ineffective in enacting its intent?"
1992.92-484,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3234.329,3239.077,There is certainly one reading of those quotation marks that is contrary to what Congress intended--
1992.92-484,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3239.077,3245.011,"And... and that if it was, then Congress simply failed to enact what it meant to enact?"
1992.92-484,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3248.572,3249.291,--That is possible.
1992.92-484,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3269.002,3273.766,"Mr. Wright, what about those other sections, other than 92?"
1992.92-484,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3282.106,3285.511,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3290.055,3302.363,"But the same... the same problem or the same... all of these... 8, 9, 10... 8, 9 and 10 will suffer the same fate--"
1992.92-484,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3302.363,3304.58,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3318.592,3318.997,"--Well, I know, but--"
1992.92-484,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3318.997,3320.341,But they all go one place or another.
1992.92-484,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3320.341,3324.527,--But they... don't... but don't they claim that they were repealed?
1992.92-484,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3324.527,3326.682,"They claim... they claim they were all repealed, yes, Your Honor."
1992.92-484,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3326.682,3326.963,Yeah.
1992.92-484,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3330.556,3343.409,"Although, if I could remind the Court, at oral argument in the D.C. Circuit, counsel for the Insurance Agents said, and I quote, that they quote, cannot advance a substantial argument that section 92 no longer exists, unquote."
1992.92-484,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3345.112,3350.547,"Is it the Government's position that those other provisions are repealed, not repealed, what?"
1992.92-484,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3350.547,3352.938,We think that they're not repealed either.
1992.92-484,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3354.795,3357.029,So your... the two sides are in disagreement as to all three of those--
1992.92-484,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3357.029,3358.795,"--Although, of course, only section 92--"
1992.92-484,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3358.795,3359.622,--Is at issue here.
1992.92-484,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3359.622,3360.528,--Is actually at issue here.
1992.92-484,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3360.528,3363.074,"Well, I know, but it controls the other two, I would think."
1992.92-484,2,20411,christopher_j_wright,,3363.074,3363.308,Yes.
1992.92-484,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3369.634,3371.072,"Thank you, Mr. Wright."
