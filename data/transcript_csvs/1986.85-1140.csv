1986.85-1140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.939,"We will hear argument first this morning in No. 85-1140, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company against Buell."
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,15.641,21.061,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is a statutory construction case."
1986.85-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,278.842,302.625,"Mr. Lee, wouldn't that also be the case if you had just a standard FELA negligence action where prior to the accident there had been complaints about slipshod procedures within the shop or about some other matters that would constitute negligence?"
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,309.794,313.662,"Clearly you can, and clearly you can do both, and those two can exist side by side."
1986.85-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,313.662,314.346,So why is this different?
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,314.346,321.233,This case is different simply because there is no legitimate FELA complaint that has been stated.
1986.85-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,327.02,330.189,"Well, that is quite a different issue, and I was going to ask you that, too."
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,354.804,355.321,"--Oh, yes, we are."
1986.85-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,400.602,403.152,"I am not talking physical injury, Mr. Lee."
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,408.189,409.305,--That is correct.
1986.85-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,409.305,436.006,"And the injury alleged here is proximately intentionally causing emotional distress which may or may not, depending on which side you believe, have led to properly alleged physical injury, but you know, proximately you have intentional action on the part of the foreman and some of the coworkers causing emotional distress, and that has been converted into a negligence action by saying that it was the company's failure adequately to supervise that constitutes the negligence."
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,436.006,436.722,That is correct.
1986.85-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,436.722,441.843,"Now, you are not protesting that and saying that that doesn't constitute a proper FELA action?"
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,441.843,442.676,"Oh, indeed we are."
1986.85-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,459.287,460.737,I am not talking emotional injury.
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,477.016,484.336,--That at least is not... we are not protesting that part of the claim.
1986.85-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,492.792,518.342,"The same problem has arised under the Federal Tort Claims Act, which only allows... which specifically excludes claims for intentional injury but it is sometimes alleged and some courts have thought it is artful pleading to allege that where the government fails to supervise, let's say, an enlisted man in the Army who intentionally inflicts injury on somebody else, that constitutes negligence under the Federal Tort Claims Act."
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,518.342,519.558,"Yes, I think I understand your question."
1986.85-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,519.558,520.076,Do you understand where I am going?
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,520.076,521.326,I think so.
1986.85-1140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,564.771,580.031,"And you could win, I take it, either by claiming... by establishing that the RLA applied even though in the absence of the RLA the FELA might apply, or you could win by proving that the FELA didn't apply whether the RLA applied or not."
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,580.031,587.935,"That is exactly right, and I would like to take those one by one now and establish the Ninth Circuit's error as to each of them."
1986.85-1140,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,587.935,597.474,"Mr. Lee, before you proceed, it would help me if you would tell me what relief could be awarded respondents under the FELA."
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,597.474,606.496,Under the RLA these adjustment boards have the authority to give standard arbitration kinds of awards.
1986.85-1140,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,609.532,611.065,Can they award damages?
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,611.065,615.017,"Well, damages in the sense of reinstatement and back pay."
1986.85-1140,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,643.6,668.402,"Mr. Lee, I am not sure you really gave an answer that I thoroughly understood to Justice Scalia's first question, that if it were an ordinary FELA case that arose out of sloppy procedures and so forth and an injury, why would the RLA not preempt that cause of action if it does in this case, and you answered it by saying, well, there is no FELA case here, but that is really your second argument."
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,668.402,669.218,That is correct.
1986.85-1140,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,886.836,914.855,"Well, Mr. Lee, I don't understand why if you are right about the Railway Labor Act, that actions from mental injury stemming from grievable disputes are preempted by the Railway Labor Act, why, then, are not physical injuries that also stem from grievable disputes not similarly preempted?"
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,914.855,926.663,"The reason in our view that they are not, Justice O'Connor, is because you have to reach some kind of an accommodation of both statutes, and you cannot simply turn your back on either of them."
1986.85-1140,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,974.441,980.695,Why would you not approach this case in the same way the court did with the National Labor Relations Act?
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,980.695,988.551,"--I think we do except that there are two different statutes, and because there are two different statutes their underlying policies cut in opposite directions."
1986.85-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1059.211,1063.765,May I ask why it is you think that the language
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1079.608,1083.678,"Because otherwise the word ""grievances"" simply becomes meaningless."
1986.85-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1083.678,1099.038,"Why couldn't you have a grievance which consists of a situation in which both the employer and the employee are clear on what the agreement means and what it requires in this case, what its application should be in this case."
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1114.048,1120.018,"Well, but it says interpretation or application."
1986.85-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1121.118,1123.82,But there is no dispute as to how the agreement applies.
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1130.493,1131.459,--All right.
1986.85-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1133.959,1135.994,"It is at least a plausible reading of the word ""grievances""."
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1135.994,1137.427,--That's right.
1986.85-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1156.555,1161.709,The problem I find is that once you depart from that interpretation what in the world is not covered by a grievance?
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1167.763,1170.215,"--That is exactly the point, Justice Scalia."
1986.85-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1170.215,1172.6,That is a grievance.
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1172.6,1173.25,That is correct.
1986.85-1140,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1204.221,1209.006,But they all arise out of interpretation of the bargaining agreement if they pertain to the running of the railroad.
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1219.814,1235.257,"If you take that point of view, and you may be right, then certainly Rules 39 and 40 of this agreement do cover this circumstance and under the facts of this case then the RLA definitely does apply."
1986.85-1140,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1293.112,1297.248,"Mr. Lee, do you define what place to include the entire railroad?"
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1300.533,1309.556,"Yes, I do, Justice Powell, in the sense that it is where Mr.... it is on the... in Congressman Barkley, in the workplaces, in the shop, and out on the tracks."
1986.85-1140,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1309.556,1317.977,So if you had an engineer who was alleged to be abusive of other people working with him on a particular train you would take the same position?
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1317.977,1319.06,"Yes, sir, I would."
1986.85-1140,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1319.06,1327.416,So really your argument comes down to whether or not the nature of the injury is emotional distress rather than physical injury.
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1338.255,1339.306,Under the FELA.
1986.85-1140,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1339.306,1340.206,Under the FELA?
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1340.206,1342.342,"Yes, because you have then the physical injury."
1986.85-1140,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1342.342,1350.329,"So the big issue in this case, is a distinction between physical and emotional injury, regardless of where it took place."
1986.85-1140,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1350.329,1365.291,"Yes, and while that may... that is correct, and while that may seem to be somewhat arbitrary we submit it is a very important one because of the need to draw some line in order that neither statute completely consume the other."
1986.85-1140,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1580.912,1582.714,"Thank you, Mr. Lee."
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,1584.214,1614.752,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, it is my privilege to address you today as counsel of record for Jim Buell, a veteran railroad worker of over ten years' employment with the Santa Fe Railroad who in October of 1981 sustained a severe and grievous injury."
1986.85-1140,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1716.598,1722.919,"Is this all in the affidavits and so forth on the motion for summary judgment, Mr. Buell... rather, Mr. McCall?"
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,1722.919,1740.213,"Justice, the affidavits... it is clear in the Buell brief that I put in, we did not marshall facts showing physicality in the lower court because the thrust of Santa Fe's argument there was that it made no difference what type of injury was involved."
1986.85-1140,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1745.134,1753.223,"Don't you think probably in this Court you are limited to what the record shows, either the complaint or the affidavits produced in the summary judgment proceedings?"
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,1753.223,1763.746,"Again we submit, Your Honor, that we should be able to point to things that are in the record that were not produced in the motion for summary judgment simply because the motion for summary judgment was rather narrow."
1986.85-1140,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1798.935,1804.572,What you are referring to then is something that is in the record although perhaps not used in the summary judgment proceeding?
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,1804.572,1822.867,"That is correct, Justice, yes, and I won't... the point as to the physicality, the physical causation, the physical consequence, the gastritis, the common law battery, if you will, those items are developed in my brief at Pages 33 through 40 and I won't refer to them again."
1986.85-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1824.652,1831.89,"The common law battery, you assert that there was a physical contact by... was it wright or one of the coworkers?"
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,1831.89,1833.858,"--It was one of the fellow workmen, a man named Williams."
1986.85-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1835.142,1836.96,And that is in the record.
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,1836.96,1837.71,That is in the record.
1986.85-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1841.245,1843.197,Were damages sought for the pushing or shoving?
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,1843.197,1849.351,"The damages... the allegation in the complaint was that he suffered physical and emotional distress, but it is clear--"
1986.85-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1849.351,1851.067,The physical stress referred to was the--
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,1851.067,1852.553,--Gastritis.
1986.85-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1852.553,1853.203,--the gastritis.
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,1853.203,1854.886,"The gastritis, and certainly--"
1986.85-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1854.886,1861.242,"So whatever physical injury there is is, you would acknowledge, physical injury arising from the emotional injury."
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,1861.242,1863.609,"--Yes, Your Honor, very definitely."
1986.85-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1913.591,1914.757,What is the source of that grievance?
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,1935.021,1962.422,"If you approach it as a grievance, but, Justice Scalia, under the FELA Congress was very clear about wanting to make the master responsible for the acts of the fellow servants in the workplace, in the railroad workplace, and it would seem to me that the FELA imposes a duty on Santa Fe to take reasonable steps to see that their foremen do not abuse their workmen, so in that sense it seems to me a classic FELA case."
1986.85-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1962.422,1966.226,You assert that that is an obligation separate and apart from any contractual obligation?
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,1966.226,1966.526,Yes.
1986.85-1140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2132.284,2133.434,Mr. McCall--
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2133.434,2134.336,"Yes, Justice."
1986.85-1140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2134.336,2154.815,"--suppose the foreman's conduct is grieved, and you have agreements, and it goes to the adjustment board, and suppose that it is found that he hasn't been harassing the man at all as a matter of fact."
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2162.053,2166.707,"He would be, Your Honor, if and only if he had suffered an injury."
1986.85-1140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2166.707,2170.659,"Well, let's suppose these very facts here."
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2176.396,2176.896,Yes.
1986.85-1140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2176.896,2181.383,But it is found that the foreman had nothing to do with it.
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2181.383,2191.155,"As far as the grievance and arbitration procedures are concerned, what the foreman did did not violate any term of the contract."
1986.85-1140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2194.44,2200.444,"Well, the fact was, the fact is that he didn't do what he claimed that the employee claims he did."
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2206.682,2207.7,"--Oh, I certainly could, Your Honor."
1986.85-1140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2212.402,2212.836,Yes.
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2212.836,2221.092,I can't see how arbitration or grievance is an adequate substitute for the Federal District Court jury trial right that the Congress gave under the FELA.
1986.85-1140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2221.092,2222.377,What if you lose your FELA action?
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2227.829,2230.614,The time limits on grievance are rather severe.
1986.85-1140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2230.614,2231.149,Yes.
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2231.149,2234.184,"So it wouldn't arise, I suppose."
1986.85-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2234.184,2238.636,I am not sure how this fits with what you said before.
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2243.873,2249.194,"I didn't speak well on that, Justice Scalia."
1986.85-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2264.085,2272.175,"But it is only grievable, according to your position, if its source is the contract, and you said earlier that the source of the right here was not the contract."
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2272.175,2283.863,"Well, there is the common law duty or the duty that the FELA recognizes on the part of the railroad not to be negligent in the way in which its fellow servants treat each other."
1986.85-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2283.863,2295.504,"Well, is that contractual or not contractual or are there two duties, one a contractual one which is grievable, and another one, a noncontractual one which can be brought under the FELA."
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2296.123,2296.79,"Yes, Justice."
1986.85-1140,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2296.79,2298.742,Isn't that contrary to the Elgin case?
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2298.742,2304.729,The Elgin case in a long... I don't think so.
1986.85-1140,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2357.078,2367.052,"Well, but it also spoke in terms that grievable matters under the RLA were not just contract disputes but a broader classification of complaints."
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2370.587,2372.57,"Not to my knowledge, Your Honor, but I--"
1986.85-1140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2372.57,2388.631,"Your position is, even if it is grievable and even if it isn't covered by the contract or has its root in the contract, you would say that even if it is grievable, you can still have your FELA action."
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2388.631,2389.731,"--Yes, indeed, Justice."
1986.85-1140,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2408.879,2420.52,Even though to the judge in charging the jury in the FELA case would have to either interpret the collective bargaining agreement as a matter of law or charge them to interpret it as a matter of fact?
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2420.52,2429.292,"That is our basic position, Your Honor, and we offer it as one of three ways we feel that there can be harmonization between the FELA and the RLA."
1986.85-1140,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2458.11,2460.478,"Yes, and you say once you have an injury."
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2460.478,2460.978,--Yes.
1986.85-1140,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2460.978,2463.097,And of course it doesn't have to be a physical injury.
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2471.517,2474.453,It is unlikely a lawsuit is going to be brought for that sort of thing.
1986.85-1140,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2474.453,2475.321,But it could in your view.
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2475.321,2477.438,"Conceivably someone could bring a lawsuit for that, yes."
1986.85-1140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2493.449,2499.52,An injury has to be something to him personally.
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2501.403,2503.088,"Yes, that's correct."
1986.85-1140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2503.088,2508.559,It has to be some medically identifiable problem that arises out of it.
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2508.559,2508.909,"Yes, Justice."
1986.85-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2521.35,2525.302,Medically identifiable but not physical necessarily.
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2525.302,2526.085,"--Pardon me, sir?"
1986.85-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2526.085,2530.371,"It has to be medically identifiable, not necessarily physical."
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2530.371,2531.355,"Yes, Justice."
1986.85-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2531.355,2535.173,You would say that just emotional disturbance would be enough.
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2535.173,2536.442,"Yes, I would."
1986.85-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2536.442,2538.125,If that is medically identifiable.
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2538.125,2549.917,"Yes, that it would be medically identifiable and under the general tort rules you could satisfy causation which is going to be a problem in emotional injury, but it is a problem also in back injuries, which are rather common under FELA."
1986.85-1140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2549.917,2555.904,Is this emotional business you are talking about words only?
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2555.904,2557.356,"Pardon me, Justice?"
1986.85-1140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2557.356,2558.622,Words only?
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2558.622,2561.558,"Yes, I would say that--"
1986.85-1140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2561.558,2563.593,That is enough to you?
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2563.593,2564.61,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-1140,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2566.628,2571.68,"To create an injury, like if he says, you are ugly, that could create an injury?"
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2571.68,2578.52,"--It is conceivable that that could do it, although one would think that usually it would take more than that and a consistent course of--"
1986.85-1140,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2578.52,2592.66,"Well, Mr. McCall, do you really think that Congress back in 1908 thought it was authorizing an FELA, a cause of action for that kind of thing or even for mental injury?"
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2600.349,2603.301,"--If so, I don't know it at this time, Your Honor."
1986.85-1140,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2608.669,2614.74,What it we think that FELA just doesn't cover emotional injuries?
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2614.74,2628.249,"--Then Mr. Buell certainly has a hard case to bring then because that would be... as a bottom line, emotional injury has to be compensable under the FELA and has to be recognized as an injury."
1986.85-1140,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2649.446,2663.589,"The indications, though, were that Congress had in mind physical injuries arising out of some kind of negligence on the part of the employer with regard to the equipment or working conditions, didn't it?"
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2665.624,2678.098,"--Oh, certainly that was the background, but I submit that this Court in Urie versus McDonald in 1949 took this direct issue on and gave to me what would be a guiding precedent for that case."
1986.85-1140,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2742.07,2749.974,"Mr. McCall, in light of what you have been saying recently, may we ignore the fact that your brief alleges physical injury?"
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2771.672,2772.672,Yes.
1986.85-1140,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2772.672,2773.572,May we ignore that?
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2773.572,2774.957,"No, Justice--"
1986.85-1140,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2774.957,2777.826,"Well, does the record prove what you say there?"
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2777.826,2779.076,--The record does contain--
1986.85-1140,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2779.076,2780.192,Where is it?
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2781.361,2787.182,--In Mr. Buell's deposition he talks of being pushed and shoved.
1986.85-1140,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2787.182,2789.165,Where do I find that deposition?
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2789.165,2790.884,It is--
1986.85-1140,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2790.884,2791.984,In the appendix?
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2791.984,2792.585,--Yes.
1986.85-1140,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2792.585,2794.618,Do you have the page by chance?
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2803.291,2808.111,"In the Court of Appeals record, which it was my understanding has been lodged."
1986.85-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2808.111,2812.063,"Mr. McCall, I asked you about that earlier."
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2824.454,2825.62,That is correct.
1986.85-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2825.62,2826.37,That is what I thought you responded.
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2826.37,2828.17,"That is correct, Justice Scalia."
1986.85-1140,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2838.761,2841.963,But we may ignore that for the purpose of deciding this case.
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2848.283,2850.318,"Yes, in essence, that is correct."
1986.85-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2856.889,2858.757,That is the physical injury you are complaining of.
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2858.757,2859.091,That's correct.
1986.85-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2859.091,2859.857,Not the pushing and shoving.
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2859.857,2861.459,"Right, there are no bruises or contusions."
1986.85-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2861.459,2867.613,That is an element of the emotional... it is one of the things that produced the emotional injury along with mocking the man and so forth.
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2867.613,2889.276,"Yes, and some courts have been more willing to grant relief for emotional distress or psychiatric injury when there has been accompanying physical harm because of a concern about was there really something happened or something that was really suffered by the plaintiff in Prosser and the other hornbooks."
1986.85-1140,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2907.004,2914.492,Was the burden on you or your opponent at the summary judgment motion stage in this case to produce this evidence?
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2914.492,2918.879,We submit it was on... it was not on us to produce the evidence.
1986.85-1140,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2919.712,2920.862,Did the railroad have that evidence?
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2920.862,2923.997,"--The railroad had taken the depositions, yes."
1986.85-1140,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2927.549,2929.9,The burden was on the railroad to prove that there was physical injury?
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2929.9,2931.019,No.
1986.85-1140,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2956.901,2960.203,"That is not the way I always saw summary judgment operate, but may I ask you another question?"
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2960.203,2960.92,--Certainly.
1986.85-1140,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2960.92,2965.774,Do the workmen's compensation laws of the states provide for purely emotional injury?
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2965.774,2971.494,"I have not researched that thoroughly, but it is my understanding that many do not."
1986.85-1140,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2971.494,2972.894,That would be my impression.
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2972.894,2974.196,California does not.
1986.85-1140,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2974.196,2981.7,"The FELA was enacted to provide, as I think you have indicated, special privileges for railway employees."
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,2987.17,2987.52,Yes.
1986.85-1140,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3025.045,3032.616,"There may be some state court tort action remedy that survives for outrageous conduct, don't you suppose?"
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,3032.616,3046.709,"There may be some for outrageous conduct but, Your Honor, I submit that the problem with relegating these kinds of injuries to state law would be a lack of uniformity in application to the railroads."
1986.85-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3156.147,3158.647,Just let me ask you a question before you sit down.
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,3182.714,3183.414,By and large.
1986.85-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3185.749,3187.666,But by and large it is intentional.
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,3187.666,3188.618,"Yes, by and large."
1986.85-1140,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3188.618,3190.284,And your cause of action here is based on negligence.
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,3190.284,3191.986,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1986.85-1140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3227.456,3241.633,Would you nave an FELA cause of action if you simply alleged that the foreman harassed this man and caused this injury and the railroad should be liable for the acts of its servants?
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,3241.633,3243.383,And there was an injury.
1986.85-1140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3244.166,3246.085,You wouldn't have to say negligence.
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,3262.379,3264.712,That would seem to me to be adequate.
1986.85-1140,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3272.235,3280.674,But is the FELA confined to negligent actions?
1986.85-1140,1,29806,james_r_mc_call,,3280.674,3283.043,I think the language of Section 51 does indicate that.
1986.85-1140,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3283.043,3286.078,"Thank you, Mr. McCall."
1986.85-1140,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3289.03,3291.846,"Just two brief points, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-1140,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3302.004,3305.623,"May I ask you on that point, Mr. Lee, about what happened in the trial court?"
1986.85-1140,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3320.482,3325.886,"I think that is probably a fair statement, Justice Stevens, but the point was, they did allege only emotional injury."
1986.85-1140,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3332.007,3339.629,"Why wouldn't you at that point, if that was that clear at that point, why wouldn't you then also have made your alternative argument that you are advancing in this Court seeking reversal?"
1986.85-1140,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3339.629,3344.598,"--Well, perhaps we should have done at that stage."
1986.85-1140,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3418.796,3425.735,When you exclude physical injury from this case you mean to exclude not merely the pushing and shoving but also the gastritis.
1986.85-1140,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3426.318,3434.055,"No, Justice Scalia, I am saying that the gastritis really doesn't count under the facts of this... that really isn't what he is talking about."
1986.85-1140,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3440.126,3461.991,"What you are seeking from this Court is a narrow holding that just says, assuming there wasn't any gastritis resulting, any physical injury resulting from this emotional state there is no cause of action under the FELA, and we will reserve for another day whether if this emotional injury had caused gastritis or some physical injury that would entitle the plaintiff to a cause of action."
1986.85-1140,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,3463.091,3463.991,That is my argument.
1986.85-1140,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3478.601,3480.284,"Thank you, Mr. Lee."
