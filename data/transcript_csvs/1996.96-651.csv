1996.96-651,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.378,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 96-651, James E. Gilbert v. Richard Homar."
1996.96-651,0,25774,gwendolyn_t_mosley,,11.888,16.904,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1996.96-651,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,116.787,116.947,So you would--
1996.96-651,0,25774,gwendolyn_t_mosley,,142.204,144.216,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.96-651,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,178.37,186.594,"Well, the problem, Ms. Mosley, is not apparently on whether the suspension can occur."
1996.96-651,0,25774,gwendolyn_t_mosley,,211.42,212.291,Yes.
1996.96-651,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,214.153,218.524,"And in this case, we've never had a determination on the facts."
1996.96-651,0,25774,gwendolyn_t_mosley,,229.111,230.152,--That's right.
1996.96-651,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,259.87,263.073,So you do not apply this to every State employee.
1996.96-651,0,25774,gwendolyn_t_mosley,,263.073,275.602,"With respect to the arrest on a felony charge, we're saying that the arrest, or that the suspension would be without pay, but we're suggesting--"
1996.96-651,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,275.602,279.744,"So it's with respect to all employees, or just police officers?"
1996.96-651,0,25774,gwendolyn_t_mosley,,279.744,281.717,--With all Commonwealth employees.
1996.96-651,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,281.717,285.448,"Well, is the suspension automatic?"
1996.96-651,0,25774,gwendolyn_t_mosley,,316.549,317.728,Correct.
1996.96-651,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,317.728,328.247,"And yet if I understand what the other side is saying, they're saying that really isn't the standard that they apply, that in fact it's... number 1, it's not consistently applied."
1996.96-651,0,25774,gwendolyn_t_mosley,,361.679,362.658,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.96-651,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,373.758,388.715,"And you apply the regulation to everybody, and so far as you know, are there any exceptions in the sense that the inquiry might have been more far-ranging, or there might have been a... an exercise of discretion on the part of the suspending authority?"
1996.96-651,0,25774,gwendolyn_t_mosley,,390.277,401.935,"--As far as I know, Your Honor, there is no discretion, and that this particular regulation is applied in every instance involving an arrest of a Commonwealth employee for a felony."
1996.96-651,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,401.935,402.516,All right.
1996.96-651,0,25774,gwendolyn_t_mosley,,403.614,410.851,"Well, the only issue then is, does the employee's charge or arrest fall within that regulation, and--"
1996.96-651,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,410.851,419.397,"All right, but if that is so, and that is the standard, why wasn't he simply reinstated when the charges were dropped?"
1996.96-651,0,25774,gwendolyn_t_mosley,,419.397,425.96,"--Your Honor, that particular issue simply doesn't appear to have been addressed."
1996.96-651,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,434.596,437.098,But neither was this regulation that you're relying on.
1996.96-651,0,25774,gwendolyn_t_mosley,,449.446,449.847,Yes.
1996.96-651,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,449.847,459.363,"--said that he used it not as a law but as a guide among other guides, so it doesn't sound like it follows like the night the day."
1996.96-651,0,25774,gwendolyn_t_mosley,,466.706,476.154,"Well, we understand that Mr. Levanowitz from his deposition testimony certainly should be understood as saying that that was one of the things that he considered."
1996.96-651,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,521.583,528.649,"Well, but you don't have a balance, because you began by telling us that this was a police officer and that that's important, and I can understand that."
1996.96-651,0,25774,gwendolyn_t_mosley,,528.649,529.04,--Right.
1996.96-651,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,529.04,531.101,But you say it applies across the board to all employees.
1996.96-651,0,25774,gwendolyn_t_mosley,,532.152,532.891,"Well, no."
1996.96-651,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,538.634,540.196,May I just make it clear?
1996.96-651,0,25774,gwendolyn_t_mosley,,556.066,571.226,"--What I'm suggesting, Your Honor, is that where there's an important interest, and there's some assurance that the reason for the action taken is not without basis, and there's a need for prompt action, then the court may, in those instances, suspend without--"
1996.96-651,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,571.226,572.958,You mean the State may.
1996.96-651,0,25774,gwendolyn_t_mosley,,572.958,575.8,--The State may suspend without pay.
1996.96-651,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,575.8,581.743,So then you're not arguing for the broad rule that I suggested at the outset of my question.
1996.96-651,0,25774,gwendolyn_t_mosley,,581.743,582.544,No.
1996.96-651,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,582.544,587.287,"You don't need to defend a rule across the board, I take it."
1996.96-651,0,25774,gwendolyn_t_mosley,,591.848,601.786,"It could be, because clearly the removal of a police officer on charges such as were involved here is a very important issue."
1996.96-651,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,642.402,647.886,"Well, if you're going to have a case-by-case rule for every employee, depending on who he or she is, you might as well have a hearing."
1996.96-651,0,25774,gwendolyn_t_mosley,,647.886,662.405,"Well, Your Honor, one of the reasons that we're suggesting that there would not have been a need, or there would be no value, is that it really does depend on what the purpose or the function of the action is."
1996.96-651,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,682.748,688.982,"What we want to... I mean, what we want to know is whether in this case there should have been a hearing or not."
1996.96-651,0,25774,gwendolyn_t_mosley,,688.982,689.493,Right.
1996.96-651,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,689.493,694.419,And let me suggest an argument to you and get your response to it.
1996.96-651,0,25774,gwendolyn_t_mosley,,773.92,790.629,"My response, Your Honor, is that there are no facts in the record, or there are no facts of which I am aware, that suggest this particular regulation does not apply in every instance when there's been an arrest of a Commonwealth employee and a charge of a felony."
1996.96-651,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,795.032,798.644,So you are going to defend it on the grounds that it does apply to everybody.
1996.96-651,0,25774,gwendolyn_t_mosley,,798.644,800.267,--It does apply to everyone.
1996.96-651,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,815.585,818.269,"Had there been no Governor's code, you would lose."
1996.96-651,0,25774,gwendolyn_t_mosley,,825.512,826.654,"No, we're not, Your Honor."
1996.96-651,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,848.577,850.63,Then what use is the Government code?
1996.96-651,0,25774,gwendolyn_t_mosley,,871.822,877.886,"No, I don't think that I'm conceding that in some cases it could be unconstitutional."
1996.96-651,1,16136,ann_hubbard,,1229.717,1239.743,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-651,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1281.541,1289.246,"I take it, then, the rule you're going to submit to us is that it depends on the nature of the employee and the work that the employee does."
1996.96-651,1,16136,ann_hubbard,,1289.246,1296.361,"Under Mallen and Barchi, and as well under Mathews, you have to identify the government interest in prompt action."
1996.96-651,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1296.361,1306.978,So does the government... the government does not have an interest in suspending any employee who's been arrested and charged with a felony without a hearing and suspending without pay?
1996.96-651,1,16136,ann_hubbard,,1306.978,1313.542,We think it's an easier case to say that you could do it with a law enforcement officer.
1996.96-651,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1313.542,1315.153,I know that.
1996.96-651,1,16136,ann_hubbard,,1317.486,1319.987,It's unclear.
1996.96-651,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1323.178,1331.103,"And is there a difference between the suspension of duty, performance of duty and the deprivation of pay?"
1996.96-651,1,16136,ann_hubbard,,1331.103,1333.183,Generally--
1996.96-651,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1333.183,1335.585,Might there be a different balance between the two?
1996.96-651,1,16136,ann_hubbard,,1335.585,1337.778,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1996.96-651,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1351.086,1355.451,Why does the government have to give somebody a paid vacation if they've been charged with a felony?
1996.96-651,1,16136,ann_hubbard,,1355.451,1365.384,--It doesn't if it can satisfy the Mallen and Barchi test that it had a compelling interest or adequate interest to suspend them.
1996.96-651,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1365.384,1371.16,"How does the government show this compelling interest, other than if it's not a policeman, if it's a groundskeeper?"
1996.96-651,1,16136,ann_hubbard,,1371.16,1374.821,I think it would be harder with a groundskeeper.
1996.96-651,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1382.177,1383.557,That was a private individual.
1996.96-651,1,16136,ann_hubbard,,1411.406,1413.257,"It may well be, Justice Scalia."
1996.96-651,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1417.6,1422.173,"Of course, if you continue paying the charged felon, can the government get the money back?"
1996.96-651,1,16136,ann_hubbard,,1439.713,1444.348,"--Justice Scalia, you have identified one of the primary problems with the Third Circuit rule."
1996.96-651,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1463.539,1489.415,"One of the benefits of the Third Circuit's rule, and one of the benefits of the contrary rule... either you can suspend without pay, or... is that it avoids all the kind of building castles in the air and factual analyses that you don't know when the supervisor first confronts a situation... if he has to go through some Mathews balancing test every time, it's not very workable in the real world."
1996.96-651,1,16136,ann_hubbard,,1489.415,1507.889,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and we believe that where there's any doubt about which way the balance would tip, the prudent employer can protect itself by suspending the person with pay for the time necessary to decide whether or not further action is warranted."
1996.96-651,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1507.889,1508.75,By suspending the person with pay.
1996.96-651,1,16136,ann_hubbard,,1519.926,1521.767,"No, Justice Kennedy."
1996.96-651,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1547.085,1555.08,"Well, if you can't tell us whether the cases are easy or hard, how is the employee's supervisor to do it?"
1996.96-651,1,16136,ann_hubbard,,1556.702,1564.615,"We think there... it is the nature of a balancing test that there will be hard cases, and--"
1996.96-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1564.615,1566.526,--May I just interrupt... I don't mean to interrupt you.
1996.96-651,1,16136,ann_hubbard,,1594.175,1596.717,"--That's very often the case, Justice Stevens."
1996.96-651,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1603.411,1606.102,So we're not talking about indefinite pay.
1996.96-651,1,16136,ann_hubbard,,1613.236,1636.864,"That's absolutely correct, but we do believe that if this is a Mallen Barchi case and the government was justified in suspending him without a hearing, even during that period between the suspension and the hearing, if the suspension was lawful in that he was given all the process he was due, the employer is not constitutionally required to pay him."
1996.96-651,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1643.816,1672.385,"Ms. Hubbard, you went through a lot of ifs, and I... following up Justice Stevens' question, if the employee is arguing all I want is a chance to tell my side of the story, all that's involved... all that's at stake for the government is a couple of days, at most, of my pay, why doesn't any balance work in favor of the employee?"
1996.96-651,1,16136,ann_hubbard,,1684.954,1692.459,"It might well, but in the balance that you're proposing, you're positing 1 or 2 days' pay."
1996.96-651,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1699.443,1706.048,"But if you say the only process that's due is a chance to tell his side of the story, period, no full evidentiary hearing."
1996.96-651,1,16136,ann_hubbard,,1707.11,1722.788,"Right, but there may be government justifications for having to postpone even a Loudermillstyle hearing for a week or two, and we're just saying that the Court needs to use its framework for balancing those questions."
1996.96-651,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1722.788,1725.389,Have you come across anywhere... I'd be quite curious.
1996.96-651,1,16136,ann_hubbard,,1739.999,1741.05,From the Federal Government's perspective--
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,1852.985,1856.638,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-651,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1886.228,1892.492,"Well, maybe we should leave that issue for the circuit or the district court on remand."
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,1933.87,1940.532,"If pay is not to be continued, yes, Your Honor, because that would be an issue, as to whether or not the individual can continue to receive his pay."
1996.96-651,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1940.532,1958.233,"Well, but the issue would turn solely on the question whether there had been an arrest or a charge, and is that the kind of issue upon which there is a sufficient risk of error to require the pre-termination, the pre-suspension hearing?"
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,1970.151,1980.149,"I would concede that if the Governor's code of conduct is in the case and it is supportable and it is constitutional, then I would agree with you, Justice Souter, on that point."
1996.96-651,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2030.132,2038.146,"Well, I suppose how significant that interest is would depend certainly upon, you know, how many other funds the individual has."
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2048.362,2050.194,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.96-651,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2050.583,2052.695,Do we know how much money he had in the bank?
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2056.107,2063.393,"--I don't think so, Your Honor, because a wage earner, I think you can make certain presumptions about somebody who is earning a wage."
1996.96-651,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2064.804,2066.216,He doesn't have any money in the bank?
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2066.216,2069.368,--I don't know whether he had--
1996.96-651,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2069.368,2071.428,"No, I mean, is that the presumption you can make?"
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2071.728,2072.65,--I think the presumption--
1996.96-651,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2072.65,2077.943,"--I know a significant number of wage earners who could, you know, support themselves for quite a while."
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2077.943,2087.949,"--I think in one of the amicus briefs, Your Honor, there's a study that indicates that approximately a third of all wage earners in this country now live essentially from paycheck to paycheck."
1996.96-651,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2087.949,2115.146,"Well, isn't there something to be said for a rule that's more or less automatic, rather than requiring the supervisor to sit down in each case and read a study like this that says a third of these people... and trying to figure out whether this employee was in that third or not, for either saying that with respect to a police officer you can suspend upon arrest without pay or perhaps, as the Third Circuit says, you can't suspend."
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2120.599,2123.122,"Mr. Chief Justice, I couldn't agree with you more."
1996.96-651,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2135.161,2150.489,"Mr. Fareri, the... that rule, the automatic rule that there must be some opportunity to tell his side of the story, it isn't entirely clear to me what is entailed, how much it costs the State."
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2193.469,2200.432,"I think what you're describing, Justice Ginsburg, is a Loudermill-type process, and we are not arguing that the employee is entitled to anything more than that."
1996.96-651,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2214.423,2218.353,"No, but I thought the question was not whether he's innocent, but whether he's been charged."
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2233.975,2238.667,Given... if you take the Court's premise that that rule is valid--
1996.96-651,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2238.667,2239.308,Right.
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2239.308,2239.969,--Then--
1996.96-651,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2239.969,2240.84,Then you wouldn't need a hearing.
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2240.84,2241.671,--Then you wouldn't need a hearing.
1996.96-651,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2241.671,2249.645,So you are arguing it is invalid to have a blanket rule that if you're a State employee charged with a felony you will be suspended.
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2250.644,2255.519,"I think that's invalid, and additionally I don't think that's applicable in this case, for the reasons I indicated previously."
1996.96-651,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2255.519,2267.768,"Well, that's a seperate question, for which we might have to remand, but assuming that that is the State rule, you say you're suspended without pay when you're charged with a felony, that rule would be unconstitutional."
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2267.768,2269.468,"That's my position, yes."
1996.96-651,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2269.468,2296.145,"Well, Mr. Fareri, you do acknowledge, do you, that the State can have a blanket rule for law enforcement officers, that if the law enforcement officer himself or herself is arrested for or charged with a felony, that the duties of that officer can be immediately suspended subject to a prompt post suspension hearing."
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2298.175,2299.337,"I would agree with that, Your Honor."
1996.96-651,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2299.337,2300.657,Just the duties.
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2306.323,2307.493,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.96-651,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2307.493,2308.895,Subject to a prompt post--
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2308.895,2309.753,Absolutely correct.
1996.96-651,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2309.753,2311.216,--I thought you gave me a different answer.
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2337.522,2343.947,"I think, Justice Souter, that my answer was given assuming that that rule was valid--"
1996.96-651,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2343.947,2344.357,Right.
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2344.357,2346.929,--That if you're arrested then you would be suspended.
1996.96-651,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2346.929,2347.32,Okay.
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2352.883,2353.504,I believe so.
1996.96-651,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2353.504,2366.23,"--I believe you said that it would be unconstitutional, that that would be the rule, but in response to Justice Souter's question as well I suppose you'd have to say, no, it's not enough."
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2369.573,2370.734,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1996.96-651,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2370.734,2376.799,"Did you ever charge, or did your side ever charge in this case that the rule was substantively unconstitutional?"
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2376.799,2380.829,"Well, we didn't, Your Honor, because the rule was never raised until I'm standing here right now."
1996.96-651,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2380.829,2381.27,I see.
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2382.171,2386.684,"The rule has not been raised in any past pleadings, in any past briefs."
1996.96-651,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2389.396,2392.668,"--Well, how about your brief, your red brief in this Court?"
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2400.564,2412.041,"We didn't, Mr. Chief Justice, the reason being, again, we feel strongly that the rule is not in the case, because the personnel director himself testified that he did not rely on the rule."
1996.96-651,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2445.341,2448.614,He did eventually get pay.
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2458.38,2459.803,"The union was involved, Your Honor."
1996.96-651,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2459.803,2470.199,"Is this a bargainable subject, the... what will happen to an employee when there's a charge of misconduct?"
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2470.199,2477.275,"There's... the collective bargaining agreement is not in the record, but I can tell the Court that that does provide for a grievance process."
1996.96-651,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2477.275,2481.326,Can I go back to the... what I think is your main argument?
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2496.516,2497.257,"Yes, Your Honor."
1996.96-651,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2497.257,2497.727,Okay.
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2563.709,2564.36,The--
1996.96-651,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2564.36,2569.284,"And if you say, oh, just don't pay them, they laugh at that and say, what do you mean?"
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2643.133,2657.84,"--I would say yes, Justice Ginsburg, because I think there are some employees who probably aren't sophisticated enough to ask for one, and I think because the governmental employer is in the position of running the workforce, that that should be their obligation to provide one."
1996.96-651,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2657.84,2659.332,"And that was this case, wasn't it?"
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2665.246,2669.009,"That's correct, and that exemplifies what I'm saying."
1996.96-651,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2680.136,2681.617,Could I follow up my question with--
1996.96-651,2,30197,james_v_fareri,,2741.315,2745.959,On whether or not the post suspension process would satisfy in lieu of--
1996.96-651,3,25857,gregory_oduden,,3075.51,3093.932,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-651,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3158.915,3159.356,No.
1996.96-651,3,25857,gregory_oduden,,3164.298,3172.533,"--The Federal budget isn't doing well, Your Honor, but I can assure you it's not because people are being given Loudermill-type hearings, and I think it's also important--"
1996.96-651,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3172.533,3174.375,"A million dollars here, a million dollars there--"
1996.96-651,3,25857,gregory_oduden,,3174.375,3181.117,"--No, I don't think it translates into that at all, and I think there's one other important thing to be kept in mind here."
1996.96-651,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3208.347,3216.23,"--If it is in fact in the government's best interest to do that, presumably the government will do that without being told that the Constitution requires it."
1996.96-651,3,25857,gregory_oduden,,3216.23,3219.763,"Well, I wish the world were that simple, Your Honor."
1996.96-651,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3239.876,3248.244,"It's not a... I don't think it's a good constitutional argument to say this is really not only in the employee's best interest but in the employer's best interest, too."
1996.96-651,3,25857,gregory_oduden,,3248.244,3248.792,"Well, Your Honor--"
1996.96-651,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3248.792,3251.775,The employer presumably can look out for his own best interest.
1996.96-651,3,25857,gregory_oduden,,3251.775,3268.246,"--The reason that we're talking about the employer's interest at all is, of course, we're faced with having to deal with the Mathews test, and therefore we're having to respond to the government's assertion that their interests are somehow compromised by giving somebody a pre-deprivation hearing."
1996.96-651,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3276.961,3283.467,"Well, what... let's keep in mind what the suspended person here would argue at the hearing."
1996.96-651,3,25857,gregory_oduden,,3285.156,3289.56,"In this situation, I'm putting aside the issue--"
