1975.73-6935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,19.226,We will hear arguments first this morning in Youakim against Miller.
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,25.144,28.571,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please this honorable Court.
1975.73-6935,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,85.721,89.606,Is that program instruction outline with the existing regulations?
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,89.606,94.742,"That program instruction is consistent with the existing regulations, Mr. Justice, in the plaintiffs’ view."
1975.73-6935,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,94.742,96.12,Is it consistent with it?
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,96.12,97.808,It is consistent with it.
1975.73-6935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,152.872,167.082,I have read somewhere perhaps along these papers that the HEW has since amended or revised the applicable and pertinent regulations since this case was filed in?
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,167.082,170.134,"It is not contained in the regulations, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1975.73-6935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,190.944,194.355,Is that revision pertinent to the issue we have?
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,194.355,196.512,"I think it is not a revision, Your Honor."
1975.73-6935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,196.512,197.381,I see.
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,197.381,214.704,"I think that it is a revision of HEW’s of one position that have been previously taken by one regional administrator by HEW, but prior to this very clear program instruction, I think that the Washington Legal Department of HEW had not rendered a specific opinion on this."
1975.73-6935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,232.293,233.151,What is your position?
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,233.151,235.694,"It does, indeed, Your Honor."
1975.73-6935,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,235.694,240.208,"As I read the District Court’s opinion, they did not pass on any statutory question."
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,249.844,258.241,"I think the District Court, the Three-Judge District Court entertained the statutory contention to the following extent."
1975.73-6935,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,277.992,293.251,Where do you find that in the District Court opinion?
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,304.864,305.748,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.73-6935,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,319.65,335.386,"If you take from page 55 of the appendix, where the District Court has this -- its opinion ahead at the merits to page 60, they simply concluded at the end “The Illinois scheme does not deny plaintiffs equal protection of the law."
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,345.396,360.333,"I would candidly admit to Your Honor that the issue of whether or not the Illinois scheme violates the Social Security Act or is in inconsistent with the Social Security Act was much more fully briefed in the appeal, and that is the case for several reasons."
1975.73-6935,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,372.434,378.285,Did you -- did you allege in the complaint that there was a conflict between the federal statute and the state?
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,378.285,411.258,"We alleged that it violated the purposes of the Federal Act and it violated the purposes of the state law which must be consistent with the federal law, because in order to participate in the categorical assistance programs under Title V, the purposes of the state law must be consistent with the purposes of the federal law, and the overriding purpose which the plaintiffs allege is violated is that the law must be administered and executed in order to maintain and strengthen families, and the Illinois foster care payment scheme, as it is now written, creates an economic disincentive to that."
1975.73-6935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,417.334,440.237,"Tell me, Mr. Kennan, in light of our colloquy earlier on this clarification as you term it, if you did raise the issue of inconsistency with the federal statute rather than reach the constitutional question, why would we not remand this for reconsideration in light of the clarification?"
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,440.237,447.962,"I think it more appropriate, Your Honor, that this Court retain its jurisdiction and decide the issue on the merits."
1975.73-6935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,447.962,448.99,The constitutional issue?
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,448.99,459.692,"No, whatever issue this Court decides of course, but this Court traditionally entertains the statutory interpretation issue and seeks grounds for decision other than the constitutional one."
1975.73-6935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,459.692,461.824,Provided the statutory issue is before us?
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,461.824,488.569,"Provided the statutory issue is before you and I think it is sufficiently raised by the allegation in the complaint; first, that the Illinois foster care payment scheme violates the purpose of the federal law and second, by the language in the District Court opinion which would specifically -- which I would call a finding to the effect that the Illinois foster care payment scheme does not -- is not inconsistent with the federal law, but it rather parallels it."
1975.73-6935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,491.841,499.042,"This clarification, if that is the right word it, was issued two years after you law suit started, was it not?"
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,499.042,500.368,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.73-6935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,500.368,508.574,"And on page 28, about eight line form the bottom -- beginning about nine lines from the bottom, what does that language mean?"
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,519.855,526.128,"The plaintiffs believe it is, Your Honor, and I think that it is clear that the position of the Department of HEW thinks that it is."
1975.73-6935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,526.128,538.25,"If we sent the case back, would that not dispose of it, if we remanded the case along the lines that Mr. Justice Brennan had just hypothesized to you?"
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,538.25,540.305,I would urge that this Court should not.
1975.73-6935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,540.305,545.745,"Well, do we decide matters that are not necessary for decision up here?"
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,545.745,573.05,"I believe this matter is necessary for decision, Mr. Chief Justice because the only method the Department of Health, Education and Welfare has to enforce what it regards to -- what is absent in the opinion by this Court, merely an opinion by counsel which will obviously be disagreed with by the Attorney Generals of the states which have the scheme similar to Illinois, the only method that HEW has of enforcing this is conducting a compliance hearing."
1975.73-6935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,636.227,650.777,"But if it were remanded for reconsideration in the light of this with new directive, might that not have something to do with their view of the matter?"
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,650.777,667.042,"It might indeed, Your Honor, but I respectfully submit that question is not before the Court and that the purposes of, first of all, efficiency in national administration and the speedy justice would be much better served if this Court were to retain its jurisdiction and to decide the case on the merits."
1975.73-6935,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,721.169,768.742,"Mr. Keenan, in your prayer for relief on page 16 of the appendix, consisting of a number of paragraphs A, B, C, D, E, and F, looking at paragraph E, you asked that the Three-Judge Court enter a final judgment permanently enjoin the state director, agents, etcetera acting in concert from enforcing, applying, or executing Illinois revised statutes and Illinois family serve as placement management as written because said statutes and regulations violate equal protection of the law as guaranteed by plaintiffs by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States."
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,778.688,779.564,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.73-6935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,929.673,931.715,(Inaudible)
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,931.715,943.96,"They do not do it, Your Honor because of the scheme which precludes licensing of relatives and in the placement worker’s mind that prevention of licensing means that they simply do not look first to the relatives."
1975.73-6935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,980.985,997.947,"Is it not conventional for a state to proceed on the assumption that the kin folk, if we may call them that, have a greater obligation to take care of their relatives than strangers?"
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,997.947,1004.965,The plaintiffs respectfully urge that what is illegal cannot be rational in terms of equal protection jurisprudence.
1975.73-6935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1004.965,1007.758,"Well, that does not answer the question."
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,1007.758,1014.837,I think it would not be rational because it would be -- because such a position on the part of the State of Illinois would be based on a mistake of law.
1975.73-6935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1015.322,1029.481,"Has it not been a tradition, going back not just to the history of this country, but to all civilized people that people take care of their own?"
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,1029.481,1031.398,"It is of course a tradition, Your Honor."
1975.73-6935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1031.398,1039.946,"Well, that tradition as you say, cannot form a rational basis for a legislative action?"
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,1039.946,1055.612,"That tradition cannot form a rational basis for legislative action in the United States in 1970, Your Honor, particularly when the Illinois legislature has stated that the only persons who are responsible for the care of children are the natural and adoptive parents."
1975.73-6935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1126.483,1150.121,"When they not go into the home of a person who is related, there are no standards or I will put that as a question, are there any standards by which the environment can be measured by the state as distinguished from going into the home of a licensed foster parent?"
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,1150.121,1159.531,The standards which are imposed upon the plaintiff-related foster parents are identical to the standards imposed upon all other foster homes.
1975.73-6935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1233.374,1241.383,Were you aware of this program instruction when the case was in the District Court?
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,1241.383,1246.15,"The program instruction was issued after the District Court’s opinion was written, Your Honor."
1975.73-6935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1250.327,1253.278,January of 1974?
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,1253.278,1257.398,"-- January or February of 1974, Your Honor, and the program instruction was issued in October."
1975.73-6935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1257.398,1262.693,In October and then you took your notice of appeal?
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,1262.693,1268.908,In April of 1974 so the record was closed and the case was pending before this Court at the time the program instruction issued.
1975.73-6935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1295.159,1313.806,"Well, may I suggest though Mr. Keenan, the solicitor filed in response to our invitation his memorandum on February 18th, that is four or five months after the promulgation of the instruction and I do not find any reference to the instruction when he filed and he has not filed a brief on the merits."
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,1321.566,1323.051,"Yes, Your Honor."
1975.73-6935,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1329.198,1334.908,"Why do you suggest there is no reference to the instruction, but the solicitor did file in February?"
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,1334.908,1336.737,"Mr. Justice Brennan, I did not write the brief for them."
1975.73-6935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1341.207,1351.33,"I take it, from what you say, you certainly would not object from a decision on your behalf based on a statutory ground whether these decision issues in the District Court are here?"
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,1351.33,1352.121,"I would not, Your Honor."
1975.73-6935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1352.798,1354.657,You would just like to get it over with?
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,1354.657,1364.955,I certainly would and certainly a decision from this Court would have a much quicker effect on giving national uniform execution of Title V.
1975.73-6935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1364.955,1375.684,"But do you not agree now that the statutory ground has emerged clearly and you insist that it is in the case, do you not agree that that has to be reached first?"
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,1375.684,1385.655,"I do, Your Honor and I am respectfully urging that this Court reach that ground first and it properly decides this case as it did in the Townsend case, as it has decided a series of other social security cases."
1975.73-6935,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1385.655,1393.891,What if the statutory ground had been reached in the District Court at first and it had been decided in your favor?
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,1395.743,1399.652,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.73-6935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1404.232,1405.125,Very well.
1975.73-6935,0,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,1405.125,1409.305,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1975.73-6935,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1409.305,1411.978,Mr. Bargiel?
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1411.978,1416.435,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.73-6935,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1490.456,1493.214,Is that not what the District Court decided?
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1493.214,1514.367,"Your Honor, the District Court decided that there was no denial of equal protection and it made the determination that the Illinois welfare scheme rather than running contrary to the federal statute is parallel to the federal statute."
1975.73-6935,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1514.367,1517.341,You did not present this argument to the District Court?
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1517.341,1528.745,"We presented the argument that the -- we took the position that the Illinois welfare scheme, to the extent that it was presented, we took the position that the Illinois welfare scheme was consistent with the federal statute."
1975.73-6935,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1528.745,1534.309,"I understand that, but did you make this argument that you are making now to the District Court?"
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1534.309,1539.428,"Well, I did not make the argument to the District Court."
1975.73-6935,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1541.613,1549.897,"But this argument takes you farther than the District Court took you, would it not?"
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1549.897,1550.386,That is true.
1975.73-6935,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1551.898,1562.654,"Yes, but the state would be getting more relief if we decided in your favor on this ground than you got in the District Court?"
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1562.654,1595.343,"I suppose that it is conceivable in that the Federal District Court only decided the equal protection question, but I think it is certainly implied that the Federal District Court would have, had it considered or had it made specific findings with regard to the question of the consistency of the Illinois welfare scheme to the federal scheme would have found that in fact they impliedly found that there was no inconsistency."
1975.73-6935,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1595.343,1607.346,"It did reach the constitutional question what must have been at least a premise that the construction is contrary to the one you urge, they reached the equal protection argument?"
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1607.346,1620.85,"No, I would assume, Your Honor, that the District Court, had it considered the statutory construction question, would have had to determine the statutory construction in our favor and that is that there was no difference between the two if they were to reach the --"
1975.73-6935,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1620.85,1625.045,Is the construction you urge consistent with this so-called clarification?
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1627.298,1628.855,"No, I think that is quite clear."
1975.73-6935,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1641.166,1642.973,Are you going to follow this or not?
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1642.973,1645.087,"Are we going to follow what, Your Honor, the new program instruction?"
1975.73-6935,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1645.087,1647.057,Yes.
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1649.777,1651.66,"To my knowledge, no steps have been taken at this particular --"
1975.73-6935,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1651.66,1655.172,"Well, what did you do, just ignored it?"
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1655.172,1655.641,I do not know.
1975.73-6935,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1673.629,1675.354,Erroneous as to the statute --
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1675.354,1676.13,That is correct.
1975.73-6935,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1676.13,1680.308,"-- that is the one your urge and if you are right, then Illinois does not have to follow the instruction?"
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1680.308,1682.808,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1975.73-6935,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1687.069,1710.417,"And if you are right then, as my brother White has suggested, you get more than is accorded to you by the District Court because there is nothing n the District Court opinion that says that it would be improper or unconstitutional for Illinois to pay related foster parents the same as unrelated foster parents are paid."
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1725.119,1726.272,That is precisely correct.
1975.73-6935,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1726.272,1733.68,"Or at least you say under the Social Security Act, the state does not have to pay them anything to related foster parents?"
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1733.68,1734.633,"No, that is not our position."
1975.73-6935,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1735.161,1736.173,That is what I --
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1736.173,1743.282,"Our position, Your Honor, is that related persons, under the Social Security Act, are not foster parents."
1975.73-6935,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1746.576,1748.257,"So, they are not foster parents?"
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1748.257,1749.651,That is precisely correct.
1975.73-6935,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1750.324,1753.431,They are not parents for the purposes of AFDC?
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1753.431,1756.536,They are relatives for purposes of AFDC and eligible under Section 608.
1975.73-6935,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1756.536,1758.115,But not as foster parents.
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1758.115,1767.916,"Right, but not as foster parents. Our position is not that we do not have to pay them anything, but that they are not eligible for categorical assistance under Section 608."
1975.73-6935,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1789.161,1797.733,"This does not show any evidence of that and perhaps in response to what my brother Rehnquist has pointed out, the complaint really does not make a statutory claim?"
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1797.733,1800.07,"I, in all candor have to agree with that."
1975.73-6935,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1878.212,1878.708,Where are you?
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1879.166,1879.836,I am sorry.
1975.73-6935,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1902.378,1905.427,I am looking forward to finish this discussion.
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1917.769,1933.291,"That is very definitely true and I certainly do not mean to be disrespectful in urging that that particular program instruction is erroneous, but it is also --"
1975.73-6935,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1933.291,1936.245,What are the principles which entitle us to ignore it?
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1936.245,1949.412,"Well, I think, first, this Court has -- this Court has on occasion, certainly more than once come to the conclusion that an HEW interpretation of a statute was erroneous."
1975.73-6935,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2122.012,2122.701,A11?
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,2122.701,2125.566,"F, it is on A11 and F, Your Honor."
1975.73-6935,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2125.566,2125.907,F.
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,2125.907,2127.659,I am reading from F.
1975.73-6935,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2290.468,2302.018,"What would happen in case and I gather all these children were sent to relatives because the conditions at the foster home were not what was desired, is that right?"
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,2302.018,2304.924,I do not know if there is any generalization which can be drawn.
1975.73-6935,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2304.924,2308.357,"Whatever the reason was, they were in foster homes, non-related, were they not?"
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,2308.357,2309.189,Right.
1975.73-6935,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2309.189,2311.195,And they then went to the homes of relatives.
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,2311.195,2313.518,"Yes, I do not think we can assume from that, Your Honor --"
1975.73-6935,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2313.518,2321.651,"Well, whatever the reason may be, now suppose the relatives say “well, we simply cannot afford without this help to keep them,” now what happens to the children?"
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,2323.311,2328.069,"No, there are two things that can happen, Your Honor."
1975.73-6935,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2369.843,2370.763,(Inaudible)
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,2370.763,2379.447,"Well, these plaintiffs in this particular case, as a matter of fact, they are receiving $105 payment."
1975.73-6935,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2391.145,2393.161,They are now getting -- these are the named plaintiffs?
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,2393.161,2394.648,"Yes, that is correct."
1975.73-6935,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2395.136,2397.32,They are getting the foster home payment?
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,2397.32,2398.989,They are not getting the foster home payment.
1975.73-6935,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2401.237,2403.92,How does that compare to the foster home payment?
1975.73-6935,1,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,2403.92,2407.254,It is the same thing as they are not -- Pardon?
1975.73-6935,2,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,3212.626,3213.789,Thank you.
1975.73-6935,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3348.502,3356.175,You concede that he certainly has to be removed from the home of a relative on the grounds that -- and be made a foster child?
1975.73-6935,2,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,3356.175,3358.49,"Absolutely, Your Honor, absolutely."
1975.73-6935,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3358.49,3365.423,And the Social Security Act nor you can force that to be done except for a good cause?
1975.73-6935,2,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,3365.423,3374.503,"Only at the discretion of the State’s Attorney in Illinois and on the judgment of the Juvenile Court Judge, and the suggestion that foster care payments could go down, the plaintiffs simply do not understand."
1975.73-6935,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3406.025,3413.671,"Could I ask you before you are through, where the order certifying that class action is to be found, is it in --?"
1975.73-6935,2,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,3413.671,3417.041,"Yes, Your Honor, it is at page 54 of the appendix which is the --"
1975.73-6935,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3417.041,3423.674,"Okay, and there are members of that class still around even though the named plaintiffs may not have --?"
1975.73-6935,2,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,3423.674,3425.146,"Yes, indeed, there are, Your Honor."
1975.73-6935,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3429.36,3430.611,Between the named plaintiffs and the state?
1975.73-6935,2,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,3430.611,3431.192,Absolutely.
1975.73-6935,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3431.192,3431.782,Still?
1975.73-6935,2,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,3431.782,3437.167,"Still, because the exception to policy payments are discretionary and can be withdrawn at any time."
1975.73-6935,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3445.547,3448.069,You suggest that if the state won it might terminate the stay?
1975.73-6935,2,38038,patrick_a_keenan,,3448.069,3455.443,"It could tomorrow, yes."
1975.73-6935,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3510.282,3510.89,"Thank you, Gentlemen."
