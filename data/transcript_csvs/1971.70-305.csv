1971.70-305,0,21899,ernest_j_brown,,478.275,479.521,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-305,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,496.825,499.463,And the commission approximates 50% of all the premiums over the period?
1971.70-305,0,21899,ernest_j_brown,,499.463,504.642,"50% of the premium, yes."
1971.70-305,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,809.277,812.966,"Mr. Brown, could I just ask one detail."
1971.70-305,0,21899,ernest_j_brown,,812.966,814.003,Certainly Your Honor.
1971.70-305,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,814.003,821.553,What was the difference in tax rate by the inclusion of those premiums in the Management Company's returns as distinguished from the insurance company?
1971.70-305,0,21899,ernest_j_brown,,822.516,825.514,"Well, there was no insurance company at that time Your Honor."
1971.70-305,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,832.035,837.612,"But in any event it was reported by the Management Company at then corporate rates, I take it."
1971.70-305,0,21899,ernest_j_brown,,840.034,843.412,"Your Honor, these were all the same rates."
1971.70-305,1,40945,stephen_h_anderson,,1792.943,1798.292,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-305,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1953.186,1963.403,"Mr. Anderson, this -- in these remarks you have made, are you attacking the implementation of Section 484 or the Section itself?"
1971.70-305,1,40945,stephen_h_anderson,,1963.403,1965.104,The implementation.
1971.70-305,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1965.104,1970.835,You are not questioning the integrity of it as a tool in the tax structure?
1971.70-305,1,40945,stephen_h_anderson,,1970.835,1978.038,No Your Honor.
1971.70-305,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1979.191,1999.931,"But what would be position if an officer of the bank had received or had embezzled income and instead of keeping it himself had placed it in the bank, would -- and the bank in some way will be responsible for it."
1971.70-305,1,40945,stephen_h_anderson,,2004.148,2005.767,You say the employee embezzled the income?
1971.70-305,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2005.767,2006.663,Yes.
1971.70-305,1,40945,stephen_h_anderson,,2006.663,2007.105,No.
1971.70-305,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2027.6,2031.51,"Well, the distinction you draw then is only in the fact of receipt --"
1971.70-305,1,40945,stephen_h_anderson,,2031.51,2031.776,That is correct.
1971.70-305,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2031.776,2034.737,-- not the illegality?
1971.70-305,1,40945,stephen_h_anderson,,2034.737,2037.218,"Well, it is correct."
1971.70-305,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2097.739,2099.655,Well then at that point let me ask you this?
1971.70-305,1,40945,stephen_h_anderson,,2099.655,2099.791,Yes.
1971.70-305,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2099.791,2107.064,"If you should lose by chance on this argument, are you also attacking the allocation itself, percentage wise?"
1971.70-305,1,40945,stephen_h_anderson,,2107.064,2108.331,"We surely are, Your Honor."
1971.70-305,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2108.331,2109.734,Alright.
1971.70-305,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2109.734,2124.376,"Now what was the relationship between the $2,000.00 figure you have just mentioned and whatever percentage override was charged by the bank for handling the service charge, how much do that amount to?"
1971.70-305,1,40945,stephen_h_anderson,,2124.376,2128.049,"Your Honor, that is one of the main points of our case."
1971.70-305,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2151.199,2157.729,"Well, was there not some service charge that the bank received just before the paperwork?"
1971.70-305,1,40945,stephen_h_anderson,,2157.729,2159.193,"No, Your Honor."
1971.70-305,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2161.773,2165.773,What was the 11 or 11.5% figure that --
1971.70-305,1,40945,stephen_h_anderson,,2165.773,2175.438,"That was the amount that was charged by American National Insurance Company for servicing the insurance for -- well, if I can the diagram this way."
1971.70-305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2219.402,2238.834,"I have -- except to the fact that Security Life was a Sister Corporation, I suppose that Security Life would have had to pay out to somebody a commission?"
1971.70-305,1,40945,stephen_h_anderson,,2238.834,2242.04,"That is another main point of our case, no."
1971.70-305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2293.367,2311.076,"Well, that may be so but a family corporation (Inaudible) insurance independently, make sure that there was somebody in this family that would take commission, the Smith agents which then gave it to the Management Company?"
1971.70-305,1,40945,stephen_h_anderson,,2311.076,2311.632,Yes.
1971.70-305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2312.756,2322.356,"What about the return of 40% or 50% of the premium to the life insurance company, when somebody in their family collects it?"
1971.70-305,1,40945,stephen_h_anderson,,2322.356,2323.633,That is the key phrase.
1971.70-305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2329.205,2335.389,Why did the -- how did the Smith Agency handed the money over to the Management Company (Inaudible)
1971.70-305,1,40945,stephen_h_anderson,,2335.389,2344.395,"In the original years, 1948 to 1954, the testimony is on the record that the income was so small that it virtually passed notes."
1971.70-305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2457.54,2459.588,"(Voice Overlap) it wasn't possible, I am not stating that there is anything wrong with it."
1971.70-305,1,40945,stephen_h_anderson,,2476.922,2478.169,By all means?
1971.70-305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2478.169,2486.378,Was it possible (Inaudible) and without doing that it would have retained 40% (Inaudible)
1971.70-305,1,40945,stephen_h_anderson,,2486.378,2488.319,Yes sir.
1971.70-305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2488.319,2499.976,And had the tax law have ever entered to a tax insurance company on this premium?
1971.70-305,1,40945,stephen_h_anderson,,2499.976,2500.785,It has Your Honor.
1971.70-305,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2581.652,2582.244,Yes.
1971.70-305,1,40945,stephen_h_anderson,,2582.784,2583.419,Yes Your Honor?
1971.70-305,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2583.419,2587.011,Which the ultimate owners can get their hands on?
1971.70-305,1,40945,stephen_h_anderson,,2587.011,2589.063,"Now, that is another good point."
1971.70-305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2649.759,2661.479,Well let us assume that the banking laws were then -- so it is perfectly clear that a bank could in connection with (Inaudible) the generating credit life insurance taking commission?
1971.70-305,1,40945,stephen_h_anderson,,2661.479,2663.574,One half of my argument would fall.
1971.70-305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2663.574,2675.361,"And then let us assume that the bank, these banks continued not to take a commission although in terms of the service it performed they would have been entitled to it."
1971.70-305,1,40945,stephen_h_anderson,,2686.628,2688.901,"I would have one-half of my argument, one-half would fall in it --"
1971.70-305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2688.901,2689.432,Would you have it?
1971.70-305,1,40945,stephen_h_anderson,,2690.027,2690.583,The half --
1971.70-305,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2690.583,2693.69,(Voice Overlap) the receipt?
1971.70-305,1,40945,stephen_h_anderson,,2693.69,2695.528,Then we would get into the earnings.
1971.70-305,2,21899,ernest_j_brown,,3579.04,3579.694,Just a --
1971.70-305,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3579.694,3586.409,"Mr. Brown, for the post 1959 years, do you have any idea what the difference is to the Government in dollars?"
1971.70-305,2,21899,ernest_j_brown,,3586.409,3591.151,I do not have the record Justice Brennan I am sorry I do not know what the figures are.
1971.70-305,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3644.645,3657.609,"Mr. Brown, let us assume that in this years that the holding companies that controlled banks was different from the holding company that controlled the insurance company in the sense that there -- the stock holdings were not identical."
1971.70-305,2,21899,ernest_j_brown,,3662.545,3664.652,The statute does not require it.
1971.70-305,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3678.074,3681.497,Well in (Inaudible) would it be -- if it were actually proved that there was divorce?
1971.70-305,2,21899,ernest_j_brown,,3681.497,3687.173,"It -- for the years after the divorce, not for the years before which was expected by the Court."
