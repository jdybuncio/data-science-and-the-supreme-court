1991.90-6861,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.044,"We'll hear argument now in No. 90-6861, John J. McCarthy v. Mr. Maddigan."
1991.90-6861,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,22.116,23.288,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1991.90-6861,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,103.506,111.8,"If there is an adequate administrative remedy, then is there a Bivens option at all?"
1991.90-6861,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,111.8,120.063,"Well, Your Honor, I think there could be a situation where you would have an administrative remedy that would be adequate enough to justify exhaustion, but not so comprehensive that you would want to give it--"
1991.90-6861,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,120.063,121.781,Have we had a situation like that?
1991.90-6861,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,121.781,122.906,--You haven't.
1991.90-6861,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,150.395,155.549,"Now this prisoner is no longer in Federal prison, as I understand it."
1991.90-6861,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,155.549,159.766,He was transferred to Federal prison temporarily and then went back to State custody.
1991.90-6861,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,167.654,171.12,Is he seeking damages?
1991.90-6861,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,171.12,173.745,"This case entirely involves damages, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.90-6861,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,255.307,279.672,"The Government refers to the capacit of the prison to give some money under the Federal Tort Claims Act and says that presents the situation you have described, that they do have the power to give some money Now, does the cause of action of this plaintiff incorporate a Federal Tort Claims Act claim?"
1991.90-6861,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,282.671,289.527,"The complaint that was filed in this case, Your Honor, was limited to a Bivens action against the individual medical personnel in the prison."
1991.90-6861,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,306.831,309.814,Did the Federal regulations explicitly note that as an exception?
1991.90-6861,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,309.814,327.153,"The point I would make in response to the Government's argument about how you should file a grievance, because it might give you a settlement under the Tort Claims Act, is you've got two different procedures here; a grievance procedure that says it's not for tort claims, and the procedure for tort claims, which is an entirely different part of the CFR."
1991.90-6861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,391.283,395.436,Why didn't you bring your action under the Tort Claims Act?
1991.90-6861,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,398.39,403.811,"Well, Your Honor, I think the decision was certainly made by a pro se inmate at the time, and I actually don't know the answer to that question."
1991.90-6861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,403.811,410.106,What would you think now about the Torts Claim Act?
1991.90-6861,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,410.106,414.071,"Well, there are differences between the two in terms of the relief that's available and--"
1991.90-6861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,414.071,414.478,Yes.
1991.90-6861,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,417.945,422.88,--In this kind of case you would have to... in some sense the standard of proof would be less.
1991.90-6861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,430.861,441.295,"Well, what would the... you think if you just proved negligence in this case you could win on your Tort Claims Act?"
1991.90-6861,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,441.295,450.635,"If he had brought a Tort Claims Act... as I understand it, the Government has waived sovereign immunity and therefore, if there was a tort... State law tort committed by these Federal prison--"
1991.90-6861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,450.635,459.803,"Well, why should... if there's this alternative route to go, why would we put up with a Bivens action?"
1991.90-6861,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,459.803,465.239,--Well that's the... that whole issue was discussed at length in Carlson v. Green 11 years ago.
1991.90-6861,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,488.558,494.258,"That hasn't been regarded as dispositive in other cases where we've had, held... Bivens claims have been preempted."
1991.90-6861,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,494.258,496.492,"--More recently, Mr. Chief Justice--"
1991.90-6861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,496.492,501.412,"This is a suit against Federal prison officials, isn't it?"
1991.90-6861,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,501.412,505.364,"--Yes, they were medical officials at Leavenworth Prison in Kansas."
1991.90-6861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,505.364,506.926,So the Federal Tort Claims Act is available?
1991.90-6861,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,506.926,510.175,"It's available, sure, but this is not the route that was pursued."
1991.90-6861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,525.092,536.415,You think the standard of deliberate indifference would be close enough to intentional conduct to be barred by the Tort Claims Act?
1991.90-6861,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,536.415,544.365,"--Well, the... as I read the Tort Claims Act it doesn't say we bar all intentional torts, it just bars specific intentional torts like assault and battery and things like that."
1991.90-6861,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,608.167,614.867,"But there still may be some benefits though, I suppose, by having a prompt administrative look at the facts."
1991.90-6861,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,614.867,616.897,I don't dispute that.
1991.90-6861,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,616.897,623.144,There may be some public benefit to that kind of thing.
1991.90-6861,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,623.144,630.158,"I don't dispute, Justice O'Connor, the possibility that there are State interests served by having exhaustion of an administrative remedy in this kind of case."
1991.90-6861,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,649.353,661.083,"Well, do we have to look on a case-by-case basis at whether the remedy, the administrative remedy is adequate, or do we take a more global look at it?"
1991.90-6861,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,661.083,663.723,I don't think it would depend on the individual case.
1991.90-6861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,683.433,685.947,Swear a suit against State prison officials.
1991.90-6861,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,685.947,697.442,"If this were a suit against State prison officials, in most States there would be no exhaustion, because in most States the standards of CRIPA have not been met and the general rule that there's no exhaustion in 1983 cases would apply."
1991.90-6861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,697.442,701.988,"Well, isn't there a Federal statute about exhaustion?"
1991.90-6861,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,701.988,704.847,"Yes, that's CRIPA, the Civil Rights for Institutionalized Persons Act."
1991.90-6861,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,720.403,721.87,"Well, what about one of those States?"
1991.90-6861,0,38319,paul_m_smith,,728.431,730.132,"As I understand it, Your Honor, that's not right."
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1538.681,1545.397,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-6861,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1603.154,1608.513,"Ms. Mahoney, what if the prisoner is beat up and unconscious in the hospital for 2 weeks?"
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1608.513,1613.292,"--Your Honor, that would be... he would certainly be excused from meeting the 15-day deadline."
1991.90-6861,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1619.586,1621.179,Are there provisions for excuses?
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1621.179,1622.616,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1991.90-6861,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1648.59,1651.526,Have you ever been in a Federal prison?
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1651.526,1653.76,"Your Honor, I've been in a State prison."
1991.90-6861,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1722.17,1739.273,"Well, if the prison did not excuse a delay in filing an administrative grievance, would the Bivens action, then, have to be dismissed by the court for the failure to exhaust in a timely fashion?"
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1739.273,1749.581,"--Your Honor, I think it would be up to this Court in its equitable discretion to determine whether the reason for failure to follow the procedural rules established by the system should be excused."
1991.90-6861,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1764.292,1773.211,"Do you think that the procedure, the grievance procedure is adequate when only monetary damages are sought as relief?"
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1773.211,1776.054,"Yes, Your Honor, for a number of reasons."
1991.90-6861,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1824.785,1827.393,"Of course, that's pretty speculative on your part, isn't it, Ms. Mahoney?"
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1827.393,1829.314,"--No, Your Honor, I don't think it's speculative at all."
1991.90-6861,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1830.267,1833.047,I heard you say probably he wouldn't bring his case.
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1833.891,1846.135,"--Your Honor, the experience of the BOP is that many, many inmates who obtain some sort of relief in the administrative process never file a claim even if they theoretically, or even if they've asked for money to begin with."
1991.90-6861,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1869.892,1878.513,"Well, I agree with all that, but nevertheless, you were confronted with the fact there's no provision for damages in a grievance procedure, is there?"
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1878.513,1882.229,"--Your Honor, there is the potential to settle the claim."
1991.90-6861,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1904.284,1912.312,"Ms. Mahoney, are there any examples in the record that you can call our attention to where the Government has in fact paid money to any prisoners on Bivens claims?"
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1912.312,1915.545,"--Your Honor, there is no record in this case to speak of."
1991.90-6861,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1916.467,1920.214,"You described the general practice and what happens, but there's nothing in the record."
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1929.32,1933.412,"--Your Honor, the only thing I can do, I'd be happy to submit something supplemental."
1991.90-6861,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1950.718,1951.89,Settled by the payment of money?
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1951.89,1952.92,--Settled by the payment of money.
1991.90-6861,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1959.214,1963.056,And those claims also could have been brought as Federal Tort Claims Act claims?
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1963.056,1963.915,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-6861,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1963.915,1970.507,Are there any that could not have been brought as Federal Tort Claims Act claims where a Bivens payment of money has been made?
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1970.507,1972.678,In settlement or after judgment?
1991.90-6861,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1972.678,1973.583,In settlement.
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1973.583,1974.958,"Not that I know of, Your Honor."
1991.90-6861,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1975.49,1983.174,"That's, of course, where the problem is critical because there is a category of Bivens claims for which there's no Federal Tort Claims Act remedies."
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1983.174,1984.158,"--Well, Your Honor, if I could--"
1991.90-6861,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1984.158,1986.875,"And if you addressed yourself to that problem, then I find you more persuasive."
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1986.875,1989.062,"--All right, I'll address myself to that one."
1991.90-6861,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1995.591,1997.276,But this case isn't in that category.
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1997.276,2011.6,"--It is in... excuse me, it is in the category of cases that could be settled under FTCA authority, Your Honor, because this case, while he claims it is a Bivens case, a case of deliberate indifference, it certainly can also be characterized as a malpractice claim, which is--"
1991.90-6861,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2011.6,2018.612,"Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that in that case the regulation doesn't apply at all because it exempts tort claims."
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2018.612,2024.047,"--Well, Your Honor, there is a separate procedure for tort claims, but it's not that it does not apply."
1991.90-6861,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2043.868,2053.754,"Well, Ms. Mahoney, though, it says in the regulation filings will not be accepted under the administrative remedy procedure for tort claims."
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2053.754,2069.014,"Your Honor, the way that that has been applied by the Bureau of Prisons is if an inmate says the only thing I want is a Federal Tort Claims Act suit, they will treat it as an FTA suit which has a separate administrative claims process."
1991.90-6861,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2101.485,2108.889,"Well, do you take the position that this particular claim is a pure Federal Tort Claims Act claim?"
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2108.889,2113.761,"No, Your Honor, he has styled it as both a... he has styled it as a Bivens action."
1991.90-6861,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2114.495,2120.944,"Well, do you say that the Federal Tort Claims Act covers his entire complaint?"
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2120.944,2137.423,"--No, Your Honor, if he were correct that these doctors engaged in wanton and deliberate conduct subjecting him maliciously to injury, he might well be entitled to damages above and beyond that which he could get in a Federal Tort Claims Act suit."
1991.90-6861,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2178.844,2185.092,"Why... can you tell me, why is it that a Bivens claim can't be categorized as a tort claim?"
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2185.092,2187.575,"No, Your Honor, I'm sorry."
1991.90-6861,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2194.619,2197.789,Why can't a... isn't a Bivens claim also--
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2197.789,2198.805,"Oh, under our regulation?"
1991.90-6861,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2198.805,2199.18,--Yes.
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2205.537,2208.255,"Because simply, it could be except that it's not."
1991.90-6861,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2226.482,2236.93,Did it make that... did it change that interpretation after Congress passed the 1983 grievance process statute?
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2236.93,2237.93,"No, Your Honor."
1991.90-6861,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2241.898,2243.147,It has been consistent at all times?
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2243.147,2247.333,"--Your Honor, I don't want to say that it's been consistent at all times."
1991.90-6861,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2272.01,2277.321,Why wouldn't the regulation be rewritten to make that clear if that's the situation?
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2277.321,2280.24,"--Your Honor, if that's what required, BOP certainly would do that."
1991.90-6861,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2387.166,2409.939,What authority does the Bureau of Prisons have to provide monetary relief under this particular procedure where the claim is not under the Federal Tort Claims Act?
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2409.939,2417.561,"Your Honor, this particular procedure does not spell out what relief will be available and whether it be monetary or nonmonetary."
1991.90-6861,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2417.561,2422.854,"Oh, I know, but what authority... where does it get the... where does the BOP get the authority to pay money?"
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2422.854,2435.397,The Attorney General has delegated authority to the Bureau of Prisons to settle claims for tortious conduct against Federal prison officials pursuant to the authority under the Federal Tort Claims Act.
1991.90-6861,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2435.397,2446.533,"Well, I know, but this is... I just said, what authority is there for a non-Federal Tort Claims Act to give money?"
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2446.533,2449.985,"Well, Your Honor, it's all a question of characterization."
1991.90-6861,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2466.368,2482.409,"Well, I know, but you say that what... if this plaintiff wants to prove deliberate indifference he might be able to get much more money than the Federal Tort Claims Act, so it would not be a Federal tort claims procedure."
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2482.409,2488.11,"Well, Your Honor, he would have the option, if he chose to go to Federal court and try to do that."
1991.90-6861,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2513.413,2515.505,I think you still haven't really answered the question.
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2536.669,2540.729,"Your Honor, I believe that the Attorney General does, but that the Bureau of Prisons does not."
1991.90-6861,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2540.729,2547.18,"So this regulation really does not authorize a monetary settlement in that hypothetical case, which you say is a very rare case."
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2547.18,2548.008,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1991.90-6861,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2562.767,2567.063,Does the Attorney General take the position that correction guards are law enforcement official representatives?
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2567.063,2567.266,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-6861,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2567.266,2570.109,Let me ask you another sort of more basic question.
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2596.238,2601.533,"Your Honor, I think Congress already delegated the power to the Bureau of Prisons to come up with a system that's workable."
1991.90-6861,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2602.627,2606.61,Why do you suppose they wrote a statute for the States and not the... you think that the authority was already clearly there?
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2606.61,2623.868,"--Yes, Your Honor, under 18 USC, section 4001, the Congress established that the Attorney General and the Bureau of Prisons would have the authority to establish a system of government for prisons, to control and manage and adopt whatever regulations are necessary."
1991.90-6861,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2652.654,2656.636,What if a prisoner gets beat up the day before he's let out of prison?
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2656.636,2659.885,"Your Honor, if a prisoner gets beat up--"
1991.90-6861,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2659.885,2660.619,What would his remedy be?
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2660.619,2670.319,"--If he got beat up the day before, I would still believe--"
1991.90-6861,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2670.319,2671.099,You still say he has to exhaust.
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2671.099,2672.771,--I would still believe that he would have to exhaust.
1991.90-6861,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2779.54,2782.695,"How long is the... when did the rule come into effect, Ms. Mahoney?"
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2784.756,2787.302,"In the early 1970's, I believe 1974, Your Honor."
1991.90-6861,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2838.235,2842.233,"Yes, but you don't... do you require this procedure in a Federal Tort Claims Act situation?"
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2842.233,2844.218,"--Your Honor, we don't--"
1991.90-6861,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2844.218,2847.077,Why doesn't all the policy arguments apply there as well?
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2847.077,2847.903,"--They do, Your Honor."
1991.90-6861,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2848.778,2851.011,But then why don't they... why don't you insist it?
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2851.886,2859.68,"--The reason that we don't, Your Honor, is because Congress established the procedure for the Federal Tort Claims Act, for the Federal Tort Claims Act remedy."
1991.90-6861,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2865.192,2872.909,"I know, but if you have this wonderful record of the wonderful benefits of 15-day rule, why don't you tell Congress about it and say, let's make this exception for Federal prisons?"
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2874.502,2882.64,"Well, Your Honor, in most cases, inmates who want to pursue a Federal Tort Claims Act case will bring... they also want something else, too."
1991.90-6861,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2885.841,2886.591,"Yes, but they don't have to."
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2886.591,2888.527,"That is correct, Your Honor, they don't have to."
1991.90-6861,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2896.728,2899.164,"It's not important enough to ask Congress for its help, though."
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2899.164,2907.145,"--Well, Your Honor, we have been... as I say, the experience has been that these claims ordinarily will be brought to us."
1991.90-6861,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2922.217,2925.466,"I realize that, but most of these claims will be Federal Tort Claims Act."
1991.90-6861,1,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,2936.102,2948.784,"Well, again, Your Honor, most of these claims such as this one, even if they may seek an FTCA remedy, they do bring them under this system as well in order to try and obtain some other kind of relief."
1991.90-6861,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3066.533,3069.406,"Thank you, Ms. Mahoney."
1991.90-6861,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3071.781,3073.062,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1991.90-6861,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3205.055,3213.069,"But the argument for doing so isn't a classic exhaustion argument, it's a kind of help the Government argument, really."
1991.90-6861,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3223.393,3224.127,That is a different argument.
1991.90-6861,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3302.86,3303.985,"Thank you, Mr. Smith."
