1974.73-2050,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.657,We will hear argument next in 73-2050 and 6848 consolidated.
1974.73-2050,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,51.246,54.539,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-2050,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,97.91,103.68,"And without regard to the location of the checkpoint, the fixed checkpoint?"
1974.73-2050,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,103.68,105.321,Correct.
1974.73-2050,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,105.321,111.484,That is the factor in which these two cases are distinguishable from the one just argued.
1974.73-2050,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,111.484,111.848,Correct.
1974.73-2050,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,126.659,129.098,Are you saying it is irrelevant where the checkpoint is?
1974.73-2050,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,129.098,132.468,Well it is not irrelevant in the broad sense of the reasonableness --
1974.73-2050,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,132.468,136.264,"But that does not have to be within the statute, it should be a reasonable distance from the boarder."
1974.73-2050,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,136.264,145.759,And has to be within a reasonable distance of the boarder under the statute and within 100 miles from the boarder under the regulation of implementing statute.
1974.73-2050,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,330.811,333.389,"Mr. Evans, when was your reply brief filed?"
1974.73-2050,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,333.389,336.371,I believe it was filed on Friday.
1974.73-2050,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,336.371,339.779,I do not have it to the --
1974.73-2050,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,339.779,345.881,"Well, for lack of -- this is the San Clemente checkpoint."
1974.73-2050,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,350.069,356.35,"How about the Highway 86 checkpoint, where on Highway 86 was the checkpoint?"
1974.73-2050,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,356.35,361.241,It is approximately 36 air miles north of the Mexican border.
1974.73-2050,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,361.241,362.882,North of Brawley?
1974.73-2050,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,362.882,374.335,Let me take a look at the map so I can -- do you have copies of these maps that we had lodged with the Court for distribution to each Justice?
1974.73-2050,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,374.335,374.944,I don't.
1974.73-2050,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,374.944,377.118,I don't.
1974.73-2050,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,377.118,384.729,"These were lodged not Friday, but when our brief was first filed."
1974.73-2050,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,387.33,389.549,"4 17th that was yesterday, wasn't it?"
1974.73-2050,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,389.549,390.455,Pardon me?
1974.73-2050,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,390.455,393.362,This reply brief is stamp's February 17th.
1974.73-2050,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,393.362,399.515,"Well, my understanding Mr. Justice was that it was filed in the court on Friday."
1974.73-2050,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,402.554,405.465,"It says filed February 17th which was yesterday, a holiday."
1974.73-2050,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,405.465,407.402,There have been mistakes before.
1974.73-2050,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,411.005,414.911,No problem.
1974.73-2050,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,414.911,423.674,This is a map that shows the checkpoints in the southern district of California.
1974.73-2050,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,444.254,448.063,So it is between Brawley and Indio?
1974.73-2050,0,35781,mark_l_evans,,448.063,452.243,"I don't know the names, the towns, but I think that is correct."
1974.73-2050,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2900.437,2903.167,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court?"
1974.73-2050,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2940.864,2949.009,"These are searches which you would stop sign searches which you would consider lawful at the port of entry, I take it?"
1974.73-2050,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2949.009,2950.541,No question about that.
1974.73-2050,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2950.541,2958.395,"But if they are 10 miles or 20 miles or 30 miles interior, then they require a warrant you say?"
1974.73-2050,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2958.395,2963.02,"Then I would have a question because the question would then be, is this the functional equivalent of the border."
1974.73-2050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2992.492,2996.522,Well what criterion you suggest for the determination of functional equivalent?
1974.73-2050,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,2996.522,2999.874,Well I think the Heart case listed several.
1974.73-2050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3024.988,3029.658,If they have been opened and have to close down on the border then what?
1974.73-2050,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3029.658,3032.633,Then it would not be functionally equivalent to the border.
1974.73-2050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3032.873,3041.003,"So, what we're really saying is it is I check which in affect is a substitute for closed border."
1974.73-2050,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3041.003,3052.226,"That's true but it's not necessarily sold because we only have two ports of interest such as in California and Southern District, one in Calexico and one in San Isidro."
1974.73-2050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3073.406,3080.297,You're suggesting that if the checkpoint would pick up traffic that reasonably might not go through a port of entry.
1974.73-2050,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3083.522,3092.197,That's true as long as -- it have to be other criteria such as it should be reasonably related to the border in terms of distance.
1974.73-2050,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3558.238,3563.581,Let me get this point Mr. Sevilla we're talking about -- I can't keep this two cases clear to me.
1974.73-2050,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3563.581,3564.901,We're talking about the --
1974.73-2050,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3564.901,3567.199,"This is the one in 62 miles, isn't it?"
1974.73-2050,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3567.199,3572.451,"62 or 66 or at 62 area and 66 road, that's correct."
1974.73-2050,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3572.451,3575.029,You said a certain percentage were we're searched.
1974.73-2050,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3578.373,3579.233,It's not of the person.
1974.73-2050,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3618.42,3625.811,But wherever it is the functional equivalent he needs and he may make any search without a warrant short of the --
1974.73-2050,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3625.811,3628.499,Short of a body cavity search I would say so.
1974.73-2050,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3868.397,3869.389,We'll resume right after lunch.
1974.73-2050,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3869.389,3883.426,Thank you Your Honor.
1974.73-2050,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3883.624,3885.536,Mr. Sevilla?
1974.73-2050,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3885.536,3889.895,And may it please the Court.
1974.73-2050,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3944.498,3948.612,"Well, we don't have one."
1974.73-2050,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3948.612,3950.732,Pardon me that as just as well.
1974.73-2050,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4063.594,4069.158,"So, that is of the total entrance is that, would you say?"
1974.73-2050,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,4069.158,4081.643,"Well, by comparison in the entire year at the San Clemente checkpoint between 12,000 and 16,000 were captured, that about a half million total were captured in fiscal 73."
1974.73-2050,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4135.933,4145.934,"Well, from what you're saying now and what you have in your briefs and other briefs on this Court I think that you think they aren't doing their job very well?"
1974.73-2050,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,4145.934,4148.143,"Well, they have a significant problem."
1974.73-2050,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4158.292,4165.761,"But when they go through the barrio presumably it's a grand sweep, a drag net."
1974.73-2050,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,4165.761,4168.243,"Well, if it nearly --"
1974.73-2050,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4168.243,4180.344,Can an alien move to suppress the evidence of this illegal presence in the country by a reason of the fact that he was ceased in an illegal search?
1974.73-2050,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,4180.344,4181.881,He very probably could.
1974.73-2050,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4270.274,4271.393,Mr. Sevilla?
1974.73-2050,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,4271.393,4272.393,Yes sir.
1974.73-2050,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4272.393,4306.974,"As I understand what you are now saying you disagree with the findings that were made by the District Court in the consolidated hearing, I have before me at page 18 (a) of the petition for the writ in which the district judge said “The primary reason for their operation that is a checkpoint is that they effectively deter life's numbers of aliens from illegally entering the country.”"
1974.73-2050,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,4311.333,4314.146,I certainly do and I think the record reflects that.
1974.73-2050,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4331.564,4333.042,"Right, right."
1974.73-2050,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,4353.621,4355.889,"Well, I not only disagree with Your Honor."
1974.73-2050,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4374.67,4380.906,Your possession that there's no substantial evidence to support those findings at the District Court.
1974.73-2050,1,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,4380.906,4382.803,I would say that's true.
1974.73-2050,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4509.919,4517.441,"Thank you Mr. Sevilla, Mr. Nasatir?"
1974.73-2050,2,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,4517.441,4521.066,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-2050,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4588.466,4591.984,What permits that the extent of the administrative warrant?
1974.73-2050,2,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,4591.984,4601.791,Section 1225 (a) of Title 8 Your Honor which is cited at --
1974.73-2050,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4601.791,4611.181,In your position as to what it should be known that the space or any other form to authorize a non-probable cause of entry?
1974.73-2050,2,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,4611.181,4611.806,That is correct Your Honor.
1974.73-2050,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4611.806,4612.585,Anywhere?
1974.73-2050,2,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,4612.585,4613.419,Anywhere.
1974.73-2050,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4613.419,4614.244,(Inaudible)
1974.73-2050,2,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,4614.244,4631.853,"No sir because Section 1225 (a), presently Section 1225 (a) which is cited at page 22 of the brief in Brignoni-Ponce, footnote 11 is the statute which enables immigration officers to board and search cars in which they believe aliens are being brought into the country."
1974.73-2050,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4932.653,4942.031,"Well, that depends on what you think is 1225, now the issue to search the vehicle to find --"
1974.73-2050,2,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,4942.031,4944.882,I think a fair reading of 1225 is just that Your Honor.
1974.73-2050,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4944.882,4947.835,"Well, that's why I said it doesn't really --"
1974.73-2050,2,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,4947.835,4957.791,Yes and I think that is the way that reasonable minds would have interpreted that in light of the probable cause requirement of the Fourth Amendment and this court's Caroline of cases.
1974.73-2050,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4959.579,4960.678,Caroline?
1974.73-2050,2,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,4963.656,4970.999,"Yes, yes Your Honor -- beginning with the Carol case decided by this Court in 1925."
1974.73-2050,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,5027.578,5031.251,What about the majority opinion if it's so clear?
1974.73-2050,2,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,5031.251,5043.429,"Well, the majority appearance I feel it was mistaken and the fact that they mistook the Fumegali line of cases as clear past precedent—"
1974.73-2050,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,5043.429,5053.35,You're painting a picture here of consistency of the Ninth Circuit and yet you have a substantial number of votes of the present circuit judges the other way.
1974.73-2050,2,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,5053.35,5063.486,I believe that a close reading of the cases leading up to Fumegali shows that probably because it was required up until Fumegali.
1974.73-2050,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5165.33,5172.97,"Mr. Nasatir, we're talking here I take it about the retroactivity of the Ninth Circuit's decision in Bowen."
1974.73-2050,2,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,5172.97,5185.08,We're talking here about the lack of retroactivity analysis even having to be made Your Honor because clear past precedents supported the fact that—always has supported the fact.
1974.73-2050,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5186.146,5189.855,"Well, I've heard that part of your argument I think."
1974.73-2050,2,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,5201.119,5207.771,The Ninth Circuit held Your Honor that Bowen was not entitled to the benefit of the decision outlying checkpoints.
1974.73-2050,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5219.815,5221.569,Don't you see some difficulty?
1974.73-2050,2,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,5245.865,5248.914,I do see that difficulty Your Honor.
1974.73-2050,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5248.914,5251.82,"Well, how would you propose that it be solved?"
1974.73-2050,2,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,5251.82,5262.032,I would propose first that it would be solved by having no retroactivity analysis at all by declaring that that's always been the law as it was declared in Almeida-Sanchez clearly.
1974.73-2050,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5265.316,5268.214,"Well, that's fine for your particular case."
1974.73-2050,2,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,5297.285,5298.904,Well --
1974.73-2050,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5298.904,5311.264,I think as I've understood your argument you at least partially addressed Mr. Justice Rehnquist question by saying that the court to look to is this Court and only this Court --
1974.73-2050,2,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,5311.264,5311.605,That is precisely what I'm saying.
1974.73-2050,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5311.605,5324.917,"And that's what Judge Hufstedler said in her separate opinion that otherwise something will be one way in one circuit, one way in another, one way in one district of a circuit, one way in another."
1974.73-2050,2,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,5324.917,5325.896,That's correct Your Honor.
1974.73-2050,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5325.896,5338.243,That the only place there were retroactivity or even get into the question is if you see that this court has overruled a long settled previous precedent or practice.
1974.73-2050,2,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,5338.243,5339.935,That is exactly my argument.
1974.73-2050,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5339.935,5345.757,But the difficulty with that is that Bowen isn't the decision of this Court.
1974.73-2050,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5345.757,5357.725,"Even the Government concede, as I understand it, that the Court of Appeals was wrong in saying that Bowen was not entitled to its judgment."
1974.73-2050,2,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,5364.818,5365.827,That is correct.
1974.73-2050,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5365.827,5368.421,But not because it should be retroactive.
1974.73-2050,2,36417,michael_d_nasatir,,5368.421,5372.78,"No Your Honor because it's always been the law, that is my point."
1974.73-2050,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5373.695,5375.534,Isn't it the Government's point?
1974.73-2050,3,35781,mark_l_evans,,5375.534,5376.729,"No, it's not the Government's point."
1974.73-2050,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5724.907,5727.867,I believe your time is entirely used up Mr. Evans.
1974.73-2050,4,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,5741.924,5774.882,Thank you.
1974.73-2050,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5774.882,5776.859,Before we proceed with your case Mr. Feit.
