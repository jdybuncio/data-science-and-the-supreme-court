1972.71-1136,0,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,40.305,45.749,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-1136,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,159.172,160.289,"Which page was that, again?"
1972.71-1136,0,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,160.289,165.264,That's Page 4 of the petitioner’s brief.
1972.71-1136,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1487.03,1495.016,"You are not claiming here that the constitution prevents the respondent from doing what it did you are relying on statutes, aren't you?"
1972.71-1136,0,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,1495.016,1495.541,Yes Sir.
1972.71-1136,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1495.541,1498.792,"Well, isn't that an other distinction between Moose Lodge and your case?"
1972.71-1136,0,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,1498.792,1502.72,"Of course, of course."
1972.71-1136,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1537.249,1543.738,"Well, you have said that it has an exclusionary criteria, a parameter of three quarters of a mile?"
1972.71-1136,0,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,1543.738,1545.017,That's the only one.
1972.71-1136,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1545.017,1546.617,And none other?
1972.71-1136,0,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,1546.617,1555.193,"None other, no Sir, and it's open specifically by its own bylaws to everyone else within that parameter."
1972.71-1136,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1555.193,1564.338,"Mr. Brown, going back to your property right argument, on what specifically do you base this, on the option?"
1972.71-1136,0,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,1564.338,1566.414,"Well, no, not specifically sir."
1972.71-1136,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1572.646,1576.095,But your brief is saying whether or not the option existed?
1972.71-1136,0,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,1576.095,1577.066,Essentially.
1972.71-1136,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1590.514,1599.472,And this is so despite the fact that there must be membership approval even for the purchaser of a former member's property?
1972.71-1136,0,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,1599.472,1601.208,"Yes, yes."
1972.71-1136,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1627.431,1638.21,What kind of reasons could be properly used under their voting power to pass on new members?
1972.71-1136,0,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,1647.359,1663.915,"I would think that they could utilize, yes, the kinds of reasons that you are discussing, chronic alcoholic, a person with a dreaded skin disease or a person who lives outside the geographic area."
1972.71-1136,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1702.266,1706.848,Incidentally is the three quarter mile rule absolute?
1972.71-1136,0,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,1716.723,1731.851,"He can become a member if the membership rolls are open, that is not -- haven’t exceeded the limit and so long as the number of persons from outside the three quarter mile limit do not exceed the 30% of its total membership."
1972.71-1136,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1731.851,1735.089,"And usually the membership rolls were not full, am I correct in that?"
1972.71-1136,0,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,1735.089,1736.919,Well usually they were not.
1972.71-1136,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1746.989,1748.52,Mr. Noyes.
1972.71-1136,1,27745,henry_j_noyes,,1748.52,1751.619,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1136,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1932.345,1936.299,Did they specifically do it on race or not?
1972.71-1136,1,27745,henry_j_noyes,,1936.299,1940.417,In Presses’ case the record was stipulated and we do not deny it.
1972.71-1136,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1950.349,1958.33,"Well, that has at least the same posture as a finding of fact of the District Court, based on substantial evidence then, doesn't it?"
1972.71-1136,1,27745,henry_j_noyes,,1958.33,1959.638,At that point.
1972.71-1136,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2101.603,2106.857,I thought only he was asking for was an application blank.
1972.71-1136,1,27745,henry_j_noyes,,2106.857,2108.688,Well --
1972.71-1136,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2108.688,2109.72,Am I right or wrong?
1972.71-1136,1,27745,henry_j_noyes,,2109.72,2117.323,"He asked to have an application to – well, in asking for application he indicated he wanted to join."
1972.71-1136,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2117.323,2118.835,And he was denied the application--
1972.71-1136,1,27745,henry_j_noyes,,2118.835,2129.264,"He was denied the application by the end effect he was told formally or informally, that at that time, even if an application was given, it would not approved, we do not dispute that."
1972.71-1136,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2129.264,2132.867,What about all these other business you are talking about?
1972.71-1136,1,27745,henry_j_noyes,,2139.841,2144.34,It’s a point of distinction between the Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park and this case.
1972.71-1136,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2149.75,2159.921,"I didn't note that Hunting -- Sullivan as I remember, that's the only thing about appealing to the membership and getting one third of the votes, I do not think that was in the case at all?"
1972.71-1136,1,27745,henry_j_noyes,,2159.921,2162.01,"It was not in that case, but it is in this case."
1972.71-1136,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2636.259,2637.616,Thank you Mr. Noyes.
1972.71-1136,2,31651,john_h_mudd,,2647.172,2650.347,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1136,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2948.064,2956.437,You have a minute left if you need it Mr. Brown.
1972.71-1136,3,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,2956.437,2982.652,I would just like to say very briefly that the important thing here to consider and which has been stressed in the plaintiff’s briefs and has been stressed in the brief that was filed by the justice department in this case is that these community recreational facilities of the type that is involved here are not country clubs or fraternal organizations or sororities.
1972.71-1136,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3019.075,3024.346,"Mr. Brown, were there any facilities other than the swimming pool?"
1972.71-1136,3,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,3024.346,3046.653,"At the time, in the early days, at the time Wheaton-Haven was first organized, the record shows that there were no public pools and indeed the organizers had asked the county authorities about that to build the public pool in that area and they were told we cannot afford to, we are too busy building schools and consequently they went ahead and built this pool in the local community, that is on the record."
1972.71-1136,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3046.653,3050.14,Did this club had own any facilities there?
1972.71-1136,3,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,3051.819,3070.867,"Oh yes, there is a -- well, there is a single block, one level frame building which is where they keep their facilities I guess or keep their tools and the equipment and pumping equipment, and filters and so on and they have some vending machines there."
1972.71-1136,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3077.354,3081.155,Does the record show whether they served food or soft drinks?
1972.71-1136,3,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,3081.155,3111.169,"Yes, the record shows that there was service of foods from these vending machines for people who were admitted of course to the premises and this is the whole basis or one basis for our assertion that they are covered by the 1964 Public Accommodations Act which if you would “hinges” on the service of food or the existence of other kinds of equipment which are passed on in interstate commerce and that is why we asserted jurisdiction under the 1964 Act."
1972.71-1136,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3137.464,3143.616,"Mr. Brown, is that in the stipulation, the representations made to the board, the county board?"
1972.71-1136,3,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,3143.616,3152.051,"That is Sir, in a decision of the Montgomery County Commission on Human Relations –"
1972.71-1136,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3152.051,3153.917,That is in the record.
1972.71-1136,3,15509,allison_w_brown_jr,,3153.917,3160.861,"That's right, which is in the record was submitted in the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals in fact received it and considered it."
1972.71-1136,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3190.264,3190.882,Thank you gentlemen.
