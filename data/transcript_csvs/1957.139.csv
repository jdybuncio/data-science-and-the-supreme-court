1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3352.167,3353.009,183.
1957.139,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3353.009,3354.517,Did you handle the case for the prosecution?
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3354.517,3355.938,"Yes, I was the prosecutor."
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3359.657,3361.084,Were you the one who asked the question?
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3361.084,3361.701,I'm sorry.
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3361.701,3363.167,Are you the one who asked the question?
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3363.167,3364.714,"Yes, yes Your Honor."
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3364.714,3367.384,Did you ask those questions that were read?
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3367.384,3370.492,"The questions with respect to -- were you in love with her, was she --"
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3370.492,3370.641,Yes.
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3370.641,3371.183,-- in love with you?
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3371.782,3378.882,Did you know at that time that he had told you that he had had sexual intercourse with this woman?
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3378.882,3381.447,"Yes, Your Honor, I certainly did."
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3500.167,3501.534,Where?
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3501.534,3504.946,In the -- every portion of the body.
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3505.4,3507.598,I mean where -- where was she at the time?
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3507.598,3513.379,Herlinda Alcorta had arrived at her home in the company of Natividad Castilleja.
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3513.379,3514.565,What time?
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3514.565,3517.802,"At about 1 o'clock in the morning, Sunday morning."
1957.139,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3529.425,3530.466,And who said that?
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3530.466,3533.013,"Alcorta, the -- the defendant."
1957.139,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3582.323,3584.957,"Chasing around with other fellows he said, didn't he?"
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3584.957,3586.762,That she was going out and not taking --
1957.139,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3586.762,3588.504,Is that all he said?
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3588.504,3589.748,At that particular time that all that he --
1957.139,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3589.748,3595.924,"-- (Voice Overlap) well, didn't he in his statement also say that she was chasing around with other fellows?"
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3595.924,3602.259,That she was going to dances but I'm going to refer the Court again to this 183 what he thought of her dancing.
1957.139,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3735.706,3745.587,"But he says up there a little are there like, “I told you, if I had had a camera and waited a little longer, it would have been a different story."
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3747.507,3748.227,Yes.
1957.139,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3770.822,3773.664,"Yes, but there -- there's something you left out there."
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3792.614,3792.855,Castilleja.
1957.139,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3792.855,3794.688,"“In a way, yes, sir."
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3798.877,3801.005,"And yet, you forgot to tell us in that confession."
1957.139,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3801.005,3803.694,"Yes, but he did tell you that, though."
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3803.694,3808.823,"Oh, not -- this he said -- this is his testimony in Court, if it please the Court."
1957.139,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3809.192,3809.946,"Oh, yes."
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3809.946,3811.984,-- during the -- the taking of the confession.
1957.139,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3811.984,3812.572,Yes.
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3812.572,3815.706,-- and that's why I inquired him as to why he had left that out.
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3815.988,3816.371,Mr. Barrera --
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3816.371,3816.56,Yes.
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3816.56,3820.11,-- accorded the relevance of the question.
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3841.915,3842.413,The --
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3842.413,3844.065,How to fix the problem.
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3844.065,3865.831,"The irrelevancy at that particular point which I have a -- a sense determined maybe inadmissible but still, the purpose that I had in mind at that time was to show the jury that before his testimony with respect to what he had stated was not biased or prejudiced in any way by the fact that he may have been in love with her or she in love with him on the --"
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3865.831,3868.033,What about the other cases?
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3868.033,3869.378,"The -- again, the specific --"
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3869.378,3869.804,Yes.
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3869.804,3874.507,"-- question of the date, Your Honor, is a question of interpretation."
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3879.886,3897.051,But it would seem that that -- it would seem to one degree that what she was trying to do was to show that there has been no intimate relation here and that was plain purpose of what you had to testify before the jury.
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3897.051,3904.807,"Well, again it's just a question of the interpretation of the word ""date"" as to whether he had ever taken her out --"
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3904.807,3905.488,Date and love --
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3905.488,3906.126,-- anywhere.
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3906.126,3938.165,"-- date and love now in Texas as I've to assume and probably that if a defendant decides to murder as a man who kills -- killing a man were describe in a car in a moment that if it appears before the jury that the man had been going out with her and having intercourse with her it would likely have a pretty heavy influence on the jury, doesn't it?"
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3938.165,3943.264,"If it was admissible to begin with, certainly it would, Your Honor."
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3943.264,3952.576,"Would it be admissible, if it's admissible they had to offer evidence to show that the man might have acted under the heat of passion."
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3952.576,3959.717,Only if he knew of the things which he saw to corroborate by having that testimony come in.
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3964.712,3978.342,"But suppose he stated on the stand that he did have knowledge and he suspect -- been waiting for here and there he found them, could that have been the testimony to show that you might appeal as the heat of passion?"
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3978.342,3989.037,"Yes, it would but again, this record does not reflect that he ever said that he knew that there was anything wrong or even suspected that until such time as he took the stand there."
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3998.524,3999.176,Well --
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3999.176,3999.709,I had never seen --
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3999.709,3999.931,-- (Voice Overlap)
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,3999.931,4001.09,-- anything wrong.
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4001.09,4004.136,That's (Inaudible)
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4004.136,4006.068,"In other words, that he had never seen anything wrong --"
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4006.068,4016.717,"I know what the man saying is, he never seen anything wrong with his wife dancing, drawing an inference from that, that he wouldn't get mad if he saw -- when he said he saw it here --"
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4016.717,4017.195,Yes.
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4017.195,4020.182,"-- by a man who had done, what the man have already have done."
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4020.182,4021.226,Yes.
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4035.786,4036.157,But he feels that --
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4036.157,4036.757,-- of Castilleja.
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4036.757,4038.446,-- he had an intercourse with her --
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4038.446,4038.629,Yes.
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4038.629,4039.979,-- when you asked him the question.
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4039.979,4041.82,"Yes, I certainly did Your Honor and I never --"
1957.139,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4041.82,4045.253,And he knew that if that came out it occurred in the haste didn't he?
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4045.253,4057.045,I knew that it could not come out under our Texas law and it was inadmissible in the fact that he did not know it which was reflected to me by the confession which he had given to us that he did not know that.
1957.139,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4057.045,4068.109,"May I ask if these questions and answer was set forth by your presiding Judge Morrison, at what stage -- where in the record did you ask these questions?"
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4068.109,4075.31,Just before I turned Castilleja over for cross-examination -- or on direct.
1957.139,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4075.31,4079.743,And that as before Alcorta -- Alcorta accepted to stand.
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4079.743,4081.077,That's correct.
1957.139,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4081.077,4083.779,"And you worked with him as a witness, did you not?"
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4083.779,4084.955,"Castilleja, yes I did."
1957.139,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4084.955,4090.49,And these questions were elicited by you on the direct examination of a witness for the State.
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4090.49,4091.717,That's correct.
1957.139,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4091.717,4099.264,"And the answers that he gave you, if I heard right a minute ago, that you knew were not true, were they?"
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4099.264,4100.846,"No, Your Honor, the --"
1957.139,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4100.846,4116.536,You were -- you were saying that -- that the knowledge that you had of Castilleja's relations with the woman that he's going to (Inaudible) “Were you in love with her?”
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4123.31,4133.448,"Again, it goes to the interpretation of the word love and whether it -- when you say love, you mean intercourse, why then certainly, they would be false."
1957.139,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4133.448,4135.14,"Well, you --"
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4135.14,4140.881,But you have a 19-year-old boy there with a married woman with two children.
1957.139,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4149.613,4151.473,But he should have.
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4183.944,4185.792,"That they did not love each other, yes."
1957.139,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4185.792,4203.421,"Well, I -- he says very well and I will submit that what love is in here, has many meanings but will you be good enough to answer the question whether the questions and answers they're proposing by Judge Morrison, did they or did they not?"
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4214.363,4217.406,"The Judge, there's nothing in there about amorous relations."
1957.139,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4224.775,4224.964,I know what --
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4224.964,4225.422,-- love relations.
1957.139,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4225.422,4226.144,-- it's not.
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4231.75,4232.234,"We do now, judges."
1957.139,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4232.234,4245.725,"What was -- when the trial was on, what was left in the minds of those 12 people sitting on the jury box that his relations with this woman were what in the point of view is sexual immorality who are innocent, is that right?"
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4245.725,4247.535,"Well, I would suppose that they would, Your Honor."
1957.139,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4251.263,4255.358,"Well, I'm not now deciding whether intercourse or it implies --"
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4255.358,4258.275,Yes.
1957.139,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4258.275,4261.797,-- the roles and expression of the kind of feeling that we call love.
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4261.797,4262.832,Yes.
1957.139,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4262.832,4273.796,But what was it not the fact that the impression was left or was bound to be left that his relations were innocent in the sense in which I use the word innocence.
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4273.796,4275.979,"Yes, in the sense in which you -- you use it."
1957.139,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4276.473,4288.24,"But that's the crucial sense in this controversy isn't it, namely, that he did not have relations with a woman calculated to stir the passion of a husband."
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4288.24,4294.505,There wasn't a controversy as to just what our Court did or did not see there on that particular night --
1957.139,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4294.505,4295.351,I'm not saying that.
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4295.351,4295.813,-- if it please the Court.
1957.139,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4295.813,4310.612,"But I -- I'm -- I must press you to ask, what -- what the -- what work of these question was and what it is that the questions and the answers that the questions elicited."
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4321.342,4322.76,"I would imagine so, Your Honor, (Voice Overlap) --"
1957.139,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4322.76,4330.532,But if you -- did you ask him on the stand whether he was kissing and embracing?
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4330.532,4330.957,"No, Your Honor."
1957.139,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4330.957,4331.369,You didn't.
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4333.398,4333.919,The --
1957.139,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4333.919,4336.902,The defendant testified that -- that they were --
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4336.902,4337.173,Well it comes --
1957.139,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4337.173,4337.717,-- doing that.
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4339.43,4344.232,Castilleja had testified before the defendant took the stand.
1957.139,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4348.675,4349.033,Yes.
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4349.033,4352.875,-- that there was kissing and what he had purportedly seen there in the automobile.
1957.139,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4352.875,4357.594,Would that -- would that stop you from -- from putting in one in redirect and putting them on --
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4357.594,4357.792,No.
1957.139,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4357.876,4357.92,-- and move on?
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4357.92,4358.773,-- certainly would not.
1957.139,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4366.952,4372.031,"In other words, when you have -- when you have two different kinds of murder."
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4391.567,4420.935,"Not with the prior threats that we had in this case which the record as rampant with, as to what he would have done and I dare say under the facts in this case and under the threats which he had made when he's -- even states in the record that he had no idea that she was out there with anyone, that the threats having been made immediately before as to what they were going to read in the paper about him Monday, long before he went there, that is, that same night that he was going there with one purpose in mind that was to kill her, whether he had found her with Castilleja or by herself."
1957.139,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4420.935,4435.409,Did you -- did you bring out by your questioning the fact that he stopped there because his carburetor was -- was not working and his car occasionally stopped?
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4437.324,4439.333,"Yes, it came out this way."
1957.139,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4445.094,4445.191,Yes.
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4445.191,4454.225,"Now, he was right there and he turned his lights out so that he could again start his automobile at which time she was in the process of getting out of the automobile."
1957.139,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4454.225,4462.627,And did you bring out by your questioning the fact that what they were talking about was her going to church the next day?
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4462.627,4463.477,That is correct.
1957.139,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4463.477,4467.089,"And, of course, I suppose you did that."
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4475.731,4475.997,That was --
1957.139,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4475.997,4478.941,-- other than anything essential?
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4478.941,4489.569,-- a part of the writ's just stay immediately preceeding these facts that have just taken place which were certainly relevant as to what the parties were doing at that particular time.
1957.139,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4489.569,4506.122,"Well, Mr. Barrera may I -- may I ask, you knew when you asked these series of questions as I understand it that these illicit acts or several of what he's told you about had occurred according to him in his automobile at various places."
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4506.122,4506.708,Yes.
1957.139,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4506.708,4508.307,You knew that when you asked these questions.
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4508.307,4509.27,That is correct.
1957.139,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4509.27,4514.893,"Well now, beginning those questions in which that he talked about love and so forth."
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4539.655,4541.1,"Was when he brought her from work, yes."
1957.139,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4541.1,4550.434,"Well, then you already knew that that's not the fact that he had had her in the automobile on several occasions when according to him as he had told you."
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4550.434,4550.629,Yes.
1957.139,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4550.629,4551.936,He had had illicit relations.
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4551.936,4561.297,He had told me that he had intercourse with this girl when he brought her from work in the automobile and it's not in the record anywhere that he stopped in front of the house and had relations with her.
1957.139,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4561.297,4561.825,"Oh, but you --"
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4561.825,4561.947,I don't --
1957.139,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4561.947,4573.931,"-- don't you with that knowledge, how could he possibly not have appreciated that his answers to these questions were false if you were there?"
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4573.931,4581.342,The materiality of the question and answer there at that particular point is what --
1957.139,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4581.342,4582.346,That's not my question.
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4595.252,4597.297,Not just to drive her home from work.
1957.139,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4603.939,4608.267,"But your question was, had you ever had any dates with her other than to take her home?"
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4608.267,4608.742,Yes.
1957.139,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4608.742,4611.557,"No, well just when I brought her from there."
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4617.041,4618.993,That's correct.
1957.139,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4618.993,4634.364,"Mr. Barrera, if I remember when the -- had he had intercourse with her when he was supposed to take her home today from her work?"
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4634.364,4635.595,That's correct.
1957.139,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4635.595,4641.027,Isn't it true that he testified that -- that occurred in a vacant lot --
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4641.027,4641.314,In the --
1957.139,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4641.314,4642.488,-- near his house.
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4642.488,4643.673,"-- in the automobile, that's correct."
1957.139,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4643.673,4644.539,Near his house.
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4644.539,4645.172,That's right.
1957.139,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4645.172,4645.888,Not in her house.
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4645.888,4647.564,No.
1957.139,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4647.564,4652.986,Will you construe that to mean that they were on their way from work.
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4652.986,4658.598,"Well, he lived about a block from her house."
1957.139,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4658.598,4672.257,Don't you think that left with a rather -- that Justice Brennan indicated and explained that connotation is no less than to leave the impression with the jury that he was just -- was carrying them back and forth from work?
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4672.257,4689.438,"The thing that was foremost in my mind, if it please the Court, is the fact that Alcorta, not having known about it, therefore, if they were and certainly they were that it was inadmissible and immaterial to his reasons for having killed her."
1957.139,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4689.438,4696.539,"Well, that's true but if you were to prosecute her or would -- for fairness, did you not, Alcorta?"
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4699.324,4700.078,That's correct.
1957.139,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4700.078,4722.868,"But do you think it was fair for you to leave an impression with the jury that this man whom you knew had had a series of absolute (Inaudible) and not taking her just home from work but had taken her via a vacant lot, at his house before he took her home is that --"
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4722.868,4734.496,The dilemma that the state was in at the time if it please the Court was had -- had we sought to introduce these acts of intercourse as a motive so to speak that we would have been reversed.
1957.139,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,4753.404,4754.577,"So, I can understand that."
1957.139,1,38658,roy_r_barrera,,4805.147,4806.225,"Again, yes."
1957.139,2,27143,hubert_w_green_jr,,5606.968,5610.579,May it please the Court.
1957.139,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5705.291,5707.752,One of them in front of his house.
1957.139,2,27143,hubert_w_green_jr,,5707.752,5708.363,Sir?
1957.139,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5708.363,5709.963,One of them in front of his house.
1957.139,2,27143,hubert_w_green_jr,,5709.963,5710.591,"Yes, sir."
1957.139,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5710.591,5711.168,Not her.
1957.139,2,27143,hubert_w_green_jr,,5711.168,5711.242,"Yes, sir."
1957.139,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5711.242,5712.042,Was this on the way home?
1957.139,2,27143,hubert_w_green_jr,,5712.042,5712.862,Yes.
1957.139,3,40678,raul_villarreal,,6920.621,6931.757,"I might say, Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honor that we contend here as a size of the evidence that there's -- there's no disputed issue of fact."
