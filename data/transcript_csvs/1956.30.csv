1956.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,21.562,"Number 30, Gerald D. Nelson et al., Appellants, versus the City of New York."
1956.30,0,45153,william_p_jones,,23.329,25.848,May it please the Court.
1956.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,47.434,52.02,Very well.
1956.30,0,45153,william_p_jones,,52.02,77.065,This appeal is from the final order of the New York Court of Appeals which denied the motion for reargument but granted the motion to amend the remittitur to show that constitutional questions had been presented and necessarily passed upon.
1956.30,1,41911,seymour_b_quel,,2871.798,2872.111,If the Court --
1956.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2872.111,2873.534,Mr. Quel.
1956.30,1,41911,seymour_b_quel,,2873.534,2874.711,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1956.30,2,45153,william_p_jones,,5154.508,5155.817,May it please the Court.
1956.30,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5193.638,5205.56,"But I suggest that in our profession, we assume that when a decision is handed down, it wasn't concocted the minute that the decision was handed down, but I'm not resorting to a fiction as evidence of the lawyer of the Chapman."
1956.30,2,45153,william_p_jones,,5214.786,5233.335,"There's one good reason why the one thing I -- I know the lawyer in the Chapman case and -- and the -- and the -- the state statute, Your Honor, that is, this prototype statute of New York State does provide that where an answer is filed."
1956.30,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5250.517,5251.102,I'm -- I'm merely suggesting --
1956.30,2,45153,william_p_jones,,5251.102,5254.05,-- but this -- this -- that you didn't have it there.
1956.30,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5254.05,5277.462,I merely suggest that the -- that the stimulus to all that the statute might be so interpreted wasn't there and I should think it is there particularly (Inaudible) that wasn't merely a case in which you could reason on the fact that the Chapman's doctrine isn't -- wasn't really in that case.
1956.30,2,45153,william_p_jones,,5277.462,5283.069,"Well, they can't ever say that the -- this case here was started long before."
1956.30,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5283.069,5284.959,Not to my mind.
1956.30,2,45153,william_p_jones,,5286.813,5291.756,This case was started in January of 1953.
1956.30,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5291.756,5297.117,"Well, the Mamaroneck case at 273 App. Div. does not involve after 1948."
1956.30,2,45153,william_p_jones,,5297.117,5313.267,"No, I don't think there is anything into the Mamaroneck case that have stimulated anybody's thought that the -- that -- that filing an answer would have been includable under the relief in this statute, but what good would it have done to anybody in this case?"
1956.30,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5317.613,5319.282,But there was a chance (Inaudible)
1956.30,2,45153,william_p_jones,,5319.282,5321.129,"No, there wasn't, Your Honor, and that's what I want to correct --"
1956.30,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5321.129,5322.194,Why not?
1956.30,2,45153,william_p_jones,,5322.194,5331.152,Because the answer had to be filed 20 days after -- it had to be filed 10 weeks after this foreclosure action and that have gone on years before.
1956.30,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5331.152,5336.17,Do you mean because of the -- because of the notion that he knows?
1956.30,2,45153,william_p_jones,,5337.347,5337.49,Yes.
1956.30,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5337.49,5340.779,(Inaudible)
1956.30,2,45153,william_p_jones,,5340.779,5351.581,"At -- at any rate, any chance to make use of an -- of an interpretation of -- of what could be done with an answered file in this case, long since gone."
1956.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5351.581,5367.103,"Well, I suppose we could -- we could pass the old act unconstitutional on the grounds it provided for an automatic taking of your property when it, of course, has held at any time it doesn't make -- it doesn't provide for such conditions, couldn't we?"
1956.30,2,45153,william_p_jones,,5367.103,5371.179,"Well, yes, if you -- if you're -- if you have the misfortune to miss your chance to answer --"
1956.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5371.179,5373.991,"Well, that's the question of the adequacy of the note."
1956.30,2,45153,william_p_jones,,5374.976,5380.602,"Well, I mean, then you have a -- then, there is a confiscation if you miss your chance to answer."
1956.30,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5407.473,5413.793,Do you agree you would have an action against the City for those rents in the event that you pay the taxes now?
1956.30,2,45153,william_p_jones,,5413.793,5419.296,I have -- agree that I'd have an awful fight with the City on the interpretation of that statute --
1956.30,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5419.296,5419.508,But you agreed --
1956.30,2,45153,william_p_jones,,5419.508,5429.481,-- because I -- it has been discussed on the phone who would get those rents and that it has -- I've have been informed that the City is going to keep the rents.
1956.30,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5429.481,5432.334,Do you mean that they're legally entitled to them?
1956.30,2,45153,william_p_jones,,5432.334,5435.645,"Under the statute, they claimed that they're entitled to the rent."
1956.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5445.659,5451.482,"And you have a pretty strong argument, wouldn't you, that they're going to make you pay the taxes as though it was your property?"
1956.30,2,45153,william_p_jones,,5451.482,5452.185,"Well, you would have --"
1956.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5452.185,5455.482,The City certainly ought to give you the rent.
1956.30,2,45153,william_p_jones,,5455.73,5457.888,That -- that is certainly a strong argument.
1956.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5457.888,5460.375,-- at the cost of collecting.
1956.30,2,45153,william_p_jones,,5460.375,5468.337,"That is a strong argument if I have to go -- have to fight this one out too, I'll certainly remember what Your Honor has said promptly [Laughter] the strength of the argument."
1956.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5468.337,5468.823,I hope so.
1956.30,2,45153,william_p_jones,,5468.823,5475.07,But there should be an end of litigation sometime and I hope that we don't have to go to --
1956.30,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5475.07,5475.574,What will you say to the --
1956.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5475.574,5475.938,(Voice Overlap) --
1956.30,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5475.938,5478.165,-- one-night decision?
1956.30,2,45153,william_p_jones,,5481.603,5482.862,[Laughter]
1956.30,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5482.862,5487.28,Nobody dissented yet.
1956.30,2,45153,william_p_jones,,5487.28,5495.943,I have only a few minutes left and I would like to point out something that I didn't get to in my main argument.
1956.30,3,41911,seymour_b_quel,,5647.088,5651.212,"Excuse -- excuse me, Your Honor."
1956.30,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5659.778,5660.322,"Yes, you may."
1956.30,3,41911,seymour_b_quel,,5660.322,5660.861,With joy.
