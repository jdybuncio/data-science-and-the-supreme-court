2016.15-628,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.09,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case No. 15-628, Salman v. United States. Ms. Shapiro."
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,7.09,33.52,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In case after case -- McNally, Skilling, and McDonald, to name just a few -- this Court has construed Federal criminal statutes narrowly to avoid serious separation of powers and vagueness problems. This case presents those same constitutional concerns, but to a far greater degree, because no statute defines the elements of the crime."
2016.15-628,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,58.905,83.62,"Suppose in this case the person with the inside -- inside information, the brother with the inside information, had himself traded in the securities, and then gave the proceeds to his -- what was it? His older brother? Would that have violated 10(b)?"
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,83.62,84.755,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-628,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,84.755,98.325,"So what's the difference, if the insider trades and gives it -- makes the proceeds a gift, or if he just says, you do the trade; here's the gift?"
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,98.325,104.73,"The difference, Your Honor, is that the transaction -- the securities transaction is complete when the insider trades."
2016.15-628,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,117.529,131.475,"Justice Ginsburg was setting up the question, isn't he -- in -- in her instance where the tippee does the trading, the tippee is just an accomplice."
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,134.48,135.88,"No, Your Honor."
2016.15-628,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,181.25,201.985,"Maybe I'm missing -- maybe one of us is missing the import of the question. Are -- are you suggesting that if two people get together, one of them has inside information and he says to the other person, why don't the two of us -- why don't you trade on that, and then you and I will split the proceeds, that that's not covered?"
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,201.985,203.1,"That is covered, Your Honor."
2016.15-628,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,203.1,203.76,"Oh, okay."
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,203.76,204.49,I'm sorry.
2016.15-628,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,215.96,226.91,"Don't you think that his brother's statement -- when he was asked about trading by Maher, the younger brother, he said, I owe somebody money."
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,260.315,275.25,"Well, Your Honor, I think the problem with that is that virtually anything would -- any disclosure would then amount to a gift, and this Court has been crystal clear that -- that not any disclosure leads to a violation --"
2016.15-628,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,275.25,298.47,"That's true, but then comes the government's suggestion that the disclosure has to be for a personal benefit or a personal purpose, that there has to be a reason you're doing it, not accidentally, not -- not unknowingly, but something you're doing because you want to receive some benefit from it."
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,298.47,310.37,"Well, in this case, it's quite clear that Maher, the -- the insider brother, didn't receive any benefit at all, and indeed the district court and the SEC made that clear."
2016.15-628,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,329.525,331.795,"Why do you say ""scant""?"
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,331.795,337.04,"Well, Your Honor, I think we have to get back to the fact that this --"
2016.15-628,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,337.04,342.91,"No, my bigger question is why -- why do all the disclosure forms we have to fill out? They have a lot of relatives."
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,362.695,367.53,"Well, Your Honor, the statute books are filled with rules like that, but Section --"
2016.15-628,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,367.53,368.01,Because --
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,368.01,368.04,-- 10(b) --
2016.15-628,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,368.04,375.48,"No, no, I realize it doesn't, but I mean, I'm looking for the reason why. And of course I can suggest a reason."
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,385.04,385.76,"Well, Your Honor --"
2016.15-628,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,385.76,387.055,"-- but many, it is."
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,387.055,395.77,I think that the important thing here is that the statute doesn't address this. And Congress could certainly pass a statute --
2016.15-628,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,395.77,397.67,Do you think it addresses benefits?
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,397.67,398.67,"No, the statute --"
2016.15-628,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,398.67,410.615,"I mean, the statute doesn't, but there's a long history, and the person who's been defrauded, I take it, or the object of deceit is the company whose information you use."
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,465.13,472.34,"Well, Your Honor, there aren't a lot of cases, and the only cases that this Court has decided are Chiarella, Dirks and O'Hagan."
2016.15-628,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,481.26,488.895,"Ms. Shapiro, you're asking us to ignore some extremely specific language in Dirks, which of course, was decided quite some time ago."
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,551.995,556.7,"That's right, Your Honor. Dirks does mention gifts, but I don't think that --"
2016.15-628,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,556.7,557.44,More than mention.
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,559.03,561.7,"Well, I don't -- don't agree, Your Honor."
2016.15-628,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,577.37,578.71,"I don't know what ""dictum"" -- what ""dictum"" means."
2016.15-628,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,585.0,597.56,"And it's certainly not dictum in Dirks when the Court says, ""Thus, the test is whether the insider personally will benefit directly or indirectly from his disclosure."""
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,597.56,599.61,"I agree with you, Justice Kennedy."
2016.15-628,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,608.81,611.135,We're talking about benefit and personal gain.
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,626.18,626.84,No.
2016.15-628,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,646.06,650.535,"Except, as Justice Breyer points out, you certainly benefit from giving to your family."
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,650.535,653.98,"Well, I -- just to -- I want to be very clear about --"
2016.15-628,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,653.98,658.695,"It ennobles you, and in a sense it -- it helps you financially because you make them more secure."
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,658.695,665.7,"Well, I want to be very clear about the test that we're proposing, because I do think it's going to capture a number of these families' situations."
2016.15-628,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,696.92,699.445,"Ms. Shapiro, let me give you a hypothetical."
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,722.91,724.3,"Yes, Your Honor."
2016.15-628,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,724.3,725.115,"Yes, you have."
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,738.61,742.56,"Well, there's certainly going to be some situations involving gifts that will be covered."
2016.15-628,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,759.92,769.08,I think what I'm suggesting by the hypothetical is that we all have our own interests and purposes behind giving gifts.
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,810.35,822.9,"But, Your Honor, that would be true in virtually any instance one could think of where an insider disclosed confidential corporate information, whether it's in a business setting, or, as is often the case, a mixed social and business setting."
2016.15-628,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,833.09,833.86,Wait a minute.
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,880.555,883.47,I think the issue is that there has to be a clear line.
2016.15-628,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,889.08,896.69,But Congress doesn't define what's deceptive or manipulative or -- what's the third word? -- what defrauds.
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,926.395,938.675,"Because, Your Honor, the law says nothing about insider trading, and as the Chiarella court said, the statute provides no specific guidance, nor does the legislative history."
2016.15-628,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,990.23,991.36,I -- well --
2016.15-628,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,991.36,992.47,Justice Breyer.
2016.15-628,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,992.47,993.53,I agree with that.
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,1056.14,1064.61,"Well, I don't think so, Your Honor, and I think some of the amicus briefs illustrate that there's been a tremendous amount of murkiness in the Securities Industry Association."
2016.15-628,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1092.63,1097.33,But that -- that addresses whether or not there's an initial breach.
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,1106.33,1130.505,"No, Justice Kennedy, I don't agree with that, because what this Court has repeatedly held in a number of cases going back to the Santa Fe case is not every breach of fiduciary duty violates Section 10(b), and it has to be a fraudulent breach. And the question of whether it's a fraudulent breach depends upon whether the insider is doing the disclosing in exchange for personal benefit."
2016.15-628,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1141.74,1158.535,"If Dirks is the test, and it certainly was phrased as a test and that's how Judge Ray could have understood it, if it is the test, then this case falls within it because it's a gift, right?"
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,1158.535,1160.48,"I don't agree with that, Your Honor."
2016.15-628,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1210.59,1219.05,"And why isn't it a benefit, if you said the brother was pestering him so now his brother is happy? He's no longer being pestered."
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,1219.7,1240.27,"Well, if that's a benefit, virtually anything is, and then the Court would be going back to the rule that expressly rejected in Chiarella, reaffirmed in Dirks, and even in the Omega case, that -- that any general duty not to refrain from -- to refrain from insider trading."
2016.15-628,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1240.27,1245.72,But you agree that the -- you phrased it in terms of a concrete personal benefit.
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,1263.85,1265.66,It doesn't necessarily have to be money.
2016.15-628,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1267.839,1272.86,Except your defining limit? It has to be tangible?
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,1272.86,1274.69,It has to be tangible.
2016.15-628,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1284.02,1303.97,"If we disagree with you because of the gift language of Dirks, how else could you suggest to limit liability? What other ways are there to take care of someone who -- closer cases that exist? Lisser has given us one proposal."
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,1308.59,1322.96,I don't think there's any other test that the Court could provide that wouldn't essentially be a judicial expansion retroactively of a statute that doesn't address the question in violation of the separation of powers.
2016.15-628,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1353.74,1356.61,"Ms. Shapiro, here is not a question of expanding it further."
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,1382.865,1386.855,"No, Your Honor, I don't think we're asking you to change the rules."
2016.15-628,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1420.75,1423.355,And Chiarella really wasn't an insider.
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,1431.615,1432.73,That's correct.
2016.15-628,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1508.74,1517.445,"No, I wasn't suggesting that there was -- there are easy answers to the question of what contributes to the integrity of the market."
2016.15-628,0,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,1529.06,1535.255,"Your Honor, may I reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal?"
2016.15-628,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1535.255,1535.72,Sure.
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1540.045,1565.22,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Under a pecuniary gain limitation to the personal benefit test in Dirks, a corporate insider possessing very valuable nonpublic material information could parcel it out to favored friends, family members and acquaintances who could all use it in trading without the knowledge of the public or the investors on the other side of the trade."
2016.15-628,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1583.65,1593.339,Isn't it something of a stretch to say that the circumstance you describe more widespread on dissemination are all gifts?
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1593.339,1608.37,So some of them may be gifts. Some of them may be to obtain a reputational benefit that might translate in the future into pecuniary gain. Some of them might actually involve a quid pro quo.
2016.15-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1632.075,1635.85,But not everything is a -- is a gift just because it's disclosed.
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1662.735,1665.6,"So I -- I don't disagree with that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2016.15-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1700.2,1709.14,So then the social -- casual social interchange I -- I hypothesized would not be covered under your interpretation?
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1709.14,1711.35,It would not be a personal benefit.
2016.15-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1725.49,1737.485,"It's hazy -- it's kind of a hazy line to draw, isn't it, between something that you characterize as a gift and something that would be characterized as social interaction, isn't it?"
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1737.485,1738.76,"No, I don't think it's hazy at all."
2016.15-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1738.76,1743.525,"Does it depend how close a friend -- the friends are going away for the weekend, how close the friends are?"
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1743.525,1744.05,There may be --
2016.15-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1744.05,1751.43,"If it's -- then I -- I want to give him a gift, because we've been great friends for so many years, as opposed to I just want to tell him why I can't come?"
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1751.43,1761.315,So the burden is on the government to show that the information was given for a purpose of trading and that it was in breach of fiduciary duty.
2016.15-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1767.79,1773.52,"But the difficult part is for a personal advantage, at least to me."
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1790.089,1791.29,So I think that --
2016.15-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1791.29,1792.075,Do we decide?
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1792.075,1805.98,"I think, Justice Breyer, that whenever information is given, it's inside information; it's given by an insider to another person for that person to be able to profit on it, something that the insider himself is forbidden to do."
2016.15-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1805.98,1807.16,So if you know --
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1807.16,1807.73,It's covered.
2016.15-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1807.73,1821.02,"If you give it to your -- anyone in the world, and -- whom you happen to know, and you believe that that person will trade on it, that is for a personal advantage."
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1821.02,1822.14,Yes --
2016.15-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1822.14,1822.35,Yes?
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1822.35,1822.65,-- because --
2016.15-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1822.65,1824.305,What is the personal advantage?
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1824.305,1827.355,You have taken valuable corporate information --
2016.15-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1827.355,1827.51,Uh-huh.
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1827.51,1832.86,-- and you're giving a gift of that information to a person to enable them to profit.
2016.15-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1832.86,1832.99,Okay.
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1836.41,1841.61,The advantage that you receive is that you are able to make a gift with somebody else's property.
2016.15-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1846.32,1848.17,That is a personal advantage?
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1848.17,1851.205,"Well, Justice Breyer, let me step back for a minute."
2016.15-628,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1867.105,1884.61,"It doesn't seem to me that your argument is much more consistent with Dirks than Ms. Shapiro's. Now suppose someone, the insider is walking down the street and sees someone who has a really unhappy look on his face and says, I want to do something to make this person's day."
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1891.38,1891.995,Yes.
2016.15-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1911.0,1925.625,"If they did that, why did they use the word ""advantage""? The -- you keep going back to the -- the part that everybody concedes: This tipper is using information he shouldn't use in a way he shouldn't use it."
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1950.52,1950.89,No.
2016.15-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1952.41,1952.81,What did you say?
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1952.81,1954.3,Let -- let me clarify this.
2016.15-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1954.3,1954.47,Yes.
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1954.47,1956.765,What the Court said in Dirks --
2016.15-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1956.765,1956.9,Yes.
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1956.9,1974.39,"-- was that it was drawing a line between people who had information for corporate purposes and used it consistently with those purposes, and people who had access to corporate information made available to them only for corporate purposes and used it for personal benefit. And it gave a number of examples."
2016.15-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1983.85,1984.08,Yes.
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1984.08,1985.075,The examples --
2016.15-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1985.075,1985.785,Go ahead.
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1985.785,1988.925,The examples include direct quid pro quo --
2016.15-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1988.925,1989.19,Yes.
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1989.19,1991.585,"-- profiting, paid clearly a personal benefit."
2016.15-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1991.585,1991.785,Yes.
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1991.785,2010.815,"It also includes something far less tangible: Reputational benefit that will possibly translate in the future into financial advantage. And then it clearly included in the category of things that were not appropriate corporate purposes, giving a gift to somebody, and it explained why."
2016.15-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2022.26,2030.08,"So you are -- you are arguing for an exact relationship between, not for a corporate purpose and for a personal benefit."
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2046.385,2048.56,"I think it -- I think it is, Mr. Chief Justice --"
2016.15-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2048.56,2053.65,So any disclosure of any confidential information is actionable under that to you --
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2053.65,2053.74,No.
2016.15-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2053.74,2056.01,-- because it was not given to him to disclose.
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2056.01,2056.42,No.
2016.15-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2067.125,2074.465,"Give me the example of something that is not for a corporate purpose but is also not for a personal gain, under your view."
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2074.465,2082.59,"When there's no knowledge that the individual to whom you're going to give the information is trading, there's no breach of the Cady, Roberts duty."
2016.15-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2094.13,2096.83,I'm not interested in who the government would seek to have liable.
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2098.775,2101.52,"I'm equating the two, Mr. Chief Justice."
2016.15-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2102.12,2104.47,This Court has not equated the two. (Laughter.)
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2104.47,2105.33,I understand.
2016.15-628,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2145.15,2168.13,"Mr. Dreeben, I'm -- I'm not sure that your solution is going to clarify much of this area, because now I think the fight is going to be over what was the reason that the tipper gave for giving the tip. I mean, in this very case, there were three reasons for breaching the rule of confidentiality."
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2183.145,2191.05,"Well, correct, Justice Sotomayor, but that also was not information that was flowing from the insider to his brother."
2016.15-628,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2193.48,2193.59,No.
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2222.525,2222.925,No.
2016.15-628,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2232.44,2232.73,So you have --
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2232.73,2234.43,-- older brother's securities trading.
2016.15-628,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2234.43,2244.18,"So if all he did it for was to get information for his father, had no idea that his brother was trading, he would not be liable and his brother wouldn't be liable."
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2244.18,2249.925,"I agree with the first, not with the second. If I could explain just briefly for just a second."
2016.15-628,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2304.09,2312.595,"Is it -- but the defendant here is not the insider, and -- and we've been talking about the two brothers."
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2328.915,2329.72,Correct.
2016.15-628,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2329.72,2331.415,How -- how long does it continue?
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2331.415,2342.495,"Well, tipping chains can -- can go quite a ways when the information is passed, and the limitation on when the government can charge these cases is a limitation of proof."
2016.15-628,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2358.215,2360.345,Had knowledge or should -- should have known.
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2360.345,2363.29,"No, with -- in a criminal case we have to show knowledge."
2016.15-628,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2387.29,2391.605,"Let's look at -- on the other side, if you think about the tipper now."
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2395.445,2395.85,Yes.
2016.15-628,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2395.85,2396.98,That there would be trading.
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2396.98,2397.36,Yes.
2016.15-628,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2397.36,2401.83,So is -- is that something more than he thinks there could be --
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2401.83,2401.92,Yes.
2016.15-628,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2401.92,2405.57,"-- he thinks there -- I mean, he thinks there would be? Is it as strong as that?"
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2405.57,2405.985,Yes.
2016.15-628,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2405.985,2419.74,"Let me give you this example because that -- this goes to that, this. So the person with the inside information has had a few drinks at the country club and is talking to some friends and discloses the inside information to -- to the friends."
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2453.67,2465.7,"As -- as to the tip -- as to the tipper, we submit that an element of the Cady, Roberts duty is that the insider anticipated that the person to whom he gave the information would trade. Now, he --"
2016.15-628,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2465.7,2467.965,Is anticipated the same as he knew he would?
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2467.965,2468.55,Yes.
2016.15-628,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2478.32,2479.15,But it's not enough.
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2481.83,2483.32,"No, it's not enough."
2016.15-628,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2483.32,2486.61,"-- or, you know, I'm sort of betting that he would, but I don't really know."
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2486.61,2490.02,"Now, in a criminal case, we need to show a breach of the fiduciary duty."
2016.15-628,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2497.63,2514.725,"So why do you want to put knowledge of the -- knowledge that it will be used for trading as part of the breach of fiduciary duty? If you do that, then you have to prove that the tippee knew that the tipper thought it would be traded."
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2514.725,2521.18,"Yes, and I don't think that's a very difficult burden because in most of these situations, it's obvious why it's being done."
2016.15-628,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2521.18,2523.635,Why can't you put it in the intent to defraud?
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2523.635,2526.075,It goes to intent to defraud --
2016.15-628,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2526.075,2528.46,So why -- why make it part of the breach --
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2528.46,2529.72,Because Dirks did.
2016.15-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2547.58,2568.78,"It doesn't say it -- it has a sentence here which is exactly what's hanging me up and exactly what I thought you were going to answer before you got cut off. The sentence is: ""The elements exist also when an insider makes a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend."""
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2568.78,2569.385,Yes.
2016.15-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2569.385,2577.035,That doesn't sound as if the writer of those words had in mind any person in the world.
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2591.04,2591.64,"Yes, but --"
2016.15-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2591.64,2591.97,So I want --
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2591.97,2593.81,"-- this isn't a portion of the opinion, Justice Breyer."
2016.15-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2593.81,2594.03,No. All right.
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2595.4,2628.015,"No, I'm -- it's a portion of the opinion in which Justice Powell is giving examples of the concrete circumstances, objective criteria that will allow the government to establish that the purpose of the disclosure was for personal benefit as opposed to what the SEC was concerned about, that people would use ostensible business justifications to explain why the information was being given out and the SEC was concerned this is going to create a quagmire of subjective analysis."
2016.15-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2652.645,2665.83,What can I read -- now I want you to tell me what I can read to get the explanation of Dirks that the majority of lower courts have followed.
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2670.11,2670.62,Correct.
2016.15-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2670.62,2673.565,"For after all, they came to the opposite conclusion."
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2694.9,2697.14,I'm not -- this case does not involve that situation.
2016.15-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2697.93,2700.02,"No, I realize this case -- I'm trying to get it clear in my mind."
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2700.02,2710.49,"This involves the classic, prototypical situation that actually arises in the real world and gets prosecuted. There are very few cases that involve this hypothetical of somebody distributing inside information --"
2016.15-628,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2710.49,2714.11,I'm not worried about that. I'm not worried so much about this case.
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2730.295,2734.76,So I think that there aren't a lot of cases that don't involve friends or family members.
2016.15-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2779.25,2790.65,"What if you have a situation where close friends or whatever and one says, I want to tell you what I've been working on, it's pretty interesting, but tells him, says, but whatever you do, don't go buy stock."
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2792.47,2792.86,Right.
2016.15-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2793.82,2798.91,"So you're not going to prosecute that situation when the tippee goes and makes $100,000 on it?"
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2798.91,2813.685,"The tipper in that situation is disclosing information in the context where he has made an express statement, and I'm assuming understandings between the two that the information would not be used."
2016.15-628,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2876.225,2881.99,"Mr. Dreeben, I think you're taking this way out of existing law."
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2901.04,2903.0,"In a criminal case, we're not claiming that."
2016.15-628,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2905.08,2911.66,There's plenty -- there's a legion of cases I read for this -- preparing for this argument where the government has said --
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2911.66,2918.725,"I don't think that there are, Justice Sotomayor, because I don't think that that's what we're -- we're certainly not making that submission in this case."
2016.15-628,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2933.54,2945.69,"So you're going to let go of the guy that Justice Alito -- the guy on the street who looks dejected is not my friend or a close relative, but I give him a tip and say, go trade on this."
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2951.08,2954.84,"He would, Justice Sotomayor, for the very reason you yourself articulated."
2016.15-628,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2960.69,2964.85,So it's irrelevant whether it's a friend or family member?
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2964.85,2973.77,"My submission is that the best way to understand Dirks is that it goes to a breach of fiduciary duty, which would not be limited to two categories like that."
2016.15-628,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3015.425,3020.2,"Mr. Dreeben, I get your -- your theory and why it doesn't make any particular difference."
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3030.81,3030.94,Yes.
2016.15-628,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3031.04,3041.25,"-- without any sense of who that recipient has to be. On the other hand, as you say, almost all of these cases are relatives and friends."
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3041.25,3041.67,Yes.
2016.15-628,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3041.67,3047.29,And things might look different if we had a case that was not a relative or friend.
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3059.71,3061.31,I'm fine with that.
2016.15-628,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3082.24,3086.605,"So is there a difference between friend and acquaintance, as you're talking? Tell me."
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3086.605,3104.4,"So this is precisely the reason why I think it doesn't make sense, from a point of view of principle or application, to draw a distinction that's based on words in the opinion that the court didn't actually articulate when it applied them to the very situation before it."
2016.15-628,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3264.77,3276.385,"And so a tip here like the one we're concerned with, the requirement is that that tippee know that the information came from a insider? Is that --"
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3276.385,3276.96,Yes.
2016.15-628,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3299.04,3300.36,Is recklessness used?
2016.15-628,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3300.36,3303.035,"Recklessness is not enough for a criminal case, no."
2016.15-628,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3352.0,3356.13,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Shapiro, you have four minutes remaining."
2016.15-628,2,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,3356.13,3366.275,The government's argument to this Court illustrates precisely the dangers with leaving a statute -- without having a statutory definition.
2016.15-628,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3630.585,3631.81,Finish your sentence.
2016.15-628,2,62749,alexandra_a_e_shapiro,,3631.81,3644.59,"-- if Congress could be said to have ratified anything, all it could be said to have ratified is that there is an insider trading ban. There's no indication that Congress ever ratified the Dirks gift language. Thank you."
2016.15-628,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3644.59,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
