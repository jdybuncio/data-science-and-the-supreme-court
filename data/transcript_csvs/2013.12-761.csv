2013.12-761,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.337,"We'll hear argument next in Case No. 12-761, POM Wonderful v. The Coca-Cola Company."
2013.12-761,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,7.17,10.039,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-761,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,79.45,110.904,"If there is no private cause of action to enforce the FDA label standards, only the FDA can bring a proceeding to say that an ad violates its regulations, how does a Court below, without interpreting the regulations, go about deciding whether or not a particular ad doesn't comport with the regulations and hence would be subject to the Lanham Act?"
2013.12-761,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,110.904,111.954,Justice--
2013.12-761,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,111.954,115.308,"Maybe that's a better question for the SG, but I'm trying to figure out--"
2013.12-761,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,115.308,122.712,"--Well, let me take a shot at it and, you know, the SG can and Ms. Sullivan can, as well."
2013.12-761,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,212.37,221.226,"And so do you concede that under the Lanham Act, plaintiff could not challenge aspects of the a food label that the FDA said is required?"
2013.12-761,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,221.226,224.346,"Well, Justice Kennedy--"
2013.12-761,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,224.346,226.062,I know that's not this case.
2013.12-761,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,226.062,226.962,--Thank you.
2013.12-761,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,233.535,235.018,"I want you to answer the question, though."
2013.12-761,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,235.018,250.562,"--My answer to the question would be, under Wyeth, under this Court's decision in Wyeth, the FDCA and the FDA's regulations interpreting it and applying it, supply a floor and not a ceiling."
2013.12-761,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,278.247,280.164,"Justice Kennedy's question, I think, was different."
2013.12-761,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,290.389,291.005,Yes.
2013.12-761,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,328.514,330.782,Why isn't there a different kind of conflict here?
2013.12-761,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,367.639,369.507,Why isn't that a problem?
2013.12-761,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,369.507,369.841,Yeah.
2013.12-761,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,380.799,394.639,"So we know that that is not, in fact, how the FDA construes its regulation, and we know that because just by examining the FDA's own limited enforcement history, all the parties have cited the Court--"
2013.12-761,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,394.639,405.68,"Well, just hypothetically, let's say that the FDA said that this name was not misbranding, that this name was fine under their regulations, that they did not count as misbranding."
2013.12-761,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,405.68,411.834,"--So we're challenging the label as a whole, which is covered by -- under the--"
2013.12-761,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,411.834,412.184,Right.
2013.12-761,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,423.976,424.392,--Right.
2013.12-761,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,606.778,612.232,What would be the components of the injunctive relief that you would seek?
2013.12-761,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,621.588,632.295,"--Well, we have in -- in the course of our complaint, we didn't specify -- I mean, the injunction that we would seek is ceasing to use the label as it currently exists, and of course--"
2013.12-761,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,632.295,636.014,Without saying what label would be lawful?
2013.12-761,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,636.014,636.93,--That's correct.
2013.12-761,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,702.207,704.659,Suppose the percentage were a lot higher.
2013.12-761,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,708.796,717.651,It's hard to see how we would have a -- it's hard to see how we would have a -- could possibly prevail in a Lanham Act case.
2013.12-761,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,775.605,782.511,What if it were the -- what if it were the case that there were very small number of people who were allergic to one of these ingredients?
2013.12-761,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,808.509,819.967,"Well, of course, pome -- the only thing that consumers know is that -- from the front label is that there is pomegranate -- arguably pomegranate juice and blueberry juice in here."
2013.12-761,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,859.777,868.3,"Well, what I'm saying is suppose it's the case that for 99.999 percent of the population, the more pomegranate juice, the better, you just can't drink enough of it."
2013.12-761,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,894.434,914.346,"Well, I think the vast -- presumably, and we're talking about a hypothetical regulation, presumably the FDA would promulgate a requirement that, in fact, you must name each of the -- each of the constituent juices in case there is an allergy."
2013.12-761,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,975.483,980.304,"Do you agree that if you brought this suit under state law, it would be preempted?"
2013.12-761,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,980.304,984.508,--I think it certainly would not be preempted under state law.
2013.12-761,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1073.149,1073.883,"Thank you, Counsel."
2013.12-761,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1094.396,1097.531,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-761,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1149.647,1153.201,What public health benefit is served by this regulation?
2013.12-761,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1154.801,1161.706,The regulations comes under the misbranding provisions of the FDCA.
2013.12-761,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1203.967,1204.533,Excuse me.
2013.12-761,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1215.858,1216.541,"No, no."
2013.12-761,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1247.646,1263.356,"Then, Ms. Sherry, you -- the government is taking the position that it's okay for District Courts to determine whether labels, in fact, comply or don't comply with FDA regulations?"
2013.12-761,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1263.356,1264.406,Yes.
2013.12-761,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1264.406,1270.693,"And if they decide they don't comply, that's when they can could permit a Lanham Act claim?"
2013.12-761,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1270.693,1271.495,That's correct.
2013.12-761,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1304.166,1321.195,"Do I understand your position to be that then if the label is specifically authorized, then the Lanham Act is precluded, but if the FDCA has just simply failed to forbid it then it's not?"
2013.12-761,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1323.528,1324.312,--I think so.
2013.12-761,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1325.229,1327.598,"Because if it is, I think it's very hard to work with."
2013.12-761,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1327.598,1333.168,--And I will try to articulate it slightly differently and explain why we don't think it is difficult to work with.
2013.12-761,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1356.884,1374.945,"But, Ms. Sherry, applied to this case, so we have -- you said the name is okay, pomegranate and blueberry flavored, but you say the label is something different from the name and the Lanham Act can apply to the label."
2013.12-761,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1388.603,1395.776,"--We're drawing a distinction -- when we say the name, we mean the actual words themselves, “ pomegranate blueberry flavored blendified juices ”."
2013.12-761,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1437.086,1440.121,"What if the label just had the name on it, nothing else?"
2013.12-761,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1444.257,1451.01,--Not unless they are able to point to something else on the label that was misleading aside from the actual words in the name.
2013.12-761,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1468.638,1478.43,Does the FDA -- does the FDA take into account purely commercial confusion when it issues -- when it issued its regulations governing the label?
2013.12-761,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1485.5,1489.987,It absolutely took into account -- into account consumer confusion.
2013.12-761,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1500.359,1502.028,What does the FDA know about that?
2013.12-761,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1512.501,1513.836,I'm not sure that is right.
2013.12-761,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1543.605,1552.144,"Ms. Sherry, you know, there is no irreconcilable conflict if we view what the FDA has done as just setting a floor."
2013.12-761,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1582.747,1583.463,--No.
2013.12-761,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1600.375,1601.192,"Well, I guess I don't understand that."
2013.12-761,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1621.038,1621.838,"Oh, for two reasons."
2013.12-761,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1642.969,1657.811,"You don't think there are a lot of people who buy pomegranate juice because of -- they think it has health benefits and they would be very surprised to find when they bring home this bottle that's got a big picture of a pomegranate on it and it says “ pomegranate ” on it, that it is -- what is it, less than one-half of one percent pomegranate juice?"
2013.12-761,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1657.811,1658.313,And I think--
2013.12-761,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1658.313,1660.347,The FDA didn't think that would mislead consumers?
2013.12-761,1,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,1660.347,1663.215,--I think -- I think there is a reasonable argument that it may.
2013.12-761,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1703.609,1704.492,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1708.33,1710.713,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-761,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1753.904,1760.327,"But the NLEA provision doesn't preempt all State law claims, only some State law claims."
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1760.327,1762.327,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-761,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1792.698,1793.765,"Well, why can't it be?"
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1804.422,1810.826,"--In fact, Justice Kagan, it's very rare that Congress actually says no State or Federal claims."
2013.12-761,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1810.826,1815.061,They just say no claims or no -- notwithstanding any law to the contrary.
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1815.061,1816.128,"Fair enough, Your Honor."
2013.12-761,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1836.225,1861.009,"Do you have an example, Ms. Sullivan, of a case where Congress precluded some State claims and said nothing at all about Federal laws in which this Court has held that the express preclusion of State law claims implicitly precluded Federal claims?"
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1861.009,1870.198,"--I cannot, Justice Ginsburg, though I can cite to you the most relevant and unbroken line of court of appeals authority, which are the Federal Railroad Safety Act cases."
2013.12-761,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1911.358,1918.796,Is it part of Coke's narrow position that national uniformity consists in labels that cheat the consumers like this one did?
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1918.796,1926.201,"--Justice Kennedy, you have perhaps succumbed to Mr. Waxman's attempts to argue his jury argument here."
2013.12-761,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1930.203,1934.138,I think it's important for us to know how the statutes work.
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,1961.808,1963.008,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-761,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2001.214,2004.0,"But maybe the two acts are serving different purposes, Ms. Sullivan."
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2033.169,2039.673,"First, Justice Ginsburg, let me be clear: Safety is not at issue in this case."
2013.12-761,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2075.262,2081.083,"Well, let's -- let's assume the following."
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2092.54,2093.975,It's an authorization.
2013.12-761,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2093.975,2095.109,It's an authorization.
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2126.197,2138.171,"Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kennedy, I need to make very clear that we believe that under the FDCA and the FDA regulations, Coke's label is as a matter of law not misleading."
2013.12-761,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2149.729,2158.25,Could the government -- I think what the government is saying nothing about our permission goes to the size of the name on the label--
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2158.25,2159.268,"Well, Your Honor--"
2013.12-761,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2159.268,2166.089,--that you can break up the name of the juice into two different sizes so that you are deemphasizing it.
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2198.393,2208.266,"--Justice Sotomayor, there are five different attacks that POM has made on our label, only two of which were addressed in the lower court."
2013.12-761,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2227.829,2230.531,You basically are talking about field preemption.
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2230.531,2232.014,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
2013.12-761,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2294.039,2296.823,"Well, Mr. Waxman clarified that that's not what they are seeking."
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2318.322,2328.945,"Justice Ginsburg, every single aspect of their misleadingness claim is covered by specific provisions of the FDCA that have preemptive force."
2013.12-761,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2342.971,2344.254,Where is that set forth in the--
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2344.254,2353.829,"--It's set forth, Mr. Chief Justice, in the red brief addendum at page 5A."
2013.12-761,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2353.829,2354.512,--Okay.
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2354.512,2372.724,"And if you look at the express preemption provision, which is notably called “ National Uniform Nutrition Labeling ”, Section (2) and Section (3) on 5A over to 6A, set forth those portions of the FDCA that will and won't have preemptive force."
2013.12-761,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2413.118,2416.67,"Ms. Sullivan, can I ask -- if this gets you away from the argument you want to make, I apologize for that."
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2436.916,2449.224,"Yes, Your Honor, we still win because of your more general approach to preclusion by one Federal statute of another, because the FDA regulations as to misbranding here are far more specific."
2013.12-761,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2459.347,2463.482,But you say that even -- I -- I take it I'm characterizing your position right.
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2472.505,2476.657,"We do -- we do not take that position here, Your Honor, because it's not presented here."
2013.12-761,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2477.309,2480.693,I thought that was -- I thought that was at Page 39 in your brief in a footnote.
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2480.693,2481.876,"--Justice Kennedy, let me be clear."
2013.12-761,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2527.491,2530.709,I understood them to say they were making a Lanham Act challenge.
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2539.715,2540.065,"Correct, Your Honor."
2013.12-761,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2540.065,2548.921,"So they are not saying, We're bringing an action under the FDCA or the NLEA."
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2551.607,2552.573,"Correct, Your Honor."
2013.12-761,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2580.307,2597.169,"I don't know why -- I don't know why it's impossible to have a label that fully complies with the FDA regulations and also happens to be misleading on the entirely different question of commercial competition, consumer confusion that has nothing to do with health."
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2597.169,2606.607,"Mr. Chief Justice, as I said before, the FTC in Section 341 as codified expressly refers to maintaining honesty for the consumer as well as health."
2013.12-761,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2651.053,2653.088,"Well, the Lanham -- the Lanham Act applies nationally."
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2653.088,2655.79,"--Correct, Your Honor, but the falsity standard--"
2013.12-761,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2655.79,2661.861,So you're -- you used a state preemption and then say we should apply the same principles to two federal statutes--
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2661.861,2663.03,"--We do, Your Honor."
2013.12-761,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2663.03,2664.98,--but that's a quite different point.
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2664.98,2665.982,"Here's what I'm saying, Justice Kennedy."
2013.12-761,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2692.715,2707.809,"You want us to -- you want us to write an opinion that said that Congress enacted a statutory scheme because it intended that no matter how misleading or how deceptive a label it is, if it passes the FDA, it cannot -- it -- there can be no liability."

2013.12-761,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2731.44,2739.444,"Let's suppose there were a consumer survey, as there was, but -- and -- and say it was a valid survey."
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2766.53,2767.48,--Justice--
2013.12-761,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2767.48,2773.017,Suppose -- suppose the reality is that consumers are misled.
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2773.017,2783.223,"--If I suppose that, Your Honor, then the proper procedure for a consumer or a competitor is to go to the FDA and seek FDA's change of its rulemaking."
2013.12-761,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2823.617,2827.819,Don't make me feel bad because I thought that this was pomegranate juice.
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2828.421,2836.524,"Justice Kennedy -- Justice Kennedy, it's pomegranate-blueberry-flavored blend of five juices."
2013.12-761,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2841.411,2843.947,He sometimes doesn't read closely enough.
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2844.613,2850.017,"--Yeah, pomegranate-blueberry-flavored blend of five juices."
2013.12-761,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2851.417,2853.469,How do we square this with Wyeth?
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2853.469,2854.669,--Your Honor--
2013.12-761,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2854.669,2862.409,"Wyeth, the FDA actually approves, looks at the label and says, this one is okay."
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2899.434,2903.152,"--Two important distinctions, Your Honor, but let me first disagree with the premise."
2013.12-761,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2941.794,2943.713,You assume people would pick a label and stick with it.
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,2951.05,2956.536,"Oh, but, Your Honor, that's one thing if the FDA decides to adapt its rulemaking."
2013.12-761,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2989.175,3004.867,"I would like you to respond to this question: In the real world, the FDA has a tremendous amount of things on its plate, and labels for juices are not really high on its list."
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,3036.756,3043.059,"Justice Ginsburg, precisely for the reasons you say, you should affirm here and go with us in precluding the Lanham Act claims."
2013.12-761,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3070.227,3077.482,But the point is that it is doubtful that FDA has sufficient resources to police food and beverage labeling.
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,3088.273,3094.777,"Justice Kennedy, the U.S. position is unworkable, as you said before."
2013.12-761,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3140.155,3150.094,"So that's contrary to its current position, and I think we have to take it -- the FDA is -- is -- the government is representing the current FDA position."
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,3150.094,3161.052,"But, Your Honor, you don't give our deference to an amicus brief when there's an authoritative prior statement by FDA that these implementation -- for the very reason you suggest, the FDA has other things to do."
2013.12-761,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3161.052,3167.723,"Would that -- without regard to deference, we don't resurrect the statement that they no longer support."
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,3167.723,3170.175,"Well, Your Honor, they haven't disavowed that statement."
2013.12-761,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3185.684,3189.986,"Do you think, Ms. Sullivan, that there are any Lanham suits regarding food labels that are allowable?"
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,3189.986,3190.905,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-761,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3216.053,3216.386,Yes.
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,3216.386,3221.19,"If there is something that is not covered -- name, vignette, font, multiplized are covered."
2013.12-761,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3241.104,3241.588,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-761,2,33975,kathleen_m_sullivan,,3241.588,3243.54,--the preemption provision governs here.
2013.12-761,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3244.306,3246.492,"Mr. Waxman, you have seven minutes remaining."
2013.12-761,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3246.492,3248.942,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-761,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3351.259,3353.194,Where -- where is that statement contained?
2013.12-761,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3353.194,3364.902,"--That is in 58 -- the statements that I'm quoting are in 58 Federal Register, Pages 2900, 2919, and 2920."
2013.12-761,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3364.902,3365.319,Thank you.
2013.12-761,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3365.319,3380.594,"And also, indeed said, nonetheless, we encourage manufacturers to name all of the juices in a multiple juice product specifically because it was concerned about this."
2013.12-761,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3499.221,3515.367,"But, Mr. Waxman, I think Ms. Sherry said that the FDA views itself as having a job beyond health and safety, that they view themselves as least -- not thinking about competitors' welfare or lack thereof, but at least thinking about consumer understanding of labels."
2013.12-761,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3524.406,3534.945,"--Very definitely, and for -- for some of the reasons that this Court discussed in the Lexmark case, where you were talking about who can sue under the Lanham Act and who's protected."
2013.12-761,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3629.99,3640.196,"Any authority that the FDA interpretation gets deference is presumed to be correct, or presumed to be not misleading?"
2013.12-761,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3645.6,3647.952,"--Well, certainly not in the Lanham Act context."
2013.12-761,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3674.116,3694.013,"If there is a Lanham Act suit and the regulation is brought forward to prevent the suit, cannot the party against whom it's brought forward say the regulation is--"
2013.12-761,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3694.013,3698.301,"We certainly intend to say that if it becomes relevant, absolutely."
2013.12-761,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3698.301,3700.034,--So it's not on steroids then.
2013.12-761,3,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3702.436,3703.836,"Well, I -- right."
2013.12-761,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3709.522,3710.291,"Thank you, Counsel."
