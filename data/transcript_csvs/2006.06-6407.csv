2006.06-6407,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.07,"We'll hear argument next in case 06-6407, Panetti versus Quarterman."
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,9.272,14.241,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-6407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,111.303,111.77,Wait.
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,156.182,169.14,"--Your Honor, I think the difference is, or the central holding, I believe, of Martinez-Villareal is that we do not bring these Ford claims until they are justiciable, until they're ripe."
2006.06-6407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,174.377,178.262,"If you bring it earlier, it will be unripe."
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,187.72,192.172,"Martinez-Villareal did not resolve that question, Your Honor, that's correct."
2006.06-6407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,264.452,274.242,"The difference is that in Martinez-Villareal, it was plausible to say that this was not a second petition."
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,321.97,330.51,My answer would be that the Court didn't make the mere mathematical calculation in Martinez-Villareal.
2006.06-6407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,344.335,351.239,It doesn't say a second run at the same claim.
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,364.749,379.008,The only thing I can say is that the claim in a sense doesn't even exist until the State is announcing its intention to carry out the execution in the near future by setting the date.
2006.06-6407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,390.65,401.672,Is it material to your position to show that there was deterioration in his mental condition between the time of the sentence and the time you brought the petition?
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,406.576,424.704,"I think that is definitely part of it, Your Honor, but it also is the fact that we cannot predict with any reliability how severe mental illnesses are going to influence somebody's mental processes."
2006.06-6407,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,464.614,478.272,"Why can't you have sought leave to file a second or successive application and met the requirements, if you're right that the factual predicate for the Ford claim doesn't arise until the execution is imminent?"
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,498.002,519.433,"I don't think we could have fit under that provision, Your Honor, because that provision requires that the evidence, established by clear and convincing evidence but for constitutional error, no reasonable fact finder would have found the applicant guilty of the underlying offense."
2006.06-6407,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,519.433,539.762,"I suppose it doesn't fit comfortably under there, but I guess the argument would be that... guilty of... we've used the concept of being guilty of the death sentence as opposed to guilty of the crime before, and the fact finder... you wouldn't be sentenced to death if the sentencer had known you were incompetent."
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,557.041,565.914,"That's part of the justification, but it's actually I think more than that, that the claim isn't justiciable, that the claim doesn't exist."
2006.06-6407,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,586.143,586.627,Right.
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,595.666,601.42,"--The facts aren't present, but the constitutional violation has already occurred, and I think that's got to be the difference."
2006.06-6407,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,601.42,606.974,The constitutional violation won't occur until the execution?
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,606.974,607.741,Correct.
2006.06-6407,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,607.741,609.259,"It's prospective, as you said?"
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,609.259,609.643,Right.
2006.06-6407,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,609.643,616.83,"So your position basically is that ""petition"" hear means petition that could have been brought."
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,620.983,621.816,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2006.06-6407,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,621.816,622.566,--the textual argument?
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,622.566,623.399,"Yes, it is."
2006.06-6407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,623.399,629.303,"Then if you get beyond the second or successive question, your next point was whether or not AEDPA applies?"
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,629.303,631.003,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2006.06-6407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,631.003,649.53,"In the course of your argument, could you answer this: Suppose we find that the State did not comply with the mandate of Ford because it didn't give adequate procedures to the defendant, it did not give him an adequate opportunity to present his defense."
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,669.509,671.378,"I would think it's the latter, Your Honor."
2006.06-6407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,672.561,677.432,Would it be within the discretion of the district court to send it back to the State?
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,687.037,689.589,--I... I would think not.
2006.06-6407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,718.592,729.482,"It may be much harder for you to get that standard on this Court's review of a collateral proceeding than this Court's review of a state proceeding, because of AEDPA."
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,729.482,742.374,But our contention is that the AEDPA does not prevent this Court from addressing the merits of the constitutional issue here.
2006.06-6407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,742.374,743.274,Because?
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,743.274,756.3,"Because the State court did not abide by the minimum due process procedures set out by Justice Powell's opinion in Ford versus Wainwright, and that is the clearly established law even though it is a concurring opinion."
2006.06-6407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,762.204,763.287,Before we get too far into the merits--
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,763.287,763.504,Yes.
2006.06-6407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,763.504,766.104,"--I, I'm not done about the jurisdiction yet."
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,803.712,806.247,"You don't have to overrule Burton, Your Honor."
2006.06-6407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,994.736,998.288,These... these were not appointed by the prosecutor; they were appointed by the court?
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,998.288,998.788,That's correct.
2006.06-6407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,998.788,999.004,Am I right?
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,999.004,999.554,Yes.
2006.06-6407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,999.554,1001.054,And you say that's inadequate.
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,1011.01,1013.795,"I respectfully disagree, Your Honor."
2006.06-6407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1056.391,1064.06,"It doesn't seem to me, and there's nothing in our history that requires, that you need a full dress trial to decide this issue."
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,1092.378,1094.98,"And we're not asking for that, Your Honor."
2006.06-6407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1136.69,1139.292,"You... you... you did have your own expert, though?"
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,1141.944,1143.68,--We had a pro bono expert--
2006.06-6407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1143.68,1143.996,Well.
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,1143.996,1144.513,--who--
2006.06-6407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1144.513,1145.063,Who was--
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,1145.063,1153.118,"--allowed us, but we, we went back to the well and he was not able to help us anymore after that initial threshold showing that we made."
2006.06-6407,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1179.066,1188.172,Your position is that the affidavit submitted to the district court by the psychiatrists are sufficient to vindicate your substantive position that he cannot be executed under Ford?
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,1188.172,1189.624,--That's right.
2006.06-6407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1219.143,1229.416,"--This very important matter is going to be decided on the basis of the opinion of one, one justice, what, 30 years ago?"
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,1229.416,1231.218,Your Honor--
2006.06-6407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1231.218,1244.192,"You have no other appeal to a long tradition of how we determine this matter, but just one opinion by one justice because he was the lowest common denominator on the Court at that time."
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,1246.794,1249.913,--That's not what Justice Powell did.
2006.06-6407,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1296.143,1297.845,Could you maybe elaborate on that?
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,1331.234,1339.255,"--I think that's the very nature of the Ford right, that it is something that intervenes."
2006.06-6407,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1354.265,1356.715,Well does he understand why he's being imprisoned?
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,1367.673,1382.515,"--I think that would be a different situation, Your Honor, because number one, we don't have a common law heritage stretching back a thousand years to prevent the incapacitation or the incarceration of the mentally incompetent."
2006.06-6407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1385.55,1388.502,We didn't have incarceration.
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,1388.502,1389.419,--Excuse me?
2006.06-6407,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1389.419,1392.871,We didn't have incarceration extending back a thousand years.
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,1397.775,1408.148,"The... the difference, though, I think, is if you're going to incarcerate somebody or incapacitate them, we're not concerned with their mental state."
2006.06-6407,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1415.487,1415.72,No.
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,1424.425,1439.602,"In capital punishment, yes, but I guess I'm responding to your hypothetical, a person who is sentenced to life in prison who is mentally incompetent, and I would think that the main goal there is incapacitation, deterrence."
2006.06-6407,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1439.602,1441.252,How far does your argument go?
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,1456.731,1458.714,"No, Your Honor, it doesn't."
2006.06-6407,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1474.192,1474.725,All right.
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,1516.185,1520.387,I would say that person does not.
2006.06-6407,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1555.942,1559.179,"It's more than... in my hypothetical, it's more than a purported reason."
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,1600.756,1605.708,"I think the difference in your hypothetical has to be, Your Honor, that it's the crime itself."
2006.06-6407,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1615.182,1624.038,"Well, do you claim in this case that he does not understand that he was convicted of committing a crime or that he thinks he didn't commit a crime?"
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,1624.038,1626.438,"No, not that he does not--"
2006.06-6407,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1626.438,1634.66,"If that's the case, then every person who believes he's innocent of the crime is at least a candidate for the rule that you're asking for."
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,1634.66,1637.612,"--I would disagree, Your Honor."
2006.06-6407,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1647.654,1659.877,"One problem with a mental illness that is a peculiar feature of this case, in other cases something different is introduced late."
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,1718.916,1729.122,"--I think the difference has to be, Your Honor, that, yes, he has suffered from a delusion for 20 years and that's the spiritual warfare between himself and the devil."
2006.06-6407,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1754.589,1762.677,You mean we can't predict that the delusion today is the same delusion yesterday?
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,1763.879,1767.247,--I wouldn't say that the delusion itself is changing.
2006.06-6407,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1772.9,1776.002,"Well, it's taken a specific form because the circumstance is different."
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,1789.929,1792.095,"--That's true, Your Honor."
2006.06-6407,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1813.175,1814.627,"Thank you, counsel."
2006.06-6407,0,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,1814.627,1814.944,Thank you.
2006.06-6407,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1814.944,1816.496,Mr. Cruz?
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1816.496,1824.233,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.06-6407,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1863.81,1869.797,How should he have raised the claim to avoid the second or successive bar?
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1869.797,1874.599,He could have raised it in precisely the same way the petitioner did in Martinez-Villareal.
2006.06-6407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1888.407,1889.876,"Yes, but that's a silly fiction."
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1918.926,1925.782,"Justice Souter, I don't disagree with you that as a policy matter it's not the most satisfactory outcome."
2006.06-6407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1938.84,1940.874,"Yes, but you can deal with the text of this."
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1992.39,1996.942,In our judgment that reading is not consistent with the plain text of the statute.
2006.06-6407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2013.721,2022.344,"More than that, the section goes on to make an exception from the bar of second or successive."
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2056.25,2058.317,"Justice Scalia, I think that's exactly correct."
2006.06-6407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2058.317,2064.737,Then what do you say to the indication from those two exceptions that Congress simply wasn't adverting to this problem?
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2064.737,2074.71,Congress may not have been... I don't doubt that there is a real possibility Congress in drafting this statute was not specifically considering Ford claims.
2006.06-6407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2085.768,2086.152,Has.
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2089.853,2095.424,"Well, but given the exceptions, also every claim he intends to raise at any point in the proceeding."
2006.06-6407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2110.101,2132.864,"You in effect are telling us that we've got to read this to mean that any claim that he could conceivably have under any set of conceivable circumstances has got to be raised on the first petition with these two exceptions, and that in effect is a formula for frivolous pleading and, I mean, Congress couldn't have intended that."
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2132.864,2139.501,--Congress intended that this statute be followed in order to have Federal district court jurisdiction over claims.
2006.06-6407,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2139.501,2153.511,"This would mean that in every first Federal habeas, no matter how farfetched, every single Federal petitioner has to bring a Ford claim."
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2179.845,2187.517,"Justice Ginsburg, I believe that is the way the Court found in Martinez-Villareal, to harmonize Ford claims with 2244."
2006.06-6407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2187.517,2190.219,"What's your opinion, then, how this is supposed to work?"
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2209.43,2211.382,"Justice Breyer, I agree with you."
2006.06-6407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2212.282,2213.332,I don't want you to agree with me.
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2215.018,2219.572,"--That hypothetical we discussed in our brief, precisely the one you raised."
2006.06-6407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2219.572,2222.524,"And what's your opinion, because I didn't memorize every page."
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2225.226,2229.428,"Under the plain text of the statute, that individual would be barred access to Federal district court."
2006.06-6407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2229.428,2244.603,"So your opinion is... and then is that constitutional, if in fact Congress passes a statute and says there will be no court review of a person who clearly the Constitution forbids to execute, the State to execute him."
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2255.661,2259.03,"Respectfully, Justice Breyer, that's not our position, because Texas State law--"
2006.06-6407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2259.03,2259.947,I know that's not--
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2259.947,2275.207,"--provides court review, and so that individual could raise a claim in State court, and the State proceeding does not require that it had been raised previously, and this Court would have certiorari jurisdiction over any decision from Federal... from State Court rejecting that claim."
2006.06-6407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2281.111,2284.162,The Constitution doesn't require Federal district court review.
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2284.162,2285.297,That's correct.
2006.06-6407,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2287.732,2288.282,"Okay, I got that."
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2292.584,2295.536,The Court court do see.
2006.06-6407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2295.536,2326.388,"--Well, why not?"
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2327.088,2328.673,The Court could do so--
2006.06-6407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2328.673,2329.557,Would you object if we do that?
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2329.557,2330.49,"--Yes, we would."
2006.06-6407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2330.49,2330.959,Because?
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2330.959,2344.517,"Because the Court has made clear that the standards for an original habeas corpus are particularly exacting and are informed by the legislation Congress has passed governing habeas, and in particular Section 2254."
2006.06-6407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2412.411,2413.946,And I don't know that he's disputing that.
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2434.008,2436.026,"Justice Souter, there was a means."
2006.06-6407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2443.132,2446.417,You gave him one week and there were no funds for his own psychiatrist.
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2446.417,2452.154,"Justice Kennedy, that's correct, but that leads to the second argument that the State should have paid for a psychiatrist."
2006.06-6407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2488.511,2500.652,You do agree that Ford stands for the proposition that there must be a hearing that meets the essentials of fairness so that the defendant can contradict the hearings that... the conclusions of the State-appointed psychiatrist?
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2500.652,2506.789,"Justice Kennedy, I would frame the holding a little more narrowly, and I would use Justice Powell's words because his was the controlling concurrence."
2006.06-6407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2547.866,2566.661,"There's also the substantive part, that is, I think there's also an argument that the district court here, and the court of appeals, applied not just Justice Powell, but Marshall's even stronger, and they took... they say about the same thing in Ford, I didn't see much of a difference, but if there is, take Powell."
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2634.056,2646.196,"Justice Breyer, the argument that you suggest, Panetti has at no point made an argument that substantively the State court decision violated clearly established law."
2006.06-6407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2661.356,2676.335,"But I did understand counsel's argument to say that relief must be given, he cannot be executed, if he lacks the capacity to form a rational understanding of the nature and justification for the punishment."
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2690.908,2697.164,"--Justice Kennedy, we agree with the proposition that executing the insane is unconstitutional."
2006.06-6407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2698.331,2703.318,"So we're talking about what insane means, and that's a lay term."
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2719.078,2723.13,That test is very close to the test the State proposes.
2006.06-6407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2740.574,2741.441,But suppose you went back.
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2787.655,2790.524,"In this case, Panetti satisfies that test."
2006.06-6407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2790.524,2792.209,That may be.
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2801.832,2805.017,There's no reason to do so.
2006.06-6407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2821.561,2827.097,But that's different from having a rational capacity to understand the nature and justification for the punishment.
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2845.594,2853.764,"Well, it extends a little further than there in that the test that Panetti possess rational understanding is found nowhere in any holding from this Court."
2006.06-6407,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2853.764,2862.62,"What about just repeating... see, what is worrying me is that the district court said precisely what the Fifth Circuit said, indeed stronger."
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2891.989,2903.697,"As an initial matter, I do not believe the Court has jurisdiction to reach it because of 2254, because of the proceedings that on any level comply with clearly established holdings from Ford."
2006.06-6407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2909.953,2915.571,I really do need your help on a procedural part of AEDPA.
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2938.603,2940.472,Yes.
2006.06-6407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2945.174,2946.559,I was asking the question.
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2947.559,2953.963,--I agree with you that the better course if the district court had concluded that would have been to send it back to the State court.
2006.06-6407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2953.963,2955.229,And it had discretion to do that?
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2955.229,2957.348,I don't believe the district court had discretion--
2006.06-6407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2957.348,2958.281,"No, no."
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2959.7,2962.067,--I believe he had to do that.
2006.06-6407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2994.873,3003.896,"What do you do if there's incompetency of counsel in a routine, not a death case, incompetency of counsel, and the district court finds incompetency of counsel?"
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3010.565,3029.694,"In that circumstance, if the underlying failure, the unconstitutional action, is a failure to provide enough proceedings in a State court, I agree with your suggestion that the better course of action, the course consistent with AEDPA, is to send it back to the State court to provide that procedure."
2006.06-6407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3041.419,3047.573,"Mr. Cruz, may I just go back to the suggestion that there be, in effect, a remand to the State court."
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3063.182,3078.525,"That is not the case, and in fact AEDPA provides the Federal district court can hold an evidentiary hearing and consider new facts if the claim goes to the underlying guilt of the offense."
2006.06-6407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3079.558,3082.044,"No, but it's acting, it's acting in its own right."
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3102.458,3109.813,"--Technically speaking, the way Federal district courts do this is they issue the writ conditioned, conditional upon the district court--"
2006.06-6407,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3110.813,3111.213,Sure.
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3111.213,3120.185,"And so I don't disagree with you that it's functioning not that different from an appellate court, but through the formalism of issuing a conditional writ."
2006.06-6407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3470.495,3479.97,"In your experience and in your present position, have you seen many condemned people with the symptoms as severe as this defendant?"
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3479.97,3484.088,--We... we have litigated cases where people have raised Ford claims.
2006.06-6407,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3547.078,3552.732,I don't suppose you have statistics of how many have been sentenced to death and have later been found incompetent?
2006.06-6407,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,3552.732,3559.652,We have endeavored to compile those statistics and that has been... we don't have any for the court.
2006.06-6407,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3577.162,3577.947,"Thank you, Mr. Cruz."
2006.06-6407,2,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,3586.0,3586.969,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2006.06-6407,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3628.396,3632.264,How would you phrase the test to determine how severe the mental illness has to be?
2006.06-6407,2,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,3632.264,3653.178,"I think it has to be a mental illness... again I would come back to the fact that the mental illness has to deprive the person of the capacity to make that rational understanding, and that's why delusional behavior is crucial in most of these cases to depriving that person of the capacity."
2006.06-6407,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3667.504,3669.373,Rational understanding of what?
2006.06-6407,2,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,3686.049,3693.922,He has to have a rational understanding that he is being executed precisely because of the crime that he committed.
2006.06-6407,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3705.194,3712.134,"So... so if he, if he firmly believes for whatever reason that he's innocent, then he can't be executed under your test."
2006.06-6407,2,26330,gregory_w_wiercioch,,3712.134,3715.001,--I would disagree Your Honor.
2006.06-6407,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3737.563,3738.452,"Thank you, Counsel."
