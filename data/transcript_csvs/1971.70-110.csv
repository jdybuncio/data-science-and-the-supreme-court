1971.70-110,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.387,Wisconsin against Yoder and others.
1971.70-110,0,29763,john_w_calhoun,,11.481,15.971,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-110,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,155.707,159.113,"The state law requires attendance of school, what, through a certain age (Voice Overlap)?"
1971.70-110,0,29763,john_w_calhoun,,159.113,162.387,"Yes, that is through a certain age."
1971.70-110,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,162.387,163.351,Sixteen?
1971.70-110,0,29763,john_w_calhoun,,163.351,167.162,"Yes, 7 through 16."
1971.70-110,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,173.978,194.104,"That would mean, would it not, that if you have a remarkable or unusual child who began school when he was four and whose parents wanted to take him out to pursue his own studies at a point, he would still have to go school formally until he was 16?"
1971.70-110,0,29763,john_w_calhoun,,194.104,206.338,"If he could show achievement equivalent to a high school education at any point, he would be excused from the compulsory school attendance law."
1971.70-110,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,206.338,211.578,"So the achievement test is interposed on the arbitrary 16, is it not?"
1971.70-110,0,29763,john_w_calhoun,,211.578,246.11,"Yes, there is an area of discretion there to be exercised by the State Superintendent of the Public Instruction, Your Honor and this provides for a certain unusual cases and of course there are exemptions for a health problems and handicaps and that sort of thing, but there is no problem with respect to the substantial equivalency of the education, the discretion resting with the State Superintendent of the Public Instruction."
1971.70-110,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,319.761,330.846,What happens in Wisconsin on the year of statute if a person aged under 16 wants to go of into a vocational school?
1971.70-110,0,29763,john_w_calhoun,,330.846,335.726,"We have a vocational school situation in the law, Your Honor which --"
1971.70-110,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,335.726,337.049,That is considered?
1971.70-110,0,29763,john_w_calhoun,,337.049,337.682,Yes.
1971.70-110,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,337.682,338.515,That is the meaning?
1971.70-110,0,29763,john_w_calhoun,,338.515,374.9,"Yes, that is a rather elaborate system of vocational schools in Wisconsin and there is a provision specifically for children to attend the vocational school if that vocational school is within the school district and the Trial Court asked the same question in this area and was satisfied that the vocational school law probably had no particular applications in this case, although vocational school is certainly open and available to all people in Wisconsin."
1971.70-110,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,374.9,380.547,"Generally, what is the range of training in a vocational school?"
1971.70-110,0,29763,john_w_calhoun,,380.547,384.07,The range is very broad.
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,1560.472,1564.924,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-110,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1898.713,1903.368,"The Amish are in what, about a dozen or 15 states of the union something?"
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,1903.368,1907.239,"Yes, about 15 Mr. Justice Stewart."
1971.70-110,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1907.239,1908.748,And is it about?
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,1908.748,1910.4,"About 50,000 people."
1971.70-110,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1910.4,1919.503,"And each Amish Community is unique in a way, is it not, there are local variations among them, are they not among there?"
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,1919.503,1921.112,There are slight variations among them.
1971.70-110,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1937.965,1939.001,Same basic life now?
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,1939.001,1939.958,Yes sir.
1971.70-110,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1939.958,1942.284,It is based on their religious belief?
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,1942.284,1944.019,Yes sir.
1971.70-110,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1944.019,1948.097,And we are talking in this case about the Old Order Amish.
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,1953.394,1961.149,Old Order Amish and Order Mennonite and some variants of these same groups which are nevertheless basically the same.
1971.70-110,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1961.149,1964.409,They have a common (Voice Overlap) the Anabaptists as I understand?
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,1964.409,1966.331,"Yes, that is correct."
1971.70-110,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1966.331,1969.679,"And this particular people go back to Switzerland and they what, Sixteenth century?"
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,1969.679,1971.092,They do.
1971.70-110,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2160.872,2167.399,And Dr. Hostetler grew up in an Amish community and he is a Ph. D?
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2167.399,2168.249,That is correct.
1971.70-110,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2168.249,2170.023,And how is that to explain?
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2170.023,2172.282,It shows that he lets the Amish faith.
1971.70-110,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2223.24,2227.958,Is there a belief in elementary education or just an acceptance of it?
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2233.461,2239.522,"Well, they believe that those basic skills are sound and desirable for a child to have."
1971.70-110,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2246.162,2249.878,So there is more than just an acquiescence on is that there is an affirmative acceptance?
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2249.878,2253.59,"Yes, there is an affirmative acceptance of education on that point."
1971.70-110,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2253.59,2265.229,"Mr. Ball, I take that in the -- among the consistent adherence to the church, there are no professional people, no lawyers, no positions?"
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2265.229,2265.594,That is quite true Mr. Justice Blackmun.
1971.70-110,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2265.594,2268.279,Unless they come back after the education?
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2268.279,2270.653,"Yes, that is quite correct."
1971.70-110,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2270.653,2276.593,"And yet they do rely on, certainly on medical knowledge and elsewhere do they not?"
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2276.593,2278.563,"Yes, they rely upon medical knowledge."
1971.70-110,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2299.545,2302.325,They will seek medical treatment?
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2302.325,2304.404,"Yes, they will seek medical treatment."
1971.70-110,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2323.207,2329.63,"In that connection, is there any -- has there been any attempt to compromise the situation as evidently was done in Pennsylvania?"
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2329.63,2344.172,"Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun, the supplemental appendix sets forth the ethics which we made under a number of provisions of Wisconsin law in which we felt there was some daylight of these people."
1971.70-110,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2464.868,2476.358,"Well, one of those schools that the Attorney General has said the Amish have established is where they adhere to the state standards, is it not correct?"
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2476.358,2479.383,"Mr. Justice Brennan, those are all elementary schools."
1971.70-110,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2481.18,2483.471,"That is if you were reading, writing --"
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2483.471,2486.414,"Yes, that is correct Mr. Justice Brennan."
1971.70-110,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2535.08,2540.614,Why is that so much more traumatic than the eighth grade would be?
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2540.614,2547.701,"In the eighth grade, our particular defendants were in parochial schools, Amish parochial schools until the eighth grade."
1971.70-110,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2613.87,2626.429,"Do I understand that this particular community, the elementary school is more or less regional so that most of the students are Amish students or not, is that what you are saying?"
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2626.429,2628.299,"Yes, this is correct."
1971.70-110,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2633.278,2635.997,"They are around here, in this town?"
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2636.813,2650.566,"Yes, in fact it was understood that this prosecution was triggered by the very fact that as the record shows an Amish one to eighth grade school had been started."
1971.70-110,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2650.566,2651.539,"Yes, it had been started."
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2653.228,2653.768,Now these children --
1971.70-110,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2653.768,2656.487,What about that time they went to the regular?
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2656.487,2660.532,There is a number -- many Amish children have attended public schools Mr. Justice Marshall.
1971.70-110,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2660.532,2663.791,"Well, where they mixed in with others or where they --"
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2663.791,2664.403,Yes.
1971.70-110,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2664.403,2666.469,Because of locality?
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2666.469,2667.241,The pattern varies.
1971.70-110,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2672.341,2675.659,But in the high school level there would be broader mix obviously?
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2675.659,2686.675,In the high school level it would be a very much broader mix and at the time of high school the child is then in the Amish religion being prepared for a complete vocation in Amish life.
1971.70-110,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2709.696,2733.508,"The religious point of view, is this elementary education approach somewhat like that of the Jewish faith with the -- I think it is age 13 when a Jewish child is considered to have become a mature adult?"
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2733.508,2734.055,Yes.
1971.70-110,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2734.055,2738.496,Is there an analogy between the Amish attitude and that with the Jewish faith?
1971.70-110,1,43859,william_b_ball,,2738.496,2755.034,I think it is quite a close analogy Mr. Chief Justice Burger and I think that is well brought out by the way in the brief of the -- brief amicus curiae in this case by the Synagogue Council of America and other related Jewish groups.
1971.70-110,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3359.159,3361.548,Thank you Mr. Ball.
1971.70-110,2,29763,john_w_calhoun,,3370.883,3375.822,We have absolutely no quarrel to the Amish way of life.
1971.70-110,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3476.976,3478.365,How can you say that counsel?
1971.70-110,2,29763,john_w_calhoun,,3495.483,3505.04,"Yes, but it is -- It is -- Yes, seven or eight and now sixth grade is considered in some areas as elementary education."
1971.70-110,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3548.82,3570.914,"Well, have not some very distinguished educators been very critical of the American System because it was concentrating on courses like interpersonal relations, community relations, etcetera which students who could not spell and read adequately and write by the time they get out of high school?"
1971.70-110,2,29763,john_w_calhoun,,3570.914,3572.978,May I suggest that that is true.
1971.70-110,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3616.792,3629.384,"Mr. Calhoun, do you agree with Mr. Ball’s statement that this is absolutely against the religion, to go to school beyond the elementary school?"
1971.70-110,2,29763,john_w_calhoun,,3629.384,3631.494,I do not agree with it fundamentally.
1971.70-110,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3632.157,3635.078,Do you have anything in the record to contradict this?
1971.70-110,2,29763,john_w_calhoun,,3635.078,3641.669,"That -- Yes, the Trial Court found -- If you just bear with me, I will find that point."
1971.70-110,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3641.669,3654.404,"Well, if it is a finding by the way that the Supreme Court has rejected it, does it not -- it will not help you very much, will it?"
1971.70-110,2,29763,john_w_calhoun,,3654.404,3654.944,Pardon me.
1971.70-110,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3654.944,3660.893,"If one of the findings of the Supreme Court Wisconsin rejected it, it will not help you very much?"
1971.70-110,2,29763,john_w_calhoun,,3660.893,3674.178,"No, it is not -- what it says is that they did not exactly reject it, but it just did not consider and it is this, on page 181 of the appendix."
1971.70-110,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3695.788,3699.396,Now this is a memorandum decision by the Circuit Court?
1971.70-110,2,29763,john_w_calhoun,,3699.396,3700.506,That is right.
1971.70-110,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3700.506,3703.412,"I wonder, is there any evidence?"
1971.70-110,2,29763,john_w_calhoun,,3709.162,3722.343,There is -- There was no expert testimony that contradicted the Amish testimony except the testimony of the state superintendent of the schools in the county.
1971.70-110,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3722.343,3728.318,Did he know anything about the Amish law or any doctrines?
1971.70-110,2,29763,john_w_calhoun,,3728.318,3729.178,Yes.
1971.70-110,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3729.178,3729.777,He did?
1971.70-110,2,29763,john_w_calhoun,,3729.777,3730.288,He had.
1971.70-110,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3735.232,3739.762,You deny that it is not the part of their faith that they should not go to public schools beyond the eighth grade?
1971.70-110,2,29763,john_w_calhoun,,3739.762,3780.748,"No, I deny that -- I say this, that the Trial Court found that this did not interfere with the religious belief as such but with their freedom to act and that the freedom to act, the restriction of the freedom to act here was a reasonable one which has been imposed since 1642 in this country, that the compulsory school-attendance is not a law which has just recently been enforced."
1971.70-110,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3787.183,3788.311,"Very well, Mr. Calhoun."
