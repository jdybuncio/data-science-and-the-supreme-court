1972.71-1371,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,2.583,Mr. Neuborne?
1972.71-1371,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,2.583,5.573,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1371,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,316.827,330.539,Does the impact of your position has an effect on the parties and on people who are already registered in one political party or the other?
1972.71-1371,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,330.539,331.119,I think not sir.
1972.71-1371,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,334.852,345.182,"What about those who?ve already joined one and they wanted to vote in the primary of the other party, wouldn?t your, the adoption since you opened that up --"
1972.71-1371,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,345.182,346.246,I Understand sir.
1972.71-1371,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,354.09,356.364,Is that all you really to seek --
1972.71-1371,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,356.364,377.214,"No sir, we are not, we believe that the application of the New York process even to persons who have been members of one political party and who seek to alter their party affiliations raise very serious constitutional questions and we believe that under the least drastic alternative analysis which this Court has evolved that even those regulations cannot stand, but I simply --"
1972.71-1371,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,377.214,381.259,"Is there something in the record to show what, in what category the name plaintiff?s are?"
1972.71-1371,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,381.259,381.407,Oh!
1972.71-1371,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,392.222,398.415,"Well, it?s clear then that they are in the class of people who move from one county to another or from one state to another?"
1972.71-1371,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,398.415,400.495,That is correct also Your Honor.
1972.71-1371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,400.495,412.679,"Can your narrower argument would be that the state?s interest against raiding, if it be a legitimate interest, can be adequately protected by dealing only with those who have been already registered?"
1972.71-1371,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,412.679,422.786,"Precisely, by dealing with the potential class from which, if raiders are to come at all, they will come."
1972.71-1371,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,710.85,713.12,We?ll resume there right after lunch.
1972.71-1371,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,734.044,734.409,Thank you sir.
1972.71-1371,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,949.775,954.935,[Inaudible] so that would be an awfully hard thing to prove?
1972.71-1371,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,954.935,977.989,"Your Honor, the proof that has been adduced in the various cases was to show a pattern of persons moving from one party into another party filing virtually identical declaratory statements with a long history of having been engaged in a contrary political activity and some evidence that they intended at some future time to go back to that party."
1972.71-1371,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1001.478,1005.369,"That?s before the damage is done, before the --"
1972.71-1371,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1005.369,1007.636,"It?s brought on exceptionally quickly, yes sir."
1972.71-1371,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1032.549,1035.71,How many cases have gone through judicial review?
1972.71-1371,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1035.71,1043.309,"There are approximately 10 reported cases in New York state, situations such as this."
1972.71-1371,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1043.309,1045.134,Over what period of time?
1972.71-1371,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1045.134,1053.894,"Well, we?ve had Section 186 on the books, in one form or another since the end of the 19th Century."
1972.71-1371,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1099.082,1103.211,Well when did the statute before us come on the books?
1972.71-1371,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1103.211,1104.478,"Section 186, Your Honor?"
1972.71-1371,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1104.478,1105.573,The one that we?re now dealing with here?
1972.71-1371,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1105.573,1105.907,Yes sir.
1972.71-1371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1196.286,1208.921,Might not that pose some kind of serious administrative problems though to the registration officials that one party could be in and one party be out as long as you do have a state registration system?
1972.71-1371,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1208.921,1209.971,I think not sir.
1972.71-1371,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1392.203,1400.727,"Of course, you do have a fairly unique situation in New York with your four recognized parties, don?t you?"
1972.71-1371,0,17909,burt_neuborne,,1400.727,1410.571,I don?t clam to be an expert on the political party structure of the other 49 states but I would be surprised if there were not minority parties in other states as well.
1972.71-1371,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1679.717,1683.469,Very well Mr. Neuborne.
1972.71-1371,1,16011,a_seth_greenwald,,1685.837,1690.659,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1371,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1748.119,1761.68,"You think these problems are the same for first voters as for all others, people who are moving and people who just haven?t ever bothered to register over a lifetime?"
1972.71-1371,1,16011,a_seth_greenwald,,1761.68,1773.482,"New York has in Section 196, a general rule that provides the registrations, excuse me, enrollments must be accomplished before the general election to avoid the danger of raidiing."
1972.71-1371,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,3525.02,3527.144,Yes sir.
1972.71-1371,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3556.564,3567.108,"Mr. Neuborne, barred as a candidate by virtue of a provision dealing with candidates or was he barred as a candidate by virtue of this provision dealing with registration as a voter."
1972.71-1371,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,3567.108,3570.336,I know of no provision that deals only with candidates so assume it was this.
1972.71-1371,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3570.336,3572.081,It would?ve been this provision then?
1972.71-1371,2,17909,burt_neuborne,,3572.081,3574.805,"Secondly, a more importantly Your Honor, I suggest --"
