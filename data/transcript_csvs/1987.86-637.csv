1987.86-637,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.356,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 86-637, Communication Workers of America versus Harry E. Beck."
1987.86-637,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,12.558,22.997,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1987.86-637,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,303.863,307.917,"The second proviso is then a proviso to the first proviso, so to speak?"
1987.86-637,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,307.917,313.738,I think both provisos are provisos to the basic prohibition.
1987.86-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,446.139,448.089,"Mr. Gold, is there no ambiguity there?"
1987.86-637,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,486.966,502.392,"First of all on initiation fees, Congress did decide to regulate the amounts in part for the type of concern that you've stated."
1987.86-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,560.478,581.475,"But if that's what Congress intended, it could simply have said, instead of the failure of the employee to tender the periodic dues and the initiation fees uniformly required, it could have simply said the failure of the employee to tender any amount of money uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership."
1987.86-637,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,583.591,593.199,"For a good reason, and certainly would have preferred the language you just articulated."
1987.86-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,618.648,620.95,"But they wouldn't have been uniform anyway, so you didn't have to use."
1987.86-637,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,620.95,621.433,Sure.
1987.86-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,622.552,624.052,Uniformly required as a condition of acquiring?
1987.86-637,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,624.052,625.118,Yes.
1987.86-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,689.745,694.232,"But if you eliminated that and put it in the dues, it would be okay, which the union could do, I presume?"
1987.86-637,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,694.232,694.881,That's right.
1987.86-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,694.881,698.266,"We're not going to have any more assessments, we're just going to raise the dues three dollars a year."
1987.86-637,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,698.266,735.476,"If the union can, and the Landrom-Griffin Act provides that you have to get membership approval, as opposed to the situation of public bodies where the representative can act, provide that where the union goes to its members and says we want x dues and makes the case to them, and then each month or each quarter someone has to pay that, that is dues."
1987.86-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,735.476,745.998,"So your answer to my question is, no matter what they use it for, including retirement benefits available only to union members, so long as they do it through dues, they can get it from the non-union members."
1987.86-637,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,745.998,746.848,That's correct.
1987.86-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,746.848,747.45,No matter what?
1987.86-637,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,747.45,748.317,No matter what.
1987.86-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,748.317,750.569,Annual party or anything at all?
1987.86-637,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,750.569,752.036,Having a party?
1987.86-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,752.036,753.052,Yes?
1987.86-637,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,753.052,754.304,Yes.
1987.86-637,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,822.665,841.828,"Mr. Gold, what about Judge Murnaghan's argument that the duty of fair representation as regards these non-union members should lead to the result for which he argued."
1987.86-637,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,849.732,861.307,"I had hoped we had dealt with it more, but let me go back to the language of the first proviso of 8(a)(3)."
1987.86-637,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,974.43,988.656,"But certainly the language very similar to that in 8(a)(3) is found in the Railway Labor Act, and this Court has said it just doesn't include collection of dues of that kind against non-members."
1987.86-637,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,992.775,1001.148,"The Court, as Justice O'Connor just stated, does not write on a blank slate here."
1987.86-637,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1246.154,1250.373,"Mr. Gold, can I ask you a question that Justice Scalia's question raises in my mind."
1987.86-637,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1281.911,1290.35,I think there are two questions in terms of what you've asked.
1987.86-637,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1298.705,1299.622,Right.
1987.86-637,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1299.622,1308.311,It is our submission that it is not a fair interpretation of the Statute.
1987.86-637,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1350.805,1371.135,"But it's conceivable... I don't know as much history as you do in this area... but it's conceivable that what was known in 1946 was a form of union dues which was used exclusively for things like collective bargaining, and that premiums for the benefit of the membership only and not for non-members would not be treated as union dues within the meaning of the Statute."
1987.86-637,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1371.135,1390.513,"I can only in that regard since I'm hardly a dispassionate observer, refer you to Justice Frankfurter's dissenting opinion in Street with regard to the facts of the matter."
1987.86-637,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1419.699,1421.984,"Including the purposes at issue in this case, Mr. Gold?"
1987.86-637,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1421.984,1422.518,Yes.
1987.86-637,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1422.518,1436.327,"So that, I'm really troubled by the prospect that I gave you in my hypothetical, and what you're saying is that in order to decide this case, we really don't have to decide that hypothetical."
1987.86-637,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1444.814,1445.199,Yes.
1987.86-637,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1445.199,1451.17,"And if some particular union should come up with the kind of scheme I just described, which I take it you're not familiar with anywhere, are you?"
1987.86-637,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1451.17,1451.62,No.
1987.86-637,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1451.62,1453.537,Retirement system funded out of dues.
1987.86-637,0,34494,laurence_e_gold,,1461.693,1464.109,"Well, it isn't rather I'd rather have the whole loaf or not."
1987.86-637,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1642.075,1646.712,"Thank you, Mr. Gold."
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,1648.595,1652.116,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.86-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1908.46,1910.812,"Strange way to say that, isn't it?"
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,1918.149,1922.203,"Well, Justice Scalia, they said that in the Railway Labor Act in 1951."
1987.86-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1923.236,1924.086,"It's strange there, too."
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,1924.086,1941.747,"--Your Honor, this Court has held in Street, in Allen, and in Ellis that that somewhat strange, at least as we're using the term now, use of terminology leads to the conclusion in Section (2)(4) that only collective bargaining costs can be charged."
1987.86-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2003.572,2004.774,I think he might have.
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2011.761,2017.914,Mr. Gold agrees that he comes to this not in a position of objectivity.
1987.86-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2017.914,2030.055,Mr. Gold's position is that it's better than what the pre-existing situation was where you could be compelled to pay the full dues and also be compelled to be a full-fledged union member.
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2030.055,2034.793,Well that's an interesting question as to what was required under Section 8(a)(3).
1987.86-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2215.694,2219.895,"That makes a lot of sense and the States can do that under the current law, if they want to, can't they."
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2235.44,2236.274,"--Well, that's true."
1987.86-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2236.274,2239.107,And that's a big difference between this and the Railway Labor Act.
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2239.107,2265.257,"Well, it's a big difference in the sense that the States have the ability to interfere in this Act, and therefore we don't have a primary jurisdiction problem that we might have otherwise, but I'm not sure it's so important in terms of the effect between the employee and the union, for instance, in a State like California, which doesn't have such a provision, doesn't have a Right to Work law."
1987.86-637,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2362.138,2364.973,In cooperation with the employer.
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2364.973,2365.69,Absolutely.
1987.86-637,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2420.208,2426.678,"Yes, but that doesn't mean that everything the union does is required by law."
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2426.678,2427.278,--Excuse me?
1987.86-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2427.278,2433.784,"Well, that doesn't mean that the union is always in the status of exercising official power."
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2433.784,2436.902,Only when it's exercising its 9(a) power.
1987.86-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2459.666,2468.922,What's Steele got to do with this particular case about the right of the union to charge dues equal to the dues charged union members?
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2468.922,2470.707,The union cannot make--
1987.86-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2470.707,2475.909,Why is that a State action?
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2475.909,2483.848,"--The union cannot make a Section 8(a)(3) agreement unless it is a 9(a) representative, so says the statute."
1987.86-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2503.425,2525.707,"I suppose if the union didn't negotiate this kind of an agreement, and just didn't charge the non-members anything, I suppose the union could be sued by its members saying you're not fairly representing us."
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2532.111,2536.23,"Well, it would be an interesting situation for the voluntary union members to sue their own union."
1987.86-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2536.23,2539.765,"It might be very interesting, but not unheard of."
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2550.406,2567.951,So the question you're positing would be would governmental action be infused in an internal union decision because the union is exercising some powers as a 9(a) representative.
1987.86-637,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2597.554,2603.957,"Because they're violating the equal protection clause, they are in effect the government of a government action?"
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2603.957,2605.909,"Well, we go back to the duty of fair representation."
1987.86-637,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2626.24,2641.915,"What was involved with Steele was only the cooperation of the Brotherhood and the Railroad in refusing to promote negro firemen, period."
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2644.701,2647.653,"Well, they created the duty of fair representation in that case."
1987.86-637,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2647.653,2648.753,They did?
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2648.753,2649.486,"Oh, yes."
1987.86-637,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2649.486,2653.807,I thought the statute did.
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2653.807,2654.54,"Well, let me put it this way."
1987.86-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2656.342,2659.311,"It was always there, wasn't it?"
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2659.311,2665.365,"Well, if they found it there, it must have been there."
1987.86-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2665.365,2666.881,"Right, right."
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2666.881,2668.65,At the time that Congress created the statute.
1987.86-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2668.65,2669.583,Exactly.
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2669.583,2678.855,"The impetus for finding it, the light by which they found it was the recognition that if they couldn't find it, they had another problem."
1987.86-637,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2678.855,2681.557,"Well, you don't have any mediation board here, do you?"
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2681.557,2682.674,"Excuse me, sir?"
1987.86-637,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2682.674,2686.676,"You don't have the mediation board involved in this case, do you?"
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2686.676,2688.461,"Well, we didn't have it there."
1987.86-637,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2688.461,2689.628,You didn't.
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2689.628,2690.246,Yes.
1987.86-637,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2695.881,2708.374,"Wasn't that case, didn't that case say that the members of the mediation board cooperated with the Brotherhood in discriminating against the negro firemen, period."
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2708.374,2712.91,"Forming the original discriminatory agreement, yes."
1987.86-637,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2715.028,2717.73,"So you don't have the mediation board here, do you?"
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2720.932,2723.634,"--No, I don't think so."
1987.86-637,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2723.634,2732.239,"One's the railroad and the mediation board, and this is a non-railroad and no mediation board."
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2732.239,2739.893,"Well, the Court in Steele came back to powers of the union."
1987.86-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2811.174,2829.82,"Under more recent cases, is just governmental permission to engage in a course of conduct, does that make the person who engages in that conduct, is he wielding official power?"
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2829.82,2831.703,"Well, it's not simply governmental permission."
1987.86-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2835.641,2842.478,"Well, the government says, you may extract these membership fees from non-members if you want to, but you don't have to."
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2846.08,2851.984,"--Well, they have disabled the non-union employee from doing anything about that."
1987.86-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2863.273,2876.599,So it's only because of the position the union has a collective bargaining agency that permits negotiating anything on behalf of a non-union member.
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2876.599,2877.149,--True.
1987.86-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2889.907,2900.196,"So if you decide to do it, you can do it over the objections of the non-member because we say so, because the law says so."
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2900.196,2901.013,--That's right.
1987.86-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2922.676,2931.346,Which of our cases comes closest to agreeing with you on this?
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2931.346,2934.382,In terms of whether 9(a) is governmental action?
1987.86-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2934.382,2935.334,Yes.
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2935.334,2936.0,Steele.
1987.86-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2936.0,2940.368,But how about the Railway Labor Act cases?
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2942.237,2948.307,"Well, Street in terms of the interpretation of the language of (2)(4), the exact parallel language to 8(a)(3)."
1987.86-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2948.307,2952.026,"Well, Street was really a statutory case, I guess."
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2952.026,2952.859,Even better for us.
1987.86-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2952.859,2957.413,"Well, I know, but a statutory case really doesn't--"
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2957.413,2959.949,I agree wholeheartedly with the opinion that that was a reasonable construction of the statute.
1987.86-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2972.256,2977.826,"--Well, I know, but if it's a statutory case, whether it's State action or not really doesn't make any difference."
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,2977.826,2978.476,Excellent.
1987.86-637,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3091.481,3108.458,"Well, now, but that doesn't make much sense as a matter of statutory construction to say that whatever Congress may have intended when it passed this in 1948, it's too late for us to do anything about because we've already made so many mistakes in the past."
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3108.458,3111.31,"Well, number one, I don't think that you've made a mistake."
1987.86-637,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3171.183,3177.002,"Mr. Vieira, could you talk about how practically feasible that is?"
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3204.985,3206.319,Not if they keep their books straight.
1987.86-637,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3239.658,3240.175,Yes.
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3240.175,3244.11,"And I think as soon as this Court rules that it has to live up to Beck, it will do the same thing here."
1987.86-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3245.896,3260.822,"Well, what happens if an employer refuses to collect this fair fee from non-members and says, I won't fire... I know that John Jones isn't paying, but I won't fire him."
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3262.456,3270.262,"Well, he's arguably committing an unfair labor practice, but under those two provisos in 8(a)(3), if he's correct, if the union has not in fact charged John Jones."
1987.86-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3270.262,3277.618,"Yes, but there's no argument but what the union wants to collect from him is fair."
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3280.735,3281.252,All right.
1987.86-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3285.187,3285.654,Exactly.
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3285.654,3288.306,It's the employer has violated.
1987.86-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3288.306,3290.841,So he is required to collect.
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3290.841,3291.725,"Oh, Yes."
1987.86-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3295.495,3302.316,And that's only by virtue of the coercive nature of the Federal law?
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3302.316,3308.72,"Well, he has a collective bargaining agreement he made with the union that was imposed on him through a 9(a) representational arrangement."
1987.86-637,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3308.72,3309.07,Yes.
1987.86-637,1,23336,edwin_vieira_jr,,3309.07,3310.22,Thank you.
1987.86-637,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3310.22,3311.255,"Thank you, Mr. Vieira."
1987.86-637,2,34494,laurence_e_gold,,3313.038,3314.29,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1987.86-637,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3447.592,3450.461,But how do you reconcile that with Street and Hanson?
1987.86-637,2,34494,laurence_e_gold,,3450.461,3457.65,"--Well, on Street and Hanson, let me refer you back to the materials."
1987.86-637,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3533.281,3534.948,"Thank you, Mr. Gold."
