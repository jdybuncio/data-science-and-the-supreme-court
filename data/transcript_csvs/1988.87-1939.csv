1988.87-1939,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.058,"We'll near argument next in No. 87-1939, Geoffrey W. Barnard v. Susan Esposito Thorstenn and Virgin Islands Bar Association v. Thorstenn."
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,65.208,67.575,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1939,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,191.772,200.278,"There's nothing in the Virgin Islands judicial system, like the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, that sits side by side with the federal district courts?"
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,200.278,201.028,"That's correct, Judge."
1988.87-1939,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,239.486,242.854,So we treat it as an instrumentality of the Virgin Islands?
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,242.854,246.74,"I believe that that is the correct treatment, at least to this extent, Justice Kennedy."
1988.87-1939,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,286.3,299.358,"But by the same token, I take it if it's an instrumentality of the Virgin Islands, then the federal statute making the... privileges immunities clause applicable to the Virgin Islands does apply here."
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,299.358,302.477,"Yes, the statute does apply and we are subject to the privileges and immunities."
1988.87-1939,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,302.477,302.91,All right.
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,302.91,323.39,"In addition to the fact that the District Court of the Virgin Islands is this special and unique hybrid court, the Virgin Islands is in a factual setting which is quite unlike any that have reached the federal courts before, either under Frazier or under the several other cases which have been decided, Piper v. New Hampshire and Friedman v. Virginia."
1988.87-1939,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,347.589,352.925,"Ms. Hodge, would you say the circumstances are not too different from those on Guam?"
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,352.925,359.229,I... I am a little bit hesitant to speak of the circumstances in Guam since that is not an area with which I'm deeply familiar.
1988.87-1939,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,360.181,361.215,It is some distance from the mainland.
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,361.215,361.915,"--Yes, Justice I--"
1988.87-1939,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,361.915,368.252,"With similar problems, in some respects, at least as to transportation and distance."
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,368.252,373.573,--The problems in Guam that I'm reluctant to comment on would be those that exceed the question of being a long way away across water.
1988.87-1939,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,373.573,376.875,And how has Guam dealt with this problem?
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,377.727,399.056,"We are told... we are told that since the decision of this Court in Frazier, that Guam has rescinded its absolute prohibition on non-resident admissions and has adopted a rule which requires non-resident lawyers to have a local lawyer with whom they are affiliated, who appears with them in all proceedings and signs all pleadings with them."
1988.87-1939,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,399.056,402.758,How would that work in the Virgin Islands?
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,402.758,405.127,"We don't think that it would work, Judge, for several reasons."
1988.87-1939,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,405.644,407.177,I think we're generally called Justice.
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,407.177,408.112,--I'm sorry.
1988.87-1939,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,409.312,412.281,What... how do you think that would work here?
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,412.281,421.804,The reason that we don't think it would work is that the Virgin Islands has a set of circumstances that differ from those of other jurisdictions in excess of our geographic isolation.
1988.87-1939,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,459.945,466.368,"Could the lawyer who is assigned to do that for them, under a system like Guam, respond?"
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,466.368,476.99,"There would be at least one immediate problem with a system of that sort, and that is that it would clearly establish a kind of two-class system for the practice of law."
1988.87-1939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,533.727,548.153,"Excuse me, have our cases drawn any distinction as, as far as what the states must do between what they must do for residents of neighboring states as opposed to states on the other side of the country?"
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,556.175,573.22,"The only distinction that I am aware that's been recognized in the decisions between admission of nearby residents and very distant residents is, number one, that the cases have said that they think it is fair to assume that the vast majority of applicants for admission to a bar in a state in which they do not reside will be nearby residents."
1988.87-1939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,576.339,582.576,"But we didn't say that you wouldn't... you wouldn't have to apply the same rule to, to distant residents, if they... if they want to benefit from it?"
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,582.576,586.712,"Actually, if I may say so, the Court did say that a different rule could apply to distant residents."
1988.87-1939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,690.881,693.381,Who provides the telephone... who provides the telephone service?
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,693.381,696.951,"The name of our telephone company is the Virgin Islands Telephone Company, Justice."
1988.87-1939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,696.951,697.418,I see.
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,697.418,704.105,"It is a single company, it has an exclusive franchise, and there have been problems reported--"
1988.87-1939,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,704.105,704.605,"And, it doesn't work."
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,704.605,706.224,"--I, I [inaudible]."
1988.87-1939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,706.224,711.461,"You know, you can talk to Paris, you can talk to Tokyo, but you can't talk to the Virgin Islands--"
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,711.461,715.496,"It, it is certainly not a system that is a total failure, Justice Stephens."
1988.87-1939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,716.346,717.948,"--Maybe you... maybe you ought to get a new system, is--"
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,717.948,719.498,We are able to call the United States.
1988.87-1939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,738.028,742.314,--It seems to me that burden would... might be alleviated somewhat if you had more lawyers?
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,742.314,748.634,"Well that... it might be alleviated if we had more lawyers who were actually there, Judge... Justice, excuse me, Justice Stephens."
1988.87-1939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,749.551,752.872,"Well, your, your mistake in calling me Judge is also made in Article III of the Constitution, by the way."
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,754.238,755.022,"--I do, do apologize."
1988.87-1939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,765.762,767.964,What do you do with pro hac vice admissions?
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,769.031,769.814,--Yes.
1988.87-1939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,771.499,772.033,--Is it fairly common?
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,772.033,773.701,It is relatively common.
1988.87-1939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,778.437,780.605,I don't understand why you couldn't do the same thing with these people.
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,781.155,783.891,"--Well, the, the court has said two things about that Judge."
1988.87-1939,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,788.461,791.83,"We'll, we'll resume there at 1:00 o'clock, Ms. Hodge."
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,791.83,792.263,--Thank you.
1988.87-1939,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,792.263,799.852,"We'll resume, Ms. Hodge."
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,799.852,801.335,Thank you.
1988.87-1939,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,849.833,856.855,"Well, there's, there's nothing in the rule that says appointed counsel can't send a colleague to any hearing on any matter in an indigent case, is there?"
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,856.855,875.067,"There is not a statement in the written rule, but there is a well-established judicial authority to the effect that each lawyer in the Virgin Islands must accept his appointments on an individual basis, and his failure to do so can result in his loss of entitlement to be an active practitioner in the Virgin Islands."
1988.87-1939,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,878.768,881.22,You can't appoint an associate counsel?
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,881.22,881.704,That is correct.
1988.87-1939,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,882.672,887.041,"So suppose you don't think that you're qualified to hear a homicide case, you've got to try it all by yourself?"
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,887.041,896.997,--The only way that an attorney can be excused from the obligation to accept an appointment is by petitioning the court and making a showing that he is not qualified in his view to handle a particular matter.
1988.87-1939,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,913.442,918.679,Is that justified as being necessary for the smooth functioning of the public defender system?
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,918.679,924.333,"--It is justified by the courts of the Virgin Islands as being necessary to have a smooth, functioning equitable system."
1988.87-1939,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,938.593,941.293,So you're a tax attorney and you have to try the homicide case.
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,941.293,949.715,"--Well, it's quite unlikely that a tax attorney would not, if he petitioned for substitution, be permitted to have a different appointment."
1988.87-1939,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,953.001,953.936,They just give him a robbery case?
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,953.936,957.555,"--Well, there are many kinds of cases for which we're appointed, there are immigration cases."
1988.87-1939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1039.875,1044.01,How many... how many cases are we talking about for the average member of the... how many appointed cases--
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1044.01,1045.195,The affidavit--
1988.87-1939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1045.195,1053.349,"--does the tax... the one who gets the least, the tax lawyer who really doesn't want to get involved in criminal law at all, how many appointments will he typically take a year?"
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1053.349,1056.836,"--Can I just clarify and say, all lawyers take an equal number of appointments."
1988.87-1939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1062.338,1064.074,"Well, I just want to be sure that I'm asking about, you know, the most--"
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1064.074,1071.93,"The affidavits below suggest that as of the date of the evidentiary record here, approximately four appointments a year was considered average."
1988.87-1939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1080.285,1089.807,"--And your, your point is that if a non-resident lawyer could only handle three, that'd be unfair to those who handle four, and therefore you should have the rule."
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1089.807,1092.343,--Actually it would be unfair if he took any lesser number of appointments.
1988.87-1939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1102.115,1113.007,"And he might have to hire somebody else who then would take four by appointment and four by being hired, that's a total of eight, say, and that would be unfair to the other members of the bar because... for what reason again?"
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1113.007,1116.209,"--The local lawyers, the Virgin Islands lawyer would then be a disadvantaged group."
1988.87-1939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1119.911,1123.545,But they get paid for the four that the non-resident is willing to hire somebody to handle.
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1123.545,1126.647,"--But in, in addition to having to take more, they would in effect be--"
1988.87-1939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1126.647,1127.214,They'd take their four.
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1127.214,1130.199,"--It seems to us, a second-class bar."
1988.87-1939,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1137.705,1140.907,You don't want to go through our Civil War experience again.
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1140.907,1142.942,We do not want to relive that experience.
1988.87-1939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1156.4,1161.571,"But what if they let the non-residents in on condition, say, it's kind of inconvenient but you must take your four cases?"
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1161.571,1173.045,"--The District Court's decision below indicated that it was the opinion of the judge that if the rule were evenly applied to all that the non-residents would inevitably fail in their effort to comply, no matter how well intentioned they were."
1988.87-1939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1173.045,1174.361,"Why don't you say, then you get disbarred if you fail?"
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1174.361,1178.949,"Well, it would be possible to try the experience, but the difficulty would be--"
1988.87-1939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1178.949,1180.901,Do you disbar them now if they don't take their four?
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1180.901,1184.453,"--In the... yes, they excluded from practice if they don't take their appointments."
1988.87-1939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1184.453,1185.403,And have there been such disbarments?
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1185.403,1185.836,Yes.
1988.87-1939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1189.388,1191.59,How many lawyers have been disbarred for that reason?
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1192.257,1192.709,--I don't know.
1988.87-1939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1192.709,1193.609,Is it... is it--
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1193.609,1194.459,It's not in the record.
1988.87-1939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1194.459,1195.577,--It's not what?
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1195.577,1197.411,"It is not in the record, and I don't know."
1988.87-1939,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1197.411,1198.863,"I doubt if it happens very often, does it?"
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1198.863,1202.398,It doesn't happen very often because lawyers wouldn't have the nerve to refuse appointments.
1988.87-1939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1286.051,1302.43,"Well, Ms. Hodge, the... as I take it, the Court of Appeals... well, the Court of Appeals said, we disagree with appellant's assertion that the facts in this case dictate a different result than the result reached in Heebe."
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1310.417,1311.369,"I, I--"
1988.87-1939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1311.369,1322.058,"And that court perhaps knows more about... I'm sure it doesn't know more about the Virgin Islands than you do, but it, it certainly knows more about the Virgin Islands than we do."
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1322.058,1338.436,"--The Court of Appeals in its decision said it need not reach the facts, and when it said it took a different view of the facts I think it meant it took a different view of the significance of the factual dispute, because the opinion of the majority says, we need not even decide which of the two contradictory affidavits are correct."
1988.87-1939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1367.888,1369.907,"Now, where do you find that in the opinion--"
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1369.907,1371.724,At the very outset of the opinion.
1988.87-1939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1371.724,1372.457,--All right.
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1372.457,1378.311,At the very beginning of the majority opinion.
1988.87-1939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1378.311,1389.119,"And by the way, while I've got you interrupted, you, you no longer urge, I take it, that, that, that the very exercise of supervisory power was wrong?"
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1389.119,1399.844,"It is our contention that, while the Third Circuit has supervisory power over the Virgin Islands, that it was incorrect in exercising it to strike this rule."
1988.87-1939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1399.844,1400.46,Yes.
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1405.747,1426.911,"No, we conceded to the Third Circuit that they had supervisory power over the Virgin Islands in our brief, but contended that it should be exercised with a great degree of deference toward the Virgin Islands as a territorial court, and also that our factual setting was so different from that which was before the Court in Frazier that it was not correct to apply the supervisory power to strike our rule, relying upon that precedent."
1988.87-1939,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1426.911,1435.767,"Following up on one of Justice White's earlier questions, I take it the Court of Appeals did not set aside any finding of fact by the District Court as being clearly erroneous?"
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1435.767,1436.517,That's correct.
1988.87-1939,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1437.1,1445.539,"It just said it was... that the disagreement was not an issue of material fact, so the disagreement was just those facts were not material, they thought."
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1446.073,1463.767,"It could be read to mean that the facts were not material, but since they were all the facts that had to do with access and availability, presumably the significance of that was to say, even if a lawyer will have problems of availability, that is not material to the question of whether the supervisory power should be used."
1988.87-1939,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1475.844,1478.962,How far is Puerto Rico?
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1478.962,1480.762,"--I'm sorry, sir."
1988.87-1939,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1480.762,1482.664,How far away is Puerto Rico?
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1482.664,1486.033,Puerto Rico is approximately 40 miles from the closest part of the Virgin Islands.
1988.87-1939,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1486.033,1489.401,Do you have any Puerto Rican attorneys admitted to your bar?
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1489.401,1490.167,"No, we don't."
1988.87-1939,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1490.167,1490.686,None at all?
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1490.686,1491.653,None at all.
1988.87-1939,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1535.215,1537.032,Is there any parallel to the state of Alaska?
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1537.032,1543.036,--There is some parallel in the sense that Alaska is quite distant from the rest of the contiguous United States.
1988.87-1939,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1566.402,1574.59,"Ms. Hodge, do you still defend the durational aspect of the residence requirement, the one-year durational requirement?"
1988.87-1939,0,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,1574.59,1583.279,The position we have taken is that the durational residency requirement can only stand if the simple residency requirement is first found to be valid.
1988.87-1939,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1615.834,1617.2,"Very well, Ms. Hodge."
1988.87-1939,1,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,1618.202,1625.873,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1939,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1674.706,1679.693,I guess there's no question but what your clients are competent.
1988.87-1939,1,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,1679.693,1680.56,Yes.
1988.87-1939,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1722.937,1729.258,Are they willing to meet the pro bono requirements personally rather than through hired associates?
1988.87-1939,1,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,1729.258,1736.613,They will meet any obligations that are imposed on island residents in an even-handed and non-discriminatory manner.
1988.87-1939,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1746.802,1751.623,"Well, is a requirement of, of accepting four appointments a year non-discriminatory?"
1988.87-1939,1,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,1751.623,1753.273,Let me answer that in this manner.
1988.87-1939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1866.998,1872.068,xxx by declaring this rule unconstitutional on its face?
1988.87-1939,1,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,1872.068,1874.604,I think that it diminishes the argument.
1988.87-1939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1876.754,1882.091,"I know, but that would just arguing over breadth, which I'm not sure is applicable in cases like this."
1988.87-1939,1,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,1882.091,1885.21,"--Well, the court has indicated in looking whether--"
1988.87-1939,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1885.21,1891.28,"I mean, maybe as applied to some Puerto Rican it would be invalid, but I don't know that you've got much to do with that."
1988.87-1939,1,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,1891.28,1899.802,"--Well, I think that the court has looked in privileges and immunities clause cases in terms of whether the restriction is over-inclusive or under-inclusive."
1988.87-1939,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1939.629,1944.664,Did Guam do it after this Court's Frazier decision?
1988.87-1939,1,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,1944.664,1949.235,--The Superior Court of Guam abolished its rule after Piper.
1988.87-1939,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1956.322,1960.71,So that would be the relevant court for our... for purposes of our inquiry?
1988.87-1939,1,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,1960.71,1965.864,"Well, as well as the District Court of Guam, which is similar, it's an Article I court."
1988.87-1939,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2012.559,2015.178,"I'd like to get back, if I could, to my question about Guam."
1988.87-1939,1,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,2017.463,2017.847,Okay.
1988.87-1939,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2017.847,2024.903,"In the Superior Court they do have a restriction, or they did have similar to that imposed by the Virgin Islands?"
1988.87-1939,1,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,2024.903,2026.703,The Superior Court of Guam did.
1988.87-1939,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2038.293,2045.114,So it's a fair inference the Superior Court did it not because it wanted to but because it thought it was required to by the decisions of this Court.
1988.87-1939,1,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,2045.114,2059.974,"It believed that it was bound by the decision of this Court, as did every other state court which had such a restriction, and every other territorial court which had such a restriction, even those that are considerably further away from the mainland than are the Virgin Islands."
1988.87-1939,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2068.562,2073.383,"Of course, it may have been more cost-free for the courts of Guam to do it."
1988.87-1939,1,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,2081.072,2083.255,"Well, that may depend on one's perspective."
1988.87-1939,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2100.451,2106.771,My only point is I'm not sure the disincentives are equivalent in the Guam courts and the Virgin Islands courts.
1988.87-1939,1,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,2112.141,2118.578,"--Guam is further away, but again neither the Superior Court nor the District Court see the need for these restrictions."
1988.87-1939,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2120.197,2128.118,"Is that fair to say the Superior Court doesn't see the need for these restrictions, when they had then but changed them only in response to our Piper decision?"
1988.87-1939,1,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,2128.118,2128.953,--Well--
1988.87-1939,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2128.953,2130.436,Is that an accurate statement?
1988.87-1939,1,19186,cornish_f_hitchcock,,2130.436,2132.772,"--I would clarify the statement, Mr. Chief Justice--"
1988.87-1939,2,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,3217.897,3219.697,Thank you.
1988.87-1939,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3370.713,3377.218,Don't you think that you and your opponent have a different views of the facts with respect to communications and--
1988.87-1939,2,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,3377.218,3377.668,Yes.
1988.87-1939,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3378.201,3383.789,--And did the... did the... and those different views were reflected in the counter-affidavits that were filed--
1988.87-1939,2,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,3383.789,3384.405,"Yes, they were."
1988.87-1939,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3384.405,3387.657,--Wells what... how come it wasn't at trial then?
1988.87-1939,2,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,3387.657,3396.68,"The District Court, I think, in, in candor, felt that it knew the facts so well that it was in a position to, in effect, take judicial notice of the correct version of the facts."
1988.87-1939,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3396.68,3399.549,"Well, that's a strange way of proceeding for summary judgment--"
1988.87-1939,2,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,3399.549,3408.655,"I quite agree, and it was suggested before the Court of Appeals that perhaps the more correct remedy would be to remand for a trial to decide the factual disputes."
1988.87-1939,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3411.857,3415.51,"--Well, the Court of Appeals just didn't seem to think they, it made much difference."
1988.87-1939,2,36019,maria_tankenson_hodge,,3415.51,3433.186,"--The Court of Appeals evidently shared Mr. Hitchcock's view that once Frazier was decided it need not concern itself with the special difficulties associated with practicing in a jurisdiction, that those concerns of the Virgin Islands had been eliminated from legitimate consideration by the Court's decision."
1988.87-1939,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3433.186,3434.236,"Thank you, Mr. Hodge."
