1986.85-686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,65.275,"Mr. Davis, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,65.275,69.577,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1986.85-686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,362.718,375.478,"I think all of that is probably conceded, Mr. Davis, and what the fight here about is the conflict between the well-pleaded complaint doctrine and the rules that you're talking about."
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,375.478,395.522,"Okay, I think it's important to recognize that under 502 Congress, in the legislative history, specifically advised that claims seeking benefit entitlement were to be considered arising under the laws of the federal, of the United States in similar fashion to Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act."
1986.85-686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,398.457,403.961,"What the plaintiff has said here, as I understand it, is, yes, I'm pleading this case."
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,407.449,408.649,Okay.
1986.85-686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,489.114,502.124,We're those cases that say that the so-called 301 actions aren't... don't completely preempt the state causes of action.
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,502.124,510.444,"--And probably the issue in those cases are whether the action is peripheral, far enough apart, tangential to the labor agreement."
1986.85-686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,510.444,517.217,"Whatever way you put it, the argument is that state law is not put aside."
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,517.217,530.941,"One difference between the Labor Management Relations Act is that statute didn't include a comprehensive remedial scheme such as ERISA, so the courts have fashioned federal remedies under section 301."
1986.85-686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,541.499,547.903,"So, you say that preemption is much more stricter and more obvious here than in the 301 cases?"
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,547.903,548.569,--That's right.
1986.85-686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,609.559,614.028,"Well, Mr. Davis, you heard the last case argued, did you not?"
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,614.028,614.463,Yes.
1986.85-686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,614.463,628.854,"Supposing that in deciding that case this Court were to decide either 5-to-4 that it was preempted, or 5-to-4 that it wasn't preempted; does that mean that the defendant in the last case, had it been brought in state court, could have removed?"
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,628.854,630.639,"Yes, it does."
1986.85-686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,643.463,653.152,"You're saying that no matter how debateable the preemption point may be, if it ultimately turns out to be preempted then removal was proper?"
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,653.152,653.902,That's right.
1986.85-686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,683.521,688.075,"Well, you can't always rely on the dissent to explain the rationale of the majority."
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,688.709,689.209,--I understand.
1986.85-686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,713.573,717.542,So that any action trying to collect a claim is a federal claim?
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,717.542,718.125,That's right.
1986.85-686,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,720.311,725.215,"Of course, you would argue that there was original jurisdiction even if there wasn't a federal claim and it was just a state claim."
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,725.215,733.821,"I would argue no matter how the complaint was written, if it was one seeking benefits under the plan then it arises under the federal law and it's a federal claim."
1986.85-686,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,733.821,735.621,What if it doesn't arise under federal law?
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,741.241,747.795,"If it doesn't arise under federal law, I would acknowledge that."
1986.85-686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,747.795,748.095,"Well, but--"
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,748.095,750.014,"But, I think Congress intended specifically--"
1986.85-686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,750.014,750.78,--can't be.
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,750.78,752.282,--what it indicated--
1986.85-686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,752.282,753.698,From your position that couldn't be.
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,753.698,759.166,"--well, I think any claim for benefits under an ERISA plan must arise under federal law."
1986.85-686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,759.166,759.333,Yes.
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,759.333,766.006,"If you want me to assume that that premise is incorrect then, yeah, it's disagreement with my argument."
1986.85-686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,766.006,766.739,Yes.
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,766.739,773.66,I think Congress clearly stated that when they said these claims are similar to the Labor Relations Law.
1986.85-686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,787.252,801.595,"You're really saying the well-pleaded contempt, complaint rule just doesn't apply when on its face the state claim is frivolous."
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,805.631,806.314,--That's right.
1986.85-686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1277.653,1294.531,"Well, in your case are you... if case just argued, if Pilot Life is decided against preemption, will your case be more difficult?"
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,1294.531,1306.255,"If Pilot Life is decided against preemption, I contend in this case the case was properly removable, or removed because of the claim for the uninsured benefit."
1986.85-686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1306.255,1310.724,"But, that's in, but then, but otherwise, otherwise--"
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,1310.724,1310.974,Otherwise--
1986.85-686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1310.974,1312.876,--you have a tough case I take it.
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,1312.876,1316.694,"--Well otherwise, you know, I'm putting more focus on the remedies."
1986.85-686,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1319.063,1323.05,"Well, a lot of the focus in Pilot Life is on the remedies too."
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,1323.05,1337.727,"Well, I think additionally, even if there's no preemption, I think there was an express federal grant that comes within the original jurisdiction of the federal courts and I think the case would be removable whether or not there was preemption."
1986.85-686,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1338.294,1341.096,I asked you that before and you said no.
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,1354.569,1356.021,--It would be removable.
1986.85-686,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1361.825,1364.711,It's a state cause of action that arises under federal law?
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,1364.711,1377.535,"--I think it would be, it may be a state cause of action where Congress ordained and granted the federal court's jurisdiction under 502 to consider the state claims, maybe under the premise of protective jurisdiction."
1986.85-686,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1377.535,1378.335,Sure.
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,1378.335,1381.87,"And, I think that, I think even if it was recognized as a state law claim--"
1986.85-686,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1381.87,1383.237,You're not abandoning that portion?
1986.85-686,0,20723,david_m_davis,,1383.237,1383.72,"--No, I'm not."
1986.85-686,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1425.529,1426.981,"Very well, Mr. Davis."
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,1429.165,1436.437,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-686,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1490.722,1498.828,"What if we decide that they are preempted, in effect, in the preceding case, Pilot Life?"
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,1511.635,1531.882,"If the Court decided in the Pilot Life decision that the savings clause of Section 514 did not save the type of state law claim brought by Dedeaux, I would not be able to meaningfully distinguish that decision from the state law claims involved here."
1986.85-686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1535.251,1537.453,That would be just like Avco in the Labor--
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,1537.453,1560.632,"--Well, all I mean to say is that the nature of respondent's breach of contract claims against the insurance company, Metropolitan Life in this case, are not meaningfully distinguishable in my mind from the state law claims in Pilot Life, the purposes of the ERISA savings clause."
1986.85-686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1560.632,1566.52,"--And so, there would be... would this case have been properly removable then?"
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,1566.52,1571.924,"No, it would not, if the court accepts our removal theory."
1986.85-686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1575.059,1579.446,"Even with preemption, no removal?"
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,1579.446,1579.996,--That's correct.
1986.85-686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1586.149,1586.965,Yes.
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,1586.965,1589.934,--we would still win on our removal theory.
1986.85-686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1589.934,1590.417,Yes.
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,1590.417,1610.031,"Our removal theory is as follows: It is that, as the court below held, that Taylor's breach of contract claim against the insurer was not properly removable because it was not obvious, and obvious at the time of the commencement of the litigation."
1986.85-686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1610.031,1610.548,At the time.
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,1610.548,1611.115,That's correct.
1986.85-686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1619.137,1630.076,"Although it might be removable the day after Pilot Life is... if Pilot Life were decided against preemption, or decided in favor of preemption."
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,1631.994,1632.944,No.
1986.85-686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1638.832,1639.284,--Yes.
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,1639.284,1644.152,"--this case would still not be, would still not be properly removable if that were the case."
1986.85-686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1644.152,1644.736,"You mean, even if it were filed later?"
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,1644.736,1658.662,"That is correct, because the removal determination, the determination as to whether a federal court has removal jurisdiction, has to be made and has to speak to the commencement of the case."
1986.85-686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1660.281,1671.755,"Exactly, but I mean, let's assume Pilot Life is decided and it is decided that remedies are preempted and then a case is filed like yours."
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,1671.755,1672.388,--Yes.
1986.85-686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1676.24,1679.342,"No no, not yours, but a new case would be affected?"
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,1681.027,1681.294,--That is correct.
1986.85-686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1686.598,1687.348,It would be like Avco then?
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,1687.348,1692.769,"That would be exactly like Avco and Avco is, of course, an example of the obviousness test."
1986.85-686,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1692.769,1693.152,Yes.
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,1695.287,1695.704,Yes.
1986.85-686,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1695.704,1698.156,At the time we made our decision I thought there was a Circuit conflict.
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,1698.156,1702.441,"There was a Circuit conflict, Justice Scalia, but it was not regarding the obviousness of preemption."
1986.85-686,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1702.441,1704.06,"Oh, really?"
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,1704.06,1710.463,In Avco an employer brought a breach of contract action to enforce a no strike provision of a collective bargaining agreement.
1986.85-686,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1739.9,1741.466,xxx preemption.
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,1741.466,1747.236,"--Well no, the preemption issue is, I see it as conceptually distinct."
1986.85-686,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1767.883,1769.169,I see.
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,1769.169,1777.573,"And the obviousness test subscribed to by the Court of Appeals below in our case, as we are urging here is one that focuses on preemption."
1986.85-686,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1849.22,1863.979,"So, whenever we have a removal case such as this, where the issue comes up, the case comes all the way up to the Supreme Court and really the only thing we can determine is whether it is obvious that there was preemption and we shouldn't get any further because that's as far as we have to go."
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,1881.524,1883.441,That is correct.
1986.85-686,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1883.441,1885.476,"That's a really strange way to run a system, don't you think?"
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,1889.512,1902.688,"Because the plaintiff's entitled to stay in state court, and that preemption issue will get to this court, either in cases filed originally in federal court, or in cases that are appealed to the state system to this court by certiorari."
1986.85-686,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1902.688,1906.889,"But all we can answer now is whether it's obvious or not that there's preemption, right?"
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,1931.707,1933.757,It has to be obvious at the time it was filed.
1986.85-686,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1933.757,1947.3,"And presumably if we could decide this sort of case by just deciding whether or not we think its preempted, every district court that's called upon to make a removal decision also would decide on that basis."
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,1947.3,1966.964,"Every district court called upon to make a removal decision would look to see whether in fact, if the plaintiff has stated on the face of this complaint simply a state law claim, whether that state law claim is obviously preempted, and if this court has already addressed the issue, then clearly it has been obviously preempted for purposes of that xxx--"
1986.85-686,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1966.964,1975.986,"But the alternative to your way of looking at it is that the district court would simply make a, decide whether or not it's obvious."
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,1980.788,1987.025,"--Well that is correct, but the decision, I think, is not a particularly difficult one to make."
1986.85-686,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1999.851,2006.255,In the old... the law governing convening of three judge courts had something much like that in it.
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2006.255,2007.271,Um-hum.
1986.85-686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2054.065,2060.656,"Suppose we decide in Pilot Life that there, that the remedies are preempted."
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2060.656,2061.156,Um-hum.
1986.85-686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2061.156,2067.141,"I suppose that then all the defendant does, in your case has to do is move to dismiss?"
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2067.141,2076.248,That... certainly the petitioner's in this case would have the benefit of that ruling in Pilot Life by moving to dismiss in state court.
1986.85-686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2076.248,2080.867,"And so it's great to have it back in state, great to have it back in state court just so it can be dismissed there."
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2080.867,2082.819,"Oh no, that claim would be dismissed."
1986.85-686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2082.819,2083.601,Oh.
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2083.601,2084.685,That claim would be dismissed.
1986.85-686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2093.041,2093.491,Yes.
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2093.491,2105.097,"--Mr. Taylor can then proceed against petitioner, General Motors, for his separate tort claim against GM... his separate, concededly state law, claim."
1986.85-686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2105.097,2105.549,I see.
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2105.549,2115.237,"That state law claim was decided on the merits by the federal district court after removal in this case under the mistaken theory that it was a Section 5, excuse me, on a pendent jurisdiction--"
1986.85-686,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2115.237,2115.937,Pendent jurisdiction.
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2115.937,2116.987,--a pendent jurisdiction theory.
1986.85-686,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2116.987,2123.76,"Mr. Scheer, it really is a very unproductive enterprise to spend a lot of time litigating over jurisdiction."
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2180.096,2181.629,If the argument--
1986.85-686,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2181.629,2182.965,"Now, why isn't that a lovely way to handle it?"
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2193.171,2205.711,"--As I understand that theory, it derives from what has sometimes been called by the commentators ""protected federal jurisdiction""."
1986.85-686,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2215.852,2217.302,It was not made to the Court of Appeals?
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2217.302,2218.638,--It was not made to the Court of Appeals below.
1986.85-686,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2301.708,2304.494,The federal policy would be lets get rid of it all together.
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2311.648,2311.814,Uh-huh.
1986.85-686,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2316.849,2317.132,I see.
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2317.132,2342.916,"It has been stated here again and again this morning that Congress intended Section 502 remedies to be exclusive and that any state law claim that might possibly fall within their sphere, like a breach of contract action against an insurance company, is simply because it falls within the scope of Section 502 preempted."
1986.85-686,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2480.49,2484.542,Why is it any different when the company is a self-insured?
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2487.978,2495.416,"A company that is self-insured is a somewhat interested party, but xxx--"
1986.85-686,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2495.416,2497.616,"Just as much, just as much as the insurance company."
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2497.616,2499.785,"--No, I would disagree, Justice Scalia."
1986.85-686,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2518.449,2529.305,"Well, I mean there may be some differences but don't tell me that it's not a self-interested party that you're allowing to adjudicate the rights under this contract."
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2529.305,2539.445,I think it is a party that is certainly less directly interested in the outcome of a particular benefit claim case than is an insurance company.
1986.85-686,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2548.301,2553.872,The insurance company is interested in keeping General Motors' business certainly.
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2563.644,2566.18,"Mr. Chief Justice, that argument can cut the other way too."
1986.85-686,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2577.903,2578.67,"Well, then we get a--"
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2578.67,2579.42,GM xxx--
1986.85-686,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2579.42,2582.622,--we'd get a wrong xxx to GM too.
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2593.93,2607.09,--In Section 502 of ERISA Congress intended to provide minimum remedies.
1986.85-686,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2701.682,2716.609,"xxx a remedy for a small claim ends up in federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, or Madison, Wisconsin, when if you could sue in state court you might be many miles closer to home doesn't make a lot of sense."
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2716.609,2720.744,I'm not quite sure I'm following the question.
1986.85-686,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2720.744,2728.083,"Well, you're saying that the congressionally-designed remedy for claims was to benefit small, small claims."
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2738.273,2740.307,That may be in some circumstances.
1986.85-686,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2749.246,2757.269,In no event could the venue provisions of ERISA provide anything better than the nearest federal court house?
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2760.221,2772.196,All I mean to say is that in certain respects a Section 502 claim is advantageous to a state law claim.
1986.85-686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2818.427,2829.365,"Mr. Scheer, are these clauses typically drafted by the insurance companies, or are they typically the product of a union management negotiation as to just what the benefits will be and the conditions of eligibility and all the rest?"
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2832.9,2852.581,"It is my understanding that in the vast majority of cases, not necessarily the plans covering the vast majority of employees who are subject to ERISA, but in the vast majority of individual plans the insurance company has a policy and it drafts the policy and it sells it to the employer."
1986.85-686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2852.581,2859.552,"For the entire work force, of course, for everybody employed by that company."
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2876.679,2887.071,"Well you have some built-in protection, but I should also point out that ERISA permits a fiduciary to delegate his fiduciary responsibility to an insurance company."
1986.85-686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2913.971,2923.094,"If the insurance company habitually was slow paying because it wanted to, you know, get the use of the money and so forth, do you suppose it would keep the business very long?"
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2928.981,2946.442,"--Obviously market forces, you know, are at work and if an insurance company, at some point an insurance company's intransigence in dealing with claimants with bona fide claims would certainly, one could see that it would be to termination of that relationship."
1986.85-686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2946.442,2947.659,Yes.
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2947.659,2954.096,"But the mere fact that, you know, the marketplace is at work doesn't--"
1986.85-686,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2954.096,2964.737,"What we started with was the question of the drafting of the... in this particular case, was the General Motors' plan drafted by Metropolitan or was it drafted by the company and the union?"
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2964.737,2965.404,--That I don't know.
1986.85-686,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2966.856,2980.783,Why would the Congress want to save these important state rights only in the case of insurance companies and not where you have a self-insurer?
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,2980.783,3001.327,"Well, I think again, I'm not sure that Congress first of all necessarily focused on all of the possible permutations of plan arrangements that might exist under ERISA."
1986.85-686,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3034.417,3044.623,"Mr. Scheer, aren't we dealing here with a self-insurer, in effect, who just uses the insurance company as an administrator?"
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,3044.623,3047.389,"No, Justice O'Connor, that is not correct in this case."
1986.85-686,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3149.938,3157.378,"Not, of course, define law of any state."
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,3157.378,3161.062,"Justice Scalia, the distinction really escapes me."
1986.85-686,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3163.614,3164.964,"The term, you define a term."
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,3187.48,3189.665,"--But what is the difference between ""state laws"" and a ""law of any state""?"
1986.85-686,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3189.665,3195.903,"The basic distinction is that the phrase ""law of any state"" is not defined."
1986.85-686,1,38328,peter_edward_scheer,,3195.903,3204.591,"But, if I sit here and try to imagine what the difference might be, I simply can't come up with any explanation."
1986.85-686,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3204.591,3206.96,You don't need any difference except that it's not defined.
1986.85-686,2,20723,david_m_davis,,3321.431,3335.274,"Briefly, if we talk or focus on the obviousness test, in the Avco case the issue was whether a state injunctive remedy was preempted by federal law."
1986.85-686,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3416.642,3418.475,"Thank you, Mr. Davis."
