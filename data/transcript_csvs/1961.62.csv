1961.62,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1396.274,1398.023,Could I ask you a preliminary question?
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,1416.867,1418.229,"Yes, I have Your Honor and I --"
1961.62,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1418.229,1419.146,Do you disagree with it?
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,1419.146,1431.717,-- he relies somewhat on the same ground as the petitioner here that a continuation of acts by Congress recognizes a continuing existence and extent to the reservation.
1961.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1619.724,1621.865,May I ask you a question in that and see if I can understand?
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,1621.865,1623.611,"Yes, Your Honor."
1961.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1623.611,1636.736,"Is it your position that the land that have been sold even within this that the reservation are no longer within the reservation, within the meaning of the statute (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,1636.736,1636.956,Yes Your Honor that is our position.
1961.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1636.956,1641.51,(Voice Overlap) or is it your position that there is no reservation?
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,1641.51,1679.306,"We contend this Your Honor that the Act of March 22, 1906 which opened the reservation to sale and entry and those lands which were sold and entered upon cannot be longer Indian country or within Indian reservation and the Act had the effect of separating those lands so sold and settled upon and they no longer were a part of the reservation and the Act had the effect of redefining the boundaries of the reservation."
1961.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1679.306,1684.02,Then you would have island inside the reservation which was not a part of the reservation?
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,1684.02,1688.629,"I submit Your Honor that under the language of Section 1151, if there is an island --"

1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,1692.425,1707.814,"I submit Your Honor, if the redefinition of the boundaries and there is a land settled upon by a non-Indian which sort of creates island then it would be within Indian country."
1961.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1741.131,1745.331,But if it were in an island you would say it was in the reservation?
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,1745.331,1746.599,"I would Your Honor, yes."
1961.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1746.948,1758.771,(Voice Overlap) it's only on the boundary line then where the land has been sold on the boundary line under that 1906 Act if you say it's not part of the Indian reservation?
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,1758.771,1760.231,That's right.
1961.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1760.231,1762.626,And where did this happen on East?
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,1762.626,1763.864,"East, East Omak Your Honor."
1961.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1763.864,1764.068,Omak?
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,1764.068,1764.938,Yes.
1961.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1764.938,1772.139,Is all that land -- has all the land in East Omak been sold to non-Indians?
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,1772.139,1781.731,"I cannot answer that with (Inaudible) certainty that all of the land was sold to non-Indians no, I do not know."
1961.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1781.731,1783.789,"Well, how would we know then whether -- whether this is on the boundary?"
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,1783.789,1818.277,"Well, as I said earlier, and I will come to this later, Section 11 of the Act are required the or authorized, might I say, the Secretary of the Interior to create townsites for the quote “future public interest” and to make such reservations or parts or other survey in to lots and blocks, sell the same under his regulations that money so received to be paid for the benefit of the Indians under Section 6 of the Act."
1961.62,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1818.277,1821.037,How big place is East Omak?
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,1821.037,1824.843,Its population is probably 300 people.
1961.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1847.484,1853.9,I don't -- I don't like to -- I don't want to bother you but I do want to get absolutely clear.
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,1865.743,1870.085,"No, it is not Mr. Justice Black."
1961.62,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1870.678,1878.593,Suppose an Indian could own a property and -- in Seattle and it would make this property for an Indian reservation?
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,1878.593,1880.605,Certainly not.
1961.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1892.852,1894.06,Has he done that?
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,1894.06,1902.18,"Yes, he has Your Honor and the townsite plot has been filed with the auditor of -- the county auditor of Okanogan County."
1961.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1906.091,1908.543,Where is that in the record?
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,1908.543,1923.435,"I -- Your Honor it's been filed as an exhibit in this case along with the original deed to the land in question here and that is Lot 9, Block 118 of the government townsite of Omak."
1961.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1923.435,1929.015,You say that the Secretary formally created a new reservation?
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,1929.015,1933.1,That is in essence what the Section 11 provides.
1961.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1933.1,1934.856,"Well, did he though formally create (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,1934.856,1936.088,(Voice Overlap) he formally had consent --
1961.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1936.088,1938.404,-- where we can find that spelled out?
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,1938.404,1941.052,Yes Mr. Justice Black he did.
1961.62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1956.157,1972.175,(Inaudible)
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,1972.175,1974.991,Yes he had.
1961.62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1974.991,1979.752,(Inaudible)
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,1979.752,1990.088,"No, it's laid out as a community with streets, alleyways, places for sidewalks and lots individually numbered (Voice Overlap) within blocks."
1961.62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1990.088,1992.16,(Inaudible)
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,1992.16,1998.041,The -- a copy of the plot has been filed as an exhibit here.
1961.62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1998.041,2001.874,(Inaudible)
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2001.874,2008.743,"The lots were sold in both 1916 and 1919, I believe."
1961.62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2008.743,2014.471,And when is the last time (Inaudible)
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2014.471,2021.696,I believe it was 1960 and I don't accurately recall of.
1961.62,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2021.696,2038.285,"Mr. Way, is there any statutory language to which you can refer us which would make any distinction between lands on the periphery of the -- of the reservation as distinguished from lands in the interior?"
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2041.284,2055.803,"Well, I maintain Your Honor and we maintain that the Act on March 22 in its entirety and in particular Section 11 has the effect of redefining the boundaries."
1961.62,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2089.987,2095.398,Yes.
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2095.398,2109.227,"Now, the petitioner and both -- and the Solicitor General as well in their briefs submit that the subsequent acts of Congress recognized a continuing existence and extent of the reservation."
1961.62,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2168.849,2175.563,"Mr. Way, is there other any -- are there any annual appropriations from Congress to reservation of this kind?"
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2175.563,2176.82,"Yes, there are, Your Honor."
1961.62,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2176.82,2185.596,"How do they refer to it in the -- in their appropriation bill, I was wondering?"
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2185.596,2195.638,I do not know with certainty but I presume that they do refer to the Colville Indian Agency on the Colville reservation such language of that.
1961.62,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2195.638,2197.295,Do they have a superintendent (Voice Overlap) --
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2197.295,2197.945,"Yes, they do."

1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2200.282,2200.385,Yes.
1961.62,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2200.385,2201.573,-- the reservation?
1961.62,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2201.573,2210.834,"Now, in the adversary of the Secretary of Interior, there are funds derived from the sale of this property, are there not?"
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2210.834,2211.734,That is (Voice Overlap) --
1961.62,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2211.734,2220.179,And that they -- they held in trust funds for Indian purposes?
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2220.179,2228.555,They are under the act to be expended for the benefit of the Indians by the Secretary of the Interior and for per capita payments.
1961.62,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2236.839,2240.134,Do you happen to know the account under which they deposit it?
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2240.134,2240.164,No I --(Voice Overlap)
1961.62,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2240.164,2244.855,"-- there's in a mingled Indian fund if they are specified, is that right?"
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2244.855,2249.835,"I -- Well, I have no knowledge of what account it might be."
1961.62,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2249.835,2260.178,The fees are attributable to funds derived from properties within Indian territory or Indian country?
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2260.178,2273.092,"Well, it's -- the money is received from the sale of the lands under the Act of March 22 or to be deposited and expended for the benefit of the Indians and to make for per capita payments to the Indians."
1961.62,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2369.604,2379.533,"Mr. Way, could we -- could we sustain your judgment with -- without holding that this is not a reservation?"
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2383.147,2383.467,I think it --
1961.62,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2383.467,2383.617,-- in order to --
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2383.617,2383.945,-- could be sustained --
1961.62,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2383.945,2385.996,-- sustain judgment?
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2385.996,2416.697,I think it could be if you should base your decision on the fact that Section 11 creates a reservation within the reservation and it must have been Congress' intention to separate townsites created under this authority then I think that it could be held that the remainder of the reservation still exists or that subject does not have to be touched.
1961.62,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2416.697,2476.904,"Could we hold or would it -- would it be rational or consonant with general direction of Indian law to hold that even though you -- even though authorization is made for the erection of townsites to be treated it for non-Indian, to be acquired by non-Indian and yet the territory within that townsites with the territory, within which that townsite exists is still within the quote “Indian territory” “Indian Country” could we do both for the -- is it necessary in order to conclude that this is not within Indian country to agree with you that it follow from agreeing with your self-contained townsites therefore, territory within which it existed no longer Indian country."
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2476.904,2501.533,"It does seem to me Mr. Justice Frankfurter that it would be possible to say at one and the same time that we have here a reservation created for the future public interest and the same time, a reservation for the use of Indians."
1961.62,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2504.474,2527.353,Why do you say that if you duly regard as I'm sure you do the evolutionary policies of -- of withdrawing entirely from a policy of restrictive Indian withdrawal from responsibility and jurisdiction of the state which the regulation exists.
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2559.864,2564.265,I presume you can have Mr. Justice Frankfurter those --
1961.62,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2564.265,2575.895,Subject to the governing statute that there isn't surrender the (Inaudible) drawn over the horse of the Indian horse so that's all turn over to state jurisdiction.
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2590.211,2594.106,I maintained that that conclusion seems to follow from what --
1961.62,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2594.106,2602.792,We can't just say it's so confused that in view of the confusion that both either jurisdiction to take hold.
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2608.743,2634.037,"Well, I think it -- it must presumed that Congress intended the results that is achieved its acts and the results and consequences of the Act of March 22, 1906, I think it must be interpreted that they so intended that the result would be the separation."
1961.62,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2747.44,2747.913,Can I ask you question?
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2747.913,2749.247,-- enable --
1961.62,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2749.247,2752.418,"-- I didn't mean to interrupt you, you finish your sentence."
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2754.766,2775.712,"Well, the -- how can this transformation of the lands by the force of this Act enable the lands to retain their character as Indian reservation lands especially in the absence of a congressional definition in the criminal laws and convincing such a change as it's found here."
1961.62,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2775.712,2792.749,"The question I want to ask you is whether the Act of 1906 which I think you're referring, it's a very long and I haven't read it, does that undertake to define new boundaries of the Indian territory?"
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2792.749,2794.239,Not in specific language --
1961.62,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2794.239,2813.087,"In specific terms, in other words, the essence of your argument is that when you add all these together, it is as if Congress had said from hereafter the boundaries of the Indian territory what remains will be doesn't so which would exclude East Omak, is that it?"
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2813.087,2813.137,Yes.
1961.62,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2813.137,2814.602,That's the essence of your argument?
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2814.602,2814.942,Yes sir.
1961.62,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2814.942,2818.689,But there's nothing expressed in the Act that undertakes to do that.
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2818.689,2822.786,There is no specific portion of it redefining geographically --
1961.62,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2822.786,2823.036,Yes.
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2823.036,2824.409,-- new boundaries.
1961.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2824.409,2838.047,"I -- I'm a little confused because it seems to me your state Supreme Court decided the case on a different ground, am I wrong with that?"
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2887.532,2912.27,"The decision of the Washington Supreme Court does hold as I understand it that the Act of March 22, 1906 diminished the reservation to the extent with the exception of those lands reserved for Indian purposes and allotments and severalty to the Indians."
1961.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2913.755,2928.931,I do not read it as merely saying it's diminished but it's saying there's no longer exist but even if that is true what you say is true it certainly have as the most.
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2951.6,2954.866,"Yes sir, Judge Wicks appear to hold that way."
1961.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2955.039,2966.177,"He didn't go on the ground you are arguing to us, that it's just as marginal cost that he did hold that there are islands within this area, that was not part of the reservation?"
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2966.177,2966.266,I am --
1961.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2966.266,2966.746,-- am I wrong --
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,2966.746,2970.547,-- trying to take it from two -- in two -- two directions.
1961.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3023.289,3047.485,"Some years ago, when I first came on the Court, when I knew less than possible about Indian reservation than I do now, I recall it we had a case from Nevada where they were just one or two or three little lots down there and then was arrested and tried for selling liquor but the question was whether they're Indian country."
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,3058.119,3058.619,"Well, no but I can recall the -- (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3058.619,3059.817,-- but I can't (Voice Overlap) --
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,3059.817,3069.767,-- which I remember the Ninth Circuit Court called 49 bottles of sour mash whisky which sounds to be --
1961.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3069.767,3072.566,"I forgot whether it's 49, I meant it was."
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,3072.566,3091.532,Sounds to be that sort of case but I didn't think it was appropriate for the reasons it was involved the Indian liquor laws and the definition at that time was substantially different than what is found in 1151.
1961.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3091.532,3096.361,Has it been changed now that the general -- that idea of Indian country?
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,3096.361,3106.5,"The Indian country definition there I thought was more of the creation by this Court rather than -- now, it's defined by statute where (Voice Overlap) --"
1961.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3106.5,3109.413,I don't think so because I didn't know enough to create one.
1961.62,1,42283,stephen_c_way,,3113.738,3114.917,I thank you.

1961.62,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3280.689,3282.444,"What was the date of the amendment, Mr. Wilkinson?"
1961.62,2,26290,glen_a_wilkinson,,3282.444,3293.017,The date of the amendment which includes the phrase notwithstanding the issuance of any patent was in 1948.

1961.62,2,26290,glen_a_wilkinson,,3322.874,3331.027,As I understand it and there's a serious factual error in that opinion which I believe makes it difficult to understand.
1961.62,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3402.522,3413.385,"Before you proceed on the argument on which you've been embarked so I do not want to interrupt you.But will you absorb this difficulty, this question of mine."
1961.62,2,26290,glen_a_wilkinson,,3453.096,3462.583,"Your Honor, I'm not certain but I would have to express some doubt whether it could be retroactive."
