1989.88-1835,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.189,"We'll hear argument now in Number 88-1835, Florida against Martin Leslie Wells."
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,12.308,15.26,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1835,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,165.641,168.324,"May I ask, in this case, where is the inventory in the record?"
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,169.676,171.545,--The actual inventory list?
1989.88-1835,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,200.112,202.314,"--But they did, they did make an inventory sheet?"
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,202.314,204.766,An inventory does in fact exist.
1989.88-1835,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,204.766,207.051,And... but you didn't put it in the record?
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,207.051,208.468,"It was never in the record, no, sir."
1989.88-1835,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,208.468,212.086,So we don't know whether they inventoried the contents of the suitcase or not.
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,212.086,214.705,"We do not know if it is on the inventory sheet, no."
1989.88-1835,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,251.211,255.329,"The defendant didn't rely on the, opening the suitcase in the trial court?"
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,255.329,259.817,"Well, in the trial court the theory was a consent theory."
1989.88-1835,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,264.202,265.737,You mean the state's theory was a consent theory?
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,265.737,266.704,--Right.
1989.88-1835,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,266.704,273.474,"But did the, did the defendant in the trial court argue that the search of the suitcase was improper?"
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,273.474,280.646,"At all... I really don't recall if he explicitly raised that issue, at this point in time."
1989.88-1835,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,280.646,282.598,I am just wondering how the case got here.
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,282.598,294.656,"It... I, that is how I will explain how it got here, because when... it was strictly an order by the trial court saying the motion to suppress is denied."
1989.88-1835,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,301.644,305.429,"Well, you say argued on a consent issue, you mean the state took the position there was consent."
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,305.429,306.214,"That is right, Your Honor."
1989.88-1835,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,306.214,308.681,What position did the... did the defendant take?
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,308.681,315.486,I believe that he took the position that it was an improper inventory search.
1989.88-1835,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,315.486,320.021,"And yet, and in defending that claim, the state did not put in the inventory."
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,320.021,329.227,"No, because the state relied strictly on the consent theory, and the court below, the trial court below did not give any factual findings in his order."
1989.88-1835,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,435.496,439.817,"Mr. Neimand, when did the search occur?"
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,439.817,446.121,"The inventory search occurred after the arrest, after the car was towed--"
1989.88-1835,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,446.121,447.321,What year and what month?
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,447.321,459.714,"--It was... the search occurred in 1985, prior to this Court's opinion in Bertine, right around the Opperman era."
1989.88-1835,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,459.714,475.473,"And at that time, as a legal proposition, how much discretion did the police officer have to open closed containers during the course of an inventory search?"
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,475.473,477.342,Under this... under this Court's ruling?
1989.88-1835,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,477.342,478.275,"No, no, no, no."
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,480.711,492.702,"Under the procedure as the officer stated, he was working under standard operating procedure that he was to inventory a car upon impoundment from the hood to the trunk."
1989.88-1835,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,496.304,504.493,What does the testimony show the policy was with regard to opening locked containers?
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,504.493,507.545,The... there was no exact testimony on that point.
1989.88-1835,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,517.984,520.65,And there's no court finding below--
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,520.65,522.019,"--No finding at all, Your Honor."
1989.88-1835,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,522.019,523.452,--on what the policy was.
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,525.888,526.84,We do know--
1989.88-1835,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,526.84,533.844,"Was there some discretion there to open a locked container, or not, in your view?"
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,533.844,543.266,"--In the state's view, there is no discretion, because an inventory search within operating procedures say you must inventory the vehicle."
1989.88-1835,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,551.206,561.061,"Well, the concern, of course, is to avoid pretextual searches for evidence."
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,576.587,578.889,"That is the testimony, Your Honor."
1989.88-1835,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,700.818,722.917,"Well, now, if the officer listed on the inventory a locked suitcase, would the officer be in violation of the applicable state inventory policy, subject to discipline because he listed it that way on the inventory?"
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,722.917,724.952,I would suggest that he would be.
1989.88-1835,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,758.44,766.446,"That sounds like a very good rule, but how do we know that was the rule that indeed was in force here?"
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,766.446,768.898,"Well, we don't know."
1989.88-1835,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,769.831,774.516,"Well, then, we can't possibly affirm the case, or reverse the case."
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,774.516,778.587,"--Well, the state, what the state is seeking is a reversal with a remand."
1989.88-1835,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,788.86,797.632,And you assert that in order to sustain the search it... the lower court would have to find what?
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,810.106,818.562,"Well, I think under the inventory doctrine, the only purpose in the inventory doctrine is the protection of the property, personal valuable property."
1989.88-1835,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,843.862,853.385,"Mr. Neimand, did the Supreme Court of Florida in its opinion spend any time describing what the rule was in this police department for inventory searches?"
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,853.385,854.385,"Yes, they did."
1989.88-1835,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,890.908,898.83,"Well, do you question the accuracy of the description in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Florida of the department's inventory search policy?"
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,898.83,903.651,"Well, the accuracy of the documentation I, we do not question."
1989.88-1835,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,907.203,919.427,"But, the court decided that the instructions were so and so, but they weren't detailed enough."
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,921.577,922.796,"Well, that... exactly."
1989.88-1835,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,922.796,928.799,"--So that's... they're saying that's what, that's what this Court's opinions require."
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,935.686,936.722,And that is why we are here--
1989.88-1835,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,936.722,937.205,Exactly.
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,937.205,953.832,"--because obviously the state is saying that that is not what this Court has meant by Bertine standard procedures, and the standard procedures that was meant for Bertine simply was that an inventory must occur on all impounded vehicles."
1989.88-1835,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,965.456,966.408,You just said valuable personal property.
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,972.645,978.799,"Well, I think in terms of valuable personal property, or personal property, that is my subjective statement."
1989.88-1835,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,981.834,987.238,Well then is it not reasonable to assume that any closed container contains something?
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,987.238,990.773,"It is most reasonable to assume that, yes, sir."
1989.88-1835,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,990.773,995.142,So that every closed container would reasonably be thought to contain some personal property.
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,995.142,995.808,"Yes, sir."
1989.88-1835,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,995.808,1002.248,"So that would mean that... does that mean that the officer has discretion in every case to open or not to open, or that he must open in every case?"
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,1002.248,1007.2,"Well, the discretion is there subject to civil liability."
1989.88-1835,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1012.036,1013.086,I don't understand.
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,1013.086,1014.471,What I am saying is that--
1989.88-1835,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1014.471,1016.757,"There is a container in a vehicle, and the officer finds it."
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,1021.392,1023.327,"--No, he must open it to inventory it."
1989.88-1835,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1023.327,1029.731,"But if you say that, how do you reconcile that with the court's statement that the Florida Highway Patrol"
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,1037.671,1038.82,That is right.
1989.88-1835,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1039.753,1041.705,Should we take your word or the court's word on this?
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,1043.491,1049.394,"--Well, I think what we... what the problem we have here is that the testimony of the officer was never fleshed out."
1989.88-1835,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1061.869,1073.177,"Well, the Florida court apparently was referring to the Highway Patrol Policy Manual, Chapter 16?"
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,1073.177,1073.694,"Yes, ma'am."
1989.88-1835,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1073.694,1074.894,Uh-huh.
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,1081.014,1081.7,Correct.
1989.88-1835,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1081.7,1084.735,Indicating that it wasn't in effect at that time.
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,1084.735,1100.844,"Well, there is some question as to the effective date of that, but that really has no bearing on this case, because in the testimony of Trooper Adams at the suppression hearing, there was no mention of the rules and regulations."
1989.88-1835,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1128.931,1136.5,"And yet the court, as Justice Stevens pointed out, found there was no firm policy."
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,1136.5,1144.987,"Well, the court, again, was looking at the written and not the oral, and the oral statement by the officer was--"
1989.88-1835,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1144.987,1149.991,Do you think if they had looked at the oral policy they would have found that it was firm and sufficient?
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,1149.991,1153.86,"--Well, again, you know, this case comes before this Court in a strange posture."
1989.88-1835,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1182.029,1191.551,And your position is that you lose unless it is their procedure to open every container?
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,1192.318,1192.92,Right.
1989.88-1835,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1192.92,1198.907,"So you find a bottle of, it looks like a bottle of Coca-Cola, you have to open it and make sure it's Coca-Cola?"
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,1202.509,1205.061,"Well, I believe that's carrying--"
1989.88-1835,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1205.061,1211.882,"Or a bottle of 1873, it looks like wine, it is 1873 Chateauneauf du Pape."
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,1214.5,1215.483,"--I think I could clarify that, that any--"
1989.88-1835,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1215.483,1216.452,"Well, really--"
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,1216.452,1222.856,"--closed, non-clear or an opaque container, where you can't ascertain the contents of that."
1989.88-1835,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1225.391,1232.795,"--I thought you said earlier, too, that it would be a container that would be likely to be, likely to be expected to contain personal property?"
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,1232.795,1236.164,"--Yes, exactly."
1989.88-1835,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1236.164,1238.866,"Every container is likely to contain personal property, isn't it?"
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,1241.584,1241.984,Correct.
1989.88-1835,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1247.988,1249.257,I think that is a very strict rule.
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,1265.349,1278.193,"--Well, I think... but I think that's a different area, because they can ascertain simply by looking at the wine bottle, that it is a sealed wine bottle, and an 1850 label, and they are not going to assume the liability to taste that wine."
1989.88-1835,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1278.193,1279.793,--So then they don't have to open every container.
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,1279.793,1282.061,But that is not the type of container we are talking about.
1989.88-1835,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1311.347,1312.964,So you have to allow some discretion.
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,1316.984,1317.668,"No, in that--"
1989.88-1835,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1317.668,1319.401,What is the limitation that you are applying?
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,1319.401,1327.357,"--In that scenario, what I was talking about is if you open up a briefcase, if you open up a locked briefcase, and those are the three items you find in that locked briefcase."
1989.88-1835,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1337.277,1337.979,Why?
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,1342.281,1346.851,When there is no longer a fear of losing personal property.
1989.88-1835,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1346.851,1352.988,"Well, I have seen notebooks, trial notes for the lawyers or something like that, that are of some importance to the lawyer."
1989.88-1835,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,1367.914,1372.2,"Well, the state would have no problem with listing the number of pages, but what I am saying is you don't have to read--"
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,1691.722,1696.459,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1848.689,1849.472,Mr. Johnson--
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,1849.472,1850.191,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1850.191,1861.462,"--The Supreme Court of Florida, as I read its opinion, discusses this under the head of an inventory search, and they don't say there was no effort to make an inventory search."
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,1871.27,1878.858,"Your Honor, the Supreme Court of Florida was unfortunately under a misguided set of circumstances in that--"
1989.88-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1878.858,1880.543,"Well, just a minute."
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,1880.543,1881.543,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1881.543,1894.303,"Be they misguided or not, do you agree with me that they did not follow the theory that you are now expounding, when they came to discuss the inventory search in their opinion?"
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,1895.736,1896.136,"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1989.88-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1896.136,1896.986,--You agree with me?
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,1896.986,1901.206,"Yes, I do, and I would like to expand on that, if I could, sir."
1989.88-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2056.157,2057.576,How do we know that?
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,2057.576,2058.509,--Your Honor--
1989.88-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2058.509,2062.978,Because certainly the Supreme Court of Florida indicated otherwise.
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,2062.978,2068.983,"--Your Honor, we have searched the record thoroughly since, unfortunately, this last Thursday night, that in a conversation--"
1989.88-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2068.983,2069.399,Well--
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,2069.399,2070.016,"--Excuse me, Your Honor."
1989.88-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2070.016,2071.751,--This thing isn't in the record at all.
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,2071.751,2076.887,That is because last Thursday night we noticed that in the record there has never been a date as to when the Florida--
1989.88-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2076.887,2080.005,"Well, you don't supplement the record that way in this Court."
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,2080.005,2087.261,"--Your Honor, I knew that it was not going to make us look good coming up here, but the point was it is something we just discovered Thursday."
1989.88-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2102.437,2110.793,"Well then, you know... certainly you can't contend that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida should be affirmed on this basis."
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,2114.245,2117.03,"--I think the case should be remanded, to be candid, Your Honor."
1989.88-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2147.233,2157.874,"Mr. Johnson, just in case we get to the point, if... what kind of guidelines do you think would be sufficient?"
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,2183.073,2188.375,"--That would be closer, but I don't care for that personally, Your Honor."
1989.88-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2196.131,2197.114,Period.
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,2197.114,2197.849,Period.
1989.88-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2198.883,2202.367,Open all... all containers.
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,2202.367,2203.034,"--Yes, sir."
1989.88-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2236.606,2239.824,So you agree there can be some discretion as to whether--
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,2239.824,2244.544,"--I think that under special exigencies, if you will, as were spoken about in--"
1989.88-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2244.544,2247.163,--Under special exigencies you can decline to open.
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,2247.163,2258.054,"--No, under a special exigency you could then open, because the special exigency would be a legitimate danger to the police or to the citizenry by, for example, the ticking bomb."
1989.88-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2258.054,2262.089,You think the only constitutional role is you can never open containers?
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,2263.355,2263.705,"No, sir."
1989.88-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2263.705,2265.207,--rule that says you must always open containers.
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,2265.207,2265.741,No.
1989.88-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2287.72,2290.656,And that would be discretion not to open.
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,2290.656,2294.56,"No, I think that would be... well, you would call the bomb squad at that point, if that is what you mean."
1989.88-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2294.56,2295.41,Yeah.
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,2305.082,2306.618,"Meaning no discretion, Your Honor?"
1989.88-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2306.618,2314.872,"Well, meaning no... perhaps no discretion, or perhaps some discretion, but that one and only one would comply with the Constitution."
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,2324.912,2328.614,"I would think that under the concept of federalism that that would be a possibility, Your Honor."
1989.88-1835,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2336.803,2347.492,"But that is not consistent with the Florida Supreme Court's opinion, is it, where it says the police under Bertine must mandate either that all containers will be opened or that no containers will be opened."
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,2347.492,2350.828,"No, it is not, Your Honor, and I have great difficulty with their opinion."
1989.88-1835,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2373.309,2377.844,But your view of discretion has nothing to do with whether they will find evidence of criminal activity.
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,2381.646,2386.883,"Well, the Opperman doctrine, yes, sir, would be the situation we are suggesting, Your Honor."
1989.88-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2527.523,2530.808,But that is not a violation of our... of our rules.
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,2546.501,2548.936,If there is bad faith and the sole purpose is to investigate--
1989.88-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2548.936,2549.319,It's not bad faith.
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,2567.748,2572.719,"--Yes, Your Honor, that is a violation under Bertine, as I read it, wherein the opinion talks about--"
1989.88-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2572.719,2573.921,I thought it was an objective test.
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,2573.921,2579.538,"--Bad faith or, and for the sole purpose of investigating."
1989.88-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2580.74,2582.54,This is not the sole purpose of investigating.
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,2593.782,2594.75,"--Well, Justice--"
1989.88-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2594.75,2597.786,The reason I want to inventory it is--
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,2597.786,2609.344,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I would suggest that if he had been inventorying at all, as has been pointed out by the question from Justice Stevens, we would have some list."
1989.88-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2756.915,2758.931,"--Mr. Johnson, could I ask you one other question?"
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,2758.931,2759.698,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-1835,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2759.698,2765.233,"I know you are not interested in these points, but it is the reason we took the case, and maybe we'll get to them."
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,2803.125,2805.81,"I think the answer to that is no, Your Honor."
1989.88-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2818.118,2819.587,"Thank you, Mr. Johnson."
1989.88-1835,1,27341,huntley_johnson,,2819.587,2820.203,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1989.88-1835,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2820.203,2822.021,"Mr. Neimand, do you have rebuttal?"
1989.88-1835,2,36397,michael_j_neimand,,2823.438,2824.723,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.88-1835,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2853.208,2855.243,"Yes, but you can't stipulate that the supreme court of--"
1989.88-1835,2,36397,michael_j_neimand,,2855.243,2856.026,"No, I am not stipulating."
1989.88-1835,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2856.026,2857.112,--Florida was wrong.
1989.88-1835,2,36397,michael_j_neimand,,2858.595,2860.314,"I am not stipulating, Your Honor."
1989.88-1835,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2860.314,2865.781,"--But, if we thought it was right, I suppose we would affirm it."
1989.88-1835,2,36397,michael_j_neimand,,2865.781,2866.383,I agree.
1989.88-1835,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2872.554,2879.124,"May I also suggest this, that it may have been wrong in stating that there are only two kinds of procedures that would be permissible."
1989.88-1835,2,36397,michael_j_neimand,,2891.413,2907.607,"--Well, that is not necessarily true, because in the joint appendix he also testified: well, based on the regulations we go by, if I was going to place him under arrest for DUI, I would have to tow the car, regardless, and from there, upon towing it, we would have to do an inventory search."
1989.88-1835,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2909.957,2910.873,He would have to do an inventory search.
1989.88-1835,2,36397,michael_j_neimand,,2922.098,2924.698,--Except for the definition of what an inventory search is.
