2003.02-6320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.802,"We'll hear argument now in No. 02-6320, John J. Fellers v. the United States."
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,8.545,10.857,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-6320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,39.731,51.498,"What is your authority, Mr. Waxman, for saying that this is different from the Miranda warnings in the sense that it's... it's an immediate violation rather than something... something like Miranda?"
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,51.498,54.842,"--Well, it's... Your Honor, I guess I have a two-fold answer."
2003.02-6320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,175.874,185.905,"Do police officers generally know this distinction, that when an indictment has been handed down, suddenly the Sixth Amendment is in the case as well as the Fifth?"
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,200.644,203.782,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I don't... I don't think I would call it fiction."
2003.02-6320,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,236.104,243.906,"Mr. Waxman, you... you're making a... a very technical distinction, if I understand you correctly."
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,282.998,288.571,"--Well, they... they aren't, Your Honor, and I don't think this is a matter of technicality or formality."
2003.02-6320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,317.633,321.925,The point is why... why should that make a difference other than the convenience of the bright line?
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,332.865,351.812,"Your... Your Honor, it's... it is entirely true that if the Court agrees with... agrees with our submission here, that the Government can very easily conform its conduct simply by not conducting uncounseled interrogations or elicitations prior to changing its status."
2003.02-6320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,433.752,436.436,"Well, how... how far does this right go, Mr. Waxman?"
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,443.123,443.866,"--Oh no, of course not."
2003.02-6320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,467.81,478.956,"Well, but it's... it's... I'm... I'm talking about a situation where, say the police simply say something to a... an indicted defendant."
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,482.504,491.504,"--There only is a violation of a right, Your Honor, if what... if the police statements and conduct amount to what this Court has deemed deliberate elicitation."
2003.02-6320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,503.021,503.021,And you think that's what happened here?
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,503.021,506.902,"I am... I am absolutely certain that that's what happened here, and the--"
2003.02-6320,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,506.902,510.163,That was the finding of the magistrate and the--
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,510.163,510.451,--Yes.
2003.02-6320,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,517.389,522.59,--He found deliberate eliciting of the comments at the first statement?
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,522.59,522.773,--Yes.
2003.02-6320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,528.14,528.678,Is that a factual finding or--
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,528.678,528.928,--It is.
2003.02-6320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,528.928,529.959,--or a legal conclusion?
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,541.681,550.105,"Well, it's... I think, Your Honor, Justice Scalia, it's... this is a mixed question of law and fact under Miller v. Fenton and Thompson v. Keohane."
2003.02-6320,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,551.181,568.354,"And the Eighth... the Eighth Circuit said, the Eighth Circuit is the closest court to this one, and I thought that the Eighth Circuit said, and that it's a threshold question in this case, that it wasn't anything like interrogation, and that that's... wasn't that the... the--"
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,568.354,569.097,--The Eighth--
2003.02-6320,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,569.097,570.462,--prime ground of the Eighth Circuit?
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,570.462,577.808,"--Justice Ginsburg, the Eighth Circuit... two judges, the majority, the panel in the Eighth Circuit, concluded that it wasn't interrogation."
2003.02-6320,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,580.575,580.863,But wouldn't we have to answer that--
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,580.863,587.716,"--pointed out, Judge Riley pointed out, that under the Sixth Amendment, unlike the Fifth, interrogation is not the standard."
2003.02-6320,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,603.198,614.055,--I thought the Eighth Circuit's position was that all this was was the police informing the defendant that he had been charged with this and this crime.
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,614.055,629.742,"That is... the... the... I don't believe the Eighth Circuit made any such finding, but the magistrate who heard the two officers testify and evaluated their credibility made a determination, Justice Scalia, that is a mixed question of fact and law."
2003.02-6320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,659.563,664.947,"Well, was... was there any debate or controversy about what they in fact said?"
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,664.947,671.619,"--There was no debate about what they said, but... but there was a credibility finding made by the magistrate, because the--"
2003.02-6320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,671.619,677.479,"If there was... if there was no factual dispute, why... why did... why was credibility involved?"
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,677.479,700.103,"--Well, when you have... when you... because there is a subjective intent here, the subjective intent of whether Officer Bliemeister, he came to the house knowing that this man had been indicted, and said, we are here to discuss with you your involvement with methamphetamine and your involvement with four individuals."
2003.02-6320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,700.103,702.704,"Well, why... why should subjective intent make any difference here?"
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,707.655,729.575,"Your Honor, I'm... I'm simply reciting back for... for you the court's instructions, and... and saying that if the standard is deliberate elicitation and intentionally creating a situation, it essentially, in terms of providing a line, it proscribes what the police may not deliberately do, and--"
2003.02-6320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,729.575,729.825,Well--
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,729.825,736.262,"--but deliberateness, I think, is a finding of the magistrate, which... to which the Eighth Circuit and this Court owe deference."
2003.02-6320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,736.262,755.209,"--But deliberateness may refer to nothing more than intending the statement that was made, and whether it elicits or not, or whether it constitutes elicitation... what a terrible word... whether it constitutes elicitation, it seems to me, can be judged objectively, can't it?"
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,755.209,763.92,"Your Honor, perhaps, but designed to elicit, it strikes me as including a subjective component."
2003.02-6320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,780.145,780.888,"Bliemeister, I think."
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,780.888,785.346,"--Bliemeister... had been the witness before the grand jury, and he comes--"
2003.02-6320,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,785.346,787.947,"Mr.... Mr. Waxman, I... I will assume that that is correct."
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,802.33,807.531,--I don't remember what the officer did in Elstad.
2003.02-6320,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,807.531,813.93,"Well, in... in Elstad, the... there were two officers, one went with the mother of the suspect into the kitchen to tell her why they were there."
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,845.015,845.47,"Well, that--"
2003.02-6320,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,845.47,846.379,But I want to know whether you agree.
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,846.379,848.071,--I... I actually don't agree.
2003.02-6320,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,855.107,855.646,Well--
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,855.646,870.794,"--when the police officers come and say, we are here to discuss with you the following things, which happened to be the precise things that he has just been indicted for, that is a paradigm... paradigmatic deliberate elicitation."
2003.02-6320,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,870.794,871.332,"--Well, yeah, but--"
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,871.332,871.992,And--
2003.02-6320,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,871.992,879.589,"--to... to say to a kid, you know, I think you may know something about this, and the person making that statement's a cop, sounds like elicitation to me."
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,879.589,880.498,"--Well, if... if... Mr.--"
2003.02-6320,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,880.498,899.53,"Functionally... if... if functionally it is, let's assume... I... I tend to think it is... and... and functionally in each case, whether it's Fifth Amendment right or Sixth Amendment right, the statement doesn't come in unless there is, among other things, a voluntary waiver of the right to the presence of counsel then and there."
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,917.65,922.414,--Because the functional analysis depends on the right being protected.
2003.02-6320,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,936.226,937.896,"Well, neither does the Sixth."
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,952.035,954.059,--It... the difference is what's being protected.
2003.02-6320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,963.347,967.433,"Well, Mr. Waxman, isn't it also true that in one case there was an indictment, in the other there wasn't?"
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,967.433,968.01,"--Well, yes."
2003.02-6320,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,977.92,981.551,And... and recognize he's got that right because there was the indictment.
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1007.557,1008.217,Absolutely.
2003.02-6320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1062.542,1069.685,"But most of our Miranda cases, we recognize that the... the police nationwide understand the dynamics of Miranda."
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1079.799,1080.337,But--
2003.02-6320,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1080.337,1084.896,--their Fifth and Sixth Amendment obligations in... in this... in these circumstances.
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1084.896,1090.301,"--But Justice Kennedy, I submit to you that it doesn't matter as a matter of constitutional prophylaxis."
2003.02-6320,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1162.981,1163.27,"Mr. Waxman, can I... Mr.--"
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1185.644,1186.553,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-6320,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1209.216,1226.184,"Well, because of the Eighth Circuit's position on the original statements, it really didn't address the subsequent jailhouse statements in any proper fashion, did it?"
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1226.184,1226.434,--No.
2003.02-6320,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1234.607,1234.807,Right.
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1234.807,1236.543,--what the fruits consequences are.
2003.02-6320,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1236.543,1249.629,"So I suppose... if we were to agree with you on the first statement and conclude they were deliberately elicited, we'd have to remand, I suppose--"
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1249.629,1250.994,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
2003.02-6320,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1250.994,1251.653,--on the second question.
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1251.653,1269.28,"Because the question presented in the petition, the second question presented in the petition is, okay, assuming that there was a violation of the Sixth Amendment in the first interrogation, does the invocation, the mere invocation of Miranda warnings, cleanse that taint?"
2003.02-6320,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1269.28,1270.189,"No, it wasn't that--"
2003.02-6320,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1270.189,1273.987,"--Well, except the Eighth Circuit didn't address that second question."
2003.02-6320,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1273.987,1274.154,Right.
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1274.154,1274.73,That's correct.
2003.02-6320,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1274.73,1276.876,"Well, would you like to say something about it--"
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1276.876,1277.414,I would.
2003.02-6320,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1277.414,1281.091,"--because I... in looking at it, I want... would like you to address the particular argument."
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1312.337,1312.709,Well--
2003.02-6320,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1312.709,1314.073,So they're different subject matters.
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1324.254,1324.537,--Okay.
2003.02-6320,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1324.537,1324.62,What do you say?
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1324.62,1327.881,I'll... I'll answer Justice O'Connor's question first and then your question.
2003.02-6320,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1357.025,1364.761,"But certainly the... the... the defendant can waive his right to counsel later on, and he did."
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1364.761,1365.942,He absolutely can.
2003.02-6320,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1367.223,1367.799,And he did.
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1367.799,1368.542,--He--
2003.02-6320,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1368.542,1374.404,Do you think it's tainted simply because if we find a violation originally?
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1374.404,1386.292,"--Our... our case, Your Honor, doesn't depend on any argument or showing that the second statement was either involuntary or that the waiver of the right to counsel was not knowing and intelligent."
2003.02-6320,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1412.094,1416.302,But he can certainly waive his Sixth Amendment right later.
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1422.701,1426.499,"--Well, you... you have never held in a Sixth Amendment--"
2003.02-6320,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1426.499,1427.408,No.
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1427.408,1430.752,--You've never held the... the precise question that's presented here for sure.
2003.02-6320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1480.991,1484.706,How is the second statement the fruit of the first?
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1484.706,1501.712,"The first statement in the first... I mean, as a... that... this is a sort of a common sense, practical analysis, but in the first statement he was... he acknowledged that he had used methamphetamines and he had associated with the four individuals that the police officer named."
2003.02-6320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1556.41,1575.54,"I can under... I can understand the position, although I'm not entirely persuaded by it, that where... when you are violate... have violated the Fifth Amendment and gotten a confession that's already on the table, the second confession is sort of the fruit of that, because the person thinks, what the heck, I've already confessed, I may as well... that's the argument that it's the fruit."
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1575.54,1576.472,The taint--
2003.02-6320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1576.472,1590.097,But I don't... but I don't see how the waiver of... of counsel the second time is the... is the fruit of the improper approach the first time.
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1595.502,1596.578,"--Your Honor, the taint--"
2003.02-6320,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1596.578,1598.503,That doesn't follow the way... the way confession does.
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1598.503,1636.164,"--The taint, which this Court in Elstad, in part IIa of its opinion in Elstad, said was insufficient... IIb... was insufficient to prove involuntariness, is in fact what demonstrates that there is fruit of the poisonous tree here in the link, and that is the accepted, common sense proposition that an uncounseled accused, from whom the Government deliberately elicits an unwarned, incriminatory statement after it institutes adversarial proceedings, is erroneously likely to believe that there is little to be gained and much to be lost from attempting to avoid further incrimination."
2003.02-6320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1636.164,1641.365,"Well, now, but is there... is there some authority for that specific proposition that you just said?"
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1641.365,1645.163,"This Court recognized it in Bayer, in Brown, in--"
2003.02-6320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1645.163,1647.931,Did it say... I... I'm... you... you just recited kind of a litany.
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1651.396,1658.992,"--Well, in Brown, for example, it said that the second warrant statement, quote, was clearly the result and fruit of the first."
2003.02-6320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1671.707,1672.904,But that... that's a... that's a first statement.
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1677.075,1678.022,It is the same thing.
2003.02-6320,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1703.946,1707.168,"Yeah, but isn't the... the... isn't the... correct me if I'm wrong."
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1718.89,1719.262,Yes.
2003.02-6320,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1719.634,1720.999,--that your position?
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1720.999,1726.05,"--as... as Justice Harlan stated in his concurrence in Darwin, which is only a concurrence, but I think is sort of the--"
2003.02-6320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1726.05,1729.748,"Well, but that... that's... the cat out of the bag is what we rejected in Elstad."
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1729.748,1738.21,"--You rejected it, Your Honor, as evidence or as constituting or... or eliciting a presumption of involuntariness."
2003.02-6320,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1781.843,1796.045,"And that should make the case... that case that we heard yesterday easier than this one if that's the standard, because there, the first unwarned set of questions was much more intense, much more detailed than in this case."
2003.02-6320,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1796.045,1796.211,--Right.
2003.02-6320,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1811.322,1811.86,"Thank you, Mr. Waxman."
2003.02-6320,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1813.512,1817.683,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-6320,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1841.626,1849.428,Did the Eighth Circuit ever decide whether there was a knowing and voluntary waiver at the jailhouse?
2003.02-6320,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1849.428,1850.643,Yes.
2003.02-6320,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1866.247,1877.392,I thought that perhaps since they didn't think the first statement posed a problem that they never really got to the crux of the jailhouse inquiry.
2003.02-6320,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1877.392,1882.388,"Well, I... I think in... in part, Justice O'Connor, your reading of the opinion is correct."
2003.02-6320,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1951.575,1974.237,"Just so I understand what the Sixth Amendment rule is, if the Sixth Amendment prohibits the state from eliciting statements when the defend... when proceedings have begun, outside presence of counsel, is it wrong for them to give the Miranda warning and if he's then silent, then go ahead and say, now you've had your Miranda warning, would you like to talk to us?"
2003.02-6320,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1984.89,1985.755,Yes.
2003.02-6320,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2023.528,2027.076,And they can attempt to elicit that waiver consistently with the Sixth Amendment?
2003.02-6320,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2027.076,2027.698,That's correct.
2003.02-6320,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2035.926,2036.548,"No, that wasn't my question."
2003.02-6320,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2046.912,2050.748,"--I think so, if that's construed as seeking a waiver of his right to counsel."
2003.02-6320,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2077.293,2082.206,"But, Mr. Dreeben, maybe I'm wrong on the facts, but you're relying on the waiver at the station house?"
2003.02-6320,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2082.206,2082.782,--That's correct.
2003.02-6320,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2082.782,2087.407,Do you agree that prior to that waiver there had already been a violation of the Sixth Amendment?
2003.02-6320,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2087.407,2088.931,"No, Justice Stevens."
2003.02-6320,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2089.181,2090.873,"Well, then... then you don't need the waiver."
2003.02-6320,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2090.873,2092.609,--That... that is true.
2003.02-6320,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2105.24,2106.726,Assume it was deliberate elicitation.
2003.02-6320,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2108.5,2113.192,"--No, I wouldn't say that it was a... an actual violation of the Sixth Amendment at the time."
2003.02-6320,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2119.108,2124.392,"So even if there was no waiver at the home, there... there still was no violation of the Constitution?"
2003.02-6320,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2124.392,2125.674,--Not at that time.
2003.02-6320,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2129.351,2129.761,It seems to me a rather extreme position.
2003.02-6320,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2129.761,2143.218,"--Well, I... I don't think it is extreme, because I'm going to follow it up with what I think Your Honor is getting to, which is, can the police simply go to an indicted suspect's home, ignore his right to counsel, and engage in questioning?"
2003.02-6320,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2159.444,2160.103,"Well, what is the sometimes yes?"
2003.02-6320,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2160.103,2178.679,"Sometimes yes is that, this Court has recognized in its seminal case in this area, the Massiah case, and then again in Maine v. Moulton, that the Sixth Amendment, as it is offense-specific, does not preclude the police from investigating ongoing criminal activity that's not charged."
2003.02-6320,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2178.679,2183.592,"Well, but this is... this was an offense-specific interrogation if it... if was an interrogation."
2003.02-6320,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2183.592,2184.789,Yes.
2003.02-6320,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2187.557,2190.901,It seems to me there's an analogy to civil cases here.
2003.02-6320,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2204.564,2212.282,"--There may be a ethical obligation, even if the party is not known to be represented at the time, although--"
2003.02-6320,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2212.282,2214.345,"If he's known not to be represented, that's my case."
2003.02-6320,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2214.345,2221.654,"--He's known not be represented, I think it's a closer question whether... whether the ethics rules would... would bar the approaching of the defendant."
2003.02-6320,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2222.518,2223.611,Who... who... who would you go to?
2003.02-6320,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2226.833,2227.088,"--Well, Justice Stevens--"
2003.02-6320,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2227.088,2229.184,--and he's filed the case... he's filed the case pro se.
2003.02-6320,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2231.003,2232.117,"--I think, Justice Stevens--"
2003.02-6320,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2232.117,2234.635,"Now, I'm assuming that the... the Government is the plaintiff in the case."
2003.02-6320,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2234.885,2236.759,--The implication is that you couldn't approach him.
2003.02-6320,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2259.488,2270.484,"--Well, can the police approach a person and deliberately elicit statements without advising him of his right to counsel after indictment?"
2003.02-6320,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2270.484,2275.464,"Not on the charged offense, Justice O'Connor, and have the information admitted at trial."
2003.02-6320,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2278.474,2282.932,"Well, have we looked to whether the statement was deliberately elicited?"
2003.02-6320,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2288.134,2292.592,"--That... that has been the way that this Court has formulated the test, and I would suggest that if--"
2003.02-6320,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2292.592,2296.679,And so should we apply that test here to those early statements?
2003.02-6320,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2296.679,2309.022,"--Yes, but I think the Court should clearly reformulate it to make it in the context of overt interrogation by the police, known police officers, to be an objective test."
2003.02-6320,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2414.905,2417.422,"Didn't they say, we're here to discuss with you?"
2003.02-6320,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2417.422,2418.909,--Justice--
2003.02-6320,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2418.909,2421.76,"Wasn't it Bliemeister's statement, I'm here to discuss with you?"
2003.02-6320,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2421.76,2432.617,"--Justice Souter, on three occasions when Officer Bliemeister was asked to say what he said in his own words, he said, we're here to discuss your methamphetamine activities."
2003.02-6320,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2479.633,2481.407,Telling... telling is not discussing.
