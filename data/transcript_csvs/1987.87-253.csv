1987.87-253,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,20.228,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 87-253, Otis Bowen v. Chan Kendrick, 87-431, Bowen v. Kendrick, 87-462, Kendrick v. Bowen, 87-775, United Families of America v. Kendrick."
1987.87-253,0,18942,charles_fried,,21.991,25.974,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-253,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,313.046,324.619,"Mr. Fried, is it possible that as applied this statute would meet the Hunt v. McNair standard that you want us to apply?"
1987.87-253,0,18942,charles_fried,,324.619,325.556,It certainly is possible.
1987.87-253,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,370.163,385.548,"Well, what do our cases tell us we should do if we think a statute might be constitutional on its face but not as applied, and if the evidence is there, to establish that?"
1987.87-253,0,18942,charles_fried,,385.548,387.484,That is it constitutionally applied.
1987.87-253,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,387.484,390.185,That it is unconstitutionally applied.
1987.87-253,0,18942,charles_fried,,390.185,398.277,"If it is unconstitutionally applied, then I think the question becomes, is it capable of being constitutionally applied?"
1987.87-253,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,418.769,424.595,Is that how the Court has handled aid to parochial schools?
1987.87-253,0,18942,charles_fried,,424.595,444.039,"--I believe if you look at the most recent instances, Aguilar and Grand Rapids, Title I, here was a general program which, it turns out, a number of states were not applying in an appropriate way."
1987.87-253,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,529.52,539.485,Were there any findings in the District Court where you would concede in this case that there were some unconstitutional applications?
1987.87-253,0,18942,charles_fried,,539.485,550.073,"In our brief we said that there were some departures, but I don't think, Justice Kennedy, it is correct to say there were any findings of any sort in the District Court."
1987.87-253,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,584.108,595.212,"You concede that all of those departures were not just departures from the regulation, but were unconstitutional?"
1987.87-253,0,18942,charles_fried,,595.212,602.615,"Well, I think--"
1987.87-253,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,602.615,609.91,Because in that respect I think you diverge from the private Appellant here.
1987.87-253,0,18942,charles_fried,,609.91,628.902,"--I think that some of those departures are departures not only from what the Secretary was directing, but also departures from a fairly tight reading of some of the decisions of this Court."
1987.87-253,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,674.744,685.222,But there have been no findings by the District Court on which to sort the ones that are constitutionally suspect and those that are not.
1987.87-253,0,18942,charles_fried,,685.222,685.894,Plainly not.
1987.87-253,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,711.994,721.194,Is it available to us to make any additional factual findings that are necessary?
1987.87-253,0,18942,charles_fried,,722.879,728.892,It would be most unusual; this is not an original action.
1987.87-253,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,799.255,801.021,"Mr. Fried, can I ask you one question about the procedure?"
1987.87-253,0,18942,charles_fried,,804.721,805.549,There were.
1987.87-253,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,805.549,814.014,"And I did not understand you to be arguing that the case should be sent back for trial, but rather that the record is adequate to decide the case one way or the other."
1987.87-253,0,18942,charles_fried,,814.014,821.215,"If that is your impression, we have mislead you, Justice Stevens."
1987.87-253,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,844.501,850.187,"Is it your view, then, that some of the facts that the District Court thought were undisputed are, in fact, disputed?"
1987.87-253,0,18942,charles_fried,,850.187,851.328,--Absolutely.
1987.87-253,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,851.328,851.671,I see.
1987.87-253,0,18942,charles_fried,,851.671,854.186,Most definitely so.
1987.87-253,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,872.537,874.678,"That shouldn't be too hard to identify, shouldn't it?"
1987.87-253,0,18942,charles_fried,,887.734,897.45,"Well, that was done, and we then set forth in our motion for summary judgment those facts that we thought were disputed."
1987.87-253,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1075.378,1081.595,"Mr. McConnell, we will hear now from you."
1987.87-253,1,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1081.595,1092.979,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-253,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1175.962,1192.705,"Well, Mr. McConnell, do our cases support the view that public funds may be used to teach secular subjects in parochial schools to teenagers?"
1987.87-253,1,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1192.705,1195.094,"No, Your Honor."
1987.87-253,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1225.551,1236.093,"Does this statute, in your view, contemplate that parochial schools, for instance, could be grantees in these programs?"
1987.87-253,1,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1236.093,1247.542,"I suppose so, Your Honor, so long as the class of potential grantees includes a much wider category than just parochial schools."
1987.87-253,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1250.837,1260.349,"But it would contemplate that a parochial school, for instance, could be a grantee and teach these subjects in pregnancy prevention with federal funds."
1987.87-253,1,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1260.349,1272.376,"--None of the grantees, in fact, have been parochial schools, but I am not aware of any reason why they would be excluded as one of a much broader range of potential grantees under the program."
1987.87-253,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1272.376,1278.154,"And it is your position that as so interpreted, it can be upheld under our precedents?"
1987.87-253,1,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1278.154,1278.982,"Yes, Your Honor."
1987.87-253,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1278.982,1289.916,"Should the Court, on remand, determine whether any of these organizations are pervasively sectarian, or is that an improper test?"
1987.87-253,1,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1289.916,1315.779,"We have no quarrel with the test of pervasively sectarian, and for this reason: under this Court's definitions... which were, frankly, ignored by the District Court... a pervasively sectarian institution is one that is simply incapable... by virtue of being so permeated with religion... of distinguishing between the teaching or promotion of religion on the one hand, and the carrying out of secular purposes on the other."
1987.87-253,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1665.982,1673.51,"But Mr. McConnell, is that different from a grant that says it can go to religious organizations provided the religious beliefs are of a certain kind?"
1987.87-253,1,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1673.51,1687.582,"--I do believe that those are quite different situations, and it is simply not true that this program gives grants only to organizations with beliefs of a certain kind."
1987.87-253,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1726.66,1727.597,"Thank you, Mr. McConnell."
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,1729.878,1740.857,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1987.87-253,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1830.618,1839.036,"So you say, Ms. Benshoof, that one would judge this statute after ten years of operation just the same way you would judge it on the day it was enacted?"
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,1839.036,1845.987,I think after ten years of operation you would have stronger proof that it is certain to do so.
1987.87-253,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1848.439,1857.309,"You say you would, then, judge it the same way after ten years of operation as you would on the day it was enacted?"
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,1857.309,1857.856,--Yes.
1987.87-253,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1898.684,1903.385,But you can't look at that evidence to demonstrate that it doesn't have a significant unconstitutional application.
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,1903.385,1903.822,That's right.
1987.87-253,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1903.822,1907.82,Sort of a one way look at subsequent practice: it can hurt you but it can't help you.
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,1907.82,1908.508,That's right.
1987.87-253,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1931.75,1941.384,"It seems to me if we can look to the practice and the application of it in order to determine that it is unconstitutional, we ought to be able to look to them to determine that it is constitutional as well."
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,1946.07,1972.17,"Well, the basis was described by this Court in your majority opinions both in Grand Rapids and in Aguilar, where you said the fact that there had been no proof in 18 years of unconstitutional application, that didn't mean that there wasn't a high risk, and that there were certain factors mitigating against those kinds of unconstitutional applications being brought to the forefront."
1987.87-253,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2051.278,2061.149,"May I ask, because your brief has a good deal of factual material in it that the District Court did not refer to, do you refer to any of those 29 disputed facts, or do you rest entirely on the undisputed?"
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,2061.149,2063.679,We rest entirely on the undisputed facts.
1987.87-253,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2070.004,2078.938,But what you are telling me... just to make sure... is that what you described as factual in your brief is within the limits of those that the District Court regarded as undisputed?
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,2078.938,2079.767,--Absolutely.
1987.87-253,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2087.357,2106.661,"Ms. Benshoof, do you think that the statute would survive, in your view, if there were additional statutory or administrative proscriptions against the misuse of government for non-secular purposes?"
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,2106.661,2108.911,"No, I don't think so for three reasons."
1987.87-253,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2136.01,2137.055,"It says, as appropriate."
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,2137.055,2149.285,"--Yes, although this is disputed by the government, the District Court, HHS, grant applicants themselves, and the 1984 Senate committee all agreed with our interpretation."
1987.87-253,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2164.998,2166.217,As appropriate.
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,2166.217,2172.698,"Well, we agree it is as appropriate in the delivery of their services, not whether or not they want to have them."
1987.87-253,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2210.619,2225.77,"Ms. Benshoof, let me ask you this: you don't contest, I don't think, that Congress can lawfully adopt, as a purpose, encouraging and inculcating in the young sexual self-restraint?"
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,2226.893,2228.143,Absolutely not.
1987.87-253,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2236.343,2242.028,"--Now, let me put the worst case scenario to you that was suggested by Justice O'Connor."
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,2264.66,2283.043,"When we are talking about teaching itself, this Court has always said that the entanglement problems... even if you had a statute that separated the sectarian from the secular, which this statute doesn't... are too much, particularly with these kinds of religiously sensitive values."
1987.87-253,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2309.141,2318.794,"You can have other organizations who have the opposite values that can teach those values, even if the people that are teaching them are religiously motivated."
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,2327.525,2331.929,"Obviously, our public schools teach a lot of values; we all know that."
1987.87-253,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2397.122,2400.682,Is the Covenant House a religious authority?
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,2406.274,2412.585,We did extensive discovery on the 1981 and the 1982 grantees.
1987.87-253,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2415.801,2433.153,"Well, as you know they are founded by the Franciscans, but they are open to all people, and the District Court's rationale, as I understood it from page 34 of the record, was that this is a religious organization that may not give this kind of program."
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,2433.153,2438.152,--The District Court said that you should use a functional definition of a religious organization.
1987.87-253,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2443.275,2444.056,What about the Covenant House?
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,2447.18,2450.038,--They might have filed a... I don't know.
1987.87-253,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2458.909,2462.922,"They are founded by the Franciscans, and suppose they are supervised by Franciscan fathers."
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,2462.922,2483.368,"--If they have religious dictates on the kind of care funded under this, if they counsel teenage girls, but they will not give information that even the statute allows you to give because of religious reasons, if there is a religious override on their secular care, and they do educational programs that are governed by religious dictates, yes, they are."
1987.87-253,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2485.618,2487.163,Can they do drug counselling?
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,2487.163,2497.362,"That would depend what statute they are doing the drug counselling under, whether the secular and the sectarian are separate--"
1987.87-253,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2497.362,2506.14,Suppose it is simply a statute that is designed to discourage drug use and encourage abstinence and avoidance of drugs.
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,2506.14,2525.522,"--If they have religious guidelines on how they discourage drug use, such as tell people, as one grantee did in this program, that using drugs means the devil is wasting your body, that Satan will strike you down, most certainly they could not."
1987.87-253,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2525.522,2537.486,Do you agree with the District Court when it said that to presume that counsellors from religious organizations can put their beliefs aside when counselling an adolescent on matters that are a part of religious doctrine is simply unrealistic?
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,2537.486,2548.966,"Absolutely, because every religious organization that got funding when we did discovery was operating under religious dictates whether they were religious themselves or not."
1987.87-253,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2596.213,2601.96,What if the chief executive officer of a sectarian hospital was personally very religiously motivated?
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,2607.536,2609.348,Absolutely not.
1987.87-253,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2614.736,2617.845,But only people have beliefs in the long run.
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,2623.217,2627.294,But people operate under religious dictates that they may or may not believe in.
1987.87-253,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2638.195,2643.537,That could be the imposed belief of the director as well as the imposed belief of the institution.
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,2660.513,2669.635,It depends whether or not that affects the degree of the religious delivery of services or not.
1987.87-253,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2678.944,2687.879,"If the religious belief affects the ability of the organization to implement the program properly, now, that certainly is a different question, as in your drug testing example."
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,2706.887,2709.448,"No, you misconstrue my answer."
1987.87-253,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2827.181,2832.523,"I think there is an administrative prohibition of use for religious purposes, isn't there?"
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,2832.523,2835.897,"Absolutely, and that is deficient for four reasons."
1987.87-253,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2835.897,2842.894,"Well, does that fact that it is administrative rather than statutory affect your judgment of the program?"
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,2842.894,2847.126,"Yes, it does, and I think it has affected this Court's judgment in the past."
1987.87-253,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2893.327,2899.948,Do you think the Court meant that the case would have come out differently had the statute not been amended?
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,2899.948,2929.765,"Yes, and in fact, Justice White, when he wrote the opinion in Regan upholding a New York statute that gave parochial schools reimbursement for state mandated tests, that case took care of a problem that this Court had struck down in Levitt where there were no statutory guarantees, and Justice White made it quite clear that if those kinds of guarantees were not in the face of the statute, the outcome of the case would have been different."
1987.87-253,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2929.765,2935.935,"Did the opinion there say that had they only been administrative and not statutory, the result would have been different?"
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,2935.935,2940.027,"No, they didn't, but I would like to point out that this isn't even really administrative."
1987.87-253,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2972.185,2988.318,"Ms. Benshoof, in the First Amendment area we have certainly upheld legislative schemes that do not contain in the statutes sufficient standards to guide the administrator's discretion."
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,3009.263,3015.261,"You have never upheld that in the Establishment Clause area, and I believe it is because of the very--"
1987.87-253,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3015.261,3018.135,We have never had occasion to address it in the Establishment Clause area--
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,3018.135,3030.551,"--Well, in a sense you have, because in cases such as Levitt when it wasn't clear that the state mandated test would... when you gave the money to the parochial school, it would only be used for that."
1987.87-253,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3058.838,3068.366,"--We are not talking here about inferring a regulation; we are not talking about speculating that a regulation could be adopted; we have one, and in those other cases we didn't have any."
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,3068.366,3088.044,"Well, the problem with dwelling on the fact... I think the importance of the fact of the administrative regulation for this case is not that it would constitutionalize anything, but its importance is to show how inadequate it has been."
1987.87-253,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3175.914,3184.224,"Ms. Benshoof, the government suggests that you do not really defend the standard that the District Court used, is that right?"
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,3184.224,3185.833,--That is absolutely incorrect.
1987.87-253,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3187.566,3190.44,What standard do you think the District Court applied here?
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,3190.44,3201.482,"--The District Court said that this statute violated the primary effects doctrine in five ways, and it violated the entanglement doctrine in two ways."
1987.87-253,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3248.838,3258.773,Suppose none of the grants had ever been to religiously affiliated organizations that were pervasively religious.
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,3263.318,3278.513,"Yes, because the pervasively sectarian doctrine developed by this Court in the college aid case is certainly not the heart of the Establishment Clause jurisprudence, it is only a shorthand way to know it you should go ahead and look at other factors."
1987.87-253,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3303.129,3313.266,So your submission here is that it just doesn't make any difference whether these religiously affiliated organizations were pervasively religious or not?
1987.87-253,2,28893,janet_benshoof,,3313.266,3319.091,"It doesn't make a difference, but I think that the government has also used a wrong definition."
1987.87-253,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3469.765,3473.247,"Thank you, Ms. Benshoof."
1987.87-253,3,18942,charles_fried,,3475.169,3504.126,"I would like to just briefly indicate that the joint appendix, Justice Kennedy, has an affidavit from Father Bruce Ritter, who is the president of Covenant House and an AFLA grantee, setting out the programs, and that was available to the District Court on the summary judgment motions."
1987.87-253,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3595.682,3599.508,"In fairness, General Fried, I think it is more than that."
1987.87-253,3,18942,charles_fried,,3626.842,3633.121,--It is not all right with federal money to say you may not have premarital sex because it is a sin.
1987.87-253,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3635.743,3640.039,"Thank you, General Fried, the case is submitted."
