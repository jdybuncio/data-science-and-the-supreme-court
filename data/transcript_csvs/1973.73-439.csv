1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,35.716,39.892,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-439,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,498.157,499.917,The defendants here --
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,499.917,522.145,"The defendants Your Honor were Lum's, the Corporation; Mr. Chasen, Lehman Brothers and its employee Benjamin Simon; Investors Diversified Services and two of its funds and two employees of IDS who are alleged to have receive the tip and recommended the sale of the stock."
1973.73-439,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,522.145,526.954,"In the Diamond case -- In the Diamond case, the defendants were corporate officers or directors?"
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,526.954,528.276,"Yes, Your Honor, yes."
1973.73-439,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,553.696,558.811,"Who actually done the selling, that actually sold their own shares?"
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,558.811,561.951,"That’s correct Your Honor, that it actually sold the shares."
1973.73-439,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,561.951,565.785,"Now, in this case, where there any defendants a corporate officers or directors?"
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,565.785,566.989,Just Mr. Chasen.
1973.73-439,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,571.701,572.486,I see.
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,572.486,575.639,Lehman Brothers had no relationship to Lum's.
1973.73-439,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,630.187,634.58,"Mr. Hagan, I take it that it is accepted that Florida law does apply here?"
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,634.58,643.768,"Your Honor, in the lower court before Judge Tyler, the defendants argue that Florida law applied but the respondents disputed this point."
1973.73-439,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,698.723,705.763,Did your clients make any request to Judge Tyler that he certify the Florida law question to the Florida courts?
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,705.763,707.011,"No, we did not Your Honor.[Voice Overlap]"
1973.73-439,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,707.011,710.964,"Well I think they could, would you refer it, they found the statute --"
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,710.964,714.042,First of all -- that’s correct Mr. Justice Brennan.
1973.73-439,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,741.781,745.596,When did you first request that this question be certified?
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,745.596,752.401,"The first request was on the petition for rehearing before Second Circuit Your Honor, and --"
1973.73-439,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,752.401,758.261,"It was after the decision came down, including Judge Kaufman’s dissent?"
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,758.261,758.959,That’s correct.
1973.73-439,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,767.88,773.438,Was there a reason for not moving for certification before the decision?
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,773.438,785.195,"Well, Your Honor, I think as far as the present petitioners were concerned, it was their position that the Law of Florida was not unclear or uncertain."
1973.73-439,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,836.761,839.638,"Mr. Hagan, have you answered to Mr. Justice Blackmun?"
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,844.625,847.336,"Yes, I was getting to that, I am sorry Mr. Justice Brennan."
1973.73-439,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,881.793,883.308,And none here of course?
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,883.308,886.706,"There appears to be none here, no."
1973.73-439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,886.706,889.552,In what cases -- go ahead Mr. Justice Blackmun.
1973.73-439,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,889.552,898.122,"No, I am just going to ask whether Judge Kaufman’s dissent was on the certification issue was really a sua sponte, was this his own idea?"
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,898.122,898.792,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-439,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,898.792,900.155,It was not discussed at oral argument?
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,900.155,903.47,Not discussed at oral argument and not discussed in the briefs.
1973.73-439,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,903.47,911.028,"And I would presume, if you would have prevailed in the Second Circuit without ever certifying to the Supreme Court of Florida, you would not be interested in certifying?"
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,911.028,916.215,"Your Honor, it was not our position before the Second Circuit."
1973.73-439,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,947.183,951.846,"Well, the Second Circuit can’t change the law of Florida, can it?"
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,951.846,959.275,"Well, Your Honor, what the Second Circuit did here, I submit was imposing new rule on the law of Florida."
1973.73-439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1036.73,1044.76,"Before you go on, some of these cases that are cited here on certification were sua sponte by the appellate court, were they not?"
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,1044.76,1045.305,To which case?
1973.73-439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1045.531,1047.681,"Well, some of them, I don’t recall which one."
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,1047.681,1047.856,Oh!
1973.73-439,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1057.047,1059.073,"I do not know about many but we did in Aldrich, didn’t we?"
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,1059.073,1069.198,You did in Aldrich and you did in the Clay and you did in Dresner against City of Tallahassee.
1973.73-439,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1069.355,1071.327,I remember all that was sua sponte.
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,1072.671,1075.254,I believe Clay also Your Honor was sua sponte.
1973.73-439,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1273.146,1274.346,May I ask Mr. Hagan?
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,1274.346,1274.911,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-439,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1274.911,1281.141,"If it were not this Florida procedure, would this be a case for federal abstention?"
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,1281.141,1282.493,We believe it would be Your Honor.
1973.73-439,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1283.503,1286.141,No constitutional question (Inaudible)
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,1286.141,1297.046,"Well, Your Honor, we feel that under this Court’s decision in Thibodaux and Kaiser Steel, this would be the type of question."
1973.73-439,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1337.484,1341.912,"Well, that’s an argument whether or not this would have been a case for abstention."
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,1341.912,1342.594,"That is, you’re right."
1973.73-439,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1342.594,1346.347,"As long as Florida has this statute, the federal courts have to avail one?"
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,1346.347,1348.089,That is our position Your Honor.
1973.73-439,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1348.089,1366.057,"Mr. Hagan, do you think it makes any difference that Thibodaux arose in a District Court in Louisiana and depended on Louisiana law and Kaiser arose in a District Court in New Mexico and depended on New Mexico law, where this arose in the Southern District of New York and depended on Florida Law?"
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,1366.057,1368.543,"I think that makes our case much stronger, Your Honor because --"
1973.73-439,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1368.543,1369.112,Why?
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,1369.112,1379.807,"Well, because in those situations, presumably, the federal court sitting in those districts would be knowledgeable in the law of the jurisdiction."
1973.73-439,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1410.105,1419.574,What does the District Court in the Southern District of New York tell these litigants to do when it abstains -- just dismiss their action and tell the plaintiff to go get service and [Voice Overlap]
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,1419.574,1446.906,"Your Honor, here, if a state has a certification statute and today, 12 States do and there has been quite a trend here in the last number of years, depending upon whether the statute of the state permits District Court certification or appellate court certification, the parties frame a certified question to the court of that state."
1973.73-439,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1570.533,1572.004,"Is it in now what, 11 States?"
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,1572.004,1573.809,"Now, we have 12, Your Honor."
1973.73-439,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1583.444,1585.263,Are they all rather similar statute?
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,1585.263,1586.156,Basically yes.
1973.73-439,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1607.78,1609.831,Except that it expands to the District Court?
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,1609.831,1615.629,"It goes to the District Court also, from its District Court certification."
1973.73-439,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1643.32,1644.526,"Mr. Hagan, may I just ask."
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,1644.526,1646.062,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-439,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1646.062,1659.072,"Is there anything, any of these statutes which permit whether our federal questions are in the case, a reservation of the federal questions as we held at England, the litigant and an abstention case finding?"
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,1659.072,1659.43,Yes.
1973.73-439,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1677.447,1678.897,And the Uniform Act so limits?
1973.73-439,0,30771,james_j_hagan,,1678.897,1679.732,"Yes, yes."
1973.73-439,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1685.868,1688.819,Mr. Ruby.
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,1688.819,1692.643,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-439,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1822.08,1825.281,But may I ask Mr. Ruby.
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,1852.924,1854.78,"Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1973.73-439,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1855.322,1863.031,"You are not suggesting that in fact, the majority below who did even make that inquiry, did they?"
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,1863.031,1868.898,I would not say that the Court of Appeals believed that the question was settled.
1973.73-439,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1872.065,1890.827,"Well, my question was rather, whether they addressed the majority of the Court of Appeals even addressed themselves on the two questions, whether part of law would be determinative, I guess, they did say that, but about the other, that there are no clear controlling precedence in the decisions of the Supreme Court of Florida. Did they address themselves to that?"
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,1890.827,1895.552,"Well, I think there is a threshold question if I may answer your question in this fashion."
1973.73-439,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1921.771,1922.614,Yes.
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,1922.614,1928.006,"And I might also say, since I think you’ve really brought this point up."
1973.73-439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1982.593,1985.685,"Mr. Ruby, before you get to that."
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2000.641,2008.606,"Well, Your Honor, I cannot of course search into the minds of the other two judges, but I would assume from the fact that they didn’t --"
1973.73-439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2008.606,2013.097,"Well, you can’t find from their minds that they didn’t care to comment to apply that up."
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2013.097,2015.08,"Yes, that is true Your Honor."
1973.73-439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2015.08,2018.922,"So they did not make ruling on this though, did they?"
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2018.922,2023.313,"I would say that in effect, they made a ruling by deciding the case."
1973.73-439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2023.313,2031.493,"Well, but they did not say that we find that this is not the proper case to be certified, they never said that."
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2031.493,2044.012,"They did not say it in those words Mr. Justice Marshall, but I would say the clear inference from the fact that they did go ahead and decided the case on the merits that they determined that this was not an appropriate case for certification."
1973.73-439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2044.012,2045.626,"Well, they didn’t give any reasons."
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2045.626,2049.433,"They did not express any reasons, that is correct."
1973.73-439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2157.436,2161.861,What reason do you think could be imagined to that?
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2161.861,2162.942,"I am sorry, Your Honor."
1973.73-439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2162.942,2168.947,What reason can you imagine would be necessary to have the question certified?
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2168.947,2170.416,"Well, Your Honor I --"
1973.73-439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2170.416,2173.117,That you argue if you don’t certify any?
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2173.117,2173.881,"No, Your Honor."
1973.73-439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2173.881,2175.143,"You are not arguing that, are you?"
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2175.143,2176.647,"No, Your Honor."
1973.73-439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2193.364,2195.984,So you don’t do it only in diversity case?
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2195.984,2204.602,"You do it Your Honor in a case we submit which would be a proper case for abstention, since it is in effect a form of abstention."
1973.73-439,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2223.77,2227.5,"But it’s affirmed only of a qualified abstention, isn’t it?"
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2230.622,2248.825,"It retains jurisdiction Your Honor, but I think it nevertheless, is abstention in the sense that if the duty of the federal courts under the jurisdictional act is to decide all questions necessary to the adjudication of a judgment in a diversity case --"
1973.73-439,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2248.825,2263.845,I have difficulty seeing why there’s any incompatibility with the idea of asking the highest court of the State to declare what the law is so that the federal court can be aided in the exercise of its diversity jurisdiction?
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2263.845,2272.469,"I think there is no incompatibility Your Honor if it’s a proper case for a federal court to say to the litigants, we will not decide your issue."
1973.73-439,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2302.11,2316.958,"Well Mr. Ruby, I gather, had there been a decision of the Supreme Court of Florida, a white horse case with your own since Florida case -- this whole case depends on Florida law."
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2326.37,2329.011,There’s no question about that --
1973.73-439,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2329.011,2334.562,"Really, what’s involved here then is there is no such case, I gather?"
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2334.562,2335.899,There is no case directly Your Honor.
1973.73-439,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2335.899,2357.852,"Right or at least it is debatable whether there is anything that even points to the Florida and here is a way that you can get because there isn’t presently one, a decision of the Florida Supreme Court on what the Florida law is and that certainly is more definitive than anything either this Court or the Second Circuit or the District Court can provide?"
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2357.852,2364.92,"I think that’s true, Your Honor, but I think you do so -- and what you would give up I think is really what has to be considered [Voice Overlap]"
1973.73-439,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2364.92,2366.204,"Well, I don’t know what you’re giving up?"
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2366.204,2371.934,"What I think, what you give up, I think first of all and perhaps it’s more than just giving up something."
1973.73-439,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2385.393,2395.71,"May I suggest Mr. Ruby rather than -- rather then they're not doing their job, but doing it more effectively, if they’d take advantage of this opportunity."
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2395.71,2398.58,"Well, first of all, of course they are not deciding the case themselves."
1973.73-439,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2401.534,2405.915,But they have to decide it as it would be decided under Florida law.
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2405.915,2406.738,That’s correct.
1973.73-439,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2406.738,2419.952,And that being so -- and not presently being any decisions of the Florida Supreme Court which provide the answer and here you have an opportunity to get the decision applicable to your case?
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2419.952,2434.478,"That’s true Your Honor and I think this Court has considered this kind of situation in other cases if I might for example, perhaps in responding to you refer to what this Court said in the Propper against Clark case."
1973.73-439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2467.35,2482.059,"Mr. Ruby, what happens if the Supreme Court of Florida this morning renders an opinion in another case on all four but this one?"
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2482.059,2499.479,"Your Honor, I suppose an application could be made to the Court of Appeals in that unlikely event and I recognize that there are instances which occur where federal court may decide a case and then subsequently, a state court may decide it differently."
1973.73-439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2530.04,2551.032,"I am just talking about this case, you decide it on Florida law and this opinion comes down and a week later the Florida Court has identical case on all four and say in its opinion says, the Second Circuit was just completely wrong in this interpretation of Florida Law."
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2558.912,2561.089,"Well, certainly not Your Honor, certainly not."
1973.73-439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2561.554,2566.903,"And isn’t that what this is for, is to make sure that it doesn’t happen."
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2571.877,2604.208,"It could not happen if the question was certified, but Your Honor if the question was certified, not only would you have what I would refer to is ineffective denial of the rights under diversity jurisdiction, but you have what this Court I think has talked about time and time again the desire not to compel litigants to go down as I -- if I may borrow the phrase for Mr. Justice Douglas, “a long and expensive road to obtain an adjudication in the case that they have brought.”"
1973.73-439,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2605.743,2615.004,I have forgotten where we have invoked this Florida procedure in Clay and then Aldrich and Dresner.
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2618.611,2623.622,"Yes Mr. Justice Brennan, Clay was a classic abstention case."
1973.73-439,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2623.767,2626.878,So we have a federal constitutional question that we have to decide if we have them?
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2626.878,2630.013,"Precisely, precisely, and in Clay Your Honor."
1973.73-439,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2630.013,2631.892,"(Voice Overlap) in the other two, Aldrich and Dresner?"
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2631.892,2635.289,Neither Aldrich nor Dresner were even diversity cases.
1973.73-439,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2648.134,2649.313,"That was the divorce case, was it not?"
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2649.313,2650.798,"Yes, that is correct."
1973.73-439,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2712.327,2715.218,Does the Supreme Court of Florida hear oral argument or --
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2715.218,2717.034,"Yes, they do Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1973.73-439,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2718.551,2721.739,So the parties will then go down to Tallahassee and argue the case?
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2721.739,2723.54,"That’s correct, that’s correct."
1973.73-439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2875.322,2878.189,But you still agree that Florida law controls?
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2878.189,2880.692,There is no question about that Mr. Justice Marshall.
1973.73-439,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2924.408,2935.167,"The inquiry under Erie is actually for the court in sitting in the Southern District of New York is what conflicts of law would the New York Court of Appeals apply in this case, isn’t it?"
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,2942.514,2944.755,That’s correct Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1973.73-439,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3195.997,3201.87,Have you ever run across an SEC case that took less than three years?
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,3201.87,3207.699,"I suppose Your Honor only where there’s consent judgments, [Attempt to Laughter] but generally not."
1973.73-439,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3213.776,3218.872,"Mr. Hagan, are these respondents also thought as to the class action suit?"
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,3218.872,3219.222,I am sorry.
1973.73-439,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3220.561,3229.423,"I beg your pardon, Mr. Ruby, are the respondents in this case parties to the class action suit?"
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,3229.423,3235.356,"They are, Your Honor, and they were also of course parties to the action brought by the SEC."
1973.73-439,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3254.352,3256.203,Is that in the SEC injunction suit?
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,3256.203,3257.085,It was Your Honor.
1973.73-439,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3257.085,3259.706,What is the current status of the class action suit?
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,3259.706,3262.639,"I believe, they are still pending, Your Honor."
1973.73-439,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3620.149,3637.56,"Mr. Ruby, have the petitioners here, suggested to the Second Circuit at the oral argument of the case that it'd be certified, what is your guess as to the reaction of the panel?"
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,3637.56,3640.69,"Mr. Justice Blackmun, I can’t say what they would do."
1973.73-439,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3708.477,3723.428,Do you feel that the failure of the majority even to mention it in their written opinion is not necessarily indicative of the fact that they felt that the case had gone too far for certification?
1973.73-439,1,21431,donald_n_ruby,,3723.428,3724.668,"I certainly do not, Your Honor."
1973.73-439,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3743.588,3748.884,"Mr. Hagan, you have about five minutes left."
1973.73-439,2,30771,james_j_hagan,,3748.884,3756.909,"Your Honors, I believe that Mr. Ruby has overstated the position of the petitioners here and overstated the argument."
1973.73-439,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4028.223,4029.003,Thank you gentleman.
