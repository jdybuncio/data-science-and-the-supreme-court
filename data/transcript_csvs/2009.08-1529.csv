2009.08-1529,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,0.187,"Well, counsel, we're still here."
2009.08-1529,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,0.359,0.499,"I'm very glad, Your Honor."
2009.08-1529,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.499,4.621,"And we'll hear argument in Case 08-1529, Hui v. Castaneda."
2009.08-1529,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,5.276,14.884,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In section 233(a), Congress extended an absolute immunity to officers and employees of the Public Health Service."
2009.08-1529,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,65.016,68.658,What are the immunities set forth in the Westfall Act?
2009.08-1529,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,73.357,75.17,"Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
2009.08-1529,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,75.17,76.874,Including the Public Health Service.
2009.08-1529,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,76.874,78.356,"Yes, that's correct."
2009.08-1529,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,107.751,116.17,"Counsel, our job is to determine Congress's intent when it passed 233(a)."
2009.08-1529,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,167.959,180.645,"Well, certainly it's true that when Congress enacted the Westfall Act it could have broadly said, for instance, notwithstanding any other provision of law, no Federal employee shall assert a statutory immunity to constitutional claims."
2009.08-1529,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,193.934,197.573,Is there any other Act besides 233(a) that is similar--
2009.08-1529,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,197.573,197.744,--Yes.
2009.08-1529,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,197.744,199.273,--that gives separate immunity?
2009.08-1529,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,200.634,202.256,"There are a number of them, Your Honor."
2009.08-1529,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,226.058,235.211,"But it seems to me that, quite apart from the Westfall Act, there's a more -- more basic answer that you would make to Justice Sotomayor's question."
2009.08-1529,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,251.035,264.776,"--Well, I think that this Court has, you know, broadly speaking, in talking about judicially created immunities -- that immunity is for hard cases as well as easy cases."
2009.08-1529,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,270.286,270.442,Okay.
2009.08-1529,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,270.442,271.846,--something along those lines.
2009.08-1529,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,295.505,300.754,"If we limit it, then Congress would have to reenact a statute every time there was some new cause of action?"
2009.08-1529,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,300.754,301.902,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2009.08-1529,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,343.453,346.86,"Of course, I don't look to see what Congress intended."
2009.08-1529,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,358.684,360.447,"Yes, Your Honor, I agree."
2009.08-1529,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,366.191,366.363,That's what it says.
2009.08-1529,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,366.363,368.472,--that results from the same subject matter.
2009.08-1529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,422.013,422.559,Would you comment on--
2009.08-1529,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,422.559,430.366,"And that's a -- there's a ceiling, because the Tort Claims Act refers to the law of the place where the act or omission occurred."
2009.08-1529,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,432.617,436.192,"Well, Your Honor, California law is what's been discussed in the briefs."
2009.08-1529,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,450.358,456.512,"Which would put a lid on the damages, since this is a death case, of 250,000?"
2009.08-1529,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,456.512,458.466,"Not exactly, Your Honor."
2009.08-1529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,492.418,504.492,"--May I ask you to comment on the fact that, in the Carlson case, apparently the assistant surgeon general was, in fact, a defendant, and the government failed to make this defense?"
2009.08-1529,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,504.492,508.399,"Your Honor, I'm not certain why the defense wasn't raised in the case."
2009.08-1529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,508.399,509.975,"But if you're right, they should have."
2009.08-1529,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,509.975,515.723,"Well, not necessarily, because there may be factual issues that -- that we're not now aware of."
2009.08-1529,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,543.506,549.114,"Now, that's kind of interesting that apparently the government was not aware of the breadth of the position they're -- you're now taking."
2009.08-1529,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,549.114,551.672,"Well, I'm not sure that's necessarily the conclusion I would draw."
2009.08-1529,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,691.477,692.771,"Well, that would bar a later Bivens claim."
2009.08-1529,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,704.922,705.628,"Yes, I think that's right."
2009.08-1529,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,708.674,709.251,Yes.
2009.08-1529,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,709.251,709.968,--proceedings
2009.08-1529,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,734.614,735.365,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1529,1,38316,pratik_shah,,749.155,762.807,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: By its plain terms, section 233(a) precludes any civil action against officers and employees of the Public Health Service arising out of performance of their medical duties."
2009.08-1529,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,875.37,906.765,"Mr. Shah, is that -- is that the same -- in all the statutes that Carlson cites on page 20, when they say that Congress follows the practice of explicitly stating what it means to make the FTCA an exclusive remedy, there's this -- the Gonzalez Act and there's 233(a), and then there is the swine flu."
2009.08-1529,1,38316,pratik_shah,,922.383,926.302,"--Yes, Your Honor, in terms of that latter phrasing"
2009.08-1529,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1034.677,1041.739,Can you tell me how many PHS personnel work in settings outside custodial settings?
2009.08-1529,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1041.739,1043.221,Outside which?
2009.08-1529,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1043.221,1044.313,Custodial settings.
2009.08-1529,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1044.313,1049.234,"Well, Your Honor, there's 6,000 -- approximately 6,000 commissioned officers."
2009.08-1529,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1075.27,1075.692,I'm sorry.
2009.08-1529,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1076.441,1077.845,--For the Indian Health Service.
2009.08-1529,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1077.845,1093.432,"--And is there a reason Congress would want to immunize PHS personnel against Bivens claims in a custodial setting, but not immunize Bureau of Prison personnel?"
2009.08-1529,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1093.432,1099.007,"Well, Your Honor, I think they would want to immunize Bureau of Prison personnel."
2009.08-1529,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1107.567,1116.765,"But not every doctor -- if they come under the FTCA, they -- their -- constitutional claims are not immunized against them--"
2009.08-1529,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1116.765,1118.142,"--Oh, I see."
2009.08-1529,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1118.142,1120.638,--unless they are PHS personnel.
2009.08-1529,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1120.638,1121.094,Right.
2009.08-1529,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1124.402,1124.527,Right.
2009.08-1529,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1124.527,1130.664,"--as opposed to PHS personnel, then you're right, they would fall under the Westfall Act, and there would be the carve-out for constitutional claim."
2009.08-1529,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1168.022,1173.146,Are they paid less than other -- than other Federal employees who perform similar functions?
2009.08-1529,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1189.141,1196.683,"--Well -- well, Your Honor, in terms of the -- in terms of the ordinary claims, the common law claims, of course, that would be covered by the Westfall Act."
2009.08-1529,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1234.746,1240.9,"Of course, we're -- you know, we're talking here as though Congress is a perpetual unchanging institution."
2009.08-1529,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1272.041,1273.652,"--Justice Scalia, I completely agree."
2009.08-1529,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1329.079,1334.469,"Just as a matter of curiosity, do all of these immunity provisions come out of the same committee?"
2009.08-1529,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1347.232,1347.606,Right.
2009.08-1529,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1369.72,1385.529,"If section 2679(b)(2), instead of saying paragraph (1) does not extend nor apply, had said the remedy against the United States provided by sections 1346(b), et cetera, and repeated that language from (b)(1), and then said:"
2009.08-1529,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1395.492,1420.168,"Your Honor, it may be a closer case but I don't think that the result would be different, and here's why: If you look at the text of 233(a) -- and this is on the very last page of the -- of the government's brief -- it does refer to the FTCA in terms of the remedy that a -- that a plaintiff should seek, but it's not -- it does not look to the FTCA to make that remedy exclusive."
2009.08-1529,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1487.875,1514.645,"Could the -- could the plaintiff contest the certification that this was within the scope -- and say it was so egregious, it was outside the scope, and, therefore, it doesn't come -- come within 233(a) or anything else, and so we have a straight claim against the defendants?"
2009.08-1529,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1514.645,1522.608,"--To my knowledge, plaintiffs have not made that argument in this case, that they were not acting within the scope."
2009.08-1529,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1522.608,1527.779,"Or they would lose their argument against the -- I mean, they would lose their claim against the government if they were taking that position?"
2009.08-1529,1,38316,pratik_shah,,1527.779,1531.121,"They would lose their FTCA claim against the government, then, Your Honor."
2009.08-1529,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1533.633,1534.604,"Thank you, Mr. Shah."
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,1537.165,1556.217,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Section 233 does not bar Bivens claims here for two principal reasons."
2009.08-1529,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1567.261,1579.553,"Now, that's quite a surprising statement for you to make, when the very first statute that Carlson mentions is 233(a)."
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,1579.553,1585.628,"Your Honor, I believe you're referring to the dicta in Carlson on page 20."
2009.08-1529,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1585.628,1586.221,Yes.
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,1586.221,1589.47,And it's interesting to note how that issue was raised.
2009.08-1529,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1623.473,1625.002,"Well, it certainly doesn't get that out of the way."
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,1662.597,1670.266,"--Justice Ginsburg, if I may reply, I believe that that's not the proper way to read that dicta for two reasons."
2009.08-1529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1799.551,1805.973,You claim the Westfall Act implicitly repealed 233(a)?
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,1807.627,1812.034,"--No, Your Honor, there's no implicit repeal here, although we can--"
2009.08-1529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1812.034,1819.092,"Well, that provision says that it's exclusive, and you're saying the Westfall Act says it's not exclusive."
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,1819.092,1827.62,"--Your Honor, there's no implicit repeal here for the -- because 233(a) still has independent work to do."
2009.08-1529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1839.006,1841.272,But it isn't just made superfluous.
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,1849.344,1850.093,The provision--
2009.08-1529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1850.093,1852.873,"Implicitly, because it's not specifically referred to."
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,1852.873,1862.029,"--Well, there were no -- there would be no repeal because there are a number of other provisions within section 233 itself that it's relevant to."
2009.08-1529,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1863.995,1864.837,That's just (a).
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,1865.84,1868.526,"--Yes, but these other provisions refer back to (a)."
2009.08-1529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1870.492,1873.147,I don't understand your Westfall Act argument.
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,1917.941,1923.112,"--Well, Your Honor, I think that -- and I don't mean to repeat myself, but to answer that question--"
2009.08-1529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1923.112,1925.003,"Well, is there an answer to the question?"
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,1926.781,1927.202,--I believe there is.
2009.08-1529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1936.354,1938.464,That's your Carlson argument.
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,1939.669,1939.934,--Okay.
2009.08-1529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1939.934,1941.197,I understand that one.
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,1945.51,1951.352,There's -- there's two relationships between the Westfall Act and the Public Health Service Act.
2009.08-1529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1956.94,1957.833,"Yes, right."
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,1993.771,1996.252,"--Justice Breyer, if I could answer."
2009.08-1529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2012.653,2013.589,You're talking about the Westfall Act.
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2013.932,2014.259,--Yes.
2009.08-1529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2014.524,2017.758,"I just say, what does the Act have to do with this older Act?"
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2017.758,2025.3,"--Well, it isn't -- the older Act refers to the Federal Tort Claims Act as providing the exclusive remedy in this case."
2009.08-1529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2040.857,2044.668,"Westfall -- Westfall Act is not -- is not the FTCA, is it?"
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2044.668,2045.089,--It is.
2009.08-1529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2045.728,2054.07,"Oh, it is the -- in other words, you think -- I thought the FTCA Act is an Act that gives you action against the government."
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2054.07,2057.521,The Westfall Act is just simply an amendment to the FTCA.
2009.08-1529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2057.521,2075.981,"So it says: This Act is the exclusive remedy -- the FTCA is an exclusive remedy for all employees, but this provision which gives us an exception does not give you the exception, does not make it exclusive for Bivens actions."
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2081.292,2081.589,Okay.
2009.08-1529,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2108.714,2127.47,"What -- what says 233(a), where does that say anything other than -- I mean, it reads like it's immunity from any civil action."
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2158.632,2163.599,"--The later Act amended the former Act; that's correct, Your Honor."
2009.08-1529,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2163.599,2165.971,It amended 233(a)--
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2165.971,2166.894,"It -- it did, in--"
2009.08-1529,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2166.894,2167.705,--without mentioning it?
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2167.705,2171.359,"--effect, because it's incorporated by reference through the Act."
2009.08-1529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2250.577,2272.053,"Well, you say any -- any other civil action that -- that did not exist prior to the enactment of 233(a) would not be covered by its exclusion because Congress couldn't have known that this civil action existed, so that it only covered those causes of action that existed at the time the statute was passed?"
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2272.053,2275.036,"--Only -- only as to constitutional causes of action, Justice Scalia."
2009.08-1529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2275.707,2276.112,Why?
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2288.516,2298.057,"--Well, I think that the issue here is, is that when Congress is going to -- was going to abrogate a constitutional right or recognize a constitutional remedy, it has to do so in a clear way."
2009.08-1529,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2344.271,2346.131,And Carlson is your best authority for that?
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2350.128,2354.925,"Well, Carlson sets forth the clear statement rule here, the explicit declaration test, and then--"
2009.08-1529,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2354.925,2359.144,"In a different context, but that -- but Carlson is still your best authority for that proposition?"
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2359.144,2372.651,--I think Webster v. Doe is another example of a case where this Court would not abrogate a constitutional right based on fairly clear language that said the director of the CIA had discretion to terminate anybody.
2009.08-1529,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2391.459,2397.531,Do think your clear statement argument would apply even if Carlson had been decided before the statute was enacted?
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2397.531,2399.235,"--Well, that's true, Your Honor."
2009.08-1529,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2399.235,2399.438,Okay.
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2399.438,2402.421,"And so, it's not--"
2009.08-1529,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2402.421,2410.075,"Well, I would have thought it wouldn't apply as strongly because they would have been saying any action at a time when they knew that particular action existed."
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2410.075,2417.367,"--It wouldn't -- it wouldn't apply as -- as strongly, but I -- I don't think that the sequence of enactment is dispositive, I think is the point."
2009.08-1529,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2417.367,2425.552,"Oh, so you're saying -- your response to Justice Stevens follows because you say they -- unless they say a Bivens action is excluded, it's not."
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2425.552,2432.174,"Or constitutional, but it has to be clear that Congress addressed the issue and considered abrogating a constitutional claim."
2009.08-1529,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2436.14,2438.667,So the Gonzalez Act is after Bivens.
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2438.667,2439.026,--It is.
2009.08-1529,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2439.026,2454.192,"But you say the same thing -- even though Bivens was before Congress -- and even though the Gonzalez Act doesn't have an exception for Bivens claims, you read one into the Gonzalez Act?"
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2454.192,2474.415,"Your Honor, I -- I would say the Gonzalez Act also wouldn't bar Bivens claims, because it's just the sequence of enactment -- but I mean, if it was -- if it had shown in some way that Congress considered the constitutional issue -- and the legislative history of the Gonzalez Act shows that it did not at that time -- if there was some indication in the language of the statute or anywhere that a constitutional--"
2009.08-1529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2474.415,2478.509,"Legislative history will do, so -- so we don't require this clear statement, right?"
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2478.509,2480.474,"--I'm sorry, Justice Scalia, I didn't hear your question."
2009.08-1529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2480.474,2487.958,"Legislative history will do the job, so you're abandoning the -- the proposition that there has to be a clear statement by Congress."
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2487.958,2490.021,"No, Your Honor."
2009.08-1529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2492.392,2493.004,That's what you said.
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2501.952,2508.668,"It -- it -- I think that in the statute, in the -- in the text of the statute itself, there has to be some evidence from Congress that it considered it."
2009.08-1529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2520.741,2521.895,Now you're confusing me again.
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2536.904,2538.043,--That -- that's correct.
2009.08-1529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2538.62,2540.838,"Then it doesn't matter what Congress was thinking, does it?"
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2545.959,2553.781,"Well, obviously if -- if the statute unambiguously bars constitutional claims by mentioning the Constitution, I don't think you look at the legislative history."
2009.08-1529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2554.405,2567.105,"--But, ah, but if it doesn't unambiguously bar it, you can then look to legislative history and say although it didn't bar it, the legislative history shows that it was intended to bar it."
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2567.105,2570.572,I think that if -- if -- if any statute is ambiguous--
2009.08-1529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2570.572,2571.43,You are abandoning Carlson then.
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2571.43,2571.618,--you can look to the legislative history.
2009.08-1529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2571.618,2573.458,I thought Carlson was your big case.
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2573.458,2577.162,"Well, I believe it is, Your Honor."
2009.08-1529,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2578.317,2582.049,You just abandoned its proposition that there has to be a statement in the statute.
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2582.049,2585.534,"--Your Honor, all I'm saying is that--"
2009.08-1529,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2585.534,2587.079,You're not abandoning it; you're taking it further.
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2594.981,2614.473,"--All I'm saying is, I believe, is that -- is that in this case, if you look at the actual statute that's at issue, no matter what test you use, whether you -- whether you -- whether you like legislative history, whether you -- whether you only look at plain text, or whether you want to look at what's the alternative remedy, is it equivalent to a constitutional claim, this statute doesn't pass muster."
2009.08-1529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2621.439,2646.883,"I think his point is it doesn't matter whether they did or didn't consider it; the question is the statute was decided by Justice Brennan as an example of a statute where Congress did explicitly say whatever it thought that this particular remedy was a remedy exclusive, an exclusive remedy, and that satisfied the second requirement of Carlson."
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2654.361,2665.811,"Your Honor, again, I don't want to repeat my answer to that question, but just to emphasize that -- that the Court in Carlson did not specifically say that Bivens claims were barred by reference to 233."
2009.08-1529,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2759.54,2774.814,"The Westfall Act could be read to say we're now covering all these people who did not have, who were not sheltered by immunity before, but this amendment saves out Bivens claims."
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2784.995,2801.195,"Your Honor, I -- I -- I don't think that's a reasonable reading, because at the time of the Westfall Act's passage in 1988, no court had held that Bivens claims were barred by section 233 or any other pre-Act immunity statute like the Gonzalez Act or and the VA Act."
2009.08-1529,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2878.865,2881.364,May I just be sure I understand your argument?
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2901.981,2904.963,"No, Your Honor, I don't think I got to finish that answer before."
2009.08-1529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2993.366,2995.85,Can't they sue the Federal Government and collect money?
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,2995.85,2998.459,"--Not for the -- not for a Bivens claim, and--"
2009.08-1529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2998.459,3005.08,"No, I mean, can't your clients -- anybody who has a case like yours -- can't they sue the Federal Government and collect damages for their claim?"
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,3005.08,3006.016,--It depends.
2009.08-1529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3007.22,3008.156,Did your clients sue the Federal Government?
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,3008.156,3009.046,Yes.
2009.08-1529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3009.046,3009.767,Did they collect money?
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,3009.767,3011.358,"No, they haven't collected money yet."
2009.08-1529,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3011.358,3011.608,No.
2009.08-1529,2,18751,conal_doyle,,3012.45,3052.951,"On one claim, but one of our claims, the most important claim here, is -- is -- will be extinguished under California law, which highlights why, you know, Congress would not want to -- why this Court in Carlson, first of all, said that the FTCA is not an effective substitute for Bivens, and Congress ratified that decision 8 years later in the Westfall Act by finding the same thing, that -- that Bivens claims and the FTCA are complementary and parallel causes of action, because for the very reason that, under California law in this case, a survival claim for pre-death pain and suffering for -- for Mr. Castaneda, who endured an incredible ordeal for 2 years at the hands of a government medical provider, that that -- that claim would be barred."
2009.08-1529,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3070.319,3071.991,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-1529,3,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3075.224,3079.97,"Just two quick points, if I may."
2009.08-1529,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3172.755,3173.649,"Thank you, counsel."
