1987.86-656,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,15.369,"We will hear arguments, first this afternoon, in Number 86-656, Ronald Reagan versus James Abourezk, and you may proceed whenever you are ready, Mr. Wallace."
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,15.369,46.607,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, these cases, which were consolidated in the District Court, present questions concerning the denial, on foreign policy grounds, of non-immigrant visas to aliens invited by persons or groups in this country to participate in public or academic discussions."
1987.86-656,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,182.74,184.988,"May I ask, Mr. Wallace?"
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,195.782,202.03,"--Well, I would not characterize my burden that way, Mr. Justice."
1987.86-656,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,205.2,207.01,"Well, what does it mean, do you think?"
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,207.01,213.477,"--Well, there are two ways of looking at it, that support our position."
1987.86-656,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,273.016,279.825,"Well, in this case, as I understand it, there is no evidence, whatever, that they had any intention of engaging in any activities."
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,284.481,286.525,Yes.
1987.86-656,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,304.424,313.89,"And by reason of their association of one or the other or more of those organizations, that they were said to be excludable under the Statute?"
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,313.89,347.377,"--It was by reason of that, coupled with the State Department's determination that these organizations are instruments of a particular foreign government; and that it would be disadvantageous to our conduct of foreign policy, to admit someone for the purpose of carrying on that organization's program, in the activities in which they want to engage in the United States."
1987.86-656,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,359.324,366.275,"Mr. Wallace, it was charged that they were going to engage in those activities in this country?"
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,366.275,369.241,That is correct.
1987.86-656,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,380.018,380.909,Like what?
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,384.283,387.282,"That is correct, and to participate in discussions."
1987.86-656,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,387.282,390.717,Freedom of speech?
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,390.717,397.996,"Undoubtedly, when engaged in by someone properly present."
1987.86-656,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,397.996,400.526,There is nothing other than speech involved?
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,400.526,412.022,"Our position is there need not be any misconduct in the activities, themselves, for Subsection 27 to apply."
1987.86-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,431.873,440.901,Is it critical to your position that the activities be activities that could be attributed to the organizations with which the three people were associated?
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,440.901,443.353,"--Well, it--"
1987.86-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,443.353,445.539,You seem to suggest that on an earlier statement?
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,445.539,448.772,--It is a part of our position.
1987.86-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,448.772,451.38,"Well, then, it is not a case of mere presence or mere entry?"
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,456.612,459.315,That is correct.
1987.86-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,459.315,464.469,"That is a different theory than the dissent below, I think."
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,464.469,477.418,"Well, the dissent authorizes in its theory, a broader use of Subsection 27, then we are actually making of it."
1987.86-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,477.418,479.792,So you are not espousing the theory of the dissent?
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,479.792,491.475,"Well, I am not disassociating myself from it, but we do not have to go as far as some of the implications of the dissenting opinion."
1987.86-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,491.475,496.034,"Well, you are not arguing that mere presence and mere entry is an activity, within the meaning of Subsection 27?"
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,499.517,504.921,"Well, that is one of our alternative contentions, yes."
1987.86-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,560.476,566.319,"Is there a finding here, that it was the activities in which they intended to engage that explain the reason for their exclusion?"
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,566.319,570.895,--There were affidavits submitted--
1987.86-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,570.895,572.3,"No, I said, was there a finding to that effect?"
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,572.3,595.041,"--The finding by the District Judge, is that we had facially valid foreign policy reasons for denying their entry, which under this Court's decision, in Kleindienst v. Mandel, he has no right to look behind and make a finding with respect to--"
1987.86-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,595.041,603.46,"I still ask is the facially valid reason the fact that their mere presence or mere entry would be detrimental, or is it, that the activities in which they would engage would be detrimental?"
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,605.287,615.267,"--I cannot say that the District Judge's finding is articulated so as to draw that distinction, as I recall it."
1987.86-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,620.5,621.5,It would make a difference in this.
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,621.5,644.021,"--I am looking at Page 80-A of the Joint Appendix, where the District Court merely says, it has concluded that,"
1987.86-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,768.158,775.094,"Mr. Wallace, the thing that troubles me is that you are telling me what the affidavits say, but the finding just relates to the personal status of the three people."
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,790.57,796.943,--But the finding was made based on affidavits that explain the reasons--
1987.86-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,796.943,803.957,"Well, let me just ask you, is it necessary for us to support your position to go behind the finding, and rely on what is in the affidavits, instead of what the finding says?"
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,803.957,807.096,--I think that--
1987.86-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,807.096,807.97,"That is your whole argument, is it not?"
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,807.97,819.372,"--I would say that it is necessary to read the finding in light of the affidavits on which the finding is based, because the finding is very succinctly stated."
1987.86-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,849.501,850.719,We have the affidavits.
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,850.719,871.039,"They are in the Joint Appendix, and the classified ones that he refers to, are in the Appendix to the Petition for Certiorari because they were declassified and reprinted there."
1987.86-656,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,871.039,879.692,"Mr. Wallace, when you speak about a finding in this case, actually the District Court granted summary judgment for the Government, did it not?"
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,879.692,880.504,That is correct.
1987.86-656,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,880.504,885.471,"So you are not talking about finding, in the ordinary sense, of a finding of fact at a bench trial?"
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,885.471,887.642,That is correct.
1987.86-656,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,906.383,923.127,"Mr. Wallace, may I ask whether you agree with the dissent in the Court below, that Kleindienst v. Mandel, necessarily upheld the constitutionality of the exclusion of communists based on their political beliefs?"
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,931.265,936.901,I do not read Kleindienst v. Mandel as necessarily holding that.
1987.86-656,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1061.805,1073.128,But do you need our Courts for that purpose... to enforce public policy in foreign governments and to prevent foreign governments?
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1073.128,1080.188,We did not need the Court and we were not the one who invoked the Court's jurisdiction.
1987.86-656,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1085.92,1105.257,"You want us to say that the Court can approve the denial of an entry of somebody who is going to make a speech, because the State Department does not like the country or the person."
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1105.257,1115.689,"Because the State Department thinks that it is detrimental, has concluded that it would be detrimental to our foreign policy to extend our hospitality to that person, with a non-immigrant visa."
1987.86-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1553.575,1557.637,"Mr. Wallace, about the Nazi who was... Skorzeny, I think that you referred to?"
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1557.637,1558.182,--Certainly.
1987.86-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1558.182,1566.648,"That was back in 1959, and is it not true that a few years later, they amended the statute to provide a new section that covered the people of that status?"
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1566.648,1583.189,"People who were associated with the Nazi Regime, during the thirties and World War II, but it does not cover people who engaged in brutality while in office, in other countries at other times, and there are many such people."
1987.86-656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1583.189,1592.217,"No, but I was just wondering, if you are correctly interpreting 27, and you gave us an example, this Skorzeny, why did they need to enact 33?"
1987.86-656,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1595.136,1598.057,Perhaps it was done for emphasis.
1987.86-656,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1770.223,1772.316,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
1987.86-656,1,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,1774.001,1806.066,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, I think that it is obvious from the Government's argument that the issues raised in this case are critical ones in a constitutional democracy... whether and to what extent, the government may bar foreign speakers from addressing American audiences in the United States, on issues of obvious and substantial public concern?"
1987.86-656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1948.79,1953.554,The government has abandoned its prior position in favor of what?
1987.86-656,1,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,1955.757,1967.673,"The way that I understand its argument, now, Your Honor, and I must say that there were seeds of this in its brief, is that its previous argument was that it did not need to allege any activities, and indeed, it has not alleged any activities."
1987.86-656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2043.268,2059.137,"Well, I understood the government's position, particularly with respect to someone like Mr. Borge, as being just a highly placed official of the Sandinista government and anything that he did in this country would be prejudicial, just his presence here, would be."
1987.86-656,1,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2059.137,2062.744,"--Just his presence here would be, you are right, that is exactly their position, Your Honor."
1987.86-656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2064.103,2065.119,What is your answer to that?
1987.86-656,1,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2065.119,2066.149,--That what he does is irrelevant.
1987.86-656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2094.638,2103.056,Then you are saying that there cannot be someone of sufficiently bad omen of our foreign policy that anything that he does in this country would be prejudicial?
1987.86-656,1,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2103.056,2106.243,I am saying that that is not a (27) exclusion.
1987.86-656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2152.661,2158.394,"Of course, I do not understand the government's version of why it excluded Borge."
1987.86-656,1,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2165.671,2173.027,"--I think that the government, in the case of Borge, the government's position is, that his mere presence in the United States will create problems for us."
1987.86-656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2505.815,2527.071,"Would you say, Mr. Shapiro, suppose that the claim is that Section 27 permits the exclusion of an alien, where his mere presence, for the purpose of making speeches, would endanger our foreign policy, would you think that Section 27 would permit that?"
1987.86-656,1,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2527.071,2531.602,"I do not think that Section 27 permits... well, several things."
1987.86-656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2534.709,2535.646,"Well, that is not what I asked you."
1987.86-656,1,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2535.646,2545.518,"--I do not think that it is what 27 now says, and to the degree that it is what 27 says, then I think that you would be smack up against a significant First Amendment problem."
1987.86-656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2549.812,2553.202,"Well, let us just stick to the statute."
1987.86-656,1,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2573.662,2585.549,"I think that that is outside of the reach of the statute, because I do not think that the statute, with its reference to prejudicial activity was discussing speech making in the United States, as Justice Marshall suggested."
1987.86-656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2595.169,2606.805,"Well, they were pretty close to it, in this argument today, saying that they may consider... what they are here for, they are here for making speeches."
1987.86-656,1,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2606.805,2640.261,"--Well, to the extent, as I said, to the extent that the government's position now is that these people can be excluded because they are here to make speeches, and here to make speeches which the government openly admits, by the way, that it is not a viewpoint neutral judgment... if your question, Justice White, is meant to suggest that the government does not care what these people are saying, that it is the act of making a speech, while present in the United States, circa (a)(27), first of all, the record, itself, does not support that."
1987.86-656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2681.977,2703.422,"Well, suppose that we disagree with you on your construction of (27), that the government may deny a visa to a person whose presence here, for the purpose of making speeches, would really cause the government trouble?"
1987.86-656,1,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2709.045,2712.683,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, I think that--"
1987.86-656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2712.683,2716.385,On what basis did the District Court decide the case?
1987.86-656,1,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2716.385,2720.243,"--Well, that is a hard question for us to answer, as I will explain in a moment."
1987.86-656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2720.243,2721.852,"Well, it is hard for us too, and I want you to--"
1987.86-656,1,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2721.852,2727.522,"Well, let me give you the background on what happened, having been there since the case--"
1987.86-656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2727.522,2731.318,"--Well, what does his opinion say?"
1987.86-656,1,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2731.318,2743.235,"--What Judge Green's opinion says, is that the government may not deny visas for content-based reasons."
1987.86-656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2743.235,2743.453,Right.
1987.86-656,1,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2743.453,2753.135,"And having read the public affidavits, submitted by Undersecretary Eagleburger, which in conclusory fashion, simply recited the language of the statute."
1987.86-656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2789.434,2794.962,"Well, do you read his opinion as accepting the government's position that mere presence is enough?"
1987.86-656,1,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2794.962,2798.931,--I think that he accepted the government's position that mere presence is enough.
1987.86-656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2804.225,2804.615,"Oh, I know that."
1987.86-656,1,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2804.615,2808.896,"And one of the things, the Court of Appeals remanded on two grounds."
1987.86-656,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2813.69,2814.097,That is right.
1987.86-656,1,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,2814.097,2816.705,"--their position was, that entry or presence is not enough."
1987.86-656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3007.738,3014.923,"Well, in terms of the last argument of yours, Mr. Shapiro, is it possible that Pasti's case could come out one way and Borge's case come out another?"
1987.86-656,1,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,3014.923,3017.157,I think that there are two answers to that.
1987.86-656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3454.183,3457.259,"Well, the government would not be expected to raise it in its petition, would it?"
1987.86-656,1,42008,steven_r_shapiro,,3460.711,3485.733,"--No, what the government did, Your Honor, what the government did, in their petition, in fact, was to drop a footnote on the final page of their brief on the merits, saying that even though, we have not raised the First Amendment question in our questions presented, it was reached by dissent below, it was alleged by the Plaintiffs, and therefore, this Court has jurisdiction, and should reach out to decide it."
1987.86-656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3581.897,3584.412,"Thank you, Mr. Shapiro."
1987.86-656,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3586.896,3614.414,"The Court of Appeals referred to the legislative history of Subsection 27 as interchangeably using references to entry and activities as the basis of concern, and that is, entirely consistent with Judge Harold Green's saying that it is a distinction without a difference in this context."
1987.86-656,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3717.483,3720.2,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace, the case is submitted."
