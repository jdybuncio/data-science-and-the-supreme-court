1989.88-931,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.277,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 89-931, Lawrence Crandon v. United States, and Number 88-938, Boeing Company v. United States."
1989.88-931,0,38093,phillip__allen_lacovara,,13.324,16.963,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-931,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,198.076,203.731,Could there have been an attempt indictment in that situation?
1989.88-931,0,38093,phillip__allen_lacovara,,203.731,203.839,I think not.
1989.88-931,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,209.915,211.119,I'm just asking hypothetically.
1989.88-931,0,38093,phillip__allen_lacovara,,217.773,222.974,"I think probably not, although the general law of attempt does apply to many criminal cases."
1989.88-931,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,248.243,273.718,"What if the employer, before the government service began, paid a sum to the employee on the understanding and expectation that the employee might provide some favors to that employer later, during government service."
1989.88-931,0,38093,phillip__allen_lacovara,,273.718,277.575,"That is an issue with which Congress has dealt, Justice O'Connor, in other sections."
1989.88-931,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,279.09,281.261,Would it violate this section as well?
1989.88-931,0,38093,phillip__allen_lacovara,,281.261,282.277,"--No, no."
1989.88-931,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,283.417,285.229,Simply because of the timing.
1989.88-931,0,38093,phillip__allen_lacovara,,285.229,285.557,That's right.
1989.88-931,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,288.399,295.24,"Well, you certainly can read the language of the statute as not turning on the timing of the payment."
1989.88-931,0,38093,phillip__allen_lacovara,,307.142,323.228,"--Well, our opening submission, Justice O'Connor, is that that is not a correct reading of the language and that under the rule of lenity, if your suggestion is that one could read the statute this way, ambiguities in criminal statutes are to be resolved against the government."
1989.88-931,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,411.882,412.038,Mr. Lacovara--
1989.88-931,0,38093,phillip__allen_lacovara,,424.518,425.018,That is correct.
1989.88-931,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,545.594,559.12,"So it leaves a rather large hole in the statutory scheme, doesn't it, if an employer, a month before someone becomes a government employee, can pay them a large amount of money to tide them over the time that they will be a government employee."
1989.88-931,0,38093,phillip__allen_lacovara,,559.12,565.819,"--If we were sitting down today to write legislations, Chief Justice, we might want to draw the line differently."
1989.88-931,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,706.827,716.056,"Do you make the... Mr. Lacovara, do you make the same analysis of the first section... of the first paragraph of the statute as of the second?"
1989.88-931,0,38093,phillip__allen_lacovara,,722.819,728.222,"--I think not, Justice Kennedy, because it... I think it is common ground that these are supposed to be correlative offenses."
1989.88-931,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,732.768,743.952,"Well, but the second paragraph is in part controlled by the first, because they talk about such officer or employee, and the first paragraph begins whoever receives."
1989.88-931,0,38093,phillip__allen_lacovara,,743.952,747.247,"--Yes, for services as a government officer or employee."
1989.88-931,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,775.172,784.621,"Mr. Lacovara, the first paragraph doesn't say... it doesn't say receives as an officer or employee."
1989.88-931,0,38093,phillip__allen_lacovara,,803.474,808.799,"Justice Scalia, as I mentioned before, there might be an ambiguity--"
1989.88-931,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,808.799,810.049,In the first paragraph.
1989.88-931,0,38093,phillip__allen_lacovara,,810.049,811.064,--In the first paragraph.
1989.88-931,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,812.001,813.579,"Now, I think you are stronger on the second paragraph."
1989.88-931,0,38093,phillip__allen_lacovara,,813.579,822.497,"--If one read this paragraph, if that was all that existed in Title 18, there would be an ambiguity, which under the rule of lenity would have to be resolved in our favor in any event."
1989.88-931,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,876.163,890.359,"Mr. Lacovara, do you mind my asking whether you concede that there is a civil cause of action by the government for whatever it is the statute... the criminal statute, says?"
1989.88-931,0,38093,phillip__allen_lacovara,,898.373,905.604,--We have never doubted that there is a common law cause of action to recover secret profits obtained in breach of trust.
1989.88-931,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,924.846,926.298,"Well, what is your answer?"
1989.88-931,0,38093,phillip__allen_lacovara,,935.248,948.384,"--That is... the government would make out its prima facia burden if there had been an illegal receipt of... in violation of Section 209, but it is at least a defense that that relationship was disclosed."
1989.88-931,1,18090,benjamin_s_sharp,,955.959,964.377,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-931,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1086.937,1090.17,"Mr. Sharp, what is it... what is your understanding of the intent requirement in the statute?"
1989.88-931,1,18090,benjamin_s_sharp,,1092.872,1102.463,--I think the government had to prove expressly that the parties intended to make payments that were compensation for federal services.
1989.88-931,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1102.463,1106.694,What other motive could there possibly have been for the payments by Boeing?
1989.88-931,1,18090,benjamin_s_sharp,,1106.694,1116.441,"I think a motive to fairly sever relations with long-standing employees, to make sure that--"
1989.88-931,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1116.441,1119.237,But nobody got this except people who were going into government service.
1989.88-931,1,18090,benjamin_s_sharp,,1119.237,1127.373,--No one got it except individuals who were compelled to terminate their employment with the company to enter into public service.
1989.88-931,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1173.495,1181.321,What exactly do you understand was the government's theory at trial in its cause of action against Boeing?
1989.88-931,1,18090,benjamin_s_sharp,,1181.321,1187.521,That has long perplexed us.
1989.88-931,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1199.861,1203.124,Is that how it went to the trier of fact?
1989.88-931,1,18090,benjamin_s_sharp,,1203.124,1204.124,It is.
1989.88-931,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1204.124,1212.432,A common law tort of inducing breech of a fiduciary relationship?
1989.88-931,1,18090,benjamin_s_sharp,,1212.432,1220.477,"Well, the exact language in paragraph 16 of the complaint says the common law tort of inducing a conflict of interest situation."
1989.88-931,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1220.477,1222.101,Uh huh.
1989.88-931,1,18090,benjamin_s_sharp,,1222.101,1233.862,"Conversely, the claims against the individuals was sounded in quasi contract for their supposed breech of an undivided... duty of undivided loyalty."
1989.88-931,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1233.862,1244.64,"Under that theory would the government be entitled to recover the amounts of the payments from the employees and also from Boeing, a double recovery sort of?"
1989.88-931,1,18090,benjamin_s_sharp,,1244.64,1252.199,"I do not think they would, and the district court and court of appeals both held they could not based on the precedent of Continental Management case."
1989.88-931,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1267.317,1270.019,How did the statute ever get into the case?
1989.88-931,1,18090,benjamin_s_sharp,,1270.019,1277.486,The supposed tort duty that the government claimed was--
1989.88-931,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1277.486,1278.048,Was measured?
1989.88-931,1,18090,benjamin_s_sharp,,1278.048,1279.407,--derived from this criminal statute.
1989.88-931,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1285.654,1289.826,"Mr. Sharp, can I return to Justice Stevens' question?"
1989.88-931,1,18090,benjamin_s_sharp,,1310.145,1324.264,"I, I... we don't believe that the intent requires a quid pro quo or a specific intent to influence government service, but at least must be an intent to compensate for government services."
1989.88-931,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1327.841,1329.121,"Well, what does to compensate mean?"
1989.88-931,1,18090,benjamin_s_sharp,,1351.424,1352.048,--I don't think so.
1989.88-931,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1352.048,1352.876,Why not?
1989.88-931,1,18090,benjamin_s_sharp,,1352.876,1363.076,It is paid under circumstances... among other reasons it is paid under circumstances that could not conceivably create a conflict of interest or a potential for divided loyalties--
1989.88-931,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1363.076,1364.497,There is nothing in here about that.
1989.88-931,1,18090,benjamin_s_sharp,,1403.511,1412.477,"--In the facts of this case it would fall far short of a quid pro quo in any event, in that these payments were fixed, final and irrevocable."
1989.88-931,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1412.477,1412.774,"Oh, I know that."
1989.88-931,1,18090,benjamin_s_sharp,,1428.628,1450.461,"The only suggestion I can make is to read some meaning into the phrase that would cover a conflict of interest, and if you construe that phrase in a fashion where there could be no conceivable conflict of interest, it seems to me that it is an overbroad reading of it, that doesn't serve the purpose of preventing the evil which Congress sought to prevent."
1989.88-931,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1450.461,1453.368,"Well, every prophylactic rule is over broad, I mean, and--"
1989.88-931,1,18090,benjamin_s_sharp,,1453.368,1477.904,"The statute, as originally enacted, obviously was directed at the... at the receipt of payments during a period of time where the performance of government services was being rendered, where there was a temptation, or at least a potential for influence of that government service, to assure that that economic benefit was continued to be received."
1989.88-931,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1493.991,1500.957,--Except here you have got a series of findings which totally negate any improper actual conduct.
1989.88-931,1,18090,benjamin_s_sharp,,1558.497,1578.598,"I think implicit in the ""as compensation for"" language is... is the notion that the payor is intending something that would create a conflict of interest, some impropriety."
1989.88-931,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1592.263,1597.076,"Well, but if that only it would cover the case of say, well, we'll keep your salary going while you are in Washington."
1989.88-931,1,18090,benjamin_s_sharp,,1598.98,1600.417,--They clearly cannot do that.
1989.88-931,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1600.417,1603.041,But that would cover it even though it was totally benign in motive.
1989.88-931,1,18090,benjamin_s_sharp,,1615.8,1622.486,"Well, under those circumstances certainly the employee would be acting at a time he was receiving discretionary--"
1989.88-931,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1622.486,1622.767,--Right.
1989.88-931,1,18090,benjamin_s_sharp,,1622.767,1623.189,--funds--
1989.88-931,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1623.189,1623.736,The statute plainly--
1989.88-931,1,18090,benjamin_s_sharp,,1623.736,1628.859,"--which could tempt him, could influence him, in a way that pre-employment severance payments could not."
1989.88-931,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1628.859,1634.778,--Well--
1989.88-931,1,18090,benjamin_s_sharp,,1634.778,1651.818,"The second issue that we wish to cover briefly has to do with the court of appeals' determining that although there was no conflict of interest, that an appearance of a conflict of interest was both sufficient to violate the statute and sufficient toward injury for the United States to recover."
1989.88-931,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1670.436,1679.448,"--Does this depend on the statutory construction, Mr. Sharp, or does this go to the measure of recovery or the nature of the common law tort?"
1989.88-931,1,18090,benjamin_s_sharp,,1679.448,1685.976,--I think it goes to the statutory construction and to the issue of whether there has been--
1989.88-931,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1685.976,1689.194,But of course the statute doesn't say conflict of interest at all.
1989.88-931,1,18090,benjamin_s_sharp,,1689.194,1690.333,--That's correct.
1989.88-931,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1690.333,1699.923,"So, when you say the... to say there was no conflict of interest, how does that cut one way or the other with respect to the statutory construction?"
1989.88-931,1,18090,benjamin_s_sharp,,1699.923,1709.514,"Again, simply that the construction of a conflict of interest statute ought to be such to give some meaning to the evil which Congress sought to prevent."
1989.88-931,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1838.148,1840.975,"Thank you, Mr. Sharp."
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1841.897,1853.987,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-931,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1884.614,1889.94,"Mr. Kneedler, although this was a civil case, I guess it is based on a criminal statute."
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1895.564,1897.547,"--The statute itself, yes."
1989.88-931,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1897.547,1897.766,Yes.
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1897.766,1899.561,"In terms of its scope, yes."
1989.88-931,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1899.561,1902.076,"So, presumably the rule of lenity would have some application?"
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1902.076,1911.057,"Yes, in terms of construing the scope, in terms of the showing of intent required, we don't think that that would be... that that would be necessary."
1989.88-931,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1919.523,1931.846,"Mr. Kneedler, is... is it correct, as Mr. Lacovara said, that you concede that the two paragraphs of 209(a) are coextensive?"
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1951.135,1952.962,Yes.
1989.88-931,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1963.801,1964.987,I understand that.
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1964.987,1969.689,"I think Mr. Lacovara had it backwards in terms of which, which provision of the statute you look to first."
1989.88-931,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1969.689,1986.276,"Well, but the first... the first is at least ambiguous, and the second doesn't seem to be ambiguous, because it says whoever pays or makes any contribution to or in any way supplements the salary of any such officer or employee."
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1986.276,1991.727,"Right, but it... it... there are several aspects of that that we think are significant."
1989.88-931,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1997.804,1998.382,Fine.
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1998.382,2005.441,"And it's referring to, it's referring to someone who, who is/was an employee."
1989.88-931,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2091.498,2100.153,"But Congress, nonetheless, felt it necessary in the sections dealing with bribery to say explicitly that it covered payments made before you were actually in service."
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2100.153,2101.729,Well--
1989.88-931,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2101.729,2102.682,"It says it, very explicitly."
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2104.15,2108.055,"--Because it is unnecessary to do so, because the... because the language--"
1989.88-931,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2108.055,2108.54,You think it is that clear?
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2108.54,2109.398,--Pardon me?
1989.88-931,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2109.398,2110.054,The language is that clear.
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2110.054,2112.882,It seems to me it is all encompassing.
1989.88-931,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2115.427,2124.219,"Well, the legislative history of the change, though, does not reflect that they intended to broaden the scope, does it?"
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2124.219,2128.531,"--Well, I have several responses to that, Justice O'Connor."
1989.88-931,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2216.636,2220.541,"Well, Mr. Kneedler, this is a criminal statute."
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2229.975,2232.52,I'm sorry.
1989.88-931,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2232.52,2240.564,"Just because there is a criminal statute, does that automatically give the government the right to a civil damages action for its violation?"
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2240.564,2249.81,"Well, as Mr. Lacovara conceded, it is well established that the government has a... has a cause of action to recover payments made to its employees in violation of fiduciary duties."
1989.88-931,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2249.81,2264.773,"Right, but that, that common law cause of action presumably would encompass whether there's disclosure, whether there were secret profits taken, or something of that sort."
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2264.773,2273.925,"No, I think the cause of action would extend to violations of the fiduciary duty, however that fiduciary duty is defined."
1989.88-931,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2283.624,2293.308,"How do you know it is a fiduciary duty that the statute defines, or... ordinarily an employee does not have a fiduciary duty to his employer, does he, just in the normal course of events?"
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2293.308,2295.572,"Well, or a principal agency relationship."
1989.88-931,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2302.851,2315.503,"Well, why... you know, when you say there is a violation of a fiduciary duty that suggests some extraordinarily high duty, to me, that you don't find among ordinary relationships."
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2315.503,2315.986,--Well--
1989.88-931,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2315.986,2317.845,Why is this a fiduciary duty?
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2317.845,2324.156,"--Well, the specific fiduciary duty at issue here is the duty of undivided loyalty to the employer, which is a fiduciary duty."
1989.88-931,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2333.823,2336.993,"And can't... well then, he can insist upon that without regard to statute?"
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2341.819,2348.504,"--Well, as I say, the contours of the employer/employee relationship would be defined by whatever contract or whatever statute defines that relationship."
1989.88-931,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2354.564,2355.72,"Well, what is the--"
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2355.72,2357.439,--would enforce the contract between the parties.
1989.88-931,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2357.439,2359.61,--Where does it define the scope of the relationship?
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2359.61,2370.527,"Well, it... specifically, Section 209 says that a person, an employee or... a person cannot receive any compensation, any supplementation of his salary for his services as a government employee."
1989.88-931,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2370.527,2374.792,But how does that define the relationship of employer to employee?
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2374.792,2379.07,It defines the duty of loyalty that the employee... that the agent owes to the principal.
1989.88-931,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2379.07,2381.912,"Well, it is a prophylactic rule to prevent disloyalty."
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2389.987,2396.375,"No, we say that there is... well, the statute doesn't expressly provide a civil cause of action."
1989.88-931,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2406.95,2411.808,"Well, why... so it is a civil cause of action under the common law?"
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2411.808,2417.195,To enforce a... a duty defined or a prohibition defined by this statute.
1989.88-931,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2421.068,2425.707,Then why do you say the... why do you say the disclosure element of the common law doesn't apply here?
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2425.707,2438.984,"--Because the... the particular duty being enforced here is defined by the statute, and the statute does not make the secrecy of the payments an element of the... of the prohibition."
1989.88-931,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2462.427,2466.348,"And you say because it doesn't say it, disclosure doesn't... won't help any."
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2466.348,2467.908,That is exactly right.
1989.88-931,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2469.987,2477.375,"How about the common law action you bring, except for the statute, you say disclosure would have cured the common law--"
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2477.375,2478.952,"Well, I think that isn't clear."
1989.88-931,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2480.655,2481.483,"--Well, suppose it was."
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2481.483,2483.092,"--Well, I think--"
1989.88-931,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2483.092,2490.355,I would think... I would think the statute ought to say that disclosure won't cure this crime.
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2490.355,2502.086,"--Well, there is... in essence it does say that because there is no exception for situations in which the... in which the employee has disclosed the matter to the government and gets a waiver."
1989.88-931,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2527.467,2541.744,"But you are tacking a common law cause of action onto Section 209, and if the common law cause of action traditionally has required non-disclosure in order... as an element, it did... really the shoe is on the other foot, isn't it?"
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2541.744,2542.508,"No, I think not."
1989.88-931,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2581.18,2582.774,It is not a contractual relationship though.
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2627.365,2633.19,"Well, it seems to me our submission here is a... is a lot narrower than that, and that is--"
1989.88-931,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2633.19,2634.064,"Well, why is it?"
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2634.392,2646.122,"--Well, it's well accepted even in common law that when an agent receives money from a third party for the performance of his duties to the principal, he has a duty to account to the principal for the profits that he has received."
1989.88-931,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2679.702,2695.4,"So you assert that there is a... that a private employer, let's assume Boeing found out that somebody was leaving Boeing to go to another private employer, presumably not in aerospace, or they wouldn't make the payment, but they say, you know, this is a good job he is going to, but it is not paying very much."
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2707.052,2707.613,--No.

1989.88-931,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2721.233,2722.653,I think that is the position you are driven to.
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2734.088,2741.881,"--Well, in the example you are citing, if the second employer had a specific provision in its... in its personnel manual or its contract--"
1989.88-931,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2741.881,2743.708,"No, you say, you said this is common law."
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2747.066,2753.313,"--But what I am saying, the common law allows parties to enforce the agreement or the rules that govern the relationship between themselves."

1989.88-931,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2811.946,2812.79,Would that save it?
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2812.79,2818.412,"--At some point it would be sufficiently broad, and we're not in a position at this point to say how broad."

1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2831.001,2841.137,"--Well, the Justice Department has taken the position on a number of occasions that awards made to government employees are not covered by Section 209."

1989.88-931,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2844.995,2846.916,--understanding of the statute.

1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2903.799,2904.127,Right.

1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2961.606,2962.182,--Right.
1989.88-931,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2969.446,2970.024,It does not apply.

1989.88-931,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3135.127,3136.751,"Well, because the statute reads on that."

1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3217.343,3219.764,--Perhaps not.
1989.88-931,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3219.764,3220.405,Yes or no?
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3220.405,3224.436,According... the district court said it was theirs to keep.

1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3229.183,3231.87,--Uh--
1989.88-931,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3231.87,3234.134,"Boeing couldn't, but the government certainly could under your view."

1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3240.553,3242.537,"Well, in this, yes."
1989.88-931,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3264.809,3275.898,"Well, could... I take it the person who changes his mind, goes to work for the other company, he could be convicted under this statute, and so could his employer who paid him the money?"
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3275.898,3277.57,Yes.
1989.88-931,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3277.57,3302.106,"Mr. Kneedler, what if, instead of paying severance payments, Boeing had a policy of paying bonuses upon employment after government service, and paid precisely the same amounts... I don't know whether these people did go back to Boeing, but assume they had been totally severed, worked for the government for three or four years, then went to work for Boeing and received advance payments that more or less supplemented for the sacrifice they had made in the prior three years."
1989.88-931,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3302.106,3304.777,"It would be the same result, and for good reason."
