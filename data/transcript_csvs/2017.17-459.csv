2017.17-459,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.05,7.535,"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-459, Pereira versus Sessions. Mr. Zimmer."
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,7.535,17.815,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The stop-time rule at issue in this case specifies exactly what the government must do in order to end an immigrant's period of continuous presence."
2017.17-459,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,49.63,53.09,"Mr. Zimmer, you just said defines the notice of appear."
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,76.665,77.08,"Well, right."
2017.17-459,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,126.96,132.365,"And if any one on the list, any one is left out, then it's not a notice to appear?"
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,132.365,134.09,"Well, yes, that's right, Justice Ginsburg."
2017.17-459,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,197.8,205.745,Do you think that your interpretation is so clear that it wouldn't be necessary for us to get beyond step one of Chevron?
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,205.745,206.41,"Yes, I --"
2017.17-459,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,206.41,207.415,Why is that so?
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,207.415,210.89,So it's -- it's so because of the definitional language in Section 1229(a).
2017.17-459,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,210.89,213.64,But I -- I don't see definitional language in there.
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,215.43,218.73,"It's -- Justice Alito, it's the ""in this section referred to as"" language."
2017.17-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,249.65,266.49,"What do you do with the government's position that using the word ""under"" in the notice to appear definitional section is different than what was done in other provisions -- parts of this that said ""in accordance with"" or ""required under""?"
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,266.49,266.85,Right.
2017.17-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,266.85,268.71,So there is a difference of usage.
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,271.4,271.66,Sure.
2017.17-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,272.64,275.115,Doesn't that in -- in and of itself create an ambiguity?
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,275.115,277.46,"So -- so two responses to that, Justice Sotomayor."
2017.17-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,332.03,340.535,"If I -- if we were to disagree with you that there -- and -- and say there's ambiguity, where does that leave your argument? Do you lose?"
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,340.535,341.44,"Well, no, Your Honor."
2017.17-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,341.65,343.975,Because of Chevron and deference to the government?
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,343.975,344.32,Right.
2017.17-459,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,378.5,385.395,How -- how does the -- the logistical problem -- at least if I understand it correctly.
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,424.13,462.06,"Well, so, as the government admits, and this is on page 50, Note 15 of its brief, the government actually had a system, it was using a system that did allow it to identify the time and include it on the notice to appear. And, in fact, this is explained in even more detail in the amicus brief submitted by former BIA chairman and Immigration Judge Schmidt, who -- who explains that this system allowed coordination between the Department of Homeland Security and the immigration courts, such that individual DHS officers could identify a time that could be included on the notice to appear. And Judge Schmidt explains, again, in great detail, why that system not only worked but made the immigration courts function more effectively."
2017.17-459,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,504.04,507.09,You say we don't know why they abandoned that system?
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,507.09,508.83,"Well, no, the government has never explained."
2017.17-459,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,534.24,543.67,"Well, would it be better to include a date, even if in the great majority of cases the date is going to be changed, which can be done?"
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,543.67,550.62,"So, yes, the date certainly can be changed, and yes -- and yes, it is better to include a date in the initial notice anyway."
2017.17-459,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,585.95,587.87,"Well, I don't see how your rule would change that."
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,597.635,598.39,"Well, Your Honor --"
2017.17-459,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,598.39,599.24,What is achieved?
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,599.24,606.01,So I think the system does assume a certain degree of good faith on the government's part to not put a date that it knows -- knows to be false.
2017.17-459,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,610.12,610.54,I thought your --
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,610.54,610.63,But --
2017.17-459,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,610.63,613.86,-- I thought the example you just gave us was an example of bad faith.
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,613.86,614.57,"Oh, I don't -- no."
2017.17-459,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,695.605,709.19,"Well, what if they send a notice that specifies a date and then let's say two weeks later they send another notice that says that the -- the proceeding on that date is canceled and a new date will be set at some time in the future? What would happen then?"
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,709.19,714.69,"I mean, I think in that context -- I mean, that's an interesting question, Your Honor."
2017.17-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,741.35,745.61,"I think the provision requires in writing a change of date, doesn't it?"
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,745.61,746.47,It does.
2017.17-459,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,756.915,765.96,"Well, but it's -- it's -- it's an important practical question because there are a lot of hearings and there are limited numbers of people available to conduct the hearing."
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,788.24,788.62,Right.
2017.17-459,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,788.62,797.87,-- it -- it -- it -- I don't see what's different from that. And it seems to take great -- or practical considerations do have some role to play.
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,797.87,798.34,"Well, yes."
2017.17-459,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,808.96,813.285,"I thought you were suggesting that they couldn't keep -- they couldn't put it off until the next time, or --"
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,813.285,816.32,"No, they can change -- they can definitely change the date to another date."
2017.17-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,822.875,829.03,Can I go back and -- and ask how this works? And I was a little confused by what happened here.
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,838.61,839.17,In general.
2017.17-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,839.17,841.325,What happened here? They didn't give him a date.
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,841.325,842.05,That's correct.
2017.17-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,842.05,848.31,"They then sent a change of date to -- to the -- to the wrong address, essentially."
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,848.31,848.915,Correct.
2017.17-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,848.915,855.085,"And so he didn't get notice of the change of -- of address, and he was then deported, correct?"
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,855.085,858.83,"Well, he was -- a -- a final order of removal was entered."
2017.17-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,859.98,860.76,"Yeah, a final --"
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,860.76,861.01,Yeah.
2017.17-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,861.01,862.06,-- order of removal.
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,875.12,882.78,"Yes, but -- yes, you -- you absolutely do, but what happened here is -- is Mr. Pereira did tell them where to mail the notice to and they didn't send it to that address."
2017.17-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,883.47,896.97,"So why are we here at all, because -- since they didn't -- I -- I -- I -- I'm just asking as a practical question. Wouldn't the -- the final order have to be vacated because he was never given proper notice of the change of address?"
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,896.97,898.99,"So that notice was vacated, Your Honor."
2017.17-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,898.99,899.19,I see.
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,899.19,900.09,And then later another --
2017.17-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,900.09,900.33,Okay.
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,902.02,902.56,Exactly.
2017.17-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,911.11,911.42,Got it.
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,911.42,913.57,"-- presence, then he tried to apply for --"
2017.17-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,913.57,914.01,I had forgotten that.
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,914.01,914.1,Okay.
2017.17-459,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,951.71,952.92,"No, I under -- I understand."
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,977.62,981.65,"Well, yes, there's a big practical difference because, in a case like Camarillo, they're not trying to do that."
2017.17-459,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1027.27,1027.3,I --
2017.17-459,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1027.3,1028.82,"I mean, that sounds like some sort of --"
2017.17-459,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1028.82,1029.86,"No, go ahead."
2017.17-459,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1029.86,1031.73,-- some sort of bad faith exception.
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,1074.71,1085.52,"Well, if I understand your question correctly, Justice Alito, again, I think that the -- that the difference is that -- I mean, in that situation, the government could, of course, solve the problem by just simply providing the date."
2017.17-459,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1089.4,1120.975,"I think -- I think the concern that, if I'm correct, that -- that my colleagues are expressing is are -- would -- we may be creating a perverse incentive here for the government to issue earlier notices to appear on dates that it actually has no intention of proceeding in order to stop the clock on clients like yours, rather than being more forthright and saying we don't know when we're going to be able to do it, but here's a notice to stop the clock. We're going to wind up in the same place perhaps, and it's just a paper exercise."
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,1120.975,1121.35,"Well, Your Honor --"
2017.17-459,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1121.35,1122.38,"That's the concern, I think."
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,1122.38,1122.78,Right.
2017.17-459,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1131.74,1132.73,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,1132.73,1133.34,But -- but your --
2017.17-459,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1133.34,1136.59,"We wouldn't go that far, counsel. (Laughter.)"
2017.17-459,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1136.59,1146.025,"It -- it just is a matter of administrative convenience that we're going to list it for the first Tuesday on the second month, and maybe we'll get there and maybe we won't."
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,1172.1,1174.35,"Well, it certainly wouldn't create an adverse effect."
2017.17-459,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1216.52,1216.69,So the --
2017.17-459,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1216.69,1222.025,Were there any remedy for your -- for -- for your client in a circumstance like the one I've described that you can think of?
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,1222.025,1234.23,"Where they keep -- keep scheduling the hearing? Well, what the -- what the client could do is if -- if he or she wanted the hearings to proceed, she could go into immigration court and attempt to -- to actually have a hearing held instead of having that uncertainty."
2017.17-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1241.37,1247.19,Could your client go to immigration court before it's filed in immigration court?
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,1247.19,1247.61,No.
2017.17-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1247.61,1260.1,Meaning -- so the start of your client's ability to force the government to give it a hearing doesn't start until it's filed in the immigration court?
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,1260.1,1261.345,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2017.17-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1267.98,1272.25,"And, in fact, the -- the B -- I call it the BIA; I don't know what it's called today --"
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,1272.25,1274.1,It is called the BIA.
2017.17-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1274.1,1280.62,"-- in Ordaz, said that the notice to appear is not valid until it's actually filed with the immigration court."
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,1280.62,1281.585,That's correct.
2017.17-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1281.585,1291.76,"And so, if an order to show cause is served today but not filed, it's not valid; it doesn't stop the clock, correct, under the BIA's own reading?"
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,1291.76,1293.21,If -- if it's never filed --
2017.17-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1293.21,1295.53,And a second notice to appear?
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,1295.53,1296.22,That's correct.
2017.17-459,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1296.22,1296.805,All right.
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,1305.94,1306.78,That's correct.
2017.17-459,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1378.42,1417.26,"Mr. Zimmer, can I take you back to the language of the statute and just ask about your assertion that this is clearly definitional in nature? I mean, one question is, is that necessary to your argument? And then the other question is, you know, here's an alternative view of this language, which is this language is a -- it's -- it's -- it's a notice of shorthand, it's -- you know, we need to call this thing something, this -- this thing which tells you to appear in -- at removal proceedings, and this is what we're going to call it. But it doesn't suggest that everything that we say about this document is -- defines what a notice to appeal is."
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,1423.97,1437.44,"So I guess I don't -- I think maybe the word ""definitional"" -- I mean, what the -- this document is called a notice to appear, which in and of itself implies some indication that it -- that it will tell someone when, where, and why to appear."
2017.17-459,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1437.44,1437.53,Yes.
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,1450.94,1458.11,"Well, so I -- I think the way the language -- the statute is written -- I mean, it's certainly -- our argument is not that there cannot be a flaw."
2017.17-459,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1497.02,1504.245,"I mean, nobody had any doubt that what was filed here or what was sent here was a notice to appear, isn't that right?"
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,1504.245,1522.9,"Well, it had the words ""notice to appear"" written on top of the page. It's a little bit odd, again, to say that it was a notice to appear when it didn't tell Mr. Pereira to appear at any particular time. I mean, so I think the name -- it's hard to see that it could be a notice to appear when it didn't actually tell Mr. Pereira when to appear and when to do anything."
2017.17-459,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1522.9,1530.37499995,"Suppose the -- the parenthetical ""(in this section referred to as a ""notice to appear"")"" were deleted."
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,1532.75,1533.83,"Yes, absolutely."
2017.17-459,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1557.7,1566.99,"I mean, the rules of this Court and -- and the rules of appellate procedure say a brief shall contain certain things."
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,1569.17,1570.24,"Well, no."
2017.17-459,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1581.91,1604.95,"Well, there's no provision defining what a brief means because everybody knows what a brief is, but suppose that there were a section that says that a document filed by the parties setting out the parties' argument is -- shall be referred to as a brief, so then anything -- any document that's filed that omits anything that's required by rule to be included would not be -- would not be a brief any longer?"
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,1604.95,1607.17,"I mean, if the rules were written that way, yes."
2017.17-459,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1626.97,1627.66,"Thank you, counsel."
2017.17-459,0,62978,david_j_zimmer,,1627.66,1632.89,Thank you.
2017.17-459,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1632.89,1634.6,Mr. Liu.
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1634.6,1661.305,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The question in this case is whether the stop-time rule may be triggered by a notice to appear that doesn't contain a hearing date. The answer is yes. The statutory text reflects the judgment that an alien shouldn't be able to continue claiming credit for being in the United States once the government tells -- has told the alien that it intends to remove him. With or without a hearing date, a notice to appear does just that."
2017.17-459,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1666.3,1669.4,We don't know that until it's filed with the immigration court.
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1669.4,1670.15,I think that --
2017.17-459,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1670.15,1674.805,Because you already -- your agency has already said that in Ordaz.
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1674.805,1675.46,I don't think --
2017.17-459,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1675.46,1680.53,That a notice to appear is invalid unless it's filed with the immigration courts.
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1680.53,1695.27,"Well, I think that point actually cuts against my friend, because if it turns out at the end of the day that the government isn't serious about pursuing those charges, then it won't file the notice to appear, and under Ordaz, that notice to appear won't be given any stop-time effect."
2017.17-459,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1695.27,1709.72,"How is it that under Ordaz a notice to appear isn't a notice to appear if it -- if it's not filed, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out? An extra-statutory requirement that I -- I can't -- I don't see this -- in the language of this statute."
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1711.8,1712.5,"Well, the --"
2017.17-459,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1712.5,1721.765,But -- but yet a document that contains some of the elements that are required by this statute should qualify? That seems to me to have it sort of backwards.
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1722.515,1733.18,"Well, the question in Ordaz, Justice Gorsuch, was about what happens when there are basically two notices to appear, where there are changes to an existing notice to appear."
2017.17-459,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1736.75,1750.345,"I understand that. But -- but the BIA, in its wisdom, has said that a notice to appear isn't a notice to appear if it lacks something that the statute doesn't require, but it is a notice to appear if it lacks something the statute does require."
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1750.345,1750.75,Right.
2017.17-459,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1750.75,1753.105,And I am thoroughly confused by that.
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1753.105,1753.45,Well --
2017.17-459,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1753.45,1754.41,Maybe you can help me out.
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1754.41,1772.82,"Well, let -- let me take the second part first, which is why it is the case that a notice to appear that lacks a date and time is still a notice to appear. And I -- I think the framework this Court should approach that case with is the framework it applied in Edelman versus Lynchburg College."
2017.17-459,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1793.38,1797.21,So -- so what is the definition of a notice to appear? It doesn't have to have a date.
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1805.915,1806.61,A notice to --
2017.17-459,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1806.61,1809.92,"A blank page with -- with the title notice to appear, would that suffice?"
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1809.92,1812.33,A blank page -- a blank page would not be a notice to appear.
2017.17-459,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1827.99,1831.935,"Mr. Liu, help me. I -- I -- I'm simple-minded."
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1857.01,1859.71,"Well, I don't -- I don't think Congress had that view."
2017.17-459,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1872.68,1873.19,But not when?
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1873.19,1873.755,-- and why.
2017.17-459,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1880.51,1881.03,"Well, okay."
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1898.05,1904.07,"Well, in our -- in our view, the -- the charges are crucial to the function of a charging document."
2017.17-459,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1908.13,1910.66,"Well, I'm just wondering where the government would have us draw the line --"
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1910.66,1911.61,"Well, we would draw the line --"
2017.17-459,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1911.61,1911.77,-- and why.
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1911.77,1921.78,"-- we would draw the line, as -- as I say, that -- that the -- the notice to appear is a notice to appear so long as it tells the alien that he must appear for removal proceedings."
2017.17-459,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1921.78,1922.0,Okay.
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1924.26,1924.65,Sure.
2017.17-459,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1924.65,1925.505,We've got to have that.
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1926.975,1927.4,Yes.
2017.17-459,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1927.4,1928.17,-- got to have that?
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1928.17,1929.04,"Yes, and (C) and (D)."
2017.17-459,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1929.04,1929.13,Okay.
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1930.975,1931.39,(C) and (D).
2017.17-459,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1931.39,1934.95,So it's only the date and time that's -- we don't have to have. Everything else is good.
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1934.95,1936.98,"No, no, no, (E) through (G)."
2017.17-459,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1936.98,1938.02,"(E) through (G), no, none of those?"
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1938.02,1946.78,"No, because those have to do with the mechanics of subsequent proceedings. The reason why (A) through (D) are essential is because (A) through (D) are about --"
2017.17-459,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1946.78,1949.1,"So you don't -- don't need to tell them they need counsel, for example."
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1950.655,1951.62,No.
2017.17-459,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1951.62,1951.84,Okay.
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1951.84,1956.88,Because that -- that's an advisal about the mechanics of future proceedings.
2017.17-459,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1968.71,1980.03,"Doesn't Congress get to decide what's the essential function of a charging document? I would have thought that, you know, I don't see a distinction between (A) and (D) versus (E) through (G) in -- in this -- in this statute."
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1982.97,1983.14,"Well, I --"
2017.17-459,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1983.14,1983.72,-- (A) through (D) --
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1983.72,1984.33,"-- I think, actually --"
2017.17-459,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1984.33,1985.6,"-- (E) through (G), forget about those."
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1985.6,2010.465,"I think Congress actually told us in 1996 and then again in NACARA in 1997, and these provisions are at the statutory appendix at 69a. In 1996, when Congress enacted this very statute, it said that the stop-time rule should apply to notices to appear issued before the effective date. The question arose, there were no notices to appear because there were only orders to show cause."
2017.17-459,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2034.18,2044.67,"But, Mr. Liu, this might be the same question and, if so, I -- I apologize for beating you over the head with it, but a -- a notice to appear, it's a special kind of charging document."
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2071.555,2077.02,"Well, I think that's not the -- the essential function of a charging document."
2017.17-459,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2077.81,2079.93,"Well, you talk about it as a charging document."
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2090.79,2104.55,And the government doesn't dispute that the notice to -- to appear -- that that type of notice needs to be provided to the alien if the government is ever going to effectuate a removal in these removal proceedings.
2017.17-459,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2104.55,2110.15,"So why -- just in case -- I mean, it's possible we will agree with you."
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2164.12,2164.54,Right.
2017.17-459,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2164.54,2178.56,"It meant that a human being who was over at DHS would go to his computer, find out what dates were available, and fill them in the notice to appear. Now that wouldn't seem too tough."
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2209.505,2214.96,The reason is that -- is because of the -- the structure of the statute and the regulations.
2017.17-459,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2214.96,2216.56,"No, no, not because of the structure."
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2227.095,2227.61,Sure.
2017.17-459,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2227.61,2231.67,-- why did some group of those people stop doing --
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2231.67,2231.76,Right.
2017.17-459,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2231.945,2234.33,-- what would have eliminated the problem in this case?
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2234.33,2234.58,Simple --
2017.17-459,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2234.58,2234.64,Why?
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2234.64,2234.94,-- simple answer.
2017.17-459,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2236.115,2237.04,Why didn't it work?
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2237.04,2238.87,The old -- the old system had three problems.
2017.17-459,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2238.87,2239.12,Yeah.
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2239.12,2252.0,"Number one, it wasn't allocating workload fairly among immigration judges, which is crucial in -- in a system where IJs are notoriously overburdened. Number two, it wasn't capable of prioritizing cases."
2017.17-459,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2273.12,2284.09,"As to the third, could you not invent a system today that would, in fact, allow people to know what hearing dates were available? As to the second, I have no view."
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2289.41,2299.48,"Well, I think, Justice Breyer, to take your last part first, I think it's -- you know, it's not theoretically impossible to devise this system."
2017.17-459,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2303.28,2303.64,All right.
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2306.78,2307.255,Right.
2017.17-459,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2307.255,2310.075,The third one I'm rather dubious about.
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2318.29,2319.24,"Well, they --"
2017.17-459,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2319.24,2336.11,"In what document shall I read the reasons that the BIA or whatever these organizations were, why they did change the old system, and I will find there what you just said, so I will be able to think about it, what document says that?"
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2336.11,2341.57,"Well, there's no -- there's no document I can point to you, other than the BIA's decision in this case --"
2017.17-459,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2341.57,2343.21,"No, I didn't find those reasons there."
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2344.185,2346.31,The BIA didn't specify --
2017.17-459,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2346.31,2346.42,Okay.
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2346.42,2346.91,-- reasons why --
2017.17-459,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2346.91,2357.635,"Well, it used to be -- there was a famous hot oil case, which you know, and they discovered that the reasons or the agency rule and so forth was in somebody's desk at the Interior Department and had never been published."
2017.17-459,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2362.73,2375.15,"Did -- did they, in fact, publish this anywhere? No is the answer. And so, if they don't really give a reason, and I have a hard time understanding it, am I -- is there a basis --"
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2375.15,2375.24,Well --
2017.17-459,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2375.24,2377.84,-- on which I'm supposed to find it reasonable under Chevron's statute?
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2377.84,2393.16,"Well, but I think the reason given in the BIA's -- in the BIA's decision is the reason I am giving, which is, was -- it was infeasible for the DHS officers to be able to access the immigration court's docket to put the date in at this time."
2017.17-459,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2393.16,2402.29,What do we do with the immigration judge who tells us it was working fine; I don't know why they stopped it?
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2402.29,2405.62,"Well, the -- he doesn't know why he stopped it."
2017.17-459,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2431.66,2432.08,Mr. Liu?
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2432.08,2434.11,-- means that we're not entitled to Chevron deference.
2017.17-459,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2434.11,2434.56,What -- what percentage --
2017.17-459,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2434.56,2435.05,"Mr. Liu, you're not --"
2017.17-459,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2435.05,2441.48,"What percentage of notices to appear omit the time and date of the proceeding over the last three years, say?"
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2441.48,2442.47,The vast --
2017.17-459,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2442.47,2443.91,Over a given -- a given period?
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2443.91,2446.15,"The vast majority omit, so --"
2017.17-459,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2446.15,2447.19,The vast majority omit --
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2447.19,2449.74,-- almost 100 percent. Almost 100 percent.
2017.17-459,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2458.5,2464.05,"Mr. Liu, is it impractical? You just said there was a system; it did have some flaws."
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2471.26500005,2474.26,Whether alternatives --
2017.17-459,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2474.26,2477.25,Designs were considered that would give the date?
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2477.25,2492.35,"Well, like I said, the -- the system that was in place in 1996 and in 2006 and today isn't one that was going to allow for dates and times to be put on the vast majority of --"
2017.17-459,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2492.35,2510.16,"I do look at legislative history, and the prior language with respect to order to show cause basically said you can give those dates if practical. I look at that, and Congress knew what the BIA was doing or not doing."
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2510.16,2510.595,Right.
2017.17-459,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2510.595,2529.14,"And then it defines this notice to appear and drops those ""as practical."" To me, that's a very telling -- that's not -- that's legislative history but not in terms of what members said but what they did."
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2529.14,2529.52,Right.
2017.17-459,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2530.19,2533.78,"And, to me, that's often fairly convincing."
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2537.73,2539.38,Because --
2017.17-459,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2539.38,2541.225,-- inclusive of your argument?
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2541.225,2541.605,Well --
2017.17-459,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2541.605,2542.56,Against your argument?
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2542.56,2550.28,"Well, two -- two points. The change that Congress made does mean that the notice to appear without the date is complete."
2017.17-459,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2590.39,2597.105,"Do you want to -- do you want to -- my questions were rather mean, but they were designed to uncover something."
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2597.105,2597.5,Right.
2017.17-459,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2597.5,2600.66,And -- and it is actually a very interesting question.
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2614.63,2615.23,And I --
2017.17-459,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2615.23,2622.94,"Can it just say something like not practical, which is denied by their former chairman? Do they have to go into it in some depth?"
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2622.94,2623.46,And --
2017.17-459,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2623.46,2624.98,To what extent do they have to? You see that?
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2624.98,2625.42,And -- and -- right.
2017.17-459,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2625.42,2627.18,Because it's not just a rubber stamp job.
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2627.18,2635.87,"Well, and, Justice Breyer, I think if you look at this Court's past cases, it hasn't required this sort of administrative reason."
2017.17-459,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2671.41,2692.75,"Suppose if you -- if, you know, you say this doesn't allocate workload, which is very important for the overburdened judges, it -- it -- it doesn't prioritize, all sorts of things, it's impracticable, then I suppose if we rule against you, you'll just say: Okay, we'll put a date in, and if it turns out we can't make that date, we'll move it back another six months."
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2698.975,2702.025,"Well, I'm not sure what it would accomplish either."
2017.17-459,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2753.68,2754.14,Mr. Liu --
2017.17-459,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2754.14,2754.69,One question about --
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2754.69,2755.25,-- as in paragraph 2.
2017.17-459,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2755.25,2756.735,-- the proceeding here.
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2774.645,2806.805,"I believe the answer is no. I -- I -- I admit the record, the administrative record, we have is not exceptionally clear on that point, but my understanding is that in 2007, when that initial removal order was issued, that the IJ assumed that Pereira had received notice. Now, when it turned out later that Pereira hadn't received that notice, the IJ -- actually turned out to be the same IJ, reopened those proceedings."
2017.17-459,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2886.09,2896.36,"Could we go back, Mr. Liu, to the text of the statute, and could you tell me what your best response is to Mr. Zimmer's argument about this parenthetical ""(in this section --"
2017.17-459,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2896.36,2896.46,Right.
2017.17-459,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2896.46,2903.64,"-- referred to as a ""notice to appear"")"", which he says makes it clear that everything that follows is part of the definition of a notice to appear."
2017.17-459,2,62593,frederick_liu,,2903.64,2904.4,Right.
2017.17-459,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2927.42,2934.725,"So then what do we look to? When you were giving your sense of it has to include this, but it doesn't have to include that --"
2017.17-459,3,62593,frederick_liu,,2934.725,2935.1,Right.
2017.17-459,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2935.1,2945.08,"-- if -- if -- if we don't look to that parenthetical for the reason that you said, what do we look to to decide what is definitionally part of a notice to appear?"
2017.17-459,3,62593,frederick_liu,,2945.08,2945.375,Right.
2017.17-459,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3092.805,3095.81500005,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Zimmer, three minutes."
2017.17-459,4,62978,david_j_zimmer,,3095.81500005,3106.44,"Thank you. I think the main point here that I want to make is just that the statute actually doesn't distinguish at all between these provisions in Section 1229(a), between the types of notice that are listed."
2017.17-459,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3232.74,3238.5,But when he -- when he had notice that the government was going to attempt to remove him?
2017.17-459,4,62978,david_j_zimmer,,3238.5,3240.51,"Well, that the government might attempt to remove him."
2017.17-459,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3285.4,3286.255,"Thank you, counsel."
