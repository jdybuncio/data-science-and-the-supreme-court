1966.101,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,32.331,"Number 101, Federal Trade Commission, petitioner versus Universal-Rundle Corporation."
1966.101,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,34.122,37.856,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.101,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,158.184,164.025,Does the Trade Commission order cover the Homart products or just the U.R. Products?
1966.101,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,164.025,177.061,"It does not because it was eventually determined after very lengthy hearings, most of which had been deleted from this record that the Homart and the UR lines were not of like grade and quality."
1966.101,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,513.346,518.821,Would you say that the Commission -- that the Court of Appeals not reached the Commission's order on the merits?
1966.101,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,518.821,528.017,"That is right, Your Honor, which puts us in a -- puts the Commission in a particularly awkward position as I'm sure you realize because we may have to --"
1966.101,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,528.017,531.893,"If you -- if you prevail here, the case ought to go back to the Court of Appeals, does it?"
1966.101,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,531.893,535.028,So we pray.
1966.101,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,535.389,548.395,"Out -- out of the Court, how the Court of Appeals, they found these precise factors which followed in throughout the industry without reaching the merits?"
1966.101,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,548.395,551.047,That is one of the great mysteries of this case Your Honor.
1966.101,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,767.657,774.902,"Well, are you -- you're not suggesting to us are you that Rundle's just as well off with the order as it would be without the order?"
1966.101,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,774.902,785.042,"I'm certainly not suggesting that, but I am suggesting that there is an element here of bringing in through the backdoor what one couldn't prove or didn't prove when one had an opportunity to --"
1966.101,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,785.042,786.651,But is that -- is that important?
1966.101,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,815.383,836.276,"No, I think that -- I think it is true that I -- that even if we assume that Rundle's competitors were all violating the law, much more egregiously than Rundle, the Commission has to be free to order its own business and take up affairs, make investigations when as in if it gets around to if it wants to."
1966.101,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,836.276,860.651,"And this is not a unique situation in which the Commission has selected a smaller person in the industry which they have standard practices and -- for the proceeding against that personal -- that company and left its larger competitors happily doing their own business in the same old stance, is it?"
1966.101,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,860.651,862.794,I suppose that has happened.
1966.101,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,894.243,901.197,Does Rundle have a remedy against its competitors in the 2 (a) of the Robinson-Patman Act?
1966.101,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,904.885,906.23,This is a 2 (a) case.
1966.101,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,906.23,923.447,"Now, you're telling us now that Rundle has a remedy against its horizontal competitors in the 2 (a) of the Robinson-Patman Act and allow price cutting sales or discriminatory sales to third persons?"
1966.101,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,923.447,925.159,I think that's right.
1966.101,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,933.554,936.063,"So it's a primary line case, that's --"
1966.101,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,936.063,937.992,That's right.
1966.101,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,937.992,955.356,"Well, in the -- I take it you say that -- that the -- it's just irrelevant in the FTC proceedings what the Commission is doing -- these are the competitors and it may properly refuse to even listen to the arguments?"
1966.101,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,955.356,982.209,"I think the Commission under this Court's decision in Moog has some serious responsibilities which are its responsibilities, but which are not essentially reviewable, that is if it proceeds on a -- as long as it proceeds without reference to consideration that have no rational relation to a legitimate enforcement policy, I know --"
1966.101,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,982.209,990.033,But what if this sentence is -- what if -- what if this sentence brief can -- we just aren't interested in finding out what your competitors are doing.
1966.101,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1011.594,1026.714,"I should think that the Commission is entitled to decide that it will proceed against a few firms in many industries or many firms in the few industries or lone firm, in each industry that that's a legitimate policy that it could --"
1966.101,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1026.714,1034.767,So there is that -- there isn't anything than this -- very little that anything it could do with respect to this question it would be an abuse of discretion.
1966.101,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1034.767,1048.366,I -- I believe that the sorts of allegations that Rundle has made are on their face not the sort of allegation that can constitute a patent abuse of discretion --
1966.101,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1048.366,1050.205,Such as mentioned in Moog?
1966.101,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1050.205,1053.498,That's right.
1966.101,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1070.581,1078.512,"So now you think that Moog, from its words in Moog, industry is meant?"
1966.101,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1078.512,1098.675,"Well, I think there are probably more -- there are probably other examples that could be found, but I do think that the words in Moog were a sort of saving clause dropped in the -- in the opinion against the possibilities that someday a very outrageous case would arise."
1966.101,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1098.675,1102.02,Or some members of this Court may phrase it a little different?
1966.101,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1102.02,1105.571,Yes.
1966.101,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1250.283,1252.662,How do you get that immunity?
1966.101,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1252.662,1253.013,Well --
1966.101,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1253.013,1256.297,What do you mean when you said it's likely to immunizing?
1966.101,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1256.297,1276.537,"If pursuant to the instructions to conduct an investigation, the Commission called to testify any officer who is a defendant in this proceeding, in these criminal proceedings, he may well under Section 9 of the Federal Trade Commission Act obtain immunity."
1966.101,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1276.537,1280.905,I don't know that the Commission usually precedes with this?
1966.101,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1280.905,1281.947,"Well, all I know --"
1966.101,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1281.947,1289.22,And why -- why would they have to call these people for re-trial and the examination?
1966.101,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1289.22,1295.941,"Somewhat to the antitrust divisions should win perhaps, they didn't call in the Rundle case -- Rundle's vice president who has now moved to dismiss the --"
1966.101,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1295.941,1296.11,Or --
1966.101,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1296.11,1296.616,-- the indictment (Voice Overlap)
1966.101,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1296.616,1299.705,-- when they exchanged to the proceeding?
1966.101,0,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,1299.705,1307.039,"Well, but -- presumably, the investigation of the interest only is to culminates in a proceeding."
1966.101,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1514.545,1518.198,Mr. McAleer.
1966.101,1,24294,frank_c_mcaleer,,1518.198,1522.974,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.101,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1738.713,1758.184,May I ask if -- if the procedures of all six of those competitors that you speak of in regard to less than truckload quantities were identically to those or that of Rundle?
1966.101,1,24294,frank_c_mcaleer,,1758.184,1770.85,We alleged Mr. Justice Warren that the -- that the discounts that the competitors granted were done in the same manner as Universal-Rundle granted its discounts.
1966.101,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1770.85,1774.245,Then your answer â€“ your answer is that they weren't identical?
1966.101,1,24294,frank_c_mcaleer,,1774.245,1777.241,"That is our contention, yes sir."
1966.101,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3735.242,3736.007,"I'm not sure, I'm --"
1966.101,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3736.007,3739.148,Would you address yourself to that particular point just for a moment?
1966.101,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3739.148,3742.664,I'm not sure -- I'm -- if I have exactly which point it was.
1966.101,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3742.664,3743.514,"Well, alright."
1966.101,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3743.514,3743.854,I'm sorry.
1966.101,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3743.854,3746.609,"Proceed on your own, then."
1966.101,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3746.609,3758.923,I did want to address myself to one question they raise and that is the I -- the question of the identity of the systems that these six or seven companies were using.
1966.101,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3787.305,3802.062,"Mr. Rifkind, is there any provision in the statute that requires the Federal Trade Commission to conduct an investigation upon petition with or without any showing?"
1966.101,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3810.226,3811.651,"I think that's right, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1966.101,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3811.651,3818.202,"But there is a provision in the statute, Section 11 under which this proceeding was brought."
1966.101,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3826.786,3827.56,Correct.
1966.101,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3827.56,3835.503,"And it talks about a complaint against a person and that is to say an individual complaint, is that right?"
1966.101,2,40274,robert_s_rifkind,,3835.503,3838.787,That's right.
