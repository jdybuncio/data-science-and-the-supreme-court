2002.01-1067,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,7.059,The Court will hear argument in United States against the White Mountain Apache Tribe.
2002.01-1067,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,8.34,17.999,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1067,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,27.249,31.336,What condition was it in in 1960?
2002.01-1067,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,36.454,38.206,"--Well, it... it's certainly much older today."
2002.01-1067,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,89.292,98.458,--making use today of a portion of the structures there for the school and administrative needs?
2002.01-1067,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,98.458,99.945,"Absolutely, Justice O'Connor."
2002.01-1067,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,109.537,114.45,Are those maintained in some fashion for that use by the Federal Government?
2002.01-1067,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,114.45,114.904,--They are.
2002.01-1067,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,139.425,145.536,"Well, the U.S. Government does hold the property in trust for the tribe... the White Mountain Tribe."
2002.01-1067,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,145.946,146.772,That's true.
2002.01-1067,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,148.153,156.226,"And what basic responsibility does that entail, would you say, the fact that the Government is a trustee?"
2002.01-1067,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,156.226,164.028,"--Well, when Congress places land in trust for Indians, it has two well-settled meanings that this Court has recognized."
2002.01-1067,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,198.663,205.805,But there was an enormous difference in that case in that the Indians managed the land.
2002.01-1067,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,222.606,239.037,"Justice Ginsburg, that... that may be true in the factual sense, but the 1960 act... that is, that the Federal Government is using the property, but the 1960 act... quite unlike the General Allotment Act... specifically reserves to the Government the right to use the property for Government uses."
2002.01-1067,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,252.866,256.127,Can you just explain one small point to... to me?
2002.01-1067,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,265.536,271.481,"Well, I... I think generally, the ""administrative use"" can refer to executive uses, and is a very broad term."
2002.01-1067,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,305.25,310.451,"Mr. Garre, is... is any of the... or let me ask you an open-ended question."
2002.01-1067,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,320.482,327.254,"--Oh, well, our position would be that the vast majority, if not all, was... well, that's not true."
2002.01-1067,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,351.706,362.852,"Well, is the tribe making... is the tribe making a monetary claim with respect to property which it has had in its control, as distinct from the Government's, during this period?"
2002.01-1067,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,362.852,385.886,"--If you look at appendix A to the tribe's complaint, which... which has a detailed building-by-building analysis of the ways in which the building don't meet certain requirements, I think it's fair to say the tribe's damages claim extends to all the buildings at Fort Apache and that, therefore, it may extend to buildings over which the Federal Government is not... have any active use or... or control."
2002.01-1067,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,393.111,393.399,No.
2002.01-1067,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,395.424,408.343,"Under the Tucker Act... and this Court emphasized it in the Mitchell decisions, and it's emphasized it in other decisions... a substantive right to damages against the United States... which, after all, is a right to damages against the public fisc... has to be grounded in a source of substantive law."
2002.01-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,408.343,411.687,"Well, if... can we talk just for a moment about the analogy?"
2002.01-1067,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,427.496,429.687,That... that's true.
2002.01-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,429.687,433.152,And that... that didn't seem to figure into your argument.
2002.01-1067,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,438.065,438.453,Well--
2002.01-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,438.453,446.288,Is that because the trustee here is both the beneficiary... is... is a co-beneficiary of the trust?
2002.01-1067,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,446.288,460.727,"--That is true and it's much unlike the typical common law trust, but the... the most fundamental reason, Justice Kennedy, is we don't think that a court should have to plumb through the common law to determine whether or not Congress established a right to damages against the United States in this case."
2002.01-1067,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,473.071,475.877,"Well, but that... but, I mean, that's the whole purpose of the Tucker Act."
2002.01-1067,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,479.182,481.29,That's exactly the question before us.
2002.01-1067,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,481.29,488.925,"--Well, and I agree, Justice Scalia, and we think that that question should be answered by looking to the act of Congress on which the tribe relies, which is the 1960 act."
2002.01-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,488.925,501.806,"Well, but it would have seemed to me, following Justice Scalia's question and my own, that if the law of trusts gave a clear indication one way or the other that there was a liability, then the Tucker Act analysis might... might be different accordingly."
2002.01-1067,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,501.806,503.497,"With respect, I disagree."
2002.01-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,564.071,568.058,Do you think the Government could have just destroyed the property or the structures on the land?
2002.01-1067,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,568.058,576.231,"Well, I... Justice Stevens, I think that the notion that the Government would destroy the property, if it did so in a way that was clearly inconsistent with the terms of the act--"
2002.01-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,576.231,577.429,Let me put it another way.
2002.01-1067,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,579.825,587.171,"--That... that duty, if it exists, comes from ordinary tort principles and from principles of just compensation under the Fifth Amendment."
2002.01-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,598.317,598.855,"No, I understand."
2002.01-1067,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,612.889,616.893,"--Not under... under the 1960 act, the statute in this case."
2002.01-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,617.636,621.434,"But did they... from any source, did they have a duty not to destroy it?"
2002.01-1067,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,621.434,623.663,"--I... I think... I think it would, Justice Stevens."
2002.01-1067,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,625.975,629.486,"You'd help me if you responded yes or no, to be honest with you."
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,1825.138,1828.482,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1872.942,1879.751,But the control... the control here was not control given for the benefit of the tribe.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,1901.754,1903.983,"Justice Scalia, I respectfully disagree."
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1903.983,1905.469,Administrative purposes.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,1905.469,1917.979,"The... the benefit to the tribe... Congress stripped the United States of all fee simple, absolute title and gave 100 percent beneficial title to the tribe."
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1943.159,1945.638,I thought the fort was to protect white settlers.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,1947.783,1949.269,"Well, it was to protect white settlers--"
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1949.269,1949.558,Okay.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,1949.558,1953.645,"--but from my clients' viewpoint, it was established to conquer them."
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1955.518,1955.973,"Yes, I understand."
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,1955.973,1957.459,And there was a benefit.
2002.01-1067,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1967.201,1969.059,I... I want to make I understand your argument.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,1983.071,1983.798,--Absolutely none.
2002.01-1067,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1985.617,1986.36,Why?
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2003.367,2008.568,"--Justice Kennedy, if I understood your question, I thought you meant before March 18, 1960 when they owned it--"
2002.01-1067,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2008.568,2008.734,"No, no."
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2009.81,2010.303,--Oh.
2002.01-1067,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2010.303,2023.928,"I thought your initial argument was that after 1960, once the Government took control by, i.e.... by that I thought you meant possessing the buildings--"
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2023.928,2024.504,Occupying.
2002.01-1067,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2024.504,2029.584,"--it had a duty, but that if it had not possessed the buildings or occupied the buildings, it would have no duty."
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2029.584,2031.646,"Yes, that is true."
2002.01-1067,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2034.412,2035.405,I... I just don't understand that.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2035.405,2039.325,--They occupied and physically controlled the buildings.
2002.01-1067,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2070.699,2078.911,"Well, since 1960, did the U.S. use some of the buildings other than it's now using?"
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2078.911,2085.764,"--Yes, and the reason that they have fallen off from use is because the enrollment went from 500 students down to about 80."
2002.01-1067,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2085.764,2092.991,"Well, if there are 35 buildings on the premises, how many did the Government use since 1960?"
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2092.991,2095.303,The Government used all of the buildings.
2002.01-1067,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2095.925,2096.501,All of them.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2096.501,2097.244,Yes.
2002.01-1067,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2097.244,2099.723,Physically occupied all 35?
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2099.723,2102.695,"Yes, they did, and they used them for storage and for schools."
2002.01-1067,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2102.695,2104.347,Since 1960.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2104.347,2104.886,Yes.
2002.01-1067,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2108.196,2111.862,And now it physically occupies 4 of the 35.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2111.862,2115.577,--Four for school and about six for its administrative use.
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2115.577,2122.469,"Mr. Brauchli, would you give me your view on the hypothetical that I asked your... your colleague on the other side?"
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2167.423,2178.159,"If... if the land is being... as I understand the question, you... you are leaving this to Falls Church and as a beneficiary--"
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2178.159,2179.023,It's a lot.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2196.856,2197.682,--That is not our situation--
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2197.682,2198.797,Is that a lawsuit?
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2198.797,2201.648,--I don't know because--
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2201.648,2203.134,"Well, but that's crucial to your case here--"
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2203.134,2203.317,--I don't--
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2203.317,2204.432,--it seems to me.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2204.432,2205.053,"--Well, I don't think--"
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2205.053,2209.633,I think it goes to the point of whether a public trust is the same thing as a private trust.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2209.633,2210.709,"--Well, this is a private trust."
2002.01-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2214.174,2233.287,"Even if it were, I guess the real analogy would be it goes to the City of Falls Church to be held in trust for the public to be used as a school for as long as they want it, and thereafter to go to the archeological society for preservation."
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2249.034,2250.708,--or that it goes to the Indians afterwards.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2251.618,2257.917,"--Justice Scalia, I think you're saying that... you're talking about a situation where the beneficiary doesn't do anything with the property."
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2272.811,2272.944,I'm not talking about destroying it.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2272.944,2274.513,"--beneficiary of Falls Church, that's our situation."
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2274.513,2274.646,Yes.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2297.676,2298.419,And they're a trustee.
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2298.419,2309.48,"And... and I don't know of any lawsuits in which in such a situation a citizen could say, you know, I'm... I'm a citizen of Falls Church, and you are wasting my... my trust estate."
2002.01-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2309.48,2311.255,No.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2327.397,2344.116,"I don't... I think there's a different... there's... this Court unanimously last term in the Klamath case said that the fiduciary relationship, the trust relationship, between the United States and the tribes is the primary cornerstone of Indian law."
2002.01-1067,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2352.205,2359.719,But does that... does that extend to a requirement that the United States spend its monies rather than the tribe's monies to preserve the land?
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2386.756,2387.871,--Yes.
2002.01-1067,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2388.902,2390.183,At its expense?
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2390.183,2390.843,Yes.
2002.01-1067,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2390.843,2392.989,What... what authority do you have for that?
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2392.989,2393.444,Because they--
2002.01-1067,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2393.444,2400.502,That's... that's certainly not a... a trustee doesn't have the duty to repair at his own expense in... in a private trust.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2400.502,2416.189,"--Well, this is not a... I... the United States, if they are... the beneficiary is the tribe, and I think when you have a trustee in control and occupying, they... according to the treatises I read... read, there's an absolute obligation to protect and preserve the beneficiary."
2002.01-1067,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2416.189,2419.161,Not at the trustee's own expense.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2432.702,2435.963,"Well, I just disagree with that."
2002.01-1067,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2437.039,2439.39,"Well, you'd have to have some authority."
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2443.271,2443.727,--Okay.
2002.01-1067,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2453.552,2454.13,All right.
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2454.751,2455.782,--Waste... waste is different.
2002.01-1067,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2455.782,2455.782,If your answer to me--
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2455.782,2460.983,"--Waste is different from doing something that costs money, and the money has to come from somewhere."
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2471.18,2473.205,"--No, but they did appropriate money--"
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2473.205,2480.097,So you're... you're urging then that ordinary trust law does not apply in the case of a public trust.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2480.097,2485.026,"--Well, I think that the trust relationship between the United States and Indian tribes is sui generis."
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2485.026,2485.587,Okay.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2485.587,2489.468,You cannot import the common law wholesale into a... this type of situation.
2002.01-1067,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2489.468,2508.871,"Based on your answer you gave to me about the hypothetical about the erosion occurring, it... it would seem to me that if the United States has an affirmative duty in that case, the fact that it occupied or didn't occupy the buildings does not alter its duty to keep those buildings in repair."
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2511.305,2511.843,Well--
2002.01-1067,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2511.843,2515.065,--because in my hypothetical they didn't occupy or use the land.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2515.065,2526.498,"--Well, the complaint is for... for damage to the infrastructure for failure to keep up the... the water and sewer system, the electrical system, as well as the buildings that they used and controlled."
2002.01-1067,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2528.561,2547.759,"But if they didn't... in Justice Kennedy's question, if the United States didn't use it for administrative and school purposes, then the United States, under the terms of the trust, has no right to hold it because they have this exclusive right of occupancy only for those purposes."
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2553.619,2561.05,"It expires and they... they said that in the court of appeals below that the... the circuit judges said, well, can you use it as a uranium dump?"
2002.01-1067,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2581.029,2585.283,"Yes, but I'm not sure you confront the question, and I'm not sure what the answer is."
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2601.341,2605.223,"Well, I think in this case the United States was obligated to prevent the deterioration."
2002.01-1067,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2611.805,2616.74,Could the United States have used trust assets to perform that duty?
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2616.74,2623.799,"I think they should use their own assets since they're using it rent-free, and they should protect the property because they have--"
2002.01-1067,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2623.799,2625.164,You're saying they should use it.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2630.115,2633.253,"--Yes, the United States' assets."
2002.01-1067,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2634.945,2636.059,That's not my question.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2636.059,2636.968,"--Oh, you mean the trust assets."
2002.01-1067,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2640.478,2640.932,Could they cut--
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2640.932,2641.221,--for some of the buildings.
2002.01-1067,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2641.221,2646.672,"--Could they cut down some trees and say, we're going to sell off some timber because we've got to raise some money to fix the roof?"
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2652.366,2653.769,Of the tribe's timber?
2002.01-1067,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2653.769,2654.141,Yes.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2654.141,2658.394,I would say they cannot do that without the tribe's permission.
2002.01-1067,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2658.394,2665.452,So it's literally got to come out of a pocket of the National Government which has no relation to the tribe's assets is what you're saying.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2665.452,2666.029,That's what I'm saying.
2002.01-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2666.029,2669.456,Suppose you... you rent... it's rather interesting.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2696.472,2696.844,Well--
2002.01-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2696.844,2703.493,--the trustee is both the trustee and the third party himself because he's using it for his own purposes.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2703.493,2708.96,"--Well, under landlord and tenant law, the tenant would certainly be liable for the waste, and this Court said that in the Bostwick case."
2002.01-1067,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2708.96,2711.916,Would the tenant have to repair the holes in the roof?
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2711.916,2713.031,The tenant would be responsible.
2002.01-1067,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2741.842,2744.339,What precisely are you asking for?
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2754.391,2765.703,I think the measure of damages would be against the measuring stick of a reasonable trustee in like circumstances in total control of the trust corpus of his beneficiary.
2002.01-1067,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2774.619,2780.48,--So it would be... that... that would be the... 14 million-dollar figure to bring it up to code?
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2780.48,2795.137,"Well, that was been altered because the tribe has engaged in a little self-help, and we actually took over five... five buildings, and we had a grant from the White House Save America's Treasures and the National Endowment of the Humanities and the State of Arizona, and the tribe put 2 million of their own dollars."
2002.01-1067,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2796.706,2804.015,But you're still... what you're talking about is what it would cost to bring this up to historic building preservation level?
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2804.015,2805.129,--Not necessarily.
2002.01-1067,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2842.918,2844.1,What... what is this code?
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2851.94,2859.082,"--Well, the Bureau of Indian Affairs usually uses the General Services Administration and the Uniform Building Code or the Uniform Code of Building Conservation."
2002.01-1067,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2859.991,2860.901,--But is that what you--
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2860.901,2861.14,--Yes.
2002.01-1067,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2861.14,2862.255,--Is that what you're referring to--
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2862.255,2862.438,Right.
2002.01-1067,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2862.438,2863.369,"--when you say, the code?"
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2863.369,2863.907,Right.
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2874.188,2874.847,Mr. Brauchli--
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2874.847,2875.303,Yes.
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2875.303,2881.74,--I'm... I'm confused about... about these buildings that... that have basketball-sized holes in the roof.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2884.591,2885.334,"No, they have not."
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2888.018,2889.587,"Well, then they're not using them anymore."
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2890.33,2890.68,"Right, and that's--"
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2890.68,2899.618,"--that they have... if they're not using them, you can't say that they're in control of them, and that their being in control requires them to make the repairs."
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2900.361,2900.733,--No.
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2900.733,2906.305,"--Under... under the... under the statute, they're not required to use the buildings."
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2925.047,2927.732,Let me clarify something.
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2927.732,2928.596,All right.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2928.596,2934.502,"The... the buildings... when the need expires, their right to be there expires."
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2963.07,2964.118,And what did the Government say?
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2966.701,2969.839,"They said... oh, they... they want to give us the buildings."
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2969.839,2970.128,Okay.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2970.128,2971.242,"They said, you can't have the money."
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2971.242,2979.704,"Well, that's exactly right, it seems to me, if the only theory on which they're obliged to repair them is that they're in control of them."
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,2987.467,2999.932,"They don't own them, and under Mitchell II, this Court said that when the United States is in control of a... of a resource of a tribe, a... a fiduciary relationship is established in respect to that resource."
2002.01-1067,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2999.932,3016.567,"No, but isn't your argument that they... I... I'm not saying whether you win or lose on it, but isn't your argument that they are obliged to give us the money to repair them because the deterioration took place when they were in control?"
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,3016.567,3016.9,Yes.
2002.01-1067,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3016.9,3017.765,Isn't that your point?
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,3017.765,3022.102,"That is my point which I did not apparently express very well, but that is the point that--"
2002.01-1067,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3022.102,3028.351,You mean they... they were still using those buildings when the... when the basketball-sized holes in the roofs appeared?
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,3028.351,3033.802,--They were using the buildings as the progressive... it's not a Big Bang Theory about a building falling down.
2002.01-1067,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3131.512,3131.967,Mr. Brauchli--
2002.01-1067,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3132.184,3134.113,--can I ask this factual question?
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,3140.057,3145.22,"It is different depending on the building, and that's why we say we have to go building-by-building."
2002.01-1067,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3177.337,3180.681,Do you have a theory on when their active use of the buildings ceased?
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,3180.681,3186.625,--It's... it goes... it really does have to go by building-by-building because I would say that--
2002.01-1067,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3186.625,3189.559,Give me any building.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,3191.4,3192.214,"--in the last 5, 6."
2002.01-1067,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3195.625,3201.365,And your theory is that the... the waste occurred before or after they ceased using some... or some of each?
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,3201.365,3202.851,--It's... it's some of each.
2002.01-1067,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3239.631,3246.318,"Well, is it... let... may I also get clear on something that I... I thought I was clear on but I'm not."
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,3268.033,3268.321,Yes.
2002.01-1067,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3273.538,3273.721,No.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,3282.183,3289.225,It was the date when they relinquished control and we accepted it because we refused to accept them without the money to repair them.
2002.01-1067,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3289.225,3290.422,Okay.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,3290.422,3291.248,And they're--
2002.01-1067,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3291.248,3298.967,"So you're saying during part of the period in which the... the property was just boarded up, their responsibility was still in effect."
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,3298.967,3306.48,"--Yes, because they still kept them on their facility inventory maintenance list, but they didn't get... they get the maintenance money and they use it for other things other than the--"
2002.01-1067,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3306.48,3310.567,"Suppose in... suppose in 1960 the Government said, here are the buildings."
2002.01-1067,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3310.567,3311.188,We don't want them.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,3322.167,3326.542,"--Are you talking about after March 18th, or before--"
2002.01-1067,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3326.542,3330.052,This is after the 1960 act was enacted and they had become the trustee.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,3330.052,3335.83,"--If they never physically occupied those buildings or they stopped using them, it's not their liability."
2002.01-1067,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3362.086,3365.18,Can... can the Government terminate this trust anytime it wants?
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,3365.18,3365.718,--Pardon?
2002.01-1067,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3365.718,3369.35,Can the Government terminate this trust anytime it wants by executive order?
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,3369.35,3374.551,"No, it cannot because the executive branch does not have the power to terminate this reservation."
2002.01-1067,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3375.294,3375.954,That's... that's what I thought.
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,3377.69,3386.151,"But it's... it'd be only a bare trust, Your... Your Honor, because if... once they... once they relinquish the control and the need is not there, their liability ends."
2002.01-1067,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3394.204,3399.155,What... what of the Government's argument that this was really an illusory trust?
2002.01-1067,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3399.155,3411.044,"That is, the statute, the 1960 statute, gave the Government the right to use this for... for school and administrative purposes as long as they wanted to."
2002.01-1067,1,38686,robert_c_brauchli,,3420.332,3429.21,"Well, the... to answer that question, Your Honor, the measure of damages always could be measured against a reasonable trustee."
2002.01-1067,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3509.298,3511.444,"Thank you, Mr. Brauchli."
2002.01-1067,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3514.166,3516.19,"Thank you, Justice Stevens."
