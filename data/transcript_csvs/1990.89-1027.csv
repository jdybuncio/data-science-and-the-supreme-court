1990.89-1027,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,14.051,"We'll hear argument next in No. 89-1027, Norfolk and Western Railway Company v. American Train Dispatchers Association and a companion case."
1990.89-1027,0,29240,jeffrey_s_berlin,,45.391,47.582,"Either way is fine, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.89-1027,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1203.959,1218.128,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1027,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1252.031,1256.623,"Well, one wouldn't have to read it that way as an original proposition had it not been for Schwabacher."
1990.89-1027,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1265.569,1269.141,"Well, with all respect, Your Honor, I think that that would be a difficult proposition."
1990.89-1027,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1313.931,1316.973,One of the issues in that case was what did the State law require.
1990.89-1027,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1316.973,1319.356,"--Not exactly, Your Honor."
1990.89-1027,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1333.576,1338.358,Even if the amount were greater than the reasonable value of the shares in the exchange.
1990.89-1027,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1338.358,1338.859,--That is correct.
1990.89-1027,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1338.859,1341.911,And there had been no determination of whether they would be entitled to it or not.
1990.89-1027,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1341.911,1342.762,That is correct.
1990.89-1027,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1354.679,1359.734,It would be dispositive of the State law question of whether they're entitled to 100 cents on the dollar on the accrued dividends.
1990.89-1027,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1359.734,1364.607,--What it would effectively do is prevent them from enforcing their contractual rights under State law.
1990.89-1027,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1473.148,1476.331,May I ask you a question similar to the one I asked the... Mr. Berlin?
1990.89-1027,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1476.331,1476.611,"--Yes, sir."
1990.89-1027,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1476.611,1485.527,"Supposing one of the two railroads had long-terms leases on its executive offices and they wanted to consolidate their executive offices, could they cancel the lease?"
1990.89-1027,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1485.527,1488.959,It depends... the Commission looks at this in two parts.
1990.89-1027,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1488.959,1490.181,"Well, what does the statute provide?"
1990.89-1027,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1490.181,1498.446,"Well, the Commission... the statute provides that they would be exempt from their enforcement of those contracts to the extent necessary to carry out the transaction."
1990.89-1027,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1498.446,1505.521,"Well, let's assume it's necessary and just the same number of dollar savings that you get out of consolidating two car repair facilities."
1990.89-1027,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1505.521,1507.663,"Well, the Commission will look at this in two steps."
1990.89-1027,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1516.659,1520.802,Not interpreting the contract... how do you interpret the transact without interpreting the contract?
1990.89-1027,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1520.802,1523.754,"Well, the contract... you're talking about--"
1990.89-1027,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1523.754,1531.11,"In other words, the contract doesn't provide for the cancellation on my executive office leases and this contract doesn't provide for the consolidation of the car repair facilities, does it?"
1990.89-1027,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1531.11,1536.823,--The... it was a finding by the arbitrator that in fact the transaction did contemplate--
1990.89-1027,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1536.823,1537.613,"Well, I understand it contemplated it."
1990.89-1027,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1540.477,1545.279,"--As part of the transaction, no, but I do not believe that's necessary and the Commission does not believe that that's necessary."
1990.89-1027,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1550.585,1555.95,--Supposing they could prove that they contemplated merging the office space in the two headquarters' offices?
1990.89-1027,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1555.95,1556.591,"--Well, that's--"
1990.89-1027,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1556.591,1558.192,But there's nothing said about it in the contract.
1990.89-1027,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1558.192,1562.245,--There's nothing... this again is a matter that the arbitrator decided in this case.
1990.89-1027,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1564.115,1565.307,"Well, what's your view about my hypothetical?"
1990.89-1027,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1565.307,1569.38,My view of your hypothetical is that this would be submitted to the appropriate tribunal.
1990.89-1027,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1574.463,1582.268,"Well, what if appropriate tribunal decides whether the lease on some property on Wall Street is part of the transaction?"
1990.89-1027,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1582.268,1589.514,"--Well, the... tribunal is going to make that determination by looking at the terms of the transaction, implied and in fact."
1990.89-1027,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1589.514,1589.634,What tribunal?
1990.89-1027,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1590.813,1594.586,It will be the tribunal that has been asked to enforce the contract lease most likely.
1990.89-1027,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1595.828,1597.158,Like the New York State Court would do.
1990.89-1027,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1597.158,1598.7,"--New York State Court, for example."
1990.89-1027,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1616.881,1627.45,"Well, didn't the arbitration committee decide that this shop consolidation was actually authorized by the Commission's 1980 order?"
1990.89-1027,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1627.45,1632.163,"Yes, they did imply they found it implied in the terms of the transaction."
1990.89-1027,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1632.864,1634.316,"Well, then the Commission affirmed that."
1990.89-1027,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1634.316,1635.935,--And the Commission did affirm that as well.
1990.89-1027,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1635.935,1641.2,So this was actually contemplated or authorized by our 1980 order.
1990.89-1027,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1641.2,1645.192,"Yes, and the court of appeals did not reach that issue, so it's not part of this case."
1990.89-1027,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1647.104,1649.064,"Well, so as it comes to us, it was authorized?"
1990.89-1027,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1649.064,1650.276,"--Yes, that is correct."
1990.89-1027,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1689.484,1692.076,"Thank you, Mr. Minear."
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,1693.067,1697.158,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1027,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1804.93,1815.285,I think the railroad said that the... is it their position that the protective provisions don't apply at all if they win?
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,1821.98,1824.411,"--They will, but strip them of their contract rights--"
1990.89-1027,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1824.411,1832.439,"--Isn't the real issue whether they not only can transfer the work, but transfer the employees to the new location?"
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,1832.439,1835.55,"--No, I don't think that's the issue, Your Honor."
1990.89-1027,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1836.971,1837.552,"Well, it was, though."
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,1838.584,1858.826,"--No, the issue about the transfer, which was tried before the arbitrators in both cases, and in both cases the arbitrators found that these transfers were authorized by the Commission, because the Commission said they were authorized by the Commission and the arbitrators considered themselves an agent."
1990.89-1027,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1858.826,1869.204,--The first part of my question was do you understand the railroads to contend that the protective provisions do not apply in the sense that they object to 6 months... 6 years' worth of pay?
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,1869.204,1870.184,"No, Your Honor."
1990.89-1027,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1870.184,1870.574,"No, they do not."
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,1870.574,1870.945,No.
1990.89-1027,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1873.239,1878.795,"No, but they want to transfer... they want to transfer the employees to the new location so they can work."
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,1878.795,1889.251,"--Well, they want to absolve themselves of the contractual obligations they have under such as the Orange Book, which the arbitrator found they did not have to move."
1990.89-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1939.995,1946.821,If you have a labor contract that... would... with the rail unions that say there will be no consolidations of facilities.
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,1946.821,1947.739,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1947.739,1959.517,Then the ICC could decree mergers until the cows come home and nothing would happen except that technically there would be one company operating inefficiently instead of two.
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,1959.517,1963.881,"No, under the Railway Labor Act, Your Honor, there would... something would happen and what would happen--"
1990.89-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1963.881,1964.392,What would happen?
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,1964.392,1973.378,"--Well, it might take awhile but it would happen, and that would be that at the end of the procedures of the Railway Labor Act they could put whatever they wanted into effect."
1990.89-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1973.378,1976.099,At the end of the procedures of the Railway Labor Act?
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,1976.099,1977.959,They could put whatever they wanted into effect.
1990.89-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1995.593,2017.168,"But it is your position that all a railway labor union has to do is put in its contract with management that there shall be no consolidation of facilities without the consent of the union and, in effect, whatever the ICC decrees, no matter how specific it gets for that matter about a merger or a consolidation, it will not be effective because it cannot override that contractual obligation."
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2017.168,2018.6,"--Your Honor, in the first place, I think--"
1990.89-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2018.6,2019.408,I think it can take a yes or no.
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2021.031,2021.381,"--No, it is not."
1990.89-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2021.381,2021.742,All right.
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2023.041,2036.842,"It's not my position because if you had a contract, I would judge, that was directly opposed to an order of the Commission, you could override the contract as the court said the Congress could do in L&N against Motley when they outlawed passes."
1990.89-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2048.369,2049.791,I don't understand.
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2050.971,2060.918,"Well, there's an obligation... a contract obligation as this Court said in L&N against Motley... that they might not... they might take away specific performance, but they just can't wipe out all--"
1990.89-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2060.918,2071.674,"Oh, I see, so what you're saying is, well, the new company would be permitted to merge facilities as the ICC has said but they will have to pay compensation to the union for that."
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2071.674,2073.545,--They would have to go back and make that determination--
1990.89-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2073.545,2079.219,"Which would probably be compensation in the amount of the efficiency that they were trying to eliminate, right?"
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2083.623,2089.947,"--Well, you have to look at... 11347 requires two things it seems to me."
1990.89-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2104.937,2109.411,"Well, to the extent that that governs, I don't think the railroads are arguing that they aren't bound by that."
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2125.77,2126.712,It can.
1990.89-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2126.712,2129.223,"Well, not without compensation."
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2129.393,2131.095,"Not without compensation, correct."
1990.89-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2131.556,2133.739,"--Okay, you want to say it can be eliminated with compensation."
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2135.702,2137.202,I think there's a constitutional difference--
1990.89-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2137.202,2139.175,"I mean, you could buy back anything from the unions."
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2142.675,2143.256,--If it will sell [inaudible] so sure.
1990.89-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2143.606,2145.189,ICC for that.
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2145.189,2164.26,"It is our position rather that it is the overall view of Congress in regulating rail transportation was to ensure the adequate, safe, efficient, and uninterrupted flow of interstate commerce by rail and to accomplish that, the Congress enacted three basic statutes and a number of ancillary statutes."
1990.89-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2396.358,2403.874,"Mr. Mahoney, can I ask you something about section 11347?"
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2403.874,2404.565,"Yes, sir."
1990.89-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2404.565,2424.229,I had assumed that the reason it provides that the arrangement and the order approving the transaction must require that the employees of the affected rail carrier will not be in a worse position related to their employment as a result of the transaction during the 4 years following the effective date.
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2437.417,2440.809,"We're not and they never were and they never had been, Your Honor."
1990.89-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2440.809,2441.19,What... what--
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2441.19,2446.976,"What they meant was they could abolish jobs, could always abolish jobs, cut back your work forces--"
1990.89-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2446.976,2454.871,"--Even if you had a contractual... I mean, if there were a commitment to have so many jobs on a particular run?"
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2454.871,2456.901,"--Oh, no, Your Honor."
1990.89-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2456.901,2457.242,No?
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2457.242,2457.622,No.
1990.89-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2515.962,2516.112,I see.
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2540.579,2541.847,"--No, it doesn't mean that."
1990.89-1027,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2548.533,2564.934,"Is the reading of the section that the railroad and the union can reach an agreement with respect to the effects of the merger on the employees, but that this is a minimum standard that the ICC must insist upon."
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2564.934,2565.794,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1027,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2565.794,2566.355,Is that what you're saying?
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2566.355,2567.016,That's exactly right.
1990.89-1027,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2613.571,2617.974,"Well, Mr. Mahoney, certainly the antitrust laws are set aside."
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2617.974,2619.214,"Oh, yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1027,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2622.166,2628.549,"Well, so why shouldn't all... well, why shouldn't all other law after the antitrust laws include other Federal laws?"
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2628.549,2635.695,"I think all... you can set aside all other law, but this you had to find first of all it seems to me an explicit conflict."
1990.89-1027,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2640.789,2644.401,Do you think... do you think in Schwabacher there was a conflict?
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2644.401,2647.563,"Not with any Federal law, Your Honor."
1990.89-1027,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2648.954,2649.425,"Well, was there a conflict with State law?"
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2649.425,2650.406,"It preempted that, yes."
1990.89-1027,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2650.406,2654.289,"Well, why shouldn't Federal law be equally preempted?"
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2654.289,2679.024,"Because where Congress has enacted complementary regimes of law to govern the same subject matter, such as rail transportation in the United States, it seems to me that before one of those can be interpreted to supersede or preempt the other, there should be... it should be a very clear conflict and no possible way of accommodating and allowing both of those laws to proceed."
1990.89-1027,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2679.024,2684.978,I can certainly understand the merit of that argument if neither law said anything with respect to the other.
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2695.667,2701.79,"That's true, Your Honor, but the... it's only exempt insofar as necessary to carry out an order as conditioned."
1990.89-1027,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2716.79,2723.263,But now you're not arguing the Railway Labor Act as having to be adjusted and compromised along with the ICA.
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2725.754,2726.655,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1027,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2726.655,2728.398,Those are two different arguments really.
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2728.398,2740.747,"Well, the railway... I'm saying that the Railway Labor Act as a separate regime is not invaded... cannot be invaded or should not be invaded by 11341 unless there's an absolute conflict that can't be avoided."
1990.89-1027,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2740.747,2740.917,Okay.
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2740.917,2753.506,"But at the same time if you're going to say that, yes, you can read 11341 that way, then you have to go to 11347 because 11340 exempts only those carriers in carrying out transactions as conditioned."
1990.89-1027,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2761.202,2763.212,But 11347 doesn't say that?
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2764.504,2767.136,11347 says--
1990.89-1027,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2767.136,2776.603,"What is the language that you... you told the Chief Justice that 11347 says that all existing and collective bargaining contracts have to be preserved, and I just don't see that in the section, unless I'm missing something."
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2776.603,2792.12,"--Section 11347, Your Honor, says that they must... that the Commission must impose as a minimum level of protection the protections that were imposed by the Secretary of Labor for the protection of employees in the Amtrak case, when Amtrak was created."
1990.89-1027,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2808.653,2810.583,But do those refer to the collective bargaining contracts?
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2810.583,2818.57,"They say... section 2 says they must be... preserve all collective bargaining and collective bargaining rights, privileges and benefits."
1990.89-1027,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2861.219,2868.285,"11347 just covers the period for 4 years after the date of the final action of the Commission, doesn't it?"
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2868.285,2868.763,No.
1990.89-1027,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2881.492,2889.627,"Well... didn't I... it must say that in something that's not before me, because although the first part certainly says 4 years."
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2889.627,2892.418,"The first part of what, Your Honor?"
1990.89-1027,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2892.418,2896.311,The first part of 11... unless I'm simply dealing with a typographical... 11347.
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2896.311,2902.446,11347 is... we've printed it out on page 4a of our appendix.
1990.89-1027,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2931.637,2939.311,"Yes, but then go on to the last sentence of 11347 at the top of page 5a of your appendix."
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2948.268,2948.928,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1027,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2949.469,2953.3,How long ago did the Commission act in this case?
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,2953.3,2966.489,"--The problem is... the Commission acted in this case in 1980, but here it says you not only have to impose... the conditions that were imposed before February 5, but the terms established under 405 of the Rail Passenger Service Act."
1990.89-1027,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3071.742,3075.432,"Not required them to stay, but required the railroad to keep them if they'd wanted."
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,3075.432,3076.193,Or prohibited them from moving.
1990.89-1027,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3100.19,3109.055,"Didn't the Commission say that the promise of lifetime employment was also abrogated, or not?"
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,3109.055,3111.367,"--Well, only if... no, if they moved."
1990.89-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3136.434,3139.466,"Mr. Gallagher, why isn't that one in that a separate section?"
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,3150.124,3150.795,That's correct.
1990.89-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3150.795,3158.139,"You're making the argument that under 11347, there is a specific preservation of those contractual arrangements."
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,3160.571,3162.013,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3163.045,3163.141,--had before it.
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,3163.141,3186.897,"--But all... my point is here that if you say that 11341, or lean to the proposition that 11341 supersedes contracts or overrides contracts, then you have to look at 11347, because 11347... 11341 only extends protections or exemptions to those carriers."
1990.89-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3186.897,3198.397,"So we could tell the court of appeals below you're wrong about 22341, remand, and tell them to consider 11347, if we think that 11341 says nothing about not impairing--"
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,3198.397,3200.099,"Well, that's correct, Your Honor, you could do that, Your Honor."
1990.89-1027,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3200.099,3200.24,--We could do that.
1990.89-1027,2,45689,william_g_mahoney,,3200.24,3213.229,"And unfortunately that, we think, would be a terribly unjust thing to do in these cases, simply because these people have been deprived of these rights for 5 years, 8 years, 10 years."
1990.89-1027,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3377.999,3379.631,"Thank you, Mr. Mahoney."
1990.89-1027,3,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,3382.003,3388.427,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
