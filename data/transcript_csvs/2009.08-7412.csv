2009.08-7412,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.654,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 08-7412, Graham v. Florida."
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,7.504,22.496,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Sentencing an adolescent to life without any possibility of parole condemns him to die in prison and rejects any hope that he will change for the better."
2009.08-7412,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,31.135,36.606,"Are you urging that in all cases, including homicide cases?"
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,39.208,64.942,"--We are -- we are drawing the line, Your Honor, at -- at non-homicide cases because we recognize under the Eighth Amendment that we must look at societal consensus, and society has said that murder is different and has said that in the sentencing practices, as demonstrated by the fact that outside of Florida judges and juries have imposed this sentence on just 30 non-homicide offenders in just 6 States."
2009.08-7412,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,64.942,67.894,"Thirty-eight States allow this sentence, though, don't they?"
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,67.894,68.244,Thirty--
2009.08-7412,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,68.244,69.827,"Thirty-eight, 39."
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,74.731,91.09,"--The vast majority allow it and they have for some time, and we believe that the fact that it has been allowed for so long and imposed so rarely, as the States themselves have admitted, is -- is strong evidence of societal consensus."
2009.08-7412,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,91.09,91.942,You're making a--
2009.08-7412,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,91.942,101.881,I would have thought that would be strong evidence that they appreciate the gravity of the sentence in the particular circumstances of juveniles and therefore only impose it rarely.
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,101.881,104.75,"Your Honor, I would -- I would disagree."
2009.08-7412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,116.725,119.677,No sentence can be -- can be imposed rarely?
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,119.677,121.545,"--No, Your Honor, it has to--"
2009.08-7412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,121.545,125.247,"When a sentence is imposed rarely, it becomes unconstitutional?"
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,125.247,125.997,"--No, Your Honor."
2009.08-7412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,125.997,127.047,That's not your position?
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,127.699,130.234,Our position is that you are looking at two things.
2009.08-7412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,142.839,144.125,--It doesn't make it crueler to him.
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,149.795,153.897,"We draw the line at 18, the same line that the Court drew in Roper."
2009.08-7412,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,158.035,160.435,"--And you are making a per se argument, no?"
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,197.643,200.128,"Your Honor, that's -- that's correct."
2009.08-7412,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,221.191,221.958,If we agree with you--
2009.08-7412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,221.958,222.81,And so if it's--
2009.08-7412,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,222.81,228.445,"--If we agree with you, at what point must the parole consideration be given?"
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,239.37,243.205,"Your Honor, our position is that it should be left up to the States to decide."
2009.08-7412,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,259.65,268.422,"What about -- what if it's the -- pursuant to the usual State parole system, and it turns out that grants parole to 1 out of 20 applicants?"
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,268.422,272.91,"I think all that would have to be required, Your Honor -- I think that would be sufficient."
2009.08-7412,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,293.305,301.31,"It seems to me that your -- your argument suggests that you are, quite rightly, focusing on the particular facts that have life without parole."
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,319.955,322.991,"--Your Honor, first, I'm -- I'm not conceding that with 50."
2009.08-7412,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,326.461,333.215,Are you saying there is something in the Eighth Amendment that draws a distinction between 40 and 50 in that case?
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,333.215,353.862,"--Your Honor, I'm saying that this sentence that we are here today before is unequivocally, unmistakably a condemnation that you will never be released from prison, and so this sentence clearly falls on the line of being cruel because it tells an adolescent, for an adolescent mistake, you can never live in civil society."
2009.08-7412,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,373.941,375.808,Is it a fact that--
2009.08-7412,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,375.808,381.279,I'm interested in -- in two different things and you can address them during the course of your argument.
2009.08-7412,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,417.869,418.352,--That's the other case.
2009.08-7412,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,418.352,418.887,Pardon me.
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,419.687,423.173,"With leave, I will let Mr. Stevenson answer about the procedural bar."
2009.08-7412,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,471.869,475.304,"But Florida has abolished parole, has it not, going forward?"
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,475.304,477.59,"--Going forward, it has abolished parole--"
2009.08-7412,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,477.59,485.594,"So eventually, if things are allowed to take their course, the Florida parole board will go out of business."
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,485.594,498.004,"--And Florida could choose to make that sentence and instead impose a sentence, as its prosecutor recommended here, a 30-year determinant sentence, if Florida doesn't want to reinstitute parole."
2009.08-7412,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,502.372,507.193,What -- what would you do if there were a crime spree and there were different jurisdictions?
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,513.429,536.729,"Well, Your -- Your Honor, I -- I think that the -- that you would get into the question about whether that sentence is the equivalent of life without parole, and there could be an argument made that if you -- obviously, if you sentence someone to 150, 200 years, there's no conceivable hope of ever release, 150 years without parole."
2009.08-7412,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,536.729,539.847,"So the second jurisdiction has the obligation, but not the first?"
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,540.597,563.279,"I would think that the -- if you had that -- I would think that the -- that the judge making that sentence would have to take that into consideration, that this sentence is going to -- based on all adolescent conduct -- it has to be all adolescent conduct, not if some of the conduct is post-juvenile."
2009.08-7412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,568.064,575.504,--So he -- he could sentence up to 1 year before the life expectancy of the -- of the person in prison?
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,576.42,579.722,"I -- I wouldn't say that would be okay, Your Honor."
2009.08-7412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,580.256,581.658,"Well, what's he supposed to do?"
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,582.891,583.943,--I think--
2009.08-7412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,583.943,584.543,--consecutive?
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,584.543,586.093,--I think there has to be some--
2009.08-7412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,586.093,588.359,There obviously does.
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,592.413,601.936,"--Your -- Your Honor, I think that would be coming so close to the -- the constitutional line, it would be -- it would be difficult to see that as constitutional, but -- but--"
2009.08-7412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,601.936,606.071,"Oh, 1 year before life is also unconstitutional?"
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,606.071,607.006,"--Your Honor, I'm--"
2009.08-7412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,607.006,608.289,Two years before life?
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,608.289,613.826,"--Your -- Your Honor, there would definitely be a -- a difficult line to draw at that case."
2009.08-7412,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,632.721,636.856,We have -- you are arguing for a categorical rule.
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,636.856,637.374,Yes.
2009.08-7412,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,637.374,642.326,"Your friend on the other side is arguing for a categorical rule, always permissible."
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,701.865,717.124,"Well, two things: First, Your Honor, Roper states, and the science -- states it based on the science, that at that age we cannot make a determination about whether or not the adolescent will or will not reform."
2009.08-7412,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,720.009,720.659,"Oh, I understand."
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,732.634,749.928,"Well, anywhere you draw the line, Your Honor, you're going to come up with an example where you are 1 day before or 1 day after, and the Court in Roper struggled with where to draw the line between maturity and immaturity, and it concluded, rightly so, to draw the line at 18 based on both the science and the legislative determinations."
2009.08-7412,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,749.928,752.963,"But that is because, as they told us, death is different."
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,768.323,771.275,I think it's because adolescents are different.
2009.08-7412,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,794.123,805.329,Is there any difference in the terms of incarceration making this harsher than otherwise?
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,822.774,830.546,"If I understand your question, would it be different if those type of programs are made available to life-without--"
2009.08-7412,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,830.546,834.081,"My question is, first, you say that they are not available."
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,834.081,834.614,--Yes.
2009.08-7412,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,834.614,835.281,Is that -- that's so?
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,835.281,836.95,"Yes, that is generally true."
2009.08-7412,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,867.736,872.539,So what are the terms of incarceration?
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,875.741,880.479,"Well, Your Honor, I think it varies obviously by facility by facility."
2009.08-7412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,910.598,914.3,I don't think -- the same kind of freedom that people on death row have?
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,914.783,924.091,"--Well, the State makes the point in their brief, Your Honor, that you have the right to exercise your religion, you have the -- you have the right to petition the courts."
2009.08-7412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,924.091,931.495,"--Aren't they released into the general population for exercise, for -- which I don't think death row inmates are."
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,931.495,935.899,"Your Honor, I -- obviously everything varies facility by facility, but it's--"
2009.08-7412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,935.899,937.266,"Well, I doubt whether this varies."
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,941.97,944.672,"--Well, I'm not -- I'm not -- you are correct."
2009.08-7412,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,959.931,999.306,"And why isn't the -- the most sensible way to deal with the problem that you are raising, the one that the Chief Justice suggested, to permit as-applied proportionality challenges that take into account the particular circumstances of the juvenile in question, rather than this per se rule that you are advocating, which would deprive the State of Florida from reaching the judgment that there are some -- there are some juveniles, some individuals who are short of their 18th birthday, who cannot -- who deserve imprisonment in -- life imprisonment without parole?"
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,1015.916,1018.099,I am not familiar with that particular case.
2009.08-7412,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1018.566,1026.288,Raping a woman in front of her 12-year-old son and then forcing the son to engage in sexual conduct with the mother.
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,1027.522,1029.24,"Yes, Your Honor, I am familiar with that case."
2009.08-7412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1079.422,1096.698,"You assume -- doesn't your argument assume that the only purpose of punishment is deterrence in the sense of protecting society from this person in the future, so that, you know, once that's no longer a problem, we should let this person out."
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,1120.214,1123.248,--We are not suggesting that it goes to the point of zero.
2009.08-7412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1136.323,1139.841,"Most States didn't -- don't think so, or many States don't think so."
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,1139.841,1147.864,"--Well, Your Honor, we -- but a Juvenile is -- not only does he have an inherent capacity to grow; he is less culpable."
2009.08-7412,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1177.8,1178.633,"Mr. Gowdy, can I ask this question?"
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,1178.633,1179.335,"Yes, Justice."
2009.08-7412,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1179.335,1189.708,"If your client in this case had been processed in the juvenile system instead of the adult system, what would the maximum penalty he could have received been?"
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,1189.708,1191.993,He would have had to have been released when he was 22 years.
2009.08-7412,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1191.993,1197.295,So the choice is between that short a term and an indefinite term?
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,1197.295,1199.147,"No, no, Your Honor."
2009.08-7412,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1225.314,1229.349,The logic in Roper was very straightforward.
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,1274.211,1286.435,"--Well, I guess we will come back to the point that I think life with parole would be a long sentence, and I don't -- I don't see how you can do it on a case-by-case basis at age 17."
2009.08-7412,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1288.018,1296.624,--Is there -- is there disproportionality review generally in Florida and particularly for juvenile offenders?
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,1296.624,1298.743,--There is no -- no.
2009.08-7412,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1308.864,1313.085,"Well, there wasn't prior to our death penalty jurisprudence, either."
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,1319.406,1320.039,Right.
2009.08-7412,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1324.81,1325.393,Yes.
2009.08-7412,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1325.393,1325.926,Right.
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,1325.926,1326.543,Can you--
2009.08-7412,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1326.543,1329.762,"Well, so did I, but we are talking about constitutionality under the Eighth Amendment--"
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,1329.762,1330.312,--Right.
2009.08-7412,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1330.312,1331.047,--which is Federal law.
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,1331.047,1338.451,"I guess a -- I know under Federal -- under Federal sentencing law, statutory law, there's a reasonableness review."
2009.08-7412,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1344.355,1352.758,"Yes, that's what I meant, whether you'd have to create a -- a procedure that does not exist in Florida for proportionality review."
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,1352.758,1354.96,"Well, there would -- it would have to be strictly Federal law."
2009.08-7412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1362.732,1366.184,"Oh, sure, but you can make that claim in Florida courts, can't you?"
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,1366.184,1367.034,--You can--
2009.08-7412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1367.034,1374.771,"Can't you argue in Florida courts that this sentence is disproportionate and violates the Eighth Amendment, whereupon the Florida courts would have to decide?"
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,1376.14,1377.773,--You -- you could make that argument.
2009.08-7412,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1399.019,1411.027,"But there is a problem with that argument in this case, because the sentencing judge made it quite plain that he was treating Graham as a recidivist, not as a first-time offender."
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,1442.898,1471.601,"--He -- he admitted to the police, and I don't want to get too much into the facts, but that -- but even if Your Honor concedes that he was convicted of all those crimes, which he was not convicted of, but the judge, as you say, correctly relied upon for this sentence, then we only have two States that we know of that have imposed life without parole for a recidivist robbery or burglary crime, and that's California and Florida."

2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,1506.339,1506.889,"--Well, you--"
2009.08-7412,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1506.889,1516.047,--to affirm a judgment that someone can't be -- can't be -- can't be rehabilitated?
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,1516.047,1520.915,"--There is not much difference, Your Honor, but the line has to be drawn somewhere."
2009.08-7412,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1526.485,1527.252,Well--
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,1527.252,1527.854,--as between the--
2009.08-7412,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1527.854,1535.191,A line has to be drawn somewhere only if we accept your approach that there has to be a categorical exemption.
2009.08-7412,0,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,1553.319,1559.74,--You -- I -- I think that the -- based on -- I would just ask to conclude and then I will sit down.
2009.08-7412,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1570.012,1571.38,"Thank you, Mr. Gowdy."

2009.08-7412,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1600.567,1601.083,Did that--
2009.08-7412,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1601.083,1601.9,I didn't -- I didn't hear the second.
2009.08-7412,2,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,1601.9,1602.383,I'm sorry.
2009.08-7412,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1658.736,1662.021,"Well, but you are arguing for a categorical rule of your own."
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,1676.262,1684.185,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we do agree in Florida and other States as well that age does matter, and we ask that there be three things that the Court look at."
2009.08-7412,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1702.193,1709.799,May I ask this: Is there a minimum age when a juvenile can be transferred to -- to adult procedures?
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,1709.799,1711.501,"--It's a three-tiered system, Justice Stevens."
2009.08-7412,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1713.234,1714.12,"Well, I'm just interested in one."
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,1714.92,1715.403,--Yes.
2009.08-7412,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1716.92,1721.957,"Is that an arbitrary line, or how do you -- how do we know it shouldn't be higher or lower than the line?"
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,1721.957,1726.594,"--Well, the legislature has set the line at 14-15 for certain crimes and 16-17 for others."
2009.08-7412,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1741.77,1762.867,"But then the -- what is your objection to an approach that when you are dealing with life without parole, for the reasons that your brother has articulated, you must as a matter of Federal law consider the juvenile status of the defendant before that sentence is imposed?"
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,1762.867,1762.867,--Well--
2009.08-7412,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1762.867,1770.521,"In other words, not a -- not a categorical rule that it automatically makes a difference, but not a categorical rule that it can never make a difference?"
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,1770.521,1770.971,"--Well, sure."
2009.08-7412,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1806.893,1808.743,"Yes, but could I interrupt with one question?"
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,1819.198,1821.716,"That's not accurate, Justice Stevens."
2009.08-7412,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1868.827,1869.743,I still don't understand.
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,1884.587,1888.039,--The age -- they get a presentence report.
2009.08-7412,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1889.105,1891.323,"I understand, but statutorily?"
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,1892.256,1894.525,"--Well, the statute doesn't specifically say the trial judge--"
2009.08-7412,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1894.525,1895.758,--The answer is no.
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,1901.579,1911.904,"--Not exactly, because the range of remedies the trial judge can impose is based upon what method by which the juvenile was transferred or waived into the adult court."
2009.08-7412,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1919.091,1928.247,You mean the trial judge under Florida law does not have discretion to choose a lower sentence because of the -- of tender years of the defendant?
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,1928.247,1929.616,"--Well, absolutely, the trial judge does."
2009.08-7412,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1932.5,1936.702,But the statute doesn't draw any distinctions once he is in -- in the adult--
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,1936.702,1942.756,I guess the answer to your question is there is no specific statute that says the trial judge shall consider age specifically.
2009.08-7412,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1942.756,1945.891,"And -- and there's -- well, I guess that answers my question."
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,1958.116,1962.27,"No -- I mean, certainly not under any Federal constitutional principle I am aware of."
2009.08-7412,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1962.27,1963.737,"Well, that's what we are arguing about."
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,1963.737,1964.372,"Right, right."
2009.08-7412,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1981.231,1994.891,"--That's -- that's one of the problems, is the individual sentencing judge might think that Graham is a very bad individual, but the prosecutor had a different judgment of it."
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2008.901,2009.484,--Well--
2009.08-7412,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2009.484,2015.554,"This judge, I think, surprised everyone in the courtroom with the -- with the sentence."
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2020.173,2025.493,"--Well, the prosecutor recommended 30 years, that's correct, and the judge here entered life."
2009.08-7412,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2057.964,2058.53,Counsel--
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2058.53,2059.33,Yes.
2009.08-7412,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2059.33,2066.986,--Do you think that it categorically violates the Eighth Amendment for a 10-year-old to be sentenced to life without parole?
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2066.986,2074.724,"Well, the answer to that is it certainly raises a concern about the age."
2009.08-7412,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2076.676,2092.436,"So once it matters, the question for me is -- help me draw the line -- if 10 is in my judgment too early, why isn't 14, 16, or 18?"
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2101.691,2102.409,Right.
2009.08-7412,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2102.409,2106.695,"--but it begs the question, which is age is -- matters a lot."
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2114.134,2114.684,Sure.
2009.08-7412,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2120.121,2122.438,What about historical perspective?
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2141.034,2143.301,"Well, certainly that historical perspective has--"
2009.08-7412,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2143.301,2145.07,--and all felonies were the death penalty.
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2145.07,2145.736,--Sure.
2009.08-7412,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2166.834,2167.352,You have no one?
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2168.186,2168.669,--I'm sorry.
2009.08-7412,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2174.09,2180.076,Is that because judges haven't chosen to impose it or because your legal system doesn't permit it?
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2180.076,2181.526,"--No, the legal system permits it."
2009.08-7412,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2182.361,2188.515,How young could the youngest person in Florida be to be prosecuted as an adult and be eligible for life--
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2188.515,2189.382,--Well--
2009.08-7412,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2189.382,2190.032,--without parole?
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2190.032,2194.086,"--Under the indictment statute, there is no age limitation."
2009.08-7412,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2194.603,2196.403,So a 5-year-old could be put away for life?
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2196.403,2197.121,--That is theoretically.
2009.08-7412,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2202.14,2208.077,"In -- in your earlier response to Justice Sotomayor's question, you said age certainly matters."
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2224.188,2230.426,"--Well, we suggest that it may matter in a particular case, and when you get to the gross disproportionality--"
2009.08-7412,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2230.426,2231.959,Under the authority of what law?
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2236.763,2240.365,"--Well, I -- I -- I think our -- country's traditions recognize it--"
2009.08-7412,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2240.365,2241.5,--Because of the Eighth Amendment?
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2241.5,2246.352,"--Well, I believe it could be certainly a part of the Eighth Amendment analysis."
2009.08-7412,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2269.251,2270.503,I'm sorry.
2009.08-7412,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2281.792,2286.846,And then we apply a totality of the circumstances test--
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2286.846,2287.729,--Well -- well--
2009.08-7412,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2287.729,2289.812,--which means whatever seems -- seems like a good idea.
2009.08-7412,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2289.812,2297.251,"Well, we apply the proportionality review that we articulated in Harmelin, and Solem and Ewing."
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2297.251,2298.035,"--Well, of course--"
2009.08-7412,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2298.035,2298.968,It's already there.
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2298.968,2305.691,"--Well, if that's applied, and even if you consider age in these cases that are before the Court, they are on the violent side of the line."
2009.08-7412,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2314.06,2329.639,You are not seriously suggesting that the crimes at issue here are comparable to a rape or a permanent infliction of serious disability or any of those other very violent crimes that are close to homicide that Justice Alito spoke about?
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2333.691,2337.21,"--There is, but the legislatures make the judgment about how they are going to punish those."
2009.08-7412,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2338.328,2365.979,"Well, if we -- if we have already said that you can't impose death on an adult who hasn't committed a homicide, an intentional death, and so for an adult the most serious sentence that we can give them is life without parole, why should that same sentence be given to a juvenile who we have recognized as being less capable than an adult?"
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2375.835,2380.672,"--Because it is still a very serious, violent crime."
2009.08-7412,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2387.659,2396.95,But isn't it true -- and I think one of my colleagues already questioned you -- that the prosecutor didn't think that this merited life without parole.
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2409.008,2412.876,"--Well, I think the prosecutor certainly offered up to 30 years."
2009.08-7412,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2435.575,2444.847,Do we know why the co-perpetrators got so -- their sentences were dramatically lower.
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2446.914,2449.466,Is this as to the home invasion or the armed--
2009.08-7412,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2449.466,2450.166,Yes.
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2450.166,2453.284,--The home invasion -- there was an 11-year sentence for the codefendant.
2009.08-7412,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2453.284,2453.818,Yes.
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2453.818,2462.224,"He helped -- helped and testified and basically assisted the prosecution, so I believe he got a lower sentence."
2009.08-7412,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2462.224,2464.007,Because he assisted the prosecutor.
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2464.007,2464.457,Right.
2009.08-7412,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2476.733,2477.249,I didn't think he--
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2477.249,2478.066,"--I mean, life without parole."
2009.08-7412,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2478.066,2487.505,"--For this very offense, this home invasion, I didn't think that anyone other than Graham had gotten life without parole."
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2487.505,2494.528,"Well -- well, Graham got life without parole, and it relates back to his armed burglary with assault and battery."
2009.08-7412,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2519.076,2539.906,"Did he -- how do you answer the argument that unlike an adult, because of the immaturity, you can't really judge a person -- judge a teenager at the point of sentencing?"
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2575.96,2582.114,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, we respect that, and certainly in Roper that was the linchpin to the decision."
2009.08-7412,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2594.838,2599.139,"I suppose you could say the same thing of -- of adults, of somebody over 18."
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2628.409,2628.909,True.
2009.08-7412,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2628.909,2630.528,--when there was parole for everybody?
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2630.528,2635.415,And it -- and it goes to the core of the State's sovereignty to decide what laws to enact.
2009.08-7412,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2635.415,2646.12,But Florida does -- and every State -- recognize the difference between an adult and a minor.
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2663.316,2672.772,"And, Justice Ginsburg, we ask that the same respect for our juvenile justice system be given to those laws enacted in Florida that protect the -- the juveniles."
2009.08-7412,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2680.277,2681.993,But they don't make it on a case-by-case basis.
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2685.764,2704.743,"--That's true but at the same -- by the same token, the juvenile justice system in Florida -- and keep in mind we had a juvenile justice division -- department established in 1994 because of the severe problems as we outlined in our brief -- that Florida has a -- has committed resources and -- and programs and so forth to the juvenile justice system."
2009.08-7412,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2771.453,2787.147,"If we look just at deterrence, my initial instinct is that the difference in life and life without -- life with parole and life without parole is just not a factor in deterrence."
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2822.053,2822.736,Well--
2009.08-7412,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2822.736,2836.73,"And you could say retribution, but then you have judges on a case-by-case basis deciding when there should be retribution."
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2836.73,2842.966,"--Well, I think certainly the State of Florida's interest as among other States is first of all to punish."
2009.08-7412,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2851.489,2859.743,But it seems to me the deterrence interest is quite minimal if you assume rehabilitation or strong evidence of rehabilitation.
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2859.743,2863.695,"--Well, but the deterrence goes to those who would commit the same act."
2009.08-7412,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2866.83,2877.538,I thought the question is: Will the difference between life with parole and life without parole deter anybody?
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2895.332,2902.486,"--Well, I don't -- I have not seen empiricism on this at all to say, you know, what -- does it really matter or not."
2009.08-7412,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2906.638,2920.448,I guess there's also no empiricism on whether the committed juvenile feels a lot better knowing that he will get out when he is 75 years old than he would feel knowing that he was there for life.
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2920.448,2921.048,"--Well, I--"
2009.08-7412,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2921.048,2927.637,Do we have empirical studies about how much that improves the spirits of the committed juvenile?
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2927.637,2936.576,"--I -- I have seen none, and it -- it goes to the question here, which is that Graham will be serving a lengthy prison term."
2009.08-7412,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2942.48,2944.147,--May I ask this question?
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2962.025,2966.095,"--I -- I don't have that at my grasp, but--"
2009.08-7412,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2966.095,2970.797,"But it seems to me sort of -- as a matter of intuition, Justice Kennedy made the same sort of point."
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,2981.288,2984.557,"--Well, in terms of recidivism, I think, number one, violence matters."
2009.08-7412,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3006.403,3010.605,"Well, along those lines -- and, again, maybe this was in the amicus briefs."
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,3017.528,3024.365,"--There are -- there are studies everywhere, and I have looked at many of them, and it appears that it certainly increases from age 13, and it goes up to 14."
2009.08-7412,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3082.387,3097.396,"Well, we are not sure that those 70-year sentences are any good, either, because your -- your friend on the other side, you know, is not willing to -- to pick a number at which the sentence amounts to life without parole."
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,3099.596,3119.227,"--Well, they've conceded, in their brief, that what this all boils down to is that if Graham wins and he gets to go back and be resentenced, that either the Florida legislature has to pass a law to reinstitute parole for this category of offenders, or the trial judge could say, okay, the actuarial table says you are going to live to be 64.2, we're going to -- I'm going to sentence you to something less--"
2009.08-7412,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3119.227,3142.056,"I thought that there was a parole system still functioning, so -- although it will be phased out over time, but for people who were incarcerated under the old regime -- and I think the suggestion was that that system would take care of the handful of people, not more than that, that this decision would involve."
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,3142.056,3144.175,--There is still a parole board.
2009.08-7412,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3155.983,3163.672,"Can you tell us just a little bit about the Florida correctional systems, the policies with respect to rehabilitation programs?"
2009.08-7412,3,38130,scott_d_makar,,3181.883,3182.4,"No, no."
2009.08-7412,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3229.798,3232.483,"Thank you, Mr. Makar."
2009.08-7412,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3235.435,3244.541,"Why does a juvenile have a constitutional right to hope, but an adult does not?"
2009.08-7412,4,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,3244.541,3246.826,Because the juvenile is different than an adult.
2009.08-7412,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3263.871,3271.708,"But do you know anybody who is willing to say that, as a categorical matter, that -- you know, the 18th birthday is the magical date for every single person?"
2009.08-7412,4,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,3271.708,3278.095,"No, Your Honor, and nobody was willing to say that in Roper, but, yet, the Court still drew the line at 18 for the death penalty in Roper."
2009.08-7412,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3278.095,3289.153,"Because the Court, up to this point, has said that death is different, and the rules -- the Eighth Amendment rules in capital cases are entirely different from the Eighth Amendment rules in -- in all other cases."
2009.08-7412,4,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,3289.153,3290.522,We are not -- we were not--
2009.08-7412,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3290.522,3302.829,"If we -- you know, if we abandon that, then one of two things has to happen, either the rules for noncapital cases have to change dramatically, or the rules for capital cases have to change dramatically, unless death is different, in fact."
2009.08-7412,4,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,3302.829,3314.554,"--Well, I -- first, we -- we are not asking that the procedural rules in the intricate individualized death penalty sentencing scheme be transported or moved over to the noncapital cases."
2009.08-7412,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3314.554,3318.089,"I know you are not asking for that, but that -- isn't that where this, logically, is going?"
2009.08-7412,4,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,3322.808,3341.205,"Absolutely not, Your Honor, because those rules make no sense when you are talking about adolescents, who are different, because those -- which a Court recognized in Roper, that those rules can't be applied to adolescents because we -- you can't, as a sentencer, predict the future."
2009.08-7412,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3359.416,3360.132,Why does it say that?
2009.08-7412,4,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,3382.363,3397.791,"Your -- Your Honor, I think the only difference here is -- between life without parole and life with parole, is that there will be a determination later, at age 30 or 40 or sometime thereafter, as to whether that is the right sentence."
2009.08-7412,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3412.883,3414.6,One reason States--
2009.08-7412,4,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,3414.6,3415.502,--and you will have a more accurate determination later.
2009.08-7412,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3415.502,3429.726,"--One reason States and the Federal government moved to abolish parole in -- in recent decades was, with depressing regularity, prisoners released on parole committed crimes again."
2009.08-7412,4,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,3445.188,3454.377,"Your Honor, as my brother noted, I think that the evidence shows that, as people get older, they are less likely to recommit crimes."
2009.08-7412,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3454.377,3467.952,"But isn't that -- I remember some of those studies that -- I mean, the cutoff, there's sort of a magic age at some point, where people over the age of 35, or whatever, typically don't engage in violent activity."
2009.08-7412,4,17670,bryan_s_gowdy,,3467.952,3480.527,"It -- it decreases over time, undoubtedly, and that's -- that supports, I think, our argument here, that the -- that Terrance Graham, at age 47, will not be the person he was at age 17."
2009.08-7412,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3483.813,3485.113,"Thank you, counsel."
