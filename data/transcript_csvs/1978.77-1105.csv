1978.77-1105,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,19.992,"We'll hear arguments next in 1105, Herbert against Lando."
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,25.325,29.513,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1105,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,130.246,133.661,"Counsel, you say their state of mind as to matters?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,133.661,133.883,Yes.
1978.77-1105,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,133.883,139.448,Could be a little more precise for what issue were you directing would those answers have been relevant?
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,139.448,140.13,Yes.
1978.77-1105,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,201.605,206.523,"One of this is directed at what, at the presence or absence of malice?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,206.523,207.8,"Yes, it is."
1978.77-1105,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,207.8,209.795,"That should be our focus, should it not?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,209.795,220.084,Within the absence of actual -- presence or absence of actual malice within the reckless disregard branch of that actual malice definition.
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,220.084,223.387,As this Court has developed that --
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,227.24,246.049,"We had -- the knowing falsehood issues, we have asked questions of Mr. Lando regarding knowledge of certain things which were directly contrary to matters presented on the program, which indicate a knowledge of the falsehood of certain malice."
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,263.658,271.808,"Yes, but are you telling us that he did answer questions directed to knowing falsity of some of the things that were shown on the program?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,271.808,272.812,He answered questions.
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,272.812,274.457,"But can you illustrate, for example?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,274.457,291.884,"He answered questions for example, during the -- on the program Mike Wallace stated that nobody that they interviewed could told them that Colonel Herbert had reported any of the war crimes while in Vietnam."
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,343.38,345.226,Can you illustrate just that?
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,349.88,353.061,"Yes, yes."
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,368.936,370.476,Are you speaking now of Mr. Lando?
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,370.476,380.849,"Yes, Mr. Lando -- in terms of he had interviewed a Colonel Nicholson and a major who had been in -- a Major Crouch -- who had been in Hawaii."
1978.77-1105,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,435.297,443.961,"Mr. Lubell, could you give us perhaps the most persuasive example you can think of, of a question that you asked and that he refused to answer?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,446.946,448.798,"Yes, yes."
1978.77-1105,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,485.944,489.472,"Specifically, you question in -- is this a fair paraphrase?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,494.624,502.361,"Yes, what was the -- actually, we didn't say why [Attempt to Laughter] -- we said, what was the basis for not including the -- any excerpts from those interviews?"
1978.77-1105,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,502.361,503.825,Is that question he refused to answer?
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,503.825,504.352,Yes.
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,519.761,521.034,Those he also refused to answer?
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,521.034,526.528,"Those he refused to answer too, Your Honor."
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,585.886,586.841,"Incidentally, Mr. Lubell --"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,586.841,587.221,Yes.
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,587.221,601.805,"At that stage, was there any controversy whether some of the matters shown on the ""60-Minutes"" program was or was not false?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,601.805,604.29,The defendants take the position that the matters presented --
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,604.29,606.912,"No, I'm stating at that stage of the --"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,606.912,608.074,"At that stage, no."
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,618.007,619.137,But the issue of falsity is --
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,619.137,620.121,Falsity --
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,620.121,621.392,"Very much in this case, still it was?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,621.392,624.875,"The issue of falsity is in the case, very much in the case, Your Honor."
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,624.875,625.871,It still is.
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,625.871,627.674,"Yes, I believe it is."
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,631.84,642.365,"And was there ever any suggestion that the issue of falsity should be determined before you get into the question of malice because unless something was false, I gather you wouldn't have a case, would you?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,642.365,643.799,"Right, there was no suggestion."
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,674.41,692.689,"But on the issue of so-called editorial privilege or whatever you're going to call this, a privilege, I take it that wouldn't even be in the case unless there was first the finding of falsity of something about this program, would there?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,692.689,709.536,"I'm not sure whether that is so because what the Circuit Court did is take this entire range of media activity, which they call the editorial process, and immunized it from discovery by a plaintiff."
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,712.221,715.312,Well it immunized in the sense that it was privileged in some way?
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,715.312,732.73,"In the sense that it was privilege, we could not obtain what happened during that editorial process and I suggest that it is possible that during that editorial process, certain things may have a vision which relate to the question of truth and falsity as well."
1978.77-1105,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,732.73,746.183,"Mr. Lubell, in an ordinary lawsuit, in the discovery stage of the case, you have to do your discovery for all of the issues that you think will be necessary to prove at trial before you ever get to trial, don't you?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,746.183,746.719,Yes.
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,765.19,765.56,Avoid it?
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,765.56,772.237,-- as a practical matter ever able to be distinguished.
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,775.788,784.898,"Forgive me, I shouldn't have taken so much of your time but I gather, you have allegations, I take it, do you not, on which you rely of falsity?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,784.898,785.243,"Oh, yes."
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,785.243,789.196,"Now, are they very -- about many, many matters or --"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,789.196,789.433,"Yes, they are."
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,789.433,791.631,"Only a few, or what?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,791.631,799.183,We maintain that the program as a whole as well as many specific matters presented in the program are false.
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,827.419,829.955,"All of which, as you say falsehoods."
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,829.955,830.973,All of which are falsehood.
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,830.973,833.059,Are depicted in the 60-Minutes program?
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,833.059,833.667,Yes.
1978.77-1105,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,906.554,922.726,"Well, here you are suggesting that, the responses where force coming as to the state of mind when it helped the defendant's case, but not when conceivably it might harmed the defendant's case?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,922.726,925.415,"Yes, we are suggesting that."
1978.77-1105,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,925.415,930.116,"Well, it wouldn't be the first time in a deposition that, that sort of thing had happened?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,930.116,937.051,I don't believe so.[Attempt to Laughter]
1978.77-1105,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1054.77,1063.133,"Now where do you see the line that the Court of Appeals drew, not the line that you draw, but where do you see the line?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1063.133,1064.216,That the Court of Appeals drew?
1978.77-1105,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1064.216,1065.19,Yes.
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1065.19,1065.799,"I think that, --"
1978.77-1105,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1065.799,1070.876,You're conduct your questioning where did they say you went off?
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1070.876,1091.705,"The -- I think under the Court of Appeals' decision, I think they would say any inquiry into what the media or the press did after obtaining the interview from that time, until the time that the finished product is broadcast we could not inquire into."
1978.77-1105,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1097.107,1100.29,"Well, you say it is time and not subject matter?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1100.29,1112.77,It will receive as both a period of -- I think there are two aspects of the Court of Appeals' decision and it is difficult to ascertain which one is the more powerful aspect.
1978.77-1105,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1121.958,1123.826,"Well, Mr. Lubell?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1123.826,1123.995,Yes.
1978.77-1105,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1123.995,1133.348,"Would you think that any questions that started out, did you know would be barred by this ruling?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1133.348,1134.291,Yes.
1978.77-1105,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1134.291,1136.392,Did you know a particular fact?
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1136.392,1137.737,"Yes, yes we believe."
1978.77-1105,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1143.409,1149.284,So you couldn't inquire whether a particular fact was true or not?
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1149.284,1153.467,We could inquire as to who he interviewed.
1978.77-1105,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1157.324,1159.323,You could find out what he was told?
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1159.323,1165.623,"What he was told, but we couldn't inquire for example, as to whether he knew the person he was interviewing --"
1978.77-1105,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1165.623,1166.561,But you could ask --
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1166.561,1166.9,I am sorry.
1978.77-1105,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1166.9,1173.252,Couldn't you ask -- couldn't you ask did you ever learned that so and so?
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1173.252,1185.671,"I believe that when Chief Judge Kaufman talked about any intrusion into the mental process of the press, I believe that he speaks of --"
1978.77-1105,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1185.671,1197.554,"Why didn't -- you really read it to me that you cannot inquire from the reporter the state of his knowledge, that whether he knew a certain facts or not?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1197.554,1207.447,"We can inquire as to -- I believe we can inquire as to what he did, but I do not believe we can --"
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1207.447,1209.459,"You interviewed John Jones, I did."
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1220.898,1235.104,It is my opinion that Chief Judge Kaufman's opinion is not clear as to whether that question is permissible when he states that any intrusion into the mental process of the reporter is precluded.
1978.77-1105,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1235.104,1241.973,"You mean you couldn't say, were you ever told by anybody else to the contrary?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1241.973,1243.723,"That you could ask, I believe, Your Honor."
1978.77-1105,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1243.723,1250.529,"Well, couldn't you go on and say, did you ever learn from any other source to the contrary?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1250.529,1257.492,"I think, Your Honor, you get closer to an inquiry regarding the state of mind."
1978.77-1105,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1265.599,1266.958,"Mr. Lubell, let me interrupt you."
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1270.683,1272.033,Thank you.
1978.77-1105,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1284.993,1287.963,"Mr. Lubell, you may continue."
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1287.963,1291.259,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1308.24,1311.967,"Well, you don't have any court opinion anyway, do you?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1311.967,1312.356,I'm sorry?
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1312.356,1314.958,There is no court opinion from the Court of Appeals?
1978.77-1105,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1314.958,1315.625,No majority?
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1315.625,1316.953,"No, no majority opinion."
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1323.207,1326.912,"Now, which opinions are you talking about when -- what you're about to say?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1328.591,1353.123,"Well, I think the Chief Judge's opinion at Page 40 -- at 22A of the Appendix describes what plaintiff has already done in the course of discovery and states that he has already discovered what Lando knew, saw, said and wrote during his investigation."
1978.77-1105,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1361.447,1367.505,"Well, doesn't that imply that you can ask anything -- ask him whether he knew something?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1367.505,1368.212,Yes it does.
1978.77-1105,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1410.676,1422.031,"Yes but if either -- if there are only two people supporting the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and either one of them says that something is discoverable, it's discoverable under that judgment?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1422.031,1434.496,"However, if it's discoverable in a time period that might be described as the editorial process time period, which both of the opinions say cannot be inquired into."
1978.77-1105,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1439.713,1456.105,"Well, you can ask -- I would think it would be a fair implication from what you read a moment ago that you could say when you went into this process, did you know it and when you came out of the process, did you know it?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1456.105,1460.14,What -- I don't -- I think we possibly could ask that.
1978.77-1105,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1466.5,1470.125,"Well, I know, but if he came out of it knowing it, he learned it somewhere?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1470.125,1473.213,"The problem is, we wouldn't know what is is he came out with knowing."
1978.77-1105,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1473.213,1477.22,"Well, you would ask him a particular question, did you know so-and-so?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1478.283,1484.661,"We would have to ask him every -- knowing every issue on every aspect of the case, we would not be able to --"
1978.77-1105,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1484.661,1487.193,"Well, how else do you prove a lawsuit?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1487.193,1492.09,But we would not be able to find out what -- how it is that he came to know something.
1978.77-1105,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1516.323,1523.495,But You think that the -- then in this judgment you could not ask where you ever told something to the contrary?
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1523.495,1532.945,I think that it's possible that the defendants could raise the question that if it was told to the defendants during the editorial process by --
1978.77-1105,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1532.945,1535.27,By somebody on the within the editorial process?
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1535.27,1537.368,In the course of the editorial process yes Your Honor.
1978.77-1105,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1538.258,1541.889,"But if it were told him by some outsider, you could inquire into that?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1541.889,1558.498,"It may well -- I can't say, I would argue obviously if it came up in the District Court, I would argue if you could, but I don't -- I cannot say with confidence that, that answer is supported by the two decisions which form the majority."
1978.77-1105,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1558.498,1571.091,"Well assuming now Mr. Lubell the question suggested by Justice White has been answered, in that he has had two statements made to that are not consistent."
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1581.617,1587.205,"No, I do not think and it would be quite clear on this, I do not think we could ask that."
1978.77-1105,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1597.058,1599.173,You can ask whether he thought it was true or false?
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1599.173,1600.359,"That's right, that's right."
1978.77-1105,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1604.673,1611.577,And you can't ask whether he thought some witness was truthful or not whether he was telling a falsehood or not?
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1611.577,1614.116,We can't -- that's right and also we can't answer whether --
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1614.116,1616.611,"In other words, you can't say did you believe them?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1616.611,1618.642,Or did you think you had to check it further.
1978.77-1105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1629.236,1633.077,"Certainly you have no problem about those sources here, did you in this case?"
1978.77-1105,0,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,1633.077,1641.935,"No, in fact there was a question of sources which was then waived by CBS, there is no source problem in this case."
1978.77-1105,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1717.044,1727.344,Mr. Abrams.
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,1727.344,1730.346,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1789.83,1793.94,How does Miami Herald bear on this case?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,1793.94,1796.831,Our argument Mr. Chief Justice is this.
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1835.17,1838.263,"Yes, but that wasn't involved in the Miami herald case --"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,1838.263,1839.11,Absolutely not.
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1840.263,1841.388,-- probably beyond that?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,1841.388,1861.163,"I am without question or going beyond that case, what I am saying is that it does seem to us that the underlying theory of that case ought not to be limited to right of reply statutes any more than you would limit I think, Mills versus Alabama to limitations on what occurs on election day, and what can be printed by a newspaper on election day."
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1999.742,2004.429,Do you think that's an unfair strategy in war?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2004.429,2009.551,"Your Honor I don't think it's defamatory, it is their position that, that is defamatory per se."
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2015.306,2020.306,"Well, in this if the statement were false and that it was known that it was false, then it might be, would it not?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2020.306,2022.362,I don't think it would be defamatory even then in times of war.
1978.77-1105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2022.362,2024.269,That's a question of New York law?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2024.269,2024.707,I am sorry sir.
1978.77-1105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2024.707,2025.519,That's a question of New York law.
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2025.519,2032.628,"Yes, yes that's a question of New York law, and I think New York law is to some extent at least has been constitutionalised as to what is defamatory."
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2043.191,2052.237,Would you agree that Mr. Abrams is that under in New York Times and Sullivan malice is a state of mind?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2052.237,2067.21,"Your Honor I fully agree that in order to prevail a plaintiff in a New York Times versus Sullivan case must either prove that in this case, CBS knew what it was broadcasting was untrue or broadcasts with reckless disregard of truth or falsity meaning with serious doubts has to --"
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2067.21,2067.853,The question --
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2067.853,2069.08,I don't dispute that at all.
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2069.08,2075.212,"It is the question then in the cases how the plaintiff finds that out, is that not so?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2075.212,2081.654,I think the plaintiff finds it out Your Honor first of all that it kind of material he was given.
1978.77-1105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2105.048,2120.297,I gather from that what judge Kaufman said that he wasn't indicating that the plaintiff would be limited in finding out what information the newspaper had.
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2120.297,2122.974,"Exactly Mr. Justice White, here --"
1978.77-1105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2122.974,2127.344,And except perhaps what the individual reporter may have learned during the process?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2127.344,2129.15,Perhaps that and even that was not --
1978.77-1105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2129.15,2133.954,But in terms of out – of what information he had from outside --
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2133.954,2135.765,All questions that were asked about --
1978.77-1105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2135.765,2137.486,What did you learn or what did you know?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2137.486,2140.093,What did you learn or what did you know?
1978.77-1105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2149.584,2151.28,What about a question?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2157.854,2162.929,"Well, that I think Mr. Justice Rehnquist gets a lot closer to what answers were not given in this case."
1978.77-1105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2162.929,2180.805,"Well, but that's a real problem for plaintiffs in cases like this that's having in my own practice been a party on both sides to fraud cases and defamation cases, you don't get admissions out of defendants mouths that they lied, you have to go after them in tangential ways?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2180.805,2182.586,You are right.
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2258.998,2260.562,How do they find out what's CBS?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2262.256,2264.169,"Those questions have all been answered, Your Honor."
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2265.1,2266.326,You concede then --
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2266.326,2267.007,"Yes sir, but there is --"
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2267.007,2273.405,"-- when you ask the CBS representative when you said this, did you know 'A,' 'A,' 'A?'"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2273.405,2277.537,"All the questions about, what CBS knew have been answered."
1978.77-1105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2289.106,2294.497,"And you are saying he shouldn't be asked, he shouldn't be required to answer, did you know he was a liar?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2294.497,2294.892,That's right.
1978.77-1105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2294.892,2296.291,Or he was telling the falsehood or something?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2296.291,2297.482,Yes.
1978.77-1105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2309.485,2310.613,Would you have objected to a question --
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2310.613,2312.698,"No, Sir."
1978.77-1105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2312.698,2319.599,"-- of at the time you had this interview with this particular source, did you believe him?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2319.599,2323.499,"I think that, that falls within the area of protected information, Your Honor."
1978.77-1105,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2362.584,2364.201,But why does -- did you believe him?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2366.936,2368.538,It -- I am sorry Mr. Justice --
1978.77-1105,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2368.538,2371.335,Why does that go to the absolute court?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2371.335,2381.641,"Let me say, I was distinguishing, I meant to distinguish between the example that I just posed and the did you believe question, which it seems to me is necessarily a step away."
1978.77-1105,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2383.084,2388.68,"I know but, didn't I understand you to answer my brother White that did you believe him would be --"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2388.68,2390.792,"We think that, that should fall as well --"
1978.77-1105,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2390.792,2390.952,Why?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2390.952,2392.042,Within the area.
1978.77-1105,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2392.042,2392.328,Why?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2392.328,2400.389,"Because it seems to me that, that's a probe that deeply into the mind of the journalist is first of all not necessary in order to allow the plaintiff to prove his case."
1978.77-1105,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2416.868,2420.37,How about the question Mr. Abrams not that you believed him.
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2426.869,2428.219,That question wasn't ask and --
1978.77-1105,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2428.219,2431.751,"I know but what about it, is that within or outside the protective code?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2431.751,2439.543,"I will think that questions as to what the journalist knew are questions which he ought to answer, but it seems --"
1978.77-1105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2439.543,2442.323,Even though it too involved some sort of cognition?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2442.323,2454.1,"Some sort, but it seems to me that there aren't any kind of grade scale that -- as you go down that road, at the end of it at least, is why didn't you put these four people on, who said something good about Colonel Herbert."
1978.77-1105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2454.1,2460.126,"But at least you I gather you would think that he could be asked, were you told us something to the contrary by somebody?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2460.126,2461.189,"Yes, yes."
1978.77-1105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2461.189,2461.526,And --
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2461.526,2462.259,There's is no objection --
1978.77-1105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2462.259,2464.975,And then you would be say -- and you did not put this on the program?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2464.975,2466.749,"Yes, and there was no objection to any such questions."
1978.77-1105,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2466.749,2475.35,"Mr. Abrams, assume this went to trail, you couldn't then ask him whether he believed it or not?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2475.35,2489.987,"If an objection were made Mr. Justice Marshall by the defendant in this case, any question that was objected to, it seems to me could not be testified affirmatively to by the press."
1978.77-1105,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2489.987,2493.609,"I am talking about at the trial, you say that you believe it when he told you that?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2493.609,2503.396,"I think that if we object to any question on this basis at pre-trial, we could hardly be the ones to introduce evidence to that effect at the trial."
1978.77-1105,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2503.396,2504.852,I didn't say --
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2504.852,2504.87,I am sorry --
1978.77-1105,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2504.87,2507.67,I said this same man --
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2507.67,2508.03,Yes.
1978.77-1105,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2508.03,2517.554,-- Mike Wallace is on the witness stand and if he asked in particular phase in your did you believe that man for telling the truth?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2517.554,2531.557,"We have taken the decision Mr. Justice Marshall, that all questions are proper as to what was on the program that is to say, did you believe so and so insofar as what he said on the program we think is a proper question and we would not have objected to such questions."
1978.77-1105,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2531.557,2535.271,No I am talking about did you believe him when he told you?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2539.262,2541.623,"If it was broadcast on the program, my answer to you is yes."
1978.77-1105,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2541.623,2551.578,"For example I know what the answer would be but I assume you say that he couldn't answer the question, did you do this with the reckless disregard?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2551.578,2553.102,Well --
1978.77-1105,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2553.102,2556.418,You have to say you couldn't ask him that question?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2556.418,2557.789,We think that Justice Marshall that question --
1978.77-1105,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2557.789,2560.464,You wouldn't object to it because you would know what the answer would be?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2560.464,2562.835,I know what the answers would be to all of these questions.[Attempt to Laughter]
1978.77-1105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2562.835,2568.068,"But that's the ultimate issue in the case of the New York Times against Sullivan what justice Marshall was asking, isn't it?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2573.523,2593.907,"That's right -- and what I said is that, we have not -- Mr. Lubell has not asked these question, but we would not have objected it and we do not maintain that the privilege that we seek here protects against a response to the question about whether anything that was on the program was believed by the journalist or was known by the journalist to be untrue."
1978.77-1105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2609.11,2613.291,"Well, I have thought -- moved over -- you said a question about belief in the truth of something could not be asked?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2613.291,2621.353,But when I concluded from that Mr. Justice Rehnquist was a question as to the belief of material which was actually broadcast on the program.
1978.77-1105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2645.577,2650.578,"Well, that amounts as though the soft pitches you can hit and the hard ones you can duck?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2650.578,2656.589,"Well, Your Honor, there are no -- I ask you to look at the questions here, that's not a question I couldn't answer."
1978.77-1105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2656.589,2679.779,"I know but in -- but the kind of questions that you say are not answerable and to go further in the process, certainly no producers is going to say, I didn't believe what I put on the program, but if you go further back in the process and say what did you think after you learned that 'X' said such and such, you may get a string of answers that may permit a jury to infer that he didn't believe it."
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2679.779,2684.384,"Well, it seems to me Mr. Justice Rehnquist that it would be a very rare liable case indeed."
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2735.636,2743.882,"Now you've emphasized -- you've emphasized objective, Mr. Abrams, in a number of your responses."
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2756.182,2758.542,That's correct.
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2758.542,2770.646,How do you probe for the presence or absence of malice if you can't ask what was the state of mind at the time this or that was done?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2770.646,2784.379,"It seems to me, Your Honor, that the way it has been done in libel cases, and the way it is routinely done in criminal cases, and security's act cases, and antitrust cases, is for a jury to infer a particular state of mind from a particular set of facts."
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2784.379,2790.005,"Well, let's take a criminal case for example, and the defense is self-defense."
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2803.316,2810.317,"I think once the defendant takes the stand in that type of situation, and to the extent that that's a relevant issue, he certainly can."
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2811.0,2813.88,Wouldn't the state of mind be relevant to self-defense?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2813.88,2816.01,"Yes, sir, it would."
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2822.423,2826.466,"Well, or course, you can't prove his state of mind if he isn't there?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2826.466,2831.476,"But the question before you is, are we entitled not to respond to certain questions?"
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2841.538,2844.46,"But in a civil case, you can't do that, can you, you must take the stand?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2844.46,2847.203,Unless you are -- you must take the stand.
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2851.798,2857.863,"Well, do you suggest that privilege of a reporter is different from the privilege of some other witness?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2857.863,2879.969,"Well, it seems to me, Your Honor, that this will take a moment or two, because it seems to me that the Court is yet to rule on whether the Gertz case, first of all applies alone to the press and the media or to other entities and so that would be a threshold ruling for the Court to make as to whether there is any different treatment under libel law, or under slander law."
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2908.124,2914.467,"But there are many libel cases brought against people who have nothing to do with journalism, aren't there?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2914.467,2925.148,"There are manly libel cases, and Your Honor, it is our position that the only open question is whether this protection ought to go to the “press,” including a lot more than journalists -- or to the press and speakers as well --"
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2925.148,2925.166,Well then now let's narrow it down --
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2925.166,2927.731,-- or to the press and speakers as well.
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2927.731,2938.112,"-- let's narrow it down to two different kinds of defendants in libel cases, one is a media reporter and one is just another taxpayer who happened to --"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2938.112,2939.786,Write a book or a --
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2939.786,2944.035,"No, just make some very bad statements about someone, not a writer?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2944.035,2944.738,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2944.738,2949.401,Just another citizen who is not -- doesn't purport to be a professional writer.
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2949.401,2950.833,Right.
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2950.833,2956.138,You think there is a difference in the scope of probing the mind of the one from the other?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,2956.138,2970.895,"I'm saying the first thing I would have to know, Your Honor, is whether New York Times against Sullivan protects the individual in that type of situation and what I was observing is that I don't think this Court has yet ruled on the question of whether the Sullivan case does afford such protection."
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3037.73,3056.562,"Do you know of any case, none in this Court of course, but any case in any court which has put a limit on the cross-examination of the witness when the issue is malice, whether it's a murder case or whatever kind of case it may be?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3056.562,3066.082,"Well, the only type of situation is that -- I'm trying to think of cases where malice is in fact at issue."
1978.77-1105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3079.434,3085.178,"Well, any kind where an intent, where any kind of a fraud case, civil fraud case?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3085.178,3086.402,Yes.
1978.77-1105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3086.402,3088.42,"In a 10(B)(5) case, now, how about that?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3088.42,3093.279,10(B) -- I was limiting my answer to the question of malice but in terms of intent --
1978.77-1105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3093.279,3094.639,"Well, state of mind."
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3094.639,3103.636,State of mind or intent is routinely proved in 10(B)(5) cases by reference to what the person did and what the person knew.
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3108.714,3113.182,"No, I would not suggest that and I have no reason to think of that is constitutionally privileged."
1978.77-1105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3113.182,3138.135,"While I've got you interrupted, I take it that your submission here is not just that the state of -- that there should be no inquiry into state of mind, but there shouldn't be any inquiry into the editorial process, the decision-making process, and for example, you would say that it would be an improper question to say, what did another one of your editors tell you?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3138.135,3140.777,"I think as a general matter, certainly."
1978.77-1105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3140.777,3145.789,Or what did you tell one of your senior editors?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3155.028,3176.255,"Yes, it is indeed one of the analogies that we urge on you in our brief is that of executive privilege, is that indeed as the Court observed in the Nixon case, that human experience teaches us that people will speak less freely in that type situation if they know that what they're going to say is going to be exposed to public dissemination."
1978.77-1105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3186.776,3198.447,"Well, sometimes what happens with the government when they claim the privilege is what the government's interest -- if they want to claim the privilege, they must give up the interest."
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3199.71,3201.871,"In a criminal case, that is correct."
1978.77-1105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3201.871,3222.678,"If they claim -- they want to claim a privilege, I mean they have to dismiss the prosecution and if the government wants to pursue someone civilly and still claim a privilege for some information they have, they may not be able to press their claim very far."
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3222.678,3223.425,I appreciate that.
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3229.174,3238.503,"It's true in civil cases, is it not in Federal Tort Claims cases against the government, one of the classic cases in this Court?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3260.211,3267.212,"Well, our position here, Mr. Chief Justice, is not that we cannot respond, but that you ought to rule that we need not respond, and --"
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3267.212,3290.286,"Well, or course, theoretically, the United States could have told the court in Philadelphia in that case that, no, we will not respond because this is a national security matter, which is about what it did, then the court said, if you don't respond, we'll enter judgment against you, we'll presume the worst."
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3291.621,3299.399,"If that were the nature of any privilege granted by the Court in this area, it would not be very expansive."
1978.77-1105,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3299.399,3303.325,"Mr. Abrams, let's get a way -- away from this case."
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3328.749,3334.29,"He can certainly have the whole transcript at the outset, in order to make judgments based on that."
1978.77-1105,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3334.29,3337.144,"Right, and he picks and chooses?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3337.144,3339.182,"Yes, and if the process --"
1978.77-1105,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3339.182,3344.164,And he does that with discussion with other people in his office?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3344.164,3368.211,"It seems to me, Mr. Justice Marshall, that those kinds of discussions in the office, as opposed to the facts of what he had, what he knew, and what he did, should indeed be protected and it seems to me that the precise analogy to that is, in fact, the executive privilege cases and the variety of other cases about the nature of discussions in situations like that."
1978.77-1105,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3382.115,3386.004,"Well, where do you get the chilling there, who gets chilled?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3386.004,3387.597,"Well, it seems to me that what is --"
1978.77-1105,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3387.597,3388.817,Who gets chilled?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3388.817,3393.469,"What is chilled are the people who speak to each other in the newsroom, aware --"
1978.77-1105,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3393.469,3396.365,"They get chilled, reporters get chilled?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3396.365,3399.931,"Oh, Mr. Justice Marshall, I am not suggesting that this has happened."
1978.77-1105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3447.53,3450.567,"Of course, this never happened under the old libel law?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3450.567,3455.895,"It never did, I don't want to follow that up, but it never did."
1978.77-1105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3455.895,3461.155,"Well, before 1965, it happened all the time, before New York Times against Sullivan?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3461.155,3470.756,"Not state of mind inquiry because at that point the test was wholly truth or falsity, was it privileged under Sullivan statement."
1978.77-1105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3470.756,3474.323,How about for punitive damages?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3474.323,3483.167,"For punitive damages, it sometimes came up in very specific and narrow circumstances, not questions as to why certain material was included and excluded."
1978.77-1105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3488.744,3490.247,Was there actual malice?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3490.247,3493.509,"Yes, actual malice in non-constitutional terms."
1978.77-1105,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3493.509,3503.424,"Mr. Abrams, what of Mr. Lubell's comment on editorial process, all of that's been revealed in Mr. Lando's article in the Atlantic Monthly?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3503.424,3504.396,"Well, first --"
1978.77-1105,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3504.396,3506.022,As it applies to this case.
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3506.022,3507.557,"I don't think it so, Your Honor."
1978.77-1105,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3509.481,3510.367,I haven't seen it.
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3511.49,3512.489,Yes sir.
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3533.822,3543.69,Let me ask you just one more question about your reference to discussions within the publisher's establishment.
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3587.647,3593.231,"You would ask the person in charge of advertising acceptability at the New York Times, what did you know?"
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3595.307,3598.676,"How about the editor, to ask him what was in the files?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3598.676,3602.957,"Well, let me say first, Your Honor, that the files here have been turned over."
1978.77-1105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3640.359,3646.338,Or any conversations whatsoever in the editorial process?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3646.338,3646.75,Are what?
1978.77-1105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3647.222,3651.886,Or any conversations in the editorial process may not be inquired into?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3651.886,3654.182,It seems to us that conversations --
1978.77-1105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3654.182,3660.664,That's a considerably different kettle of fish than just talking about state of mind?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3660.664,3672.641,"Well, that is -- it is a different area, Your Honor, it is and it seems to us that that also should be privileged, but that the policy basis for some of these are somewhat different and I tried to set forth but they aren't."
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3672.641,3681.963,"I get a hint from some of the things, at least between the lines of your argument Mr. Abrams, that perhaps some misreading of the opinions has taken place."
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3686.46,3687.514,Misreading of the opinions by --
1978.77-1105,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3687.514,3692.931,"Of the opinions of the Second Circuit, that some people may be misreading them."
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3692.931,3694.704,I think that to the extent that -- yes.
1978.77-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3716.012,3721.878,"Mr. Abrams, before you sit down, when you started, you called my attention to page 53 (a) of the appendix."
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3721.878,3722.222,Yes.
1978.77-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3722.222,3723.783,Why did you do that?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3723.783,3726.105,I started to respond to a question that you had asked Mr. Lubell.
1978.77-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3726.105,3730.787,I'd be interested in your response.
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3730.787,3756.999,"Starting about halfway down on page 53 (a), there was an interview on the program with Bruce Potter, and that was, I think what Mr. Lubell was adverting to earlier and I described it briefly about how Mr. Potter said that in his presence Colonel Herbert had thrown a sandbag out and as well had made threatening gestures towards a prisoner of war."
1978.77-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3817.786,3828.032,"Well, do you think that the question would be proper if it were asked this way, in the light of what these other four persons had to say, did you have any doubt about the credibility of Mr. Potter?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3828.032,3834.588,I certainly wouldn't have objected to a question asking whether he had any doubt about the credibility of what Mr. Potter had to say on the program.
1978.77-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3834.588,3835.203,Did he --
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3835.203,3835.672,I'm sorry?
1978.77-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3835.672,3837.548,(Inaudible) was Mr. Potter telling the truth?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3837.548,3839.178,In what he said on the program?
1978.77-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3839.711,3843.559,"Well, supposing this wasn't on the program but it was just one that was slightly different."
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3845.043,3847.411,Then it seems to me that that is a further step away.
1978.77-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3850.349,3853.434,Why is one involved editorial process any more than the other?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3853.434,3861.103,"Because it seems to me that when you put it -- I think they both involved conceptually the editorial process, but when the process is broadcast, it's out."
1978.77-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3861.103,3865.182,The process wasn't broadcast -- the product of the process?
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3865.182,3874.672,"When the segment at page 53 and 54 (a) is on the program, it seems to me, even though that is a result of a process, the journalist has to respond to the question as to whether he believed it or not."
1978.77-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3874.672,3881.604,"It's permissible to ask why he put Potter's statement on, but it is not permissible to ask, why did you not put the other four statements on?"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3881.604,3891.77,"No, Your Honor, it is our position that it is permissible to ask, did you believe the statement of Mr. Potter which you broadcast and it is our position that the questions ought not to be allowed to the effect of, why did you put it on --"
1978.77-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3891.77,3894.855,"But if there were a second statement by Mr. Potter, I just want to be sure I am --"
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3894.855,3895.265,Yes.
1978.77-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3895.265,3899.528,"The second statement by Mr. Potter was somewhat similar, but was not actually put on the air."
1978.77-1105,1,23503,floyd_abrams,,3903.679,3906.764,"Yes, Your Honor, that is our position that that should not be permissible."
1978.77-1105,2,31588,jonathan_w_lubell,,3926.133,3952.233,"Very briefly, in regard to reference to the Sullivan decision itself, the reference to the looking at the files, the issue that gets raised now by the Second Circuit decision is suppose an editor at the time that the work product was being worked up, the editorial process was going on, went to the files and looked at the files during that editorial process."
1978.77-1105,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4010.099,4012.057,"Mr. Lubell, let me ask you just one question."
