1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,42.105,44.273,May it please the Court.
1965.636,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,195.138,196.237,Could you speak a little louder --
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,196.237,196.995,Surely.
1965.636,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,196.995,199.276,-- Mr. Loomis please or move closer to the microphone.
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,199.276,199.695,Surely.
1965.636,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,308.607,316.937,"If I understand that Mr. Loomis, what you're suggesting is the only issue is whether the Commission standards or that suggested by the First Circuit is --"
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,316.937,317.041,Is the correct one.
1965.636,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,317.041,317.889,-- is the proper stand.
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,317.889,318.518,Is the proper stand.
1965.636,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,318.518,320.931,They don't have to be concerned with â€“-
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,320.931,321.07,With whether --
1965.636,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,321.07,324.375,-- if we agree with you whether or not the --
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,324.375,324.936,Whether you'd dis --
1965.636,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,324.936,325.584,-- the facts of --
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,325.584,327.114,-- agree or disagree with us.
1965.636,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,335.589,343.51,There isn't a meeting of the minds between you and your Brothers on the other side as to how well-establish this so-called Commission standard is?
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,343.51,344.064,That is quite correct.
1965.636,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,344.064,344.412,(Inaudible)
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,344.412,345.238,Yes.
1965.636,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,345.503,349.79,"You hypothesized a situation with which they don't agree, isn't it correct?"
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,349.79,352.068,"Well, no, I don't -- I think they agree that the question --"
1965.636,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,352.068,354.396,You referred to the well-established Commission standards.
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,354.396,354.449,They say it is --
1965.636,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,354.449,356.954,"It's a question that there is any such thing, isn't that right?"
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,356.954,361.314,"They questioned that's it well-established, that's correct."
1965.636,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,382.446,385.268,The question is what is the proper test under the statute?
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,385.268,386.124,Yes.
1965.636,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,386.149,406.24,"Mr. Loomis, do you understand that the respondent agrees that if we should conclude that the Commission's standard is correct then there is no dispute about the substantial -- substantiality of the evidence supporting the Commission's result?"
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,406.24,410.721,"Well, there's certainly a dispute between the respondent and ourselves about that."
1965.636,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,416.518,417.536,I see.
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,425.873,442.035,"Well, either remand or we would hope you could see your way clear to reverse the Court of Appeals and affirm the Commission because the Court of Appeals did not suggest that the Commission's findings were not supported upon the Commission's test."
1965.636,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,442.035,444.912,"But it hadn't ruled on that one way or the other, has it?"
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,444.912,445.749,No.
1965.636,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,460.825,469.824,"So, a remand would be necessary if we should agree that the Commission's standard is correct?"
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,469.824,473.075,That may well be Your Honor.
1965.636,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2113.593,2131.312,"Well Mr. Loomis when you -- when the Commission is deciding whether to allow electric and gas companies to stay together, in making that judgment do you inquire at all or predicted all what will happen to rates?"
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2131.312,2133.488,Not to any great degree.
1965.636,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2133.488,2134.778,Why not?
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2134.778,2141.382,That -- there are two types of determinations which are made when you just have electricity or you just have gas.
1965.636,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2144.597,2152.279,"I'm not interested in that, I'm administering the question you have in this case whether the -- whether they can retain the two systems together?"
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2152.279,2153.443,The gas and electric systems together.
1965.636,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2153.443,2154.16,Yes.
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2157.41,2157.901,Yes.
1965.636,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2157.901,2162.193,-- was there any prediction or consideration whether the rates would go up or down?
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2162.193,2171.01,There was some evidence introduced to the effect that because of the increase in expenses the rates might have to go up.
1965.636,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2171.811,2173.189,In both systems?
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2173.189,2176.634,"No, just in the gas system."
1965.636,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2183.388,2195.754,"Not going to be if they -- if some -- if a regulatory body has been doing its job on the rates and you had the expenses of a million or whatever -- a million dollars a year whatever, why wouldn't the rates have to go up?"
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2195.754,2204.461,"Well, there might be advantages, offsetting advantages derived from having the gas companies freely operate it."
1965.636,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2218.207,2222.006,"Well, you think it's irrelevant -- apparently it's just irrelevant to raise (Inaudible)"
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2222.006,2233.908,"No, I think that -- I think it could well be relevant on the merits, that is, if it turned out that the loss of economies was so substantial that the rates would have to go up?"
1965.636,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2239.924,2240.074,"Well, if --"
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2240.074,2240.948,All I'm saying is that --
1965.636,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2240.948,2243.689,How about if they would go up a million dollars?
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2243.689,2254.729,"Well, if that depends on whether a million dollars, it is substantial in the particular context you have whether they'd go up one half or 1% or 10%."
1965.636,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2254.729,2260.423,"Well, if the Commission decide in this case was a -- try to decide whether rates would or wouldn't go up and if so --"
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2260.423,2260.686,No.
1965.636,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2260.686,2264.957,-- how much and therefore put this factor into the balance or not?
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2264.957,2275.713,"The Commission considered this matter, included in effect that it was unable to determine whether or not the rates would go up, they might or they might not."
1965.636,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2303.772,2319.152,"Well, why would it be and why would it be under your test and unless -- because rates -- if rates can go up and will go up, there isn't going to be any interference with the sound the -- the economical operation under your care?"
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2319.152,2320.608,"Well, I think we would feel if the operation --"
1965.636,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2320.608,2323.494,Could it be -- (Voice Overlap) wholly irrelevant to your case?
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2323.494,2325.317,"No, I don't think so Mr. Justice White."
1965.636,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2496.427,2496.823,"Mr. Loomis, I --"
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2496.823,2497.769,-- that way.
1965.636,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2497.769,2498.372,I beg your pardon.
1965.636,0,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,2515.395,2516.205,Yes.
1965.636,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,2724.764,2728.883,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.636,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2841.276,2855.504,"I didn't understand the -- perhaps I misconstrued Mr. Loomis' statements Mr. Quarles, I didn't understand him to concede that that was the issue."
1965.636,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,2882.905,2884.403,"Yes, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1965.636,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2905.468,2952.977,"I thought his point was that the 11 (b) (1) (A), there is really a maintenance stated negatively and in -- and is referenced by the Court of Appeals' decision and that the question is whether there has been a showing in this record as determined by the SEC that the gas utility system cannot be operated as an independent system without the loss of substantial economies rather than whether substantial economies result from the retention of the gas utility system."
1965.636,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,2964.726,2988.952,"Whether it's phrased negatively or positively or whichever has the burden we come back to the crucial difference between us of whether the test is to be one of really serious by whatever standards you measure it, looking at the total picture, really serious which we agree is a proper test."
1965.636,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3385.825,3386.557,Mr. Quarles --
1965.636,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,3386.557,3387.198,"Yes, sir."
1965.636,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3387.198,3405.694,"Perhaps I had -- I don't quite cover this, 2 (a) (29) has a separate definition of an integrated utilities, electric utility system, separate definition of an integrated gas utility system, is that right?"
1965.636,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,3405.694,3407.453,"Yes, sir."
1965.636,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3407.453,3414.183,The words on which you are relying appear only with respect to the definition of the integrated gas utility system?
1965.636,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,3414.183,3415.237,"Yes, sir."
1965.636,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3415.237,3420.148,They do not appear in the definition of the integrated electric utility system.
1965.636,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,3420.148,3432.881,"And I think that is quite pertinent here, sir because when you are dealing with gas companies, there is no particular advantage in the interconnection."
1965.636,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3432.881,3433.865,"Yes, sir."
1965.636,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,3433.865,3437.97,"Therefore, there is no bonus, if you will, for interconnection."
1965.636,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3437.97,3439.484,"Yes, I understand that."
1965.636,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,3458.852,3460.421,"Yes, sir."
1965.636,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3460.421,3480.329,"Now, it is theoretically conceivable anyway that there might be a determination that substantial economies would be affected as a result of allowing the gas utility system to be operated as an entity."
1965.636,1,32487,john_r_quarles,,3545.669,3555.662,"In both cases, the statute has posed that as one of the requirements for combining separate utilities."
1965.636,2,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,6084.13,6086.2,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1965.636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6229.811,6238.16,"But Mr. Loomis, you announced your version of the test here, do you -- is that the test the Commission fairly applied?"
1965.636,2,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,6238.16,6239.611,"Well, I believe it is."
1965.636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6245.113,6248.231,Do you think these various versions of the test referred to (Inaudible)
1965.636,2,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,6248.231,6248.759,"Well, I'm not sure --"
1965.636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6248.759,6250.587,-- at page 45 of this brief.
1965.636,2,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,6253.362,6272.875,"Knowing that in various cases and in the opinion in this case, there were various formulations but they all seem to come down to two main thrust that the -- that in order to permit retention the system cannot be operated soundly in -- on an independent basis soundly and economically or it cannot be operated --"
1965.636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6272.875,6273.978,"Well, there's one of the --"
1965.636,2,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,6273.978,6282.712,-- on an independent basis without serious impairment which I think means much the same thing.
1965.636,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6282.712,6299.546,"Aren't you saying pretty much that it cannot be operated, if it cannot, cannot means cannot be operated soundly and economically, I suppose in a capitalistic system with private ownership, it means it cannot be operated independently, doesn't it?"
1965.636,2,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,6300.97,6310.23,It that -- if that is the case -- if it -- cannot be operated independently then it is retained by the holding companies --
1965.636,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6310.23,6310.6,Yes.
1965.636,2,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,6311.555,6313.922,It cannot be operated -- I don't say --
1965.636,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6313.922,6315.526,And now you're backing away from that test and that --
1965.636,2,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,6315.526,6318.335,"Yes, I'm get -- I'm backing away from this extent Mr. Justice Stewart."
1965.636,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6329.405,6329.877,"Well, then if (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.636,2,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,6329.877,6330.375,-- court (Voice Overlap) since been applied.
1965.636,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6330.375,6334.306,-- as long as you have private ownership.
1965.636,2,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,6339.453,6340.799,"No, I don't think so."
1965.636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6340.799,6343.535,Do you mean companies that are unsound just go right on.
1965.636,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6343.535,6343.705,"Yes, and --"
1965.636,2,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,6343.705,6344.297,"Well, companies that are --"
1965.636,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6344.297,6345.68,-- non-economic.
1965.636,2,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,6345.68,6351.36,Companies that are unsound and uneconomic probably don't but we're not talking about that.
1965.636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6359.98,6368.084,"Well, there's a -- there's -- which one of these tests says a lost is substantial unless it would render impossible economical, and efficient operation."
1965.636,2,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,6370.321,6379.411,"Well, it's a similar version of the same thing, economical and efficient, sound and economic, they're the same (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6379.411,6384.315,"(Inaudible) cannot and impossible are the same, those are synonyms."
1965.636,2,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,6384.315,6387.463,"I think they are very much the same, yes, sir."
1965.636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6387.463,6390.536,"Well, why shouldn't the Commission tell us what's the test thereof?"
1965.636,2,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,6390.536,6391.074,"Well, I am never --"
1965.636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6391.074,6421.54,"I mean, in your opinion where they're deciding the case?"
1965.636,2,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,6421.54,6457.214,"The test that they -- they put it finally in this way, they hol -- we hold that the Clause must be strictly construed that a registrant seeking to retain an additional system as the burden of showing that is by clear and convincing evidence that such additional system cannot be operated under separate ownership without the loss of economies so important as to cause a serious impairment, which is one of the --"

1965.636,2,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,6468.582,6468.6,Either that --
1965.636,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6468.6,6470.992,Or is it the one you stated a while ago?
1965.636,2,38085,philip_a_loomis_jr,,6470.992,6475.159,"Well, I -- at other times, the Commission and in its opinion is had did."
