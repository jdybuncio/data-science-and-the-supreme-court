2007.06-1321,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.42,"We'll hear argument first today in Case No. 06-1321, Gomez-Perez v. Potter."
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,8.856,38.375,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The government claims in this case that Congress decided to treat retaliation against Federal workers who complain of age discrimination differently than every other species of retaliatory conduct, that for age based retaliation alone Congress created a four part patchwork scheme in which a small cadre of Federal employees have a full judicial remedy, but tens of thousands of others who suffer retaliatory conduct have absolutely no remedies at all."
2007.06-1321,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,66.542,66.958,Excuse me.
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,69.077,71.012,"--Yes, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1321,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,71.012,74.048,"Read it to me, would you?"
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,74.048,75.231,The provision is:
2007.06-1321,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,84.42,88.691,Is retaliation discrimination based on age?
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,99.514,104.833,"With respect, Justice Scalia, I submit it does cover it for at least three reasons."
2007.06-1321,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,116.658,117.075,"No, it's not."
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,129.733,140.791,"Mr. Chief Justice, the issue in this case is whether plaintiff is entitled to allege and ultimately prove that she was... she suffered adverse personnel actions because she complained of age discrimination."
2007.06-1321,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,182.201,189.955,Of course the statute that covers age discrimination in the private sector does have an express provision addressing retaliation.
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,201.062,203.864,"--Mr. Chief Justice, three responses to that."
2007.06-1321,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,225.745,229.63,But in Jackson it was in a different statute and here it's in the same statute.
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,231.413,233.815,"It doesn't in this case, Justice Scalia, for two reasons."
2007.06-1321,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,252.093,254.495,I'm not familiar with that provision.
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,255.83,266.836,--That is the provision that the government cites in its brief and it provides that:
2007.06-1321,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,285.617,287.067,"Well, no."
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,323.675,326.194,"Justice Scalia, if I may, two points."
2007.06-1321,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,359.848,362.448,"Well, why would Congress have taken this drafting approach?"
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,394.935,400.673,"Justice Alito, if I could... the second point I was going to address to Justice Scalia I think answers this, this point."
2007.06-1321,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,426.257,426.607,Why?
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,429.708,431.377,"--You... that's correct, Your Honor."
2007.06-1321,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,494.201,503.007,"The Federal employee, though, has all of the remedies under the Civil Service Reform Act for any type of employment practice."
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,526.506,544.534,"Three points, Mr. Chief Justice: First of all, everything you just said would be equally true of discrimination under Title VII, and yet the government acknowledges that retaliatory conduct for race discrimination claims, sex discrimination claims, can all be brought directly in court, notwithstanding the existence of the CSRA."
2007.06-1321,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,544.534,552.989,"Did the government... well, we'll ask the government, but I thought they kind of qualified that in their brief."
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,569.518,588.663,"Well, I... Justice Ginsburg, I read them to be conceding for purposes of this case and the analysis of this case, and if they're willing to acknowledge, at least for purposes of this case, that all these other retaliatory claims can be brought outside of the CSRA regime, it makes no sense, I submit, to single out retaliation based on age discrimination claims."
2007.06-1321,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,589.546,598.868,"I think you're saying even if, even if that were the case, they would still urge the Court to come out the way they do."
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,602.072,617.682,"--But, Justice Scalia, even if... if... even if taken on the CSRA is the exclusive remedy for retaliation for age complaints and yet not for retaliation under Title VII."
2007.06-1321,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,627.021,628.557,But not retaliation claims.
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,648.668,650.87,"--That's... that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-1321,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,659.542,661.944,Does it cover your client?
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,661.944,667.432,"I don't believe it would, Justice Souter, because she did not suffer an adverse action."
2007.06-1321,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,669.348,672.918,She could complain; it's just that she couldn't go very far with the complaint.
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,672.918,677.187,"--Well, more fundamentally, Justice Ginsburg, she's not covered at all by the CSRA."
2007.06-1321,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,683.024,684.726,But it does that for a reason.
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,713.494,729.772,"Mr. Chief Justice, with respect, the problem with the government's reliance on the statute is that it doesn't... on their view, White House employees and congressional employees have a full judicial remedy for retaliation suffered for raising age discrimination complaints."
2007.06-1321,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,747.65,757.339,"The answer is that it doesn't exclude them, that they have all these collective bargaining rights; they have the civil service rights; they can go and bring their same claim with other remedies."
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,777.269,778.403,"--That's correct, Justice Breyer."
2007.06-1321,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,778.403,785.009,"And then, in 16(d) it says certain of those things govern Federal suits, suits against the Federal Government."
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,816.711,824.7,"Justice Breyer, the... you are right to focus on these remedies, but the remedies themselves are not incorporated as substantive bans."
2007.06-1321,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,848.365,867.027,"Well, you could say that, but you could also say, well, look here in Title VII Congress has some words, and these words give you a specific... if you're a Federal employee and somebody's retaliating against you because you went and complained about race or something, just read those words; you can bring a lawsuit, right?"
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,867.663,868.679,--I don't think so--
2007.06-1321,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,868.679,868.729,No?
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,868.729,870.346,--Justice Breyer.
2007.06-1321,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,872.915,875.15,You go to the EEOC?
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,875.15,881.054,"--Well, you can bring a lawsuit under Title VII if you are a person, an employee or applicant aggrieved."
2007.06-1321,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,881.054,882.787,Where is this stuff?
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,885.439,886.839,"I apologize, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1321,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,887.308,887.774,It's not in your brief.
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,891.21,897.546,"--I am talking about subsection (c) of 717a, the Federal sector provisions of Title VII."
2007.06-1321,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,897.546,899.098,Which we don't have here now.
2007.06-1321,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,900.715,902.4,"Well, I'm not totally certain what I'm talking about either."
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,905.085,930.051,"I'd like to think I... I can illuminate the... the language that authorizes Federal employees to bring suits for violations of Title VII says that if they are aggrieved by final disposition of the complaint, they may bring a civil action under Title VII, and aggrieved... they can bring complaints for violations of subsection (a), which like subsection (a) in our statute says"
2007.06-1321,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,938.873,940.092,Or in violation of--
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,940.092,942.925,"No, it does not say that, Justice Breyer."
2007.06-1321,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,971.378,990.006,"Why is that so clear, because section 2000e, 16(d) says section, whatever it is, f through k of this title, as applicable, shall govern civil actions brought hereunder."
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,997.045,1004.483,"Justice Ginsburg, the language ""as applicable"" I submit has to be referring to whether the case itself would implicate the need for that remedy."
2007.06-1321,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1058.068,1059.868,"--Well, could you proceed with that?"
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1114.587,1128.028,That is the very system that Congress had deemed ineffective to prevent retaliation for the very claims you're talking about in... and that's why it chose to adopt the amendments to Title VII in 1972.
2007.06-1321,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1130.864,1133.749,"--Well, that's sort of begging the question."
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1183.531,1209.566,"--Justice Scalia, I apologize if I wasn't clear in my response, but what I'm saying is that in the Brown case this Court looked at the legislative history of Title VII... excuse me... yes, in 1972 and 1977... and said that the reason Congress adopted these, this new prohibition, was because the very scheme that Justice Breyer is suggesting would have been a fix for whistle blowing was ineffective."
2007.06-1321,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1210.249,1211.434,Then it's ineffective here.
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1211.434,1212.534,--And it is ineffective here.
2007.06-1321,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1212.534,1222.69,"And if it's ineffective here and Congress has made it clear that the only way to cure the ineffectiveness is with a separate provision and you don't have a separate provision, you're out."
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1222.69,1223.775,That's correct.
2007.06-1321,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1247.741,1255.863,"When you qualified your answer by saying that the employee can control, was that a way to dismiss the collective bargaining rights?"
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1255.863,1264.785,"Well, I was talking about actually the... the... you can complain about non adverse actions under the CSRA, but all you can do is ask the Office of Special Counsel to investigate."
2007.06-1321,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1284.866,1289.518,What about review under... by the Merit Systems Protection Board?
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1289.518,1292.953,"That is the remedy under the CSRA, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-1321,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1292.953,1294.972,So when you're talking about the Office of Special Counsel--
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1294.972,1305.695,"If the Office of Special Counsel doesn't pursue the case... and the statistics in the NTEU brief suggest that it rarely... out of thousands and thousands of complaints, it pursued only in a small handful."
2007.06-1321,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1341.819,1346.404,"Mr. Guerra, can you help me on a provision of the statute that I'm a little puzzled about?"
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1364.615,1365.517,That is.
2007.06-1321,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1365.517,1372.554,Is there another provision that is necessary for there to be a remedy against the Federal Government?
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1372.554,1374.906,For retaliation based on race and sex?
2007.06-1321,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1374.906,1376.506,Under Title VII.
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1376.506,1376.939,No.
2007.06-1321,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1377.458,1387.597,"Then... your argument, if I understand it, is that precisely the same language that's found in 2000-16e is found in 233a."
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1387.597,1389.132,633a.
2007.06-1321,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1389.132,1389.882,633a.
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1389.882,1390.798,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
2007.06-1321,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1390.798,1393.0,"And, therefore, the two should be treated alike?"
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1393.0,1394.1,Precisely.
2007.06-1321,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1397.686,1399.771,"In other words, that the language"
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1410.96,1412.062,"--Absolutely, Justice Stevens."
2007.06-1321,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1412.062,1415.18,It's just as simple as those two provisions being exactly--
2007.06-1321,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1415.18,1424.436,"It isn't that simple because the government hasn't conceded that, with respect to Title VII, Federal employees are covered for retaliation."
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1431.439,1448.851,"Justice Ginsburg, even if, as I anticipate, they will not make that concession, the fact of the matter is that the remedial structure of Title VII, the Federal sector provision, confirms that the substantive ban that Justice Stevens read necessarily covers retaliation."
2007.06-1321,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1451.936,1460.209,"--Well, another reason it's not that simple is that under the Age Discrimination Act you have a private remedy that specifically provides for retaliation."
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1467.346,1471.247,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, that is precisely the same... the same is precisely true of Title VII."
2007.06-1321,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1476.834,1484.024,"I thought there was a more express incorporation in Title VII of the private anti retaliation remedy, and you don't have that in this case."
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1484.024,1487.026,"That is true, but our position--"
2007.06-1321,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1487.026,1488.892,So that makes it not precisely the same situation.
2007.06-1321,0,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,1488.892,1502.702,"--Not precisely the same, Mr. Chief Justice, but this Court's... in that case, for example, this court said when you copy language verbatim into another statute, there must be some compelling evidence that you've intended to have given it a different meaning."
2007.06-1321,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1533.657,1535.823,"Thank you, counsel."
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1544.846,1557.605,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Age Discrimination and Employment Act does not expressly prohibit retaliation in the Federal sector context and it should not be read to impliedly prohibits such conduct either."
2007.06-1321,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1557.605,1573.032,"Why not, given the Jackson precedent, where there was a similarly general ban on discrimination and we defined discrimination to include retaliation for complaining about discrimination?"
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1573.032,1582.288,"Justice Ginsburg, the Court did so very, very focused on Title IX, the Court's cases interpreting the language of discrimination in Title IX broadly."
2007.06-1321,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1607.838,1622.381,Would it be... would it be unkind to say that the government's position seems to be that a general ban on discrimination includes a ban on retaliation except when the government is being sued?
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1641.459,1643.944,"I think that would be unfair, Justice Alito."
2007.06-1321,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1749.108,1754.893,"But that's... Mr. Garre, that's traditionally when you're suing the government, you don't get a jury."
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1807.858,1814.348,"--Well, let me try to answer that question, Justice Ginsburg, but I just want to make one final point on Lehman and the statutory construction in that case."
2007.06-1321,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1859.475,1863.579,But you... I recognize it's not absurd.
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1886.743,1897.566,"--Well, we know that Congress in the Civil Service Reform Act, as the Chief Justice noted, we know that it didn't think that additional anti retaliation protections were necessary for some Federal employees."
2007.06-1321,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1926.02,1933.123,"Can you say what the government's position is on Title VII, whether there is a retaliation remedy against the Federal Government?"
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1933.123,1937.393,"As we make clear in our brief, we have not conceded that, Justice Alito."
2007.06-1321,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1939.693,1941.712,What is the government's position?
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1960.141,1971.464,"--I think in practice, Your Honor, we have not challenged the interpretation of the Federal courts that have found that Title VII does incorporate an anti retaliation right."
2007.06-1321,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1972.55,1974.383,Has any Federal court found otherwise?
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1974.383,1979.454,--I'm not aware of a circuit court that has gone the other way on Title VII.
2007.06-1321,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2002.403,2013.877,"So you agree... then you agree with Mr. Garre about the meaning of those words ""as applicable""?"
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2013.877,2019.445,"--Well, this Court actually has interpreted that phrase, v. Radabush."
2007.06-1321,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2075.516,2080.503,Do we know what Congress had in mind when it said don't incorporate private sector?
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2080.503,2082.038,"Well, this Court in the--"
2007.06-1321,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2082.038,2085.639,There must be an explanation for that section.
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2085.639,2088.356,--I don't think there is any legislative history on point.
2007.06-1321,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2105.101,2110.371,Do you agree with your friend that this employee has no remedy under the Civil Service Reform Act?
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2110.371,2110.755,--Yes.
2007.06-1321,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2143.559,2145.911,What could she get... what could she get by way of remedy?
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2159.438,2174.68,"--I believe the remedies are largely co extensive in that the principal remedy that you would get under the Age Act, under the Civil Service Reform Act and I believe under the collective bargaining agreements, although I frankly am not certain about that--"
2007.06-1321,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2174.68,2175.18,What about--
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2175.18,2178.332,"+,... is corrective... is corrective action, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-1321,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2222.711,2223.461,Why is that?
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2227.998,2228.932,--Right.
2007.06-1321,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2228.932,2242.792,"Well, if we imply or incorporate into the Federal anti discrimination remedy an anti retaliation provision, I assume it would be in the same scope as the private anti... the private antiretaliation provision."
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2242.792,2256.582,"Well, then this Court would be directly disregarding the express intent in section 663a, where it says affecting employees or applicants of employees... for employment who are at least 40 years of age."
2007.06-1321,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2258.884,2265.488,"Well, Mr. Garre isn't the most that argument gets you that the only individuals who could complain against retaliation are those over 40?"
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2270.59,2281.881,"--I think that's right, but if we're going to talk about anomalies then we have to recognize that that is an anomalous grant of retaliation protection right that only protects people within the protected class with respect to discrimination."
2007.06-1321,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2281.881,2288.202,"Well, is it any more anomalous than the fact that the only protection of the age protection is simply for people over 40?"
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2293.822,2294.308,If--
2007.06-1321,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2294.308,2295.44,They're just worried about the age.
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2299.242,2302.327,"--I think it's a great deal more anomalous, with respect, Justice Souter."
2007.06-1321,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2314.035,2321.358,"But the same anomaly applies to the private sector, because section 631a applies to the private sector and 631b to the public sector."
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2321.358,2323.827,"--Well, that's not the way the courts have interpreted it, Justice--"
2007.06-1321,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2323.827,2325.227,The language is the same.
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2329.229,2336.051,--What the courts have focused on is the 623d of the private sector provisions.
2007.06-1321,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2336.751,2342.538,But that's no reason why that trumps... any more reason why that trumps 631a than 631b.
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2342.538,2356.464,"--And that's the longstanding interpretation of the EEOC and I don't think there's been any doubt in the courts to date that under the private sector provision you can bring claims for retaliation if you're an employee, and of course that's the way it is under Title VII."
2007.06-1321,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2373.591,2376.86,I don't think it says that... the protection doesn't apply.
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2378.944,2381.663,"--Well, I think that that's right."
2007.06-1321,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2389.435,2394.054,--That's the explanation why the problem doesn't arise in the private sector.
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2402.793,2407.664,--That's not... that's not the way the courts have interpreted for more than 20 years under the statute.
2007.06-1321,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2407.664,2411.566,I though we are talking here a prohibition against taking retaliatory action.
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2413.118,2414.201,It is a prohibition.
2007.06-1321,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2414.201,2414.718,Yes.
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2414.718,2422.956,"Right, and then that would be... their argument is that 663a contains that prohibition, and so therefore it is limited by 631b."
2007.06-1321,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2422.956,2432.429,Isn't this an unusual retaliation case in that the person allegedly retaliated against also has substantive anti discrimination claims?
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2442.404,2444.856,"I wouldn't disagree with that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-1321,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2450.091,2467.069,"Isn't it quite the contrary, Mr. Garre, that most... if you did a statistical analysis of all the cases in which there was a retaliation claim, you doubt that you would find that a very high percentage of those are cases in which the person claiming retaliation is also the person who claimed the underlying discrimination?"
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2467.069,2467.902,I wouldn't doubt that.
2007.06-1321,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2486.961,2489.366,"Are those, are those mostly witness cases?"
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2489.366,2490.458,--I don't know.
2007.06-1321,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2490.458,2493.929,"In other words, it's a witness saying I think so and so was fired because of his age."
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2493.929,2495.489,I don't know the answer to that question.
2007.06-1321,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2495.489,2504.438,"Isn't the typical retaliations claim, though, like the one in this case, whether it's under Title VII or the Age Discrimination Act?"
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2542.817,2545.835,She abandoned that claim at the summary judgment stage.
2007.06-1321,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2613.213,2616.365,That does bring up Justice Alito's point.
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2619.734,2620.934,--With respect--
2007.06-1321,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2620.934,2625.62,Or else that distinction between conduct and status would require you to lose.
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2625.62,2630.691,"--I think if we have the conduct and status alone, then I think you're in the Jackson box."
2007.06-1321,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2710.874,2721.382,Do you think it's plausible that Congress intended to treat the issue of retaliation in the Federal sector differently under the various Federal anti discrimination statutes?
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2721.382,2723.049,"I do think that, Justice Alito."
2007.06-1321,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2787.692,2791.378,"--Mr. Garre, can I go back to the authority you're pointing out for a moment?"
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2810.923,2813.875,"--Well, we... no, Justice Stevens."
2007.06-1321,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2848.165,2853.419,"But the effect of giving the effect to the word ""any"" in this section is in effect to read in this exception."
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2853.419,2853.952,--I think--
2007.06-1321,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2853.952,2854.352,Do you--
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2854.352,2855.702,I think--
2007.06-1321,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2855.702,2856.068,--That's the practical effect?
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2856.068,2857.987,--I think that is the practical effect.
2007.06-1321,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2894.943,2913.807,"Am I right now in thinking, just as a matter of practice, where there is retaliation, a claim of retaliation in respect to race discrimination, Federal Government, that the person making that claim can go to the EEOC and then to court?"
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2914.491,2915.74,That's true--
2007.06-1321,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2915.74,2924.946,"The same thing in respect to age, they can't, and what they have to do is they go through the civil service system or the collective bargaining agreement; is that right?"
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2924.946,2933.535,"--Well, what would happen, if you had an employee alleging discrimination on the basis of age and retaliation, that would be a so called mixed complaint."
2007.06-1321,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2934.902,2938.353,"No, not what they do if their claim is a retaliation claim."
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2938.353,2938.686,--If it's purely--
2007.06-1321,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2938.686,2939.253,Yes.
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2939.253,2943.507,"--a retaliation claim, they'd have to bring it under the protections afforded by the Civil Service Reform Act."
2007.06-1321,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2943.507,2944.107,Yes.
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2962.485,2963.421,I don't have any evidence.
2007.06-1321,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2963.421,2963.854,No.
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2964.337,2964.82,I wasn't--
2007.06-1321,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2964.82,2966.02,Yes.
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2968.389,2978.011,"--Well, I guess, if I could just add though, I don't think there's any reason to doubt that certainly Congress had any concerns about whether the system under the Civil Service Reform Act is working properly."
2007.06-1321,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2978.011,2980.13,But that's drawing something from where you don't know.
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3002.962,3019.355,My assumption is that Congress felt that the back stop protections that were available for Federal workers at the time it passed the Age Discrimination Act and that were subsequently codified by Congress in the Civil Service Reform Act were appropriate for people who complained about age.
2007.06-1321,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3020.105,3023.626,For the people who complained about race.
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3023.626,3026.943,--I don't know the... Congress didn't tell us the answer to that.
2007.06-1321,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3026.943,3038.635,"But I'm asking you, and if you were sitting there writing it, my... my thought... the conclusion that I would reach from what you're saying is you can't think of any reason why you'd treat them differently."
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3038.635,3052.693,"Well, I think the reason would be that Congress viewed age discrimination as materially different than other types of discrimination, and it... either it felt that the risk of retaliation wasn't as great or that the protections... that it didn't need to add protections."
2007.06-1321,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3053.328,3055.528,But why would it have thought that?
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3065.286,3080.596,"--Your Honor, again, Congress didn't say... I'm not... I think you can make the same argument with respect to why it gave Federal employees a jury trial right under Title VII but not under the Age Act, why it gave Federal employees compensatory damages under Title VII but not under the Age Act."
2007.06-1321,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3080.596,3085.949,"Mr. Garre, I just want to make sure I understood something you said before, rather pleadingly."
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3104.261,3105.077,"Well, you can bring them together."
2007.06-1321,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3112.933,3114.633,But there's a different administrative mechanism.
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3114.633,3117.685,"You can bring them both together before the Merit Systems Protection Board, if you're--"
2007.06-1321,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3117.685,3119.354,"Oh, oh, but how about court?"
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3119.354,3128.826,"--Well, in... what would happen there is you would have your proceeding in the Merit Systems Protection Board, which would decide the discrimination claim and the retaliation claim."
2007.06-1321,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3143.336,3148.023,But then you... you would be putting everything under the civil service umbrella and nothing under the--
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3148.023,3148.906,"--No, I don't think so."
2007.06-1321,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3163.48,3168.267,--But if it didn't amount to an adverse action under the Civil Service Act--
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3168.267,3172.585,"If it doesn't amount to an adverse action, then you have to go the route that Congress thought appropriate for--"
2007.06-1321,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3172.585,3173.77,--And you wouldn't get to court.
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3173.77,3179.056,"--Well, you would have... you would... it would be investigated by the Office of Special Counsel."
2007.06-1321,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3179.056,3181.024,"Yes, but it would not be within your control."
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3182.46,3185.878,"It would not, and that's what Congress deemed appropriate for those types of actions."
2007.06-1321,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3185.878,3196.301,"But it seems to me, Mr. Garre, that, following up on Justice Breyer's question of what's the reason for it, the most striking thing to me is that Congress used precisely the same language in the two sections:"
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3212.829,3218.066,But there are at least two material textual differences between Title VII and the ADA... and the Age Act.
2007.06-1321,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3220.749,3226.939,"In the key section describing the prohibition, the language is exactly the same."
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3226.939,3233.943,"--Well, to understand the meaning of that section you have to understand the meaning of the whole section itself including this express incorporation."
2007.06-1321,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3234.493,3237.945,"Mr. Garre, are we going to have to decide the Title VII question in this case?"
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3250.219,3251.538,--The Court does not have to decide the--
2007.06-1321,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3251.538,3282.34,"Counsel, I would have thought the answer to Justice Breyer's question would be: This is an unusual situation where you have the employer writing the law about what the employees can do, and Congress realized, perhaps unlike the situation in Title VII, everybody over 40 would be covered; and every time somebody over 40 was fired or disciplined or didn't get a raise, they could claim that it was age discrimination; and Congress decided that they as the employer didn't want to face that disturbance, particularly since they have the Civil Service Reform Act already."
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3282.34,3289.313,"--I think that that's right, Mr. Chief Justice, and I think this Court recognized similar considerations in the Bush versus Lucas case."
2007.06-1321,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3289.313,3297.851,"--Wasn't there... there was something that was said about this... that doesn't apply to congressional employees or White House employees, that they would have a claim of retaliation."
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3297.851,3299.951,"Well... and that's because Congress gave them one, and this is--"
2007.06-1321,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3299.951,3310.143,"So why would Congress say when you... when it's Congress that's doing the reprisal, we're going to give you a suit, but not if some other--"
2007.06-1321,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3310.143,3328.971,"--I think, at least with respect to congressional employees, I'm not sure that they would have been protected by the Civil Service Reform Act protections that existed for executive agency employees, but... but look at the statutes... and we cite them at page 36 in the appendix and our brief... in those two statutes, Congress used the same substantive prohibition that is in section 633(a):"
2007.06-1321,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3353.153,3354.105,"Thank you, Mr. Garre."
2007.06-1321,2,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,3356.405,3359.157,I'd like to make three points.
2007.06-1321,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3393.747,3394.33,Excuse me.
2007.06-1321,2,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,3402.686,3404.838,--They have no remedies for retaliation under--
2007.06-1321,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3404.838,3406.807,But they have remedies for age discrimination?
2007.06-1321,2,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,3406.807,3409.59,"--They do, Justice Scalia, but my point is--"
2007.06-1321,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3409.59,3410.092,Okay.
2007.06-1321,2,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,3410.092,3425.534,"--Our argument is that it makes no sense to give some people remedies under one scheme and leave some... congressional employees getting full remedial relief, people under the CSRA getting a limited remedial relief, others getting remedies under the collective bargaining rights and thousands of others have no remedies only with respect--"
2007.06-1321,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3425.534,3430.938,"Is that because they may not engage in collective bargaining, or because they have chosen not to?"
2007.06-1321,2,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,3430.938,3432.488,--I believe they are not allowed to.
2007.06-1321,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3434.89,3436.926,To have a remedy.
2007.06-1321,2,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,3436.926,3440.528,Because they simply have none of the remedies the Government has put before--
2007.06-1321,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3440.528,3442.094,Who... who is such a person?
2007.06-1321,2,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,3442.094,3445.848,--An employee of the Transportation Security Administration.
2007.06-1321,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3445.848,3450.067,Why can't they... why can't they go to like the Merit System Protection Board?
2007.06-1321,2,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,3450.067,3453.102,They are excluded from the Civil Service Reform Act.
2007.06-1321,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3453.102,3457.072,"So they are outside the Civil Service, and they don't have unions?"
2007.06-1321,2,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,3457.072,3457.739,They don't have bargaining rights.
2007.06-1321,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3457.739,3458.505,They don't have a union?
2007.06-1321,2,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,3458.505,3459.689,Correct.
2007.06-1321,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3459.689,3462.007,So they could be fired for anything.
2007.06-1321,2,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,3462.007,3470.897,"Well, they have claims for discrimination if they suffer age discrimination directly, but if they complain about age discrimination and then get fired in retaliation, they have nothing."
2007.06-1321,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3472.165,3479.819,I suppose that's consistent with whatever prohibition it is that precludes them from engaging in collective bargaining.
2007.06-1321,2,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,3479.819,3488.859,"--But it's not consistent with their rights under Title VII, Mr. Chief Justice, because as the EEOC has... an... is entitled to deference, it has said, for three decades."
2007.06-1321,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3488.859,3492.496,So you think we do have to decide the Title VII question if you are to prevail.
2007.06-1321,2,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,3492.496,3493.296,I do.
2007.06-1321,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3498.732,3501.868,You should have given us the statute to look at if that's the case.
2007.06-1321,2,30603,joseph_r_guerra,,3501.868,3506.253,"I recognize that, Justice Scalia, and I apologize."
2007.06-1321,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3570.879,3571.695,Thank you counsel.
