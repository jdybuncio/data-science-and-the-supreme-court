1975.74-1656,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,40.44,"We will hear arguments next in 1656, the Moe against the Confederated Tribes in 75-50, a cross-appeal."
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,43.567,48.889,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1656,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,216.35,230.193,"Mr. Haddon, let me ask you something about the Montana Personal Property Tax for licensing vehicles and perhaps I can best put the question by telling you what I understand to be the Virginia Law which is the jurisdiction."
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,247.019,265.303,"The tax is paid at one time, Mr. Justice Rehnquist but there is both a personal property tax on the vehicle itself and a separate fee for registration of the vehicle."
1975.74-1656,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,265.303,270.075,Does the District Court enjoin the enforcement of the fee for the registration of the vehicle?
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,270.075,283.391,"No, the District Court did not, the tribes and the individual members of the tribe who were acting as plaintiffs had indicated their willingness to pay the registration fee not the tax."
1975.74-1656,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,283.391,285.362,And that fee is not an issue here?
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,285.362,287.019,"That fee is not an issue, Your Honor."
1975.74-1656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,287.019,294.527,"What is an issue in addition to the cigarette taxes, simply the personal property tax on the automobile, is that it?"
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,294.527,309.042,"Primarily upon automobiles but also other types of personal property, cattle, farm equipment, items of that sort which are classified under Montana Law as personal property."
1975.74-1656,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,538.889,543.428,"There is no question to put it, it does remain a reservation?"
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,543.428,545.677,That is correct Mr. Justice.
1975.74-1656,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,645.263,648.557,"Mr. Haddon, as to all this, there is not any dispute as there I think."
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,652.388,654.636,Sorry.
1975.74-1656,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,740.623,743.757,Who drew that line originally?
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,743.757,753.799,"The line, of course Your Honor is the direct result of the establishment of the confines of the Flathead Indian Reservation by the treaty of Hellgate in1855."
1975.74-1656,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,753.799,756.219,"So it is not a new line, is it?"
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,756.219,763.877,"Indeed, it is not as it existed for over 100 years."
1975.74-1656,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,919.31,937.548,"According to your arguments, Mr. Haddon, I take it that at least part of your argument is that you are asserting Fourteenth Amendment Claims are you or Fifth Amendment Claims, Equal Protection Claims on behalf of the non-Indian citizens of Montana?"
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,937.548,939.774,That is correct Your Honor.
1975.74-1656,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,947.19,951.86,That is why you need basis for the state to collect the tax is it not?
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,951.86,953.475,I acknowledge that.
1975.74-1656,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1007.894,1015.855,"Mr. Haddon, let me interrupt you further."
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,1025.634,1029.987,The ruling of the District Court was that he did not.
1975.74-1656,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1048.376,1056.075,Is this separate and distinct from the tax on the cigarettes themselves?
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,1056.075,1061.022,"It is a different kind of tax and is imposed upon a different individual, Your Honor?"
1975.74-1656,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1061.022,1062.446,Is it at issue here?
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,1062.446,1064.593,"Yes, it is."
1975.74-1656,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1064.593,1078.19,"Next, is there any Montana statute that makes it a criminal offense for anyone to use a cigarette from an unstamped package?"
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,1078.19,1087.59,It is a criminal offense to buy untaxed paid cigarettes.
1975.74-1656,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1095.324,1116.005,"Well then do you argue that the State of Montana has an interest, a distinct interest in preventing anyone from violating that statute namely the purchase of a non-stamp cigarette package?"
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,1116.005,1151.334,We certainly do Your Honor and we feel that the decision of the District Court to the extent that it upheld the position of the State of Montana that the tax could be pre-collected from non-Indian purchasers is entirely valid because to rule to the contrary would have been an invitation for all of those non-Indian purchasers of cigarettes to violate the law.
1975.74-1656,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1151.334,1160.154,I guess I did not get that argument from your brief focusing on that state interest but you satisfied me now.
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,1163.518,1176.597,Another factor of some importance in connection with this appeal while not directly related to the issue of constitutional Due Process and Equal Protection.
1975.74-1656,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1182.851,1184.401,The Act of 1877?
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,1184.401,1193.753,"Yes, the record shows that the Flathead Reservation was open for settlement."
1975.74-1656,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1225.518,1231.124,Now was that Act applicable to the Flathead Reservation in 1877?
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,1231.124,1232.402,"No, it was not Your Honor."
1975.74-1656,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1232.402,1236.325,And is there any significance in the fact that did not become applicable until when?
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,1237.596,1239.005,1904.
1975.74-1656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1498.946,1500.987,You are arguing both cigarettes and property?
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,1500.987,1501.949,Yes.
1975.74-1656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1501.949,1518.481,"Now how about, assume an automobile was used solely on a reservation, never went off the reservation, solely on a property that had been an Indian Reservation for hundred years?"
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,1518.481,1529.534,Our basic position Mr. Justice White is that it makes no difference whether the particular personal property is used on the reservation entirely --.
1975.74-1656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1529.534,1536.504,"You figure out, you could put your personal property tax on property owned by soldiers on the military reservation."
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,1536.504,1542.58,We suggest that that is not the same proposition.
1975.74-1656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1542.58,1544.064,You say that that is different?
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,1544.064,1545.151,Yes.
1975.74-1656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1560.755,1571.098,"So, your personal property tax could be applied to any personal property that an Indian owned even though he lived on the reservation."
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,1571.098,1571.298,Correct.
1975.74-1656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1571.298,1572.479,And there is only.
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,1572.479,1575.199,Even though if it were use there only.
1975.74-1656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1575.199,1579.74,I take that any authority to that effect you have cited in your brief.
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,1579.74,1588.803,We have cited all the authority that we have and we have no case specifically in point on that subject obviously.
1975.74-1656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1607.34,1613.46,You were permitted to have the Indians the collect the sales tax on sales on non-Indians?
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,1613.46,1615.744,That is correct and that is the subject --
1975.74-1656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1615.744,1618.152,But not to on sales to Indians.
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,1618.152,1618.76,That is correct.
1975.74-1656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1618.76,1621.987,And you could not make them get a license?
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,1621.987,1626.022,That is correct.
1975.74-1656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1651.924,1665.442,"Mr. Haddon, do you think the Court rule that Montana not only could not put the personal property tax on an automobile but could not put it on the automobile even though it was used of the reservation?"
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,1665.442,1671.069,That is the effect as we read the Lower Court’s decision.
1975.74-1656,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1671.069,1682.027,So you think the Court has already decided that Montana may not say to the Indians if you want to use your automobile off the reservation you must pay that?
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,1682.027,1684.76,That is our understanding of the Lower Courts decision.
1975.74-1656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1692.883,1706.493,"Mr. Haddon, if your argument is valid about the discrimination aspects, I take it the same argument would apply to a reservation which had 100% Indian population and also full-bloodied Indians?"
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,1717.344,1725.994,"Like, all advocates, perhaps Mr. Justice Stevens we like to have a position to fall back to."
1975.74-1656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1739.063,1741.807,To the position to which you are falling back that is what I like to know?
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,1741.807,1777.214,"The position to which we fall back is that if the Court should deem it appropriate to accept that interpretation of the law, that we have in this particular case, a unique set of factual circumstances akin to the Oklahoma tax commission case which dictate the application of the rule of that case rather than the application the rule of McClanahan."
1975.74-1656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1777.214,1777.925,The rule being what?
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,1779.657,1783.367,As I read the rule of McClanahan --
1975.74-1656,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1783.367,1786.023,Now what is the rule of the case in which you rely?
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,1786.023,1797.932,That the individual Indian citizen residents of the State of Oklahoma where subject to in that instance an inheritance tax imposed by the State of Oklahoma.
1975.74-1656,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1829.881,1833.868,No time if you hope to save that in fact I think you have used it up.
1975.74-1656,0,41477,sam_e_haddon,,1833.868,1839.95,Thank you very much.
1975.74-1656,1,38612,richard_a_baenen,,1839.95,1842.727,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1656,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1940.42,1943.107,(Inaudible) disposes of all these issues?
1975.74-1656,1,38612,richard_a_baenen,,1943.107,2005.665,"In our view, the McClanahan case and the cases that preceded it Williams v. Lee, Warren Trading Post, Kennerly, Mescalero Apache disposed off this issue with the exception for the one decision by the Court below holding that the State of Montana could force tribal members residing on the reservation to pre-collect the personal property tax that is owed by the non-Indian purchaser when he purchases from a tribal smoke shop as they are called. We do not believe and we believe that McClanahan v. Arizona settled that question that the state cannot force a tribal member to collect a cigarette tax owed by a non-member and for which a non-member is guilty of a state violation should he purchase and have in his property or in his possession such a cigarette tax and the state of Montana has criminal jurisdiction over that non-Indian should he violate the State Law."
1975.74-1656,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2005.665,2016.926,Do we have an issue similar to that in the Tonasket case three or four terms ago that we remanded to the State of Washington Court.
1975.74-1656,1,38612,richard_a_baenen,,2016.926,2018.352,You did Your Honor.
1975.74-1656,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2095.391,2101.391,"So, if I understood you correctly, the Law of Washington now is the same as the Law of Montana now?"
1975.74-1656,1,38612,richard_a_baenen,,2101.391,2105.597,The Law of Washington is the same as the three-judge Court below.
1975.74-1656,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2107.136,2117.413,"The state may collect from Indian sellers the prepayment of taxes on cigarettes sold to non-Indian buyers, is that it?"
1975.74-1656,1,38612,richard_a_baenen,,2117.413,2125.095,Well we get into a very difficult and sticky wicket here.
1975.74-1656,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2189.565,2194.461,How is it done in of State of Washington in the wake of the Tonasket litigation?
1975.74-1656,1,38612,richard_a_baenen,,2194.461,2197.756,I have no knowledge Your Honor; I cannot answer your question.
1975.74-1656,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2198.47,2199.562,That is the law there.
1975.74-1656,1,38612,richard_a_baenen,,2199.562,2219.331,"That is the law, I understand however that there is a case pending in the Ninth Circuit which involves that issue and I understand further that the Ninth Circuit had stayed consideration of the particular issue until upon granting of jurisdiction in this case."
1975.74-1656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2258.154,2263.84,"Mr. Baenen, are you going to devote some part of your oral argument to the Anti-Injunction Act?"
1975.74-1656,1,38612,richard_a_baenen,,2263.84,2268.547,"Most certainly, if the Court would please."
1975.74-1656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2268.547,2271.731,I would like to ask you a question such time as you get to it.
1975.74-1656,1,38612,richard_a_baenen,,2275.946,2276.264,Fine.
1975.74-1656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2285.452,2287.922,McClanahan came up on the Supreme Court of Arizona.
1975.74-1656,1,38612,richard_a_baenen,,2287.922,2288.427,Correct.
1975.74-1656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2288.427,2292.388,So you do not have any problem with the Anti-Injunction Act in McClanahan?
1975.74-1656,1,38612,richard_a_baenen,,2292.388,2293.339,Correct.
1975.74-1656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2293.339,2296.598,So how does McClanahan bear one way or the other on the anti-injunction?
1975.74-1656,1,38612,richard_a_baenen,,2296.598,2297.532,I am sorry Your Honor.
1975.74-1656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2304.582,2305.899,On the merits.
1975.74-1656,1,38612,richard_a_baenen,,2305.899,2306.196,Correct.
1975.74-1656,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2306.196,2315.007,It is before then you leave the merits to move on to my brother Rehnquist’s interest in the Anti-Injunction Act.
1975.74-1656,1,38612,richard_a_baenen,,2324.787,2325.685,To my knowledge --
1975.74-1656,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2325.685,2327.918,This Equal Protection argument is what I am talking about?
1975.74-1656,1,38612,richard_a_baenen,,2327.918,2346.567,Not addressed as an argument as certainly a number of the decision of this Court in which treaty rights have been vindicated by Indians by implication carry with it the fact that they will be treated in a way different from the way that non-Indians are treated.
1975.74-1656,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2398.974,2416.238,"We had the case last term I cannot think, the style for the moment or even the precise issue in which Justice Blackmun wrote the opinion for the Court involving a claim that a preferential hiring policy for Indians on reservations violated both the constitution and their statute."
1975.74-1656,1,38612,richard_a_baenen,,2416.238,2418.23,"Right, Your Honor that was Morton v. Mancari."
1975.74-1656,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2418.23,2419.391,That is the case we have just been discussing.
1975.74-1656,1,38612,richard_a_baenen,,2419.391,2424.535,Correct and also cited on his brief.
1975.74-1656,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2424.535,2432.619,The claim is one that can be raised by the state of should be raise by someone who claims that he or she is being denied Equal Protection?
1975.74-1656,1,38612,richard_a_baenen,,2432.619,2439.223,Your Honor we debated within our own offices to whether or not we should raised that as an issue before the Court.
1975.74-1656,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2455.478,2459.018,The source of the Indian immunity is?
1975.74-1656,1,38612,richard_a_baenen,,2459.018,2474.397,It is a jurisdictional source Your Honor based upon the fact that Congress historically has exercised jurisdiction pursuant to its authority granted by Article 2 Clause 8 Section 3 of the Constitution.
1975.74-1656,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2474.397,2488.86,"I take it, you decided to concede whatever authority the United States had with respect to Indians whether it is rests on the constitution or in the statute ought to be exercised consistent with the Fifth Amendment?"
1975.74-1656,1,38612,richard_a_baenen,,2488.86,2502.81,Certainly any authority that the United States has in terms of Indian affairs has to be exercised consistently with other constitutional provisions just as the authority has to raise and maintain armies must be exercised consistently with other statutory --
1975.74-1656,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2502.81,2511.499,"So, you did not raise the issue, about whether the state could raise this question of Equal Protection?"
