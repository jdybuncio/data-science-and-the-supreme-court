2005.05-502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.938,"We'll hear argument first today in Brigham City, Utah v. Stuart."
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,5.923,8.955,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,73.594,75.828,What were they doing in the yard anyway?
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,87.91,90.285,"Yes, it was justified."
2005.05-502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,117.151,122.418,Is any less required to... to go into the curtilage than is required to go into the house?
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,122.418,124.168,--No.
2005.05-502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,124.168,124.808,No.
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,125.684,126.34,Yes.
2005.05-502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,128.277,136.748,"So you say that even if he didn't see him throw the punch and... and draw blood, they could have gone in just because they heard somebody say, stop, stop, get off me?"
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,136.748,142.374,"--It's our position that they could have, though that's a much closer case."
2005.05-502,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,156.237,159.582,So what... what you're saying is they've got to have a reasonable ground to take the first step.
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,165.536,166.911,"--Yes, it is."
2005.05-502,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,166.911,167.49,That's... that's--
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,167.49,167.88,Yes.
2005.05-502,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,167.88,182.523,"One thing that was left out of the succession of acts... Utah provides for telephone warrants, and there was no attempt to do that."
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,195.308,196.886,Yes.
2005.05-502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,222.517,234.988,"Well, you don't... you don't really mean that if they saw somebody inside with a gun and they heard him saying, I'm going to shoot you in 2 minutes, since they could have gotten a telephone warrant, they would have to had to get a telephone warrant?"
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,234.988,235.473,"No, not at all."
2005.05-502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,235.473,244.553,"I mean, you... you don't want the... the telephone warrant requirement to... to up the ante on... on what it takes to... for the police to go in without a warrant, do you?"
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,244.553,245.631,No.
2005.05-502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,258.322,261.087,But it wouldn't be of the essence if you know you have 2 minutes.
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,263.119,264.213,"--Well, that... that's--"
2005.05-502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,264.213,267.354,"Do you really want the policeman to say I got 2 minutes, you know, dial in and get a warrant?"
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,268.838,276.98,--That... that would be assuming... that would be assuming that you could take someone who is threatening in that manner at his word.
2005.05-502,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,280.169,288.875,Are the police instructed... the city police instructed about when the telephone warrant procedure is appropriate?
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,288.875,291.328,That I... I do not know.
2005.05-502,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,295.11,314.363,"When you speak about a violent situation, would that be limited... would that apply here just because a punch was thrown, or would it be enough that the officers saw some men restraining the young man, or would it be enough if there were violent words being exchanged?"
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,314.363,325.43,"With... with violent words, generally not, though if it's accompanied with a show of immediate force or violence, then yes, in that situation."
2005.05-502,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,354.387,356.936,Did they know that minors were involved?
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,364.328,365.546,That minors were involved?
2005.05-502,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,365.546,365.812,Yes.
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,369.531,371.189,They knew that minors--
2005.05-502,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,371.189,373.266,Or did they just know that minors stay up late at night?
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,373.266,376.455,--They knew that minors were in the back yard.
2005.05-502,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,379.518,381.441,But that's after they went into the back yard.
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,381.441,381.816,--No.
2005.05-502,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,387.833,388.786,They could see that they were minors.
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,388.786,389.927,"Yes, yes."
2005.05-502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,389.927,402.617,"How much... you've been focusing on the violence because of the punch being thrown, but I gather they were called originally because of concern about the noise and disturbance of the peace and all that."
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,402.617,403.351,Yes.
2005.05-502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,403.351,407.275,Is that a sufficient basis for them to have gone into the back yard and proceed from there?
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,407.275,408.854,Well--
2005.05-502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,408.854,409.822,They're just shouting.
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,414.166,424.309,"--Probably not, certainly not where the State is... where the State offers as... as the proffered justification safety, it would not be enough."
2005.05-502,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,449.033,470.663,"--No, but if... if the... if the complaint were... were simply a complaint of noise, and they got to the... the gate, the back fence, and they could hear all the racket inside and there didn't seem to be any practical way to get people to come to the fence to talk to them, wouldn't they have had the right to go through the gate and at least go up to the door and bang on the door?"
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,470.663,471.538,Yes.
2005.05-502,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,471.538,472.944,So they could have gotten through the curtilage.
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,476.258,477.024,Yes.
2005.05-502,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,477.024,477.508,Okay.
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,477.508,477.758,Yes.
2005.05-502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,477.758,482.071,"Except that there was a front door, which they approached first."
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,484.322,485.526,Yes.
2005.05-502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,485.526,486.713,So they could have banged on the front door.
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,486.713,495.464,"They... they could have, though the evidence was that... and the trial court found that it was so loud and tumultuous that nobody would have heard it or probably would not have heard it."
2005.05-502,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,495.464,496.808,But I'm a little puzzled.
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,511.406,512.938,Absolutely.
2005.05-502,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,528.8,535.88,"So if you're going to rely on the safety and the... safety and the danger of harm, how serious does the harm have to be?"
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,544.491,545.397,No.
2005.05-502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,559.306,572.732,Doesn't yelling so loudly you can't hear police knock at the door at 3:00 in the morning suggest that violence is at least imminent or may well be associated with what they're hearing?
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,572.732,579.733,"It certainly approaches that, but again, what we would maintain is there probably has to be more than simple shouting."
2005.05-502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,587.969,601.926,"Is there, in addition to the safety rationale which you're... justification, which you're arguing here... is there a justification to go in to stop an ongoing felony whether safety is involved or not?"
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,601.926,602.942,Yes.
2005.05-502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,602.942,604.098,Is... is that a separate--
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,604.098,605.27,Yes.
2005.05-502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,605.958,618.163,"--I mean, you see a guy turning out counterfeit dollar bills, $100 bills, and can you go in right away if you see him doing that?"
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,618.163,622.835,"--Well, it's a crime ongoing, in progress."
2005.05-502,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,636.37,639.434,"Well, I mean, but if that's the case, you have a much easier argument."
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,641.466,651.17,"Yes, and certainly where officers have reason to believe that there's an ongoing assault, officers can enter."
2005.05-502,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,661.517,664.268,"In connection with the answer you just gave, it doesn't matter then?"
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,673.675,685.177,"--Well, this Court in Welsh indicated that minor offenses... you couldn't rely on the exigent circumstances exception, or at least it is what it suggested."
2005.05-502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,698.728,701.994,Any kind of assault.
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,706.448,719.404,"Well, under Utah law, an assault is defined as unlawful force or violence so as to... with an intent to do bodily injury."
2005.05-502,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,798.484,807.455,"Let me just ask this one question, if I may, if you have... did the other side preserve the right to challenge this entry under the Utah constitution?"
2005.05-502,0,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,807.455,811.58,"No, they did not, and... and the Utah Supreme Court recognized that."
2005.05-502,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,811.58,813.706,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.05-502,1,38126,paul_j_mcnulty,,826.38,830.006,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court--"
2005.05-502,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,853.668,858.388,"So if there were no punch in this case, would they have had a sufficient basis?"
2005.05-502,1,38126,paul_j_mcnulty,,866.358,867.467,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.05-502,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,876.719,877.751,"Well, that's just because it's loud?"
2005.05-502,1,38126,paul_j_mcnulty,,879.61,884.955,"--Well, it would depend on... if... if words are going to be the key--"
2005.05-502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,884.955,886.175,One thing leads to another.
2005.05-502,1,38126,paul_j_mcnulty,,886.69,889.504,"--Well, that's correct."
2005.05-502,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,895.895,899.615,So there has to be some indication of the likelihood of escalation into violence?
2005.05-502,1,38126,paul_j_mcnulty,,899.615,901.521,"--Correct, Your Honor."
2005.05-502,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,901.991,902.491,"Well, why?"
2005.05-502,1,38126,paul_j_mcnulty,,910.633,924.605,"--Well, Your Honor, if there's a loud noise alone, certainly the neighborhood shouldn't have to be a hostage to that noise, and the police officers may be acting reasonably to do what is necessary to end that noise."
2005.05-502,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,925.699,927.074,So then it doesn't matter what's being said.
2005.05-502,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,927.074,928.184,So then it does matter.
2005.05-502,1,38126,paul_j_mcnulty,,928.184,939.827,--But the... what's being said may determine... may determine... whether or not entry is necessary to respond to an imminent threat where a prompt response is critical.
2005.05-502,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,939.827,945.405,"It may determine what is necessary to prevent harm, but what if it's not necessary to prevent harm, just necessary to prevent noise?"
2005.05-502,1,38126,paul_j_mcnulty,,945.405,947.703,Then it may still be reasonable.
2005.05-502,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,949.813,953.252,"It seems to me the harm inquiry in this case is, you know, sort of superfluous."
2005.05-502,1,38126,paul_j_mcnulty,,954.674,956.237,"I agree, Your Honor."
2005.05-502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,965.801,966.817,"Well, no."
2005.05-502,1,38126,paul_j_mcnulty,,992.291,996.042,"--Justice Scalia, in most cases a knock on the door would... would be appropriate thing to do."
2005.05-502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,996.042,997.152,Not appropriate.
2005.05-502,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,997.761,998.37,Necessary.
2005.05-502,1,38126,paul_j_mcnulty,,998.37,1001.121,"Well, it may very well be necessary depending upon the totality of the circumstances."
2005.05-502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1001.121,1001.824,I hope so.
2005.05-502,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1003.215,1008.122,"Yes, but we've got a case in which knocking on the... the noise is so loud nobody can hear the knock."
2005.05-502,1,38126,paul_j_mcnulty,,1008.122,1012.624,That's why a knock on the door may not always be the right thing to do.
2005.05-502,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1019.626,1020.235,"And they did knock on the door, yes."
2005.05-502,1,38126,paul_j_mcnulty,,1020.235,1024.548,"--They entered and announced their presence, and they were not heard when they did that."
2005.05-502,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1116.693,1118.944,This wasn't... this wasn't a domestic violence case.
2005.05-502,1,38126,paul_j_mcnulty,,1148.137,1157.999,"--It is, Justice Ginsburg, to look at the... the threat to the quiet of the community as one aspect of this."
2005.05-502,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1187.536,1195.085,"Well, counsel, let's suppose you have a police officer who knows there's evidence in this house, but he doesn't have probable cause to get a warrant."
2005.05-502,1,38126,paul_j_mcnulty,,1229.483,1230.733,"--Permissible, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.05-502,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1230.733,1231.249,Really.
2005.05-502,1,38126,paul_j_mcnulty,,1231.249,1242.283,"Because there the officer is unaware of the fact based upon the... as I understood the facts presented, unaware of the fact that that is not--"
2005.05-502,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1242.283,1243.627,"Oh, no."
2005.05-502,1,38126,paul_j_mcnulty,,1258.349,1261.239,--If the officer has specific information--
2005.05-502,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1261.239,1261.662,Right.
2005.05-502,1,38126,paul_j_mcnulty,,1261.662,1272.915,"--a fact knowing that this is not truly an imminent threat or necessary to prompt a quick response, then that would be a fact in the totality of the circumstances that wouldn't justify."
2005.05-502,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1274.15,1281.713,So you're saying the objective... the... the objective officer always knows at least as much as the officers actually know.
2005.05-502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1281.713,1284.214,--A good way to put it.
2005.05-502,1,38126,paul_j_mcnulty,,1284.214,1285.949,--The... the officer knows--
2005.05-502,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1285.949,1287.371,Isn't... isn't that your standard?
2005.05-502,1,38126,paul_j_mcnulty,,1287.371,1289.746,"--Well, if... I'm not sure if I understand the question."
2005.05-502,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1290.48,1290.855,Yes.
2005.05-502,1,38126,paul_j_mcnulty,,1313.861,1314.705,Right.
2005.05-502,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1314.705,1319.268,--from our objective test when the officer actually has that information.
2005.05-502,1,38126,paul_j_mcnulty,,1319.268,1320.253,That's correct.
2005.05-502,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1320.253,1320.753,Okay.
2005.05-502,1,38126,paul_j_mcnulty,,1320.753,1325.66,What makes it difficult at times is that you often have two officers.
2005.05-502,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1330.272,1335.647,Except I... I don't think we look to whether he knew that this was a family reenactment.
2005.05-502,1,38126,paul_j_mcnulty,,1351.667,1354.041,"--Thank you, Justice Scalia."
2005.05-502,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1430.84,1431.152,"Thank you, General."
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,1434.496,1439.576,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-502,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1481.194,1482.319,What... what--
2005.05-502,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1482.319,1489.602,"I thought that probable cause was conceded, and I thought that the Utah courts didn't question that there was probable cause."
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,1489.602,1511.497,"Your Honor, the... what happened was that the Utah courts found that the probable cause was there for the emergency aid exception, but I believe under the exigent circumstances requirement... or the exception, that probable cause was not there to get out... or actually to get into the home on the situations."
2005.05-502,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1522.703,1525.001,--May... may I just get back to your general statement?
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,1547.709,1549.319,"Correct, Your Honor."
2005.05-502,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1560.947,1563.15,Let's say they... they see a fight going on.
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,1591.468,1600.141,"Justice Alito, what the officer is required to do is to weigh the totality of the circumstances and make a decision based upon the totality of what they see."
2005.05-502,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1624.46,1626.475,Why can't you?
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,1659.373,1666.952,"Except for the fact, Your Honor, I mean, the... the situation we have is that is... it would depend on whether it's an ongoing situation or not."
2005.05-502,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1672.158,1673.611,You mean... you mean the noise stopped?
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,1673.611,1685.254,"--It... shortly after the smacking in the face by the juvenile, Your Honor, the officer entered the home, and by his testimony, it abated right after he entered the home."
2005.05-502,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1685.254,1686.395,No.
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,1694.959,1696.757,It had not stopped.
2005.05-502,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1697.788,1697.866,Okay.
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,1727.278,1735.358,"Your Honor, what makes that opinion wrong, based upon the facts that were presented, is the fact that the... there was no warrant achieved in the situation."
2005.05-502,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1737.578,1740.843,And there are two reasons why he didn't want to go get a warrant.
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,1763.646,1767.068,"--That may be what he thought, not the officer--"
2005.05-502,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1767.068,1769.506,Those are the reasons why it was reasonable to go in.
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,1769.506,1770.725,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.05-502,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1770.725,1771.881,"Now, what's wrong with that opinion?"
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,1771.881,1775.57,"What's wrong with the opinion, Your Honor, is it still requires a warrant under the situation."
2005.05-502,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1775.57,1786.198,"Now, suppose I were to say at the end of that it doesn't require a warrant because it was not unreasonable objectively to go in under those circumstances."
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,1788.261,1795.183,"Your Honor, the... if they're going to enter the home, there has to be, obviously, a serious situation that's going to arise."
2005.05-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1804.404,1811.532,"Mr. Studebaker, I'm not sure that even the noise wasn't enough to justify what the police did here."
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,1824.377,1826.206,Yes.
2005.05-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1826.206,1828.019,And then only went in when nobody heard them.
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,1868.794,1874.124,"Justice Scalia, and you asked whether I thought it was reasonable or not, and I would say it's not."
2005.05-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1914.429,1916.226,They didn't hear him when he... when he just opened the screen door.
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,1921.977,1924.352,"And, Justice Scalia, he also had to raise his voice, and our contention--"
2005.05-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1924.352,1926.134,"Of course, he had to raise his voice."
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,1948.186,1950.03,"--Yes, Your Honor, he would have to get a warrant."
2005.05-502,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1951.624,1955.031,"Does it say that in a case somewhere, or is that just your opinion?"
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,1955.031,1957.328,"--It's my opinion, Your Honor."
2005.05-502,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1957.328,1957.688,All right.
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,1985.053,1991.18,"Your Honor, I believe Mincey itself requires the... the seriousness of the offense be evaluated, and further--"
2005.05-502,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1991.18,1992.039,Which case?
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,1992.039,1993.055,--Mincey v. Arizona.
2005.05-502,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1993.055,1995.649,Was that involving a... is that in this Court?
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,1996.243,1996.431,Yes.
2005.05-502,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1996.431,2000.243,"And was that involving a party or noise, or what was it involving?"
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2000.243,2001.603,"No, it was not involving a party or noise."
2005.05-502,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2001.603,2002.15,No.
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2012.294,2013.044,Correct.
2005.05-502,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2013.044,2016.436,What was in question was the search after the premises had been secured.
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2016.436,2017.935,"Correct, and--"
2005.05-502,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2017.935,2024.015,"And I don't see how that helps you because here, in the course of securing the... the premises, they had all... all the evidence they needed."
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2024.015,2031.062,"--And... and to answer the Court's question, there is nothing that I'm aware of where this Court has come out and said that a party is--"
2005.05-502,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2031.062,2031.797,So Mincey doesn't help.
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2031.797,2032.61,--Correct.
2005.05-502,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2033.344,2035.767,"I mean, I wouldn't want this to be the party case."
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2067.368,2069.726,"--I don't believe there's anything that specifically says that, Your Honor."
2005.05-502,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2096.936,2100.749,"Well, it was... it was over until somebody threw the next punch."
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2129.615,2132.287,"Not completely, Justice Souter."
2005.05-502,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2168.326,2175.25,"You don't... you can't attribute what you just said to the trial court, and you emphasize the trial court's findings."
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2225.37,2228.512,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, they should have knocked."
2005.05-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2229.839,2233.184,"Why isn't screaming, police, enough?"
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2261.8,2276.21,"Your Honor, and I think the reason the... the trial court and... is concerned about the knocking issue is it's, if you will, the baseline requirement under the Fourth Amendment, under the facts of this case, was to make their presence known by knocking."
2005.05-502,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2276.21,2286.977,"No, but the... as I understand the... the trial court, he accepted the probability that the knock would be futile, and yet he thought as a formality it was nonetheless required."
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2296.041,2296.494,"I'm sorry, Justice Souter."
2005.05-502,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2297.948,2309.998,"Well, did... do you understand the trial court to have taken the position that even though the knock would probably have been futile, the police were required to... to make it anyway, to knock anyway?"
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2309.998,2311.467,That is what the trial court--
2005.05-502,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2311.467,2317.546,"And... and do you understand that to be a Fourth Amendment requirement, i.e., no futility exception?"
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2317.546,2323.344,"--I do, Your Honor, and I know that that's a... a complicated issue, but it's still a requirement."
2005.05-502,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2324.954,2326.907,Why should there be no futility exception?
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2326.907,2335.425,"--Well, even if there is, Your Honor, the trial court did not just say that... there... he... the evidence was gone because of the failure to knock."
2005.05-502,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2341.692,2348.85,"Well, that... that may be on your argument that noise is never sufficient to dispense with a warrant requirement."
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2371.527,2374.543,"I... I agree, Your Honor, and this is why."
2005.05-502,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2376.262,2382.982,Why... why should we require a... a futile act in the name of reasonableness?
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2382.982,2398.267,"--Your Honor, first, it wouldn't have taken any effort at all to follow through on this, and even though this Court has ruled that, you know, there is mandatory knock and announce... or requirement, with some exceptions, I don't believe that this is one of those exceptions."
2005.05-502,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2398.267,2399.158,No one is denying that.
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2401.94,2402.299,Correct.
2005.05-502,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2402.299,2413.755,"But the question is do you have to knock and announce when, on the facts before you, it is apparent that nobody will hear the knock and it will just be a wasted gesture."
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2413.755,2414.817,Yes.
2005.05-502,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2414.817,2415.88,Why?
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2415.88,2423.631,"Because, Your Honor, it's our position that it's one of the... the threshold requirements to protect somebody when they're inside their home is to make that effort."
2005.05-502,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2423.631,2432.884,"But isn't the standard of the Fourth Amendment a reasonableness standard, and isn't there something bizarre about saying reasonableness requires a totally futile gesture?"
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2432.884,2438.744,"That was the finding of the court, Your Honor, the trial court, that it was futile."
2005.05-502,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2450.574,2453.028,"Well, yes, that's why courts review these things."
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2453.028,2453.951,"--Correct, and that is--"
2005.05-502,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2453.951,2466.329,"And if the court says, yes, based on the evidence before me, it would have been futile, do you think Fourth Amendment reasonableness requires the court and ultimately the officer to demand the knock anyway?"
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2466.329,2470.58,--Personally?
2005.05-502,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2471.767,2473.346,Okay.
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2473.346,2480.8,"I mean, I am not going to try... but, again, this Court... the... the courts below did say that that exigent circumstances didn't rise to the level--"
2005.05-502,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2480.8,2483.973,Where did the... where did the trial court say that in the findings of facts?
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2483.973,2485.224,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2005.05-502,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2485.224,2487.349,I'm looking at the findings of facts.
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2512.104,2519.341,"Your Honor, if I look at paragraph 5 of the joint appendix... or I'm sorry... of the... of the order, it says, at that point in time the court finds no exigent--"
2005.05-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2519.341,2519.622,Where is it?
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2519.622,2520.747,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2005.05-502,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2526.982,2532.108,"Yes, but what it says right after that to explain is it would have been sufficient."
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2540.36,2550.613,"Your Honor, and again, this isn't the, maybe, best worded order that the city has prepared in this case when they... when the... it was actually the city that prepared this, petitioners."
2005.05-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2575.666,2583.089,"You know, maybe... maybe you're taking our announce and a knock... knock and announce requirement too... too seriously or too literally."
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2595.28,2595.858,Your Honor--
2005.05-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2595.858,2599.171,You really think you got to knock even when the door is open.
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2599.171,2603.156,"--Your Honor, under the situation, he's got to make his presence known."
2005.05-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2603.156,2603.923,Okay.
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2604.923,2606.392,And--
2005.05-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2606.392,2606.954,He stood at the door.
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2608.376,2609.674,--And--
2005.05-502,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2609.674,2615.738,"--which he thought would be more effective than knocking on... on the... you know, the... the edge of a screen door, which doesn't make a very good knock."
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2617.097,2624.302,"--And once he raised his voice, though, Your Honor, and... and made himself a little bit more vocal, then they noticed him there."
2005.05-502,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2625.114,2626.474,But they still didn't stop.
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2638.853,2644.4,"--Chief Justice, like you say, once they made their presence known, it dissipated."
2005.05-502,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2656.449,2669.921,"Well, there seemed to be agreement that they couldn't have made their presence known because the noise inside was so loud that they would not have been heard."
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2669.921,2676.172,That's what the... the lower courts have found to be true.
2005.05-502,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2703.241,2717.884,"Well, was there anything in the facts that a reasonable officer would know from looking in the window to suggest that these... the adults were not... did not have the intention of inflicting some sort of serious injury on this young man that they were restraining?"
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2717.884,2732.341,"Based upon the officer's testimony at the suppression hearing, Your Honor, it would be that they did not have a serious intention to harm him is the fact that, one, there was nothing showing that they were actually doing anything more than restraining him, that juvenile."
2005.05-502,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2737.17,2740.514,They had... did they have any reason to know why they were holding him?
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2740.514,2745.219,"--I would say that they would, Justice Alito, and this is why."
2005.05-502,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2793.901,2812.983,The Utah Supreme Court seemed to be puzzled by your failure to raise the Utah protection against the... the counterpart to the Fourth Amendment.
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2828.752,2840.817,"Justice Ginsburg, I was not the trial counsel below or at the appellate court, so I cannot determine what his matter was or what... what his basis was for that decision."
2005.05-502,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2865.479,2869.401,May I ask?
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2883.702,2886.39,"Your Honor, the proceedings have been dismissed against my clients."
2005.05-502,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2898.955,2901.268,What are the penalties for those charges?
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2901.268,2907.472,"Worst case scenario, Your Honor, they could be charged with up to 6 months in the county jail, each one consecutive to each other."
2005.05-502,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2907.472,2910.739,That's the major matter we're resolving today.
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2910.739,2911.176,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.05-502,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2911.176,2916.568,What is the actual evidence that was suppressed?
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2922.335,2933.291,"Mr. Chief Justice, the evidence was... that was suppressed was everything that the officer or officers saw once they entered the home and/or heard once they entered the home, basically anything that they obtained once they entered the home."
2005.05-502,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2934.26,2938.494,Couldn't they have gotten all... wouldn't he have been able to testify to all of that without even entering the home?
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2938.494,2940.433,"--They could have, Your Honor."
2005.05-502,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2956.202,2962.344,"Yes, but among the evidence they did have was that two... two teenagers were drinking beer in the back yard."
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2966.985,2973.159,"It could have, Your Honor, but I don't know why it did not except for the fact that it could have been built into the curtilage--"
2005.05-502,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2973.159,2977.019,"This wasn't kind of constructed as a test case, by any chance, was it?"
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2977.019,2978.723,"--No, it was not, Your Honor."
2005.05-502,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2980.019,2981.176,"Well, not by you."
2005.05-502,2,36609,michael_patrick_studebaker,,2981.176,2982.161,"--No, it was not, Your Honor."
2005.05-502,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3046.066,3047.566,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.05-502,3,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,3050.879,3059.552,Just a matter of clarification initially.
2005.05-502,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3092.779,3099.968,Don't you think the evidence that was available without going in the house would have supported all those charges?
2005.05-502,3,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,3099.968,3101.296,Not the intoxication.
2005.05-502,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3102.921,3104.625,But two teenagers in the back yard were intoxicated.
2005.05-502,3,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,3104.625,3106.86,--The... the juveniles.
2005.05-502,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3110.36,3113.002,"Oh, they charge that the adults were intoxicated."
2005.05-502,3,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,3113.002,3114.081,Yes.
2005.05-502,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3114.081,3115.674,"Well, that's a serious crime in Utah I guess."
2005.05-502,3,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,3120.706,3124.847,We anticipated that comment actually.
2005.05-502,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3127.301,3128.817,And what's your response?
2005.05-502,3,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,3129.223,3138.335,"--Normally... normally intoxication... we think of it as... as public intoxication, and... and that's where it's usually prosecuted and where we find it."
2005.05-502,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3145.821,3151.384,"Counsel, you have... you have two questions presented."
2005.05-502,3,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,3166.887,3170.436,"Well, the court created two different tests."
2005.05-502,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3273.286,3280.241,My point was simply that this was not a 911 call from a distressed spouse.
2005.05-502,3,30526,jeffrey_s_gray,,3293.588,3304.105,"The initial response was clearly to the noise, but once the officers arrived, it became apparent that there was violence ongoing in the house and that's how the officers proceeded."
2005.05-502,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3310.856,3314.856,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
