1989.89-1433,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,15.26,"We'll hear argument now in No. 89-1433, United States against Shawn D. Eichman, et al., and 89-1434, United States against Mark John Haggerty, et al.--"
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,19.045,22.58,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-1433,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,402.128,404.497,"General Starr, I don't understand this line of argument."
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,430.379,434.099,The message itself enjoys the same protection.
1989.89-1433,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,439.335,442.087,"Well, what you convey by burning the flag is, ""I hate the United States""."
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,442.087,449.609,"--With all due respect, that is not what is set forth in any of the statements in this record."
1989.89-1433,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,470.955,479.461,By reason of which he felt so strongly about it that it moved him to... to have feelings of animosity towards the country.
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,493.888,497.923,"I think that assumes too much, with all respect."
1989.89-1433,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,510.398,519.253,"General Starr, I wonder if, given Justice Scalia's interpretation of the obvious meaning of this conduct, maybe you should try to ban it on the grounds that it's misleading speech?"
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,522.388,534.363,"--It may in say... in fact say too much, and more than the actor intended to convey, if in fact Justice Scalia is correct."
1989.89-1433,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,534.363,539.0,Are you saying that this is an invalid form of protest?
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,539.0,558.144,"In our judgment, it is conduct, and conduct gives much greater latitude to Congress as long as Congress does not do as the State of Texas did in Texas against Johnson, and that is, pass a statute that was not viewpoint neutral."
1989.89-1433,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,586.814,609.346,"Well, suppose... suppose we uphold the statute and sustain your position, and on sentencing, a district judge said, because you have outraged the community, because your protest was so public, because you have offended so many, I'm going to give you a harsh sentence."
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,612.631,618.452,I think that's one of the reasons Congress saw fit to pass the reform statute that has given us sentencing guidelines.
1989.89-1433,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,622.504,630.677,"I don't know if it's in the guidelines or not, but suppose that, permissibly within the guidelines, the district court said that."
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,633.228,641.484,"--As long as it were within the statutory maximum, I believe it would be constitutionally permitted, yes."
1989.89-1433,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,642.634,650.238,But isn't that precisely what we said could not be done in... in the Gregory case?
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,650.238,666.183,"Well, what... it seems to me that is going on here is that Congress has focused on a specific act of conduct, and it has said, why is it that we are prohibiting this conduct."
1989.89-1433,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,796.984,803.221,Does desecration of one's own... one's own self-constructed house of worship--
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,803.221,805.488,--It may very well... it may very well--
1989.89-1433,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,805.488,807.456,--Do you think that would be allowed?
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,807.456,809.125,--I think that... I think that raises--
1989.89-1433,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,809.125,810.425,It raises the same question we have here.
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,810.425,812.16,"--I don't think so, with all due respect."
1989.89-1433,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,853.237,854.404,But let's come back to house of worship.
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,865.509,877.667,"Well, I think that once we move into the religious area, we are raising other values, namely, values in the establishment clause with respect to how government acts."
1989.89-1433,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,892.66,902.3,We prohibit Torah burning and all religious symbols that are sacred to any religious group.
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,902.3,903.217,If in fact--
1989.89-1433,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,903.217,904.167,That would be all right?
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,904.167,921.512,"--If it is protecting it not from criticism but from physical destruction or mutilation... that's what we're talking about, physical destruction or mutilation, that one can protect those things that are special to us as a people."
1989.89-1433,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,956.202,961.256,"General Starr, does the record show the ownership of the flag in these particular cases?"
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,961.256,964.708,"--In the... yes, the record does."
1989.89-1433,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,982.151,988.823,"And in Seattle they were also indicted for destruction of government property, were they not?"
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,988.823,989.873,That is exactly right.
1989.89-1433,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1001.981,1002.664,And Count 1 remains pending?
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1002.664,1007.618,Count 1 remains pending by virtue of this being on a motion to dismiss.
1989.89-1433,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1007.618,1029.983,"We don't like, Mr. Starr, to compare our flag with any other flag, but would you be concerned if in Eastern Europe or some foreign country a government punished demonstrators for marching with a defaced flag in support of the demonstrators' cause for freedom?"
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1029.983,1037.72,"I think those are considerations, Justice Kennedy, that are very important for Congress to weigh in the balance."
1989.89-1433,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1040.672,1051.564,"Well, but isn't the point that this is a recognized... internationally recognized form of protest?"
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1051.564,1061.086,"--It certainly, at this particular stage in our history, is affiliated or associated with forms of protest."
1989.89-1433,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1077.964,1078.531,"Well, you can take it two ways."
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1091.505,1092.107,I'm sorry.
1989.89-1433,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1153.964,1164.153,"But in fact there is only one viewpoint: that you do not mutilate, deface, defile or trample upon the flag in order to show your love for the country."
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1164.153,1190.986,"I would urge the Court, before it came to that view driven by today's newspapers, to read carefully the Senate's brief, the House of Representative's leadership brief which sets forth the history of flag statutes but of instances in the country in our history where individuals were not expressing any outrage at all against the country."
1989.89-1433,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1195.072,1196.874,"But Mr. Starr, you're missing my point."
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1200.076,1205.48,--Thank you.
1989.89-1433,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1209.182,1233.847,"You started by pointing out to us that Congress had taken out of the original Section 700(a) the phrase ""casts contempt upon the flag"", but do you really think that in fact there is any difference so long as the words that they describe to protect the physical integrity of the flag are"
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1257.163,1261.781,"The term ""defaces"" would in fact encompass activity, conduct."
1989.89-1433,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1298.87,1317.598,"Well, General, I thought at the outset you suggested that burning this flag really didn't have any message of its own anyway in this case, on the facts of this case, that it was just... that there was just a flag burning to call attention to some other messages that had nothing to do with the flag."
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1322.235,1323.102,Exactly right.
1989.89-1433,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1323.752,1326.687,The only thing is that in this case they burned the flag.
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1326.687,1339.281,"--They burned in addition... not these appellees, but during the course of the demonstration there was also burned the McDonald's Golden Arches flag from a nearby restaurant."
1989.89-1433,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1371.3,1376.637,This is like just an over-loud loudspeaker?
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1376.637,1381.441,"That, I think, is the most apt analogy."
1989.89-1433,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1382.641,1383.893,"General Starr, can I ask you one question?"
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1383.893,1384.726,Please.
1989.89-1433,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1384.726,1391.046,"I may have missed it because there are so many briefs here, but do you know what the experience of our other democratic nations is?"
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1394.432,1412.626,"Most do, and as the ACLU's brief points out most go considerably farther, and in fact make punishable acts of defamation, saying words of disrespect to the president of the country and the like."
1989.89-1433,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1426.303,1428.019,General Starr... excuse me.
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1445.53,1446.966,We do not.
1989.89-1433,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1448.199,1454.536,"--Don't you think they would protest if we allowed our people to burn the Tricolor, although we do not allow our people to burn--"
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1454.536,1466.511,"--In response to your question, the State Department does not in fact register protests as a matter of routine policy when a flag of the United States is burned in another country."
1989.89-1433,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1466.511,1472.146,"--Now, what if the French feel differently and they protest to our State Department?"
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1487.174,1501.332,"Oh, it may be with respect to the consideration of the interests of foreign governments we might in fact seek to provide protections informed by international law, but we would have to be guided, if we were to do that, by Booz against Barry."
1989.89-1433,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1509.754,1517.944,"So you are saying we could prohibit the burning of the German flag, or, you know, the Iranian flag... whatever?"
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1517.944,1520.496,I am not saying we could or we could not.
1989.89-1433,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1565.59,1571.911,Did Congress identify its constitutional source of authority for enacting the flag statute?
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1571.911,1577.046,There is nothing to my knowledge specifically in the legislative history.
1989.89-1433,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1595.34,1602.263,"We have no authority for making a criminal act against something that violates our inherent sovereignty, I take it?"
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1602.263,1603.046,--I beg your pardon?
1989.89-1433,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1603.046,1609.35,There is no authority in this Court for making a criminal act out of something that violates inherent sovereignty?
1989.89-1433,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,1609.35,1625.296,"Oh, if it lies within the proper power of Congress to create, then it seems to me... as long as one answers that question yes, Congress had the power to create the flag, then it seems to me it has the power to protect that flag neutrally."
1989.89-1433,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1627.779,1628.998,"Very well, General Starr."
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,1631.95,1634.984,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2169.05,2169.9,"Mr. Kunstler, excuse me."
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2171.033,2171.968,"--Oh, pardon me."
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2173.118,2185.56,"--Could the Congress prohibit use of the flag for commercial purposes, let's say a law preventing printing the flag on beer cans?"
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2185.56,2189.364,I think myself that that could be... and we've had decisions in that respect--
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2189.364,2189.88,Now that worries me.
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2190.964,2200.153,"--Well, I think when you're dealing with commercial use of the flag, you're not expressing an idea that I think is worthy of protection under the First Amendment."
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2221.382,2222.001,"Well, what about--"
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2222.001,2223.767,It's unworthy of First Amendment protection.
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2223.767,2235.891,"--What about an American automobile company that wanted to urge people to buy American cars rather than Japanese cars and could do so more effectively if they... you know, interspersed replicas of the flag throughout their ads regularly?"
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2237.01,2239.878,"Justice Stevens, I don't think that's a worthy purpose."
1989.89-1433,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2244.914,2247.299,"And also... they also think it would help the American economy, say, to do this."
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2247.299,2249.984,"--I know, but also help the company itself, too."
1989.89-1433,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2251.536,2254.888,"Well, maybe the people who burn these flags thought they'd get something out of it, too."
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2256.072,2257.84,"--No, but the... people that burned these flags--"
1989.89-1433,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2257.84,2258.907,"They got a lot of publicity, didn't they?"
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2258.907,2268.446,"--were, I think, under the First Amendment resorting to politically expressive conduct, politically expressive sentiments that are not present in your example."
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2282.555,2292.245,"So you think if a bunch of college kids at a fraternity party just get together and say, you know, just for a kick let's burn an American flag and they're really not expressing any idea, then the statute would be okay as applied to--"
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2292.245,2293.013,"No, I don't think so."
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2294.68,2295.799,--I thought that's what you just said--
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2295.799,2296.182,--No.
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2296.182,2298.315,--that it hinges on whether you're expressing a political idea or not.
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2298.315,2298.767,No.
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2313.676,2314.21,"No, I thought--"
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2314.21,2315.043,--it's vague.
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2315.043,2327.484,"--It's not facially invalid if... if there is a situation in... in which its application would be all right and if its application would be all right as applied to these college students who have no political idea, they're just having a grand old time."
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2328.653,2337.876,"Yes, but it's facially invalid because the student doesn't know on the vagueness argument or the overbreadth argument, doesn't know, one, whether it's the flag of the United States."
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2370.347,2371.747,"But you're making a facial attack, aren't you?"
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2372.982,2374.065,We're making a facial attack--
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2374.065,2379.869,"You just want us to let your clients off and... and... and say, you know, in other situations it may be all right, but here it was no good?"
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2379.869,2380.603,"--Well, in--"
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2380.603,2382.571,"I didn't think that that was the argument you were making, but if you want--"
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2382.571,2391.094,"--Well, in Texas v. Johnson we also made a facial attack, and this Court, as the district courts below, did not go into the facial aspect of the statute."
1989.89-1433,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2398.014,2413.257,"--So if... if... if a person burned a flag in order to stay warm on a cold winter night, you would have... in order to get your client off on... on those facts you would get into overbreadth?"
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2413.257,2415.69,You'd have to get into the facial aspect of it.
1989.89-1433,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2419.244,2423.046,"But this case is a case involving a special message, as I understand it."
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2424.813,2426.248,"Well, there were a number of messages."
1989.89-1433,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2426.865,2430.033,"Well, which one do they convey by burning the flag?"
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2430.033,2432.052,--I think they convey them all.
1989.89-1433,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2462.738,2463.94,It doesn't say any one of them; it says all of them.
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2464.64,2468.242,"--General Starr made that... well, it's one or all."
1989.89-1433,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2472.109,2475.58,"But how... if I just see the flag burning, how do I know which one it is, or is that irrelevant?"
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2475.58,2488.221,"It's only irrelevant in the sense there are documents being handed out, flyers, declarations, that a person will... he'll know from that that the burning of the flag exhibited dissatisfaction."
1989.89-1433,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2496.494,2499.613,Call this... call this number and we'll tell you why we burned the flag.
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2502.565,2505.933,"Well, they did... they did give the messages out, why they burnt the flag."
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2554.413,2556.115,"Well, why just non... why do you limit it to non-verbal?"
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2563.902,2565.221,Why you burn the flag.
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2565.221,2566.221,--No.
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2571.958,2574.577,"That's true, you do not have to be precise."
1989.89-1433,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2595.756,2620.022,"Mr. Kunstler, suppose that a defendant broke into government property in violation of a valid statute, took a government flag, burned the government flag and was charged for breaking and entering and for destroying government property, not a flag statute at all."
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2629.712,2632.03,I say no; General Starr says yes.
1989.89-1433,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2641.352,2654.029,Then you must... then you must give the same sentence for spray painting the side of a building that faces a government alley as for spray painting the Lincoln Memorial?
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2654.029,2656.981,"Within the guidelines, I think the judge can give anything--"
1989.89-1433,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2656.981,2666.42,"I'm assuming that it's all within the guidelines, but he gives a maximum because people are outraged, they are offended and the conduct was very public."
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2666.42,2667.753,--If he says that--
1989.89-1433,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2667.753,2668.455,He says that.
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2668.455,2670.972,"--If he says that, I think it's unconstitutional."
1989.89-1433,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2670.972,2673.124,But that happens in sentencing all the time.
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2673.124,2673.757,I'm not sure--
1989.89-1433,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2673.757,2683.048,"And... and... and based... and based on your rule, it has to be the same sentence for spray painting the side of a government building that faces an alley and spray painting the Lincoln Memorial?"
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2683.048,2689.452,"--No, it doesn't have to be the same because there are other factors to be considered under the uniform sentencing guidelines."
1989.89-1433,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2692.154,2694.687,"No, I'm assuming everything is... is the same."
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2694.687,2695.372,--Everything the same?
1989.89-1433,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2695.372,2695.889,Sure.
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2695.889,2703.712,I think enhancing the sentence because of the nature of the communication would be unconstitutional.
1989.89-1433,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2704.695,2710.032,"Well, what about the fact that it's public, that people are outraged, that this is highly offensive?"
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2710.032,2712.651,I still think you're going on the language itself.
1989.89-1433,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2727.41,2729.01,"Well, that's probably why we're here today."
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2735.064,2759.429,"Now, with reference... I'm just... with reference to the invitation... oh, by the way, before I leave the flag and the... I guess the position that this statute was designed solely to protect its physical integrity in all circumstances, I think I've shown that it does not."
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2864.216,2866.068,"Let's... let's... let's try fighting words, Mr. Kunstler."
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2880.458,2883.779,"--Well, that isn't really what fighting words are as I understand Chaplinski."
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2883.779,2891.433,"Well... it's... it's... it's the same... it's the same thesis, that you don't have any rights to engage in conduct that's likely to provoke a riot."
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2891.433,2893.468,"It really isn't, Justice... that isn't really fighting words."
1989.89-1433,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2923.754,2926.856,What do you do with Feiner against New York?
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2926.856,2934.378,"I don't think that's really applicable here, because... well, that's not totally a fighting words case."
1989.89-1433,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2936.545,2944.918,It was held permissible for the sheriff to silence the speaker because he would... the audience was... was about to riot.
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2944.918,2953.69,"--But... but there's a point, I guess, where you have a riot develop, and on the verge of developing, where a police officer can stop."
1989.89-1433,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2971.301,2974.17,"Well, if we had a record, would it make it a different case?"
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,2974.17,2984.728,"No, I don't think so, unless it were a record were a riot did ensue and police were forced to come in and take the speaker off the rostrum."
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3010.526,3015.08,So there has to be a high probability of an injury occurring?
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3015.08,3029.257,"--Well, I remember the phrase ""clear and present danger"" floating around in my cranium at this moment, but there has to be something that is way... so probable that you are going to have bloodshed here, you're going to have a riot, and that doesn't exist here at all."
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3029.257,3030.54,You don't think a potential... a potential for a riot is enough?
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3032.542,3036.161,"I think the potential has to be a probability of a riot, and not--"
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3036.161,3040.314,"So you disagree with our decision in Austin, that just came down a couple of months ago?"
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3040.314,3040.914,--In Austin?
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3040.914,3050.937,"Yes, involving the restriction of corporate speech, and there we said, to quote it, that the mere... presents the potential for distorting the political process."
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3051.653,3056.407,"No, I don't disagree with it, because you were going to corruption, to something that would--"
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3056.407,3057.124,--Oh--
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3057.124,3058.693,--wreck the whole political system.
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3058.693,3059.693,--I see.
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3059.693,3060.978,And I think that is a little different.
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3060.978,3062.078,Oh.
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3062.078,3066.799,"Now, I take it from that ""oh"" that you're not buying this."
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3072.601,3073.436,I didn't buy it.
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3073.436,3075.253,"But I think essentially that is a different case, too."
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3086.426,3090.212,Is preventing desecration of the flag--
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3090.212,3091.497,"Well, you're using the word--"
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3091.497,3094.116,--And defending the sensibilities of the American people?
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3094.116,3100.453,"--Well, I think that's a lot different than what you have in... going to the corruption of the entire political system."
1989.89-1433,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3115.363,3117.815,"More... more specifically, the potential is for causing a riot."
1989.89-1433,1,45219,william_m_kunstler,,3128.67,3136.043,"--But Justice Scalia, there's always a potential in free speech, but it's got to go beyond... I think Justice Kennedy used the word probability."
1989.89-1433,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3398.581,3399.615,"Thank you, Mr. Kunstler."
1989.89-1433,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3405.752,3412.424,"Very briefly, Mr. Chief Justice, this is not a sedition act."
1989.89-1433,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3532.651,3533.953,"Thank you, General Starr."
