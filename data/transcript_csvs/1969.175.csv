1969.175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.787,"Number 175, Petsonella Moragne against States Marines Lines."
1969.175,0,19258,charles_hardee,,20.074,23.948,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,209.606,214.269,"As I understand it, you brought your original action, the State Court."
1969.175,0,19258,charles_hardee,,214.269,215.823,Yes sir.
1969.175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,215.823,220.574,Under the State's Wrongful Death Act and under the State Survivor Act.
1969.175,0,19258,charles_hardee,,220.574,221.909,Yes sir.
1969.175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,221.909,226.733,And that it was removed by the defendant to the Federal Court solely on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.
1969.175,0,19258,charles_hardee,,226.733,229.36,"Yes sir, that's correct."
1969.175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,229.36,258.274,"Well, in view of that, I have a little trouble seeing what the Tungus or the Harrisburg or anything else, any of the those cases have, what bearing they have on this case, if this is a state action for a wrongful death, in the District Court only by reason of diversity and not by a reason of its admirably jurisdiction, doesn't Erie Railroad against Tompkins require that the District Court follow the state law, whatever it may be."
1969.175,0,19258,charles_hardee,,264.654,269.963,"Alright sir, let's assume that the injury had not resulted in death."
1969.175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,274.475,275.921,As it result any death?
1969.175,0,19258,charles_hardee,,275.921,288.953,"Under diversity jurisdiction, but Federal Law -- Federal Maritime Law would have applied in the State Court or in the District Court, under diversity jurisdiction or on the admiralty side of the Court had the plaintiff chosen to go there."
1969.175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,288.953,289.667,And by virtue of --
1969.175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,289.667,291.821,But you didn't choose to go there.
1969.175,0,19258,charles_hardee,,291.821,293.655,No sir because this was a death.
1969.175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,294.61,307.034,"Well, but in order to test the continuing validity of the Harrisburg it would seem to me that a plaintiff -- you should have added, another complaint, an admiralty for wrongful death."
1969.175,0,19258,charles_hardee,,311.72,313.725,"But, Your Honor we thought for negligence."
1969.175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,313.725,323.679,For negligence and unseaworthiness and the Florida Supreme Court is now held that the state -- these two state statutes don't embody a liability for unseaworthiness.
1969.175,0,19258,charles_hardee,,323.679,324.373,"Yes sir, well we --"
1969.175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,324.373,330.146,"And in order to test the continuing validity, Harrisburg it seems to me a plaintiff would have to sue for wrongful death and admiralty."
1969.175,0,19258,charles_hardee,,341.541,344.509,"Yes sir, I understand your feelings first."
1969.175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,368.521,374.257,"But in Tungus and in Harrisburg, the cause of action was in admiralty."
1969.175,0,19258,charles_hardee,,391.312,395.749,"But what's the difference, if you please the Court."
1969.175,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,399.311,408.17,I think the Tungus or the Harrisburg could be attested by a plaintiff who sued in admiralty for wrongful death.
1969.175,0,19258,charles_hardee,,408.17,409.205,"Alright sir, well --"
1969.175,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,409.205,421.613,"Well, could I ask you, after removal when as the case proceeded, was a claim asserted whether formally or informally under the admiralty law?"
1969.175,0,19258,charles_hardee,,421.613,426.998,"No sir, I had considered the case to be under the admiralty law from the beginning."
1969.175,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,441.668,451.18,Is it your claim that the admiralty law would require a state to have its wrongful death statute in corporate maritime law?
1969.175,0,19258,charles_hardee,,451.18,452.718,Yes sir.
1969.175,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,465.97,470.386,"Well, that isn't the -- is that a question about the Harrisburg?"
1969.175,0,19258,charles_hardee,,470.386,474.272,"No sir, I haven't got in the Harrisburg yet, I would be glad to talk about the Harrisburg."
1969.175,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,474.272,479.368,"But can't -- if that's your only claim, you never will get to the Harrisburg, will you?"
1969.175,0,19258,charles_hardee,,479.368,483.416,"Yes sir, I think I will."
1969.175,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,521.832,527.495,"In other words -- and you could have sued, I gather Mr. Hardee in the case of an injury not a death."
1969.175,0,19258,charles_hardee,,531.073,531.542,Yes sir.
1969.175,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,531.542,532.57,But in either court.
1969.175,0,19258,charles_hardee,,532.57,533.363,Yes sir.
1969.175,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,533.363,534.715,Not a death case?
1969.175,0,19258,charles_hardee,,534.715,535.117,Yes sir.
1969.175,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,535.117,538.992,The controlling law that would have to be applied would be the federal maritime law.
1969.175,0,19258,charles_hardee,,538.992,539.579,Yes sir.
1969.175,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,539.579,542.664,And that I gather you take the same position in death cases.
1969.175,0,19258,charles_hardee,,542.664,542.881,Yes sir.
1969.175,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,542.881,546.428,And you insist that Harrisburg should be overruled.
1969.175,0,19258,charles_hardee,,546.428,546.679,Yes sir.
1969.175,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,546.679,551.266,And the -- a different federal maritime rule applied.
1969.175,0,19258,charles_hardee,,551.266,551.389,Yes sir.
1969.175,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,551.389,552.146,Is that it?
1969.175,0,19258,charles_hardee,,552.146,553.86,"That's correct, yes sir."
1969.175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,698.009,703.389,"In Florida, what's the source of the right to sue within a Death and Wrongful Act?"
1969.175,0,19258,charles_hardee,,703.389,708.196,The Wrongful Death Act in Florida was originally thought to be a Lord Campbell's Act.
1969.175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,708.196,709.586,It's a statute.
1969.175,0,19258,charles_hardee,,709.586,711.141,"It's a statute, yes sir."
1969.175,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,941.724,943.143,Thank you Mr. Hardee.
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,947.562,950.614,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1001.607,1006.842,But this is removed un-diversity and what happens to Erie Railroad against Tompkins.
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1006.842,1028.618,"Well, I thought Mr. Justice Stewart this Court had long settled that under the savings pursued as clause, state courts, all federal courts acting as state courts that is under that diversity, jurisdiction applied federal maritime law in all maritime cases."
1969.175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1033.554,1042.102,"The plaintiff here elected to proceed under two state statutes, a wrongful death statute and a survivor statute."
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1046.557,1050.476,"Well Mr. Justice Stewart, it may be a problem of pleading."
1969.175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1073.406,1074.9,Without question.
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1074.9,1077.425,And there is no difference --
1969.175,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1077.425,1080.229,-- listen to another answer here anyway.
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1099.533,1109.473,Except to the extent Mr. Justice Brennan that the claim was unseaworthiness as recognized by the state wrongful death statute.
1969.175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1109.473,1110.107,Exactly.
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1110.107,1122.511,"However, as I read the complaint, the suit is brought simply alleging a claim for wrongful death and unseaworthiness without particularly or uniquely invoking the state wrongful death statute."
1969.175,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1122.511,1123.899,Exactly.
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1127.015,1135.111,"Nor does Count 4, which is also an unseaworthiness count, though for the seaman's -- longshoreman own injury."
1969.175,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1135.111,1148.98,"Mr. Claiborne, had the suit been as you suggested for an injury not for death, what have been the source of the basis for the suit?"
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1148.98,1160.19,"It would have been the federal maritime law of unseaworthiness as to Count 2 of the complaint, which is the only here at issue, which is enforceable in both the State Court."
1969.175,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1170.893,1177.222,"And were there no statutes at all, would there had been a right to sue, the injury?"
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1177.222,1180.363,"With no statute, whatever, there would have been a right to sue for the injury."
1969.175,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1180.363,1182.979,So -- is that a distinction?
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1191.728,1208.856,"Well, as suggested here Mr. Chief Justice is that once the Harrisburg is overruled, as we think -- as we submit to the Court it should be, there will likewise be a right to sue for wrongful death without a statute, without invoking of the state wrongful death statutes."
1969.175,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1216.745,1222.589,"If the law is different from what it is today, then your rights would be in the courts what you're really signing of, isn't it?"
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1222.589,1224.794,That -- that is --
1969.175,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1224.794,1228.167,"What is it, that would just get us very far."
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1228.167,1238.883,"The reason of jurisdictional problem, there maybe a question as to the sufficiency of the pleading, though I don't think there's any problem as sufficiency to complaint."
1969.175,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1371.391,1377.113,"Did Congress have altered that situation, since Harrisburg was decided?"
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1377.113,1391.567,"No, no question whatever, Mr. Chief Justice that Congress could and as the other side will -- I'm sure point out, there is pending appeal which would have some such result, though --"
1969.175,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1391.567,1393.948,"They didalter it, they did alter it for --"
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1393.948,1400.226,"They did alter to the extent of the high seas, the death on the High Seas Act did alter it, to the extent of --"
1969.175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1400.226,1401.621,And (Voice Overlap) Jones Act.
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1401.621,1415.402,"Jones Act for the entire coverage of maritime law, but only with respect to seaman, so we really have a small area left, which Congress -- the reasons which I will try to explain in the moment, did not --"
1969.175,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1415.402,1419.682,Non seaman in the states territory less than marine league from the shores.
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1419.682,1421.264,"Within the three-mile limit, yes Mr. Justice White."
1969.175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1421.264,1443.233,"And the submission of this case would be that those people would have greater right of action for wrongful death, they're representatives, for the wrongful death of those people, and they would if they were sure that they happened on the shore or on the land in Florida, which gives the right to wrongful death only for negligence, I gather?"
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1443.233,1452.945,"Yes, so putting it the other way Mr. Justice Stewart, we've said they should not have less rights than because the action had occurred beyond the three-mile limit nor they should have --"
1969.175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1452.945,1456.917,"No Congress passed a statute, the people beyond the three-mile limit."
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1456.917,1460.206,I'll come to that Mr. Justice Stewart.
1969.175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1481.57,1487.773,"This is true of course in the -- that's nothing unusual about that, many states for example, that have limited liability for wrongful death."
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1487.773,1499.736,"Well, there is -- Mr. Justice Stewart there is no state law, which provides no remedy when the man is killed while providing remedy for the same conduct, when the man is merely injured."
1969.175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1501.341,1504.115,This isn't a case where no remedy is provided.
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1505.985,1526.185,"The same conduct, which in this case, this purpose is unseaworthiness of the vessel affords no remedy under Florida law, when the seaman died, when the longshoreman died, whereas it affords a remedy as it must under federal or when the longshoreman is injured, so it's an all or nothing proposition."
1969.175,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1543.663,1555.726,"You say it makes no sense, you're saying that the line drawn by Congress did not have a logical, sensible basis, is that what you're saying?"
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1555.726,1561.528,"No, I think it -- as I will suggest it did have some basis."
1969.175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1661.292,1662.963,I don't --
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1662.963,1663.708,How can that be?
1969.175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1663.708,1666.213,"Yes, how can that be or how is that?"
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1666.213,1685.433,"Because under this Court's decision, in Lindgren and in Gillespie, a seaman who is killed, its survivors cannot resort to State Wrongful Death Act, even where that State Wrongful Death Act would provide a remedy for unseaworthiness, but as defined in the Jones Act remedy for negligence."
1969.175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1685.433,1685.978,The negligence --
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1685.978,1692.649,"Therefore, in the Tungus, that remedy would not have been available to a seaman, because --"
1969.175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1692.649,1693.982,"He wasn't a seaman in Tungus, he was --"
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1693.982,1702.785,"He wasn't, but the seaman would not have had the benefit of the ruling of the Tungus, given the fact that New Jersey law did provide that remedy."
1969.175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1702.785,1707.961,"Except Jones Act, insofar as it has been acquitted with FELA."
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1707.961,1709.499,But which does --
1969.175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1709.499,1711.676,Still uses the word negligence.
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1711.676,1726.661,"Well, I'm assuming there's a difference, and in this case, the assumption is there's a difference between unseaworthiness and negligence, though I recognize that negligence under the Jones Act is a broader concept than negligence under Florida's law."
1969.175,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1801.72,1805.324,"Didn't the Death on the High Seas Act, they retain statement under this?"
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1805.324,1819.279,"Well, that is the second argument against repealing the Harrisburg by judicial action rather than by legislative action."
1969.175,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1864.428,1870.964,"I'm not sure I followed you there Mr. Claiborne, what did they do when they carved that out?"
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1870.964,1877.82,"Well, I am just speaking to Mr. Chief Justice is the words of the committee reports, which are quoted in the majority opinion."
1969.175,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1981.563,1999.701,"Would be your suggestion that the Government suggestion that we just overrule the Harrisburg and then spell out on a case by case basis, the essential elements of this action for wrongful death?"
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2008.743,2017.126,"Basically yes Mr. Justice White, though I must point out that by overruling Harrisburg is not fashioning a whole new body of federal law."
1969.175,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2021.894,2025.269,I understand (Voice Overlap) case to case basis --
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2025.269,2029.02,"Now, there are some details that have to be worked out."
1969.175,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2036.49,2037.908,How about of beneficiaries?
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2037.908,2044.321,"As to beneficiaries, there could be a reference to state law, thought I'm not --"
1969.175,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2044.321,2046.325,What does a Death on High Seas Act do as to beneficiaries?
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2046.325,2054.893,"Death on a High Seas Act has a list of beneficiaries, the only ones you can take, the Jones Act has a list of beneficiaries, unfortunately not identical."
1969.175,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2054.893,2055.699,We can always adapt either --
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2055.699,2056.585,Mostly the same.
1969.175,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2056.585,2060.628,"We can adopt either one of those, couldn't we, for reference?"
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2060.628,2075.214,"I think the normal thing for a federal court to do, faced with that problem would be to borrow from the federal statutory law, which governs the same conduct or be it beyond the three-mile area."
1969.175,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2075.214,2079.503,Would they bring something like in -- what was it McAllister or something?
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2079.503,2085.929,"Well, that was respect to the three year statute limitations of the Jones Act, which was borrowed when the two suits were brought together."
1969.175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2085.929,2095.882,"How about borrowing from the federal law that actually covers this decedent, i.e. the Federal Longshoreman's and Harbor Workers Act?"
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2098.239,2111.893,"Well, I would have thought that one would want a uniform rule, which remember that overruling the Harrisburg will -- permit suits not only by longshoreman but also by seaman, and also by passengers, all of which is (Voice Overlap)."
1969.175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2111.893,2115.404,Passengers wouldn't be covered by seaworthiness.
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2115.404,2115.767,"No, but they would be --"
1969.175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2115.767,2117.91,-- on unseaworthiness would they?
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2117.91,2122.5,"The Harrisburg now bars a suit for negligence, for wrongful death -- negligence."
1969.175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2122.5,2123.795,I beg your pardon?
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2123.795,2130.678,The Harrisburg likewise bars a suit for wrongful death due to negligence.
1969.175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2131.129,2136.724,"Except by -- that's changed by -- by Congressional action, the Death on the High Seas Act."
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2136.724,2140.125,"Beyond three miles, all for the seaman under the Jones Act."
1969.175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2147.395,2147.851,But there is a federal --
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2147.851,2152.923,"He has no suit for negligent killing, because of the Harrisburg."
1969.175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2166.48,2167.006,A passenger.
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2167.006,2168.115,"A passenger, though --"
1969.175,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2168.115,2169.382,"Why, why it is state?"
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2169.382,2183.024,"It's just -- I would suppose that it were complicated, unduly complicated, but I don't -- they said inappropriateness to that and I don't reject it as one alternative."
1969.175,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2183.024,2188.861,I suppose you would have a -- would you have comparative negligence rule?
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2188.861,2193.161,"Yes, as the substantive or admiralty law of (Voice Overlap)."
1969.175,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2193.161,2196.531,"Just what it is in the non death case, would have -- in a seaworthiness case?"
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2196.531,2208.68,"In seaworthiness contributory negligence, no negligence is relevant in a negligence case under the maritime law, comparative negligence is the rule, not contributory negligence."
1969.175,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2210.985,2217.034,"Well those -- you would simply apply under death cases, the substantive rules are now applicable in non death cases, is it?"
1969.175,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2217.034,2236.466,"The only thing to be fashioned is a question of who may file the suit whether it's the widow and the children or only the dependents, or only the small children are -- and how you divide it up between them, and those questions are largely answered if one borrows from the federal law."
1969.175,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2275.373,2277.805,Thank you Mr. Claiborne.
1969.175,2,21660,dewey_r_villareal,,2280.766,2285.551,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.175,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2462.459,2465.703,"But if this is an admiralty case, you wouldn't have a jury, would you?"
1969.175,2,21660,dewey_r_villareal,,2465.703,2489.218,"That is of course true, and that's the main reason, I will submit that they didn't sue in admiralty is because they want a jury to weigh this, because they know that juries are better for plaintiffs ordinarily."
1969.175,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2619.686,2636.559,"Suppose however that Congress, with respect to seaman, has very broadly legislated, depending upon their status, I suppose conceivably the Jones Act would cover a seaman injured on shore, wouldn't it?"
1969.175,2,21660,dewey_r_villareal,,2655.477,2656.71,Yes.
1969.175,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2666.638,2670.486,(Inaudible)
1969.175,2,21660,dewey_r_villareal,,2670.486,2674.222,Or out of the window or some other things that the --
1969.175,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2674.222,2681.276,"But that would depend entirely on his status, rather than the (Inaudible) of acts of the injuries, wouldn't it?"
1969.175,2,21660,dewey_r_villareal,,2681.276,2683.453,"Yes sir, as a crew member, employee of the shipment."
1969.175,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2683.453,2687.898,Because that would be the language of the Jones Act.
1969.175,2,21660,dewey_r_villareal,,2687.898,2703.967,"We think that the reason that the law has developed in this way results from a consideration of the desirability of having local uniformity for people who are essentially local, like longshoreman."
1969.175,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2755.218,2763.376,"Is the Harrisburg's rule, was it judicially created or congressional hearsay?"
1969.175,3,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2763.376,2766.288,I suppose it was judicially announced or created.
1969.175,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2768.567,2770.311,-- comes on from the Court.
1969.175,4,21660,dewey_r_villareal,,2770.311,2771.001,Sir?
1969.175,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2771.001,2772.642,It comes from the Court and not from the Congress.
1969.175,4,21660,dewey_r_villareal,,2772.642,2775.304,"Yes sir, yes Your Honor."
1969.175,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2775.304,2787.084,"The other way of putting it is that the only areas where you have actions for wrongful death have had to come from the legislators, not from the Courts."
1969.175,4,21660,dewey_r_villareal,,2787.084,2787.505,"Well, that's true."
1969.175,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2787.505,2790.555,"Whether the common law or an admiralty, isn't that correct?"
1969.175,4,21660,dewey_r_villareal,,2790.555,2797.127,"That is true or as I understood the Harrisburg decisions is by the civil law, even the common law and (Voice Overlap)."
1969.175,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2797.127,2804.992,"That's what I say, wherever you have a wrongful death action, in the Anglo-American legal system, it's because of legislations, isn't that correct?"
1969.175,4,21660,dewey_r_villareal,,2804.992,2811.516,"That is correct, and I believe in every state in the union, the only way you can have an action for wrongful death is by statute."
1969.175,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2811.516,2817.599,"But the Harrisburg rule does not come from legislation, does it?"
1969.175,4,21660,dewey_r_villareal,,2817.599,2824.848,"Well, I think it comes from the absence of legislation Your Honor."
1969.175,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2824.848,2830.734,But it exists and exists on the judicial creation.
1969.175,4,21660,dewey_r_villareal,,2830.734,2835.308,I suppose that's correct sir.
1969.175,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2910.504,2915.003,Because he's got -- because the right of action exclusively under the Jones Act?
1969.175,4,21660,dewey_r_villareal,,2915.003,2918.834,Yes Your Honor.
1969.175,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2938.096,2940.831,Which is something the seaman doesn't have for death?
1969.175,4,21660,dewey_r_villareal,,2940.831,2945.98,Which is something the seaman doesn't have for death if it occurs within the three miles of land.
1969.175,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2948.232,2948.394,On the high seas.
1969.175,4,21660,dewey_r_villareal,,2948.394,2949.441,The Death on the High Seas Act.
1969.175,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2949.441,2950.714,-- Death on the High Seas Act.
1969.175,4,21660,dewey_r_villareal,,2950.714,2958.846,Yes sir.
1969.175,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3000.98,3004.573,Thank you Mr. Villareal.
1969.175,5,21067,david_cg_kerr,,3006.061,3009.642,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.175,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3483.04,3484.737,Mr. Kerr have you filed a brief?
1969.175,5,21067,david_cg_kerr,,3486.388,3487.524,"Yes sir, I have."
1969.175,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3487.524,3491.713,In your own name?
1969.175,5,21067,david_cg_kerr,,3491.713,3495.932,"I believe it's filed in my partner's name, I was not admitted at the time."
1969.175,5,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3497.238,3501.321,"Now, which one is yours?"
1969.175,5,21067,david_cg_kerr,,3501.321,3506.878,It's the brief on behalf of Gulf Florida Terminal Company respondent.
1969.175,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3716.13,3724.837,"Of course, what the Florida legislature has done or has not done doesn't really bear at all upon the fundamental issue here does it?"
1969.175,5,21067,david_cg_kerr,,3724.837,3726.582,"No sir, I don't believe it does."
1969.175,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3726.582,3733.625,"But Congress has done or has not done indeed it does a great -- perhaps a great deal in relevance, certainly has relevance."
1969.175,5,21067,david_cg_kerr,,3733.625,3734.481,Yes Mr. Justice Stewart.
1969.175,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3749.315,3750.565,Mr. Hardee.
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,3750.565,3753.959,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.175,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3782.503,3784.741,He had only the Jones Act within the three miles.
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,3784.741,3785.454,Right.
1969.175,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3785.454,3790.349,And outside he has on option of Death on the High Seas Act or Jones Act?
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,3790.349,3798.451,"Yes sir, this Court has never made a decision on that, but Gilmore and Black at page 304 in their previous decision."
1969.175,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3798.451,3803.128,That the language in the Death on High Seas Act is a usually local --
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,3803.128,3805.776,"Just like that, New Jersey statute in Tungus, if it's a --"
1969.175,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3805.776,3807.073,"Well, who can neglect or default –"
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,3807.073,3811.308,Act in neglect or default I think is the exact words of it or in simple language.
1969.175,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3811.308,3813.773,That's broad enough to cover both negligence and unseaworthiness.
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,3813.773,3818.159,"Unseaworthiness and the federal courts, the chairman seaman against --"
1969.175,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3818.159,3824.28,It is the straight negligence to that law.
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,3824.28,3832.974,"Yes sir and under the Death on a High Seas Act, the seaman have been allowed to recover for unseaworthiness or the heirs of the seaman have been allowed to recover for unseaworthiness in a Death Act, so --"
1969.175,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3832.974,3836.927,It has never been squarely raised whether outside of the three-mile?
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,3836.927,3837.422,Yes sir and --
1969.175,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3837.422,3842.588,Was the seaman the -- whether it's exclusive under the Jones Act?
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,3842.588,3850.157,"In Chermesino against the Vessel Judith Lee Rose, which was recorded in the federal supplement also went to Second Circuit --"
1969.175,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3850.157,3852.283,Rather has this Court ever --
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,3852.283,3856.482,"No, Sir cert was denied in that case but this Court has never written an opinion on this question."
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3866.245,3867.834,When was the Jones Act passed?
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,3867.834,3871.822,"1920, the same year Mr. Justice White as the Death on the High Seas Act."
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3871.822,3874.083,"So, why did they needed both?"
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,3874.083,3880.299,"I think as the Government suggested, the Death on the High Seas Act was intended by Congress to fill a void or a vacuum --"
1969.175,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3880.299,3881.523,For passengers primarily.
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3881.523,3883.753,Or non-seaman.
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,3883.753,3885.427,"No sir, it includes everybody, seaman and non-seaman --"
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3885.427,3888.343,"I know, but why did they needed to cover seaman?"
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,3890.001,3896.079,"Well, I'm sure it wasn't -- the purpose wasn't to cover seaman because it passed the Jones Act the same year."
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3896.079,3900.045,"Well, I guess the Death on the High Seas Act, used the word person."
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,3900.045,3900.93,Yes sir.
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3900.93,3901.617,Any person.
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,3901.617,3902.48,"Any person, that's right."
1969.175,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3902.48,3906.42,And the Jones Act says its seaman.
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3906.42,3919.38,"If you apply the -- if you apply the Death on High Seas Act, seaman where they certainly don't have -- they certainly can recover one of –- the standard for recovery will be different than in the negligence case."
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,3919.38,3920.138,Yes sir.
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3926.486,3926.63,Or both.
1969.175,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3926.63,3929.778,"Incidentally, aren't the beneficiaries different under --"
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,3929.778,3933.266,"Yes, they're slightly different, they are."
1969.175,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3948.61,3951.992,A passenger doesn't have a right to recover for unseaworthiness wherever he is.
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,3951.992,3962.22,"Well, that's right because the warranty doesn't apply to -- extended to apply to a vesture, unless the failure was a negligence failure to find as in seaworthiness, but --"
1969.175,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3962.22,3964.116,"It's negligence, not unseaworthiness."
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,3964.116,3970.932,"A longshoreman may recover in all the states, except Florida that it decided the question."
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3991.547,3993.29,Why?
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,3993.29,4001.326,Because he has no -- he does not have the warranty of seaworthiness does not extend to him in a death case within the territorial waters of the United States.
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4001.326,4003.606,"Well, why does it apply to a longshoreman?"
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4003.606,4006.281,"Well, under Tungus, in New Jersey, in New York."
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4006.281,4011.158,"Well I know, but why can't the seaman take advantage of the same thing that longshoreman does?"
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4011.158,4019.627,"Because in Gillespie, the longshoreman can take advantage of it by reason of Tungus, because he sues under the State Death Act."
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4023.363,4026.509,"I know, but we're not talking about the Jones Act."
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4026.509,4039.482,"So that's -- well, this is what I'm saying, this is why a seaman cannot recover from and/or the heirs of a seaman who has been killed, cannot recover for unseaworthiness within the territorial waters of the United States --"
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4039.482,4043.99,"Because it's an exclusive remedy for the seaman per day, it's a Jones Act, is that it?"
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4043.99,4045.015,Within territorial waters of the Untied States.
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4045.015,4049.634,Within territorial waters -- the Jones Act and that talks about the negligence action at law.
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4049.634,4050.058,Right.
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4050.058,4051.133,And that's exclusive.
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4051.133,4052.199,"Yes sir, that's correct."
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4052.199,4053.743,In territorial waters.
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4053.743,4054.391,Yes sir.
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4077.12,4092.833,"Well, I wouldn't think that overruling the Harrisburg would overrule this Court's construction of the Jones Act, which was set to -- intended to made an exclusive remedy for death."
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4092.833,4104.04,"No sir, but if this Court overrules the Harrisburg, I assume that the Court then intends to find that there is in maritime law a remedy for wrongful death, aside from any statute."
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4104.04,4105.679,For unseaworthiness.
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4105.679,4113.765,"Besides many statute for whatever the rights would have been and if the man had been injured, he had -- he's heirs have the same rights if he's killed."
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4113.765,4128.375,"Oh yes, but if the Harrisburg is overruled, would you suggest that the seaman on the high seas has any other remedy other than either a Jones Act or a Death on the High Seas Act remedy?"
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4128.375,4129.423,"No sir, but I would suggest that --"
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4129.423,4137.509,"Well, that it isn't -- whether the legislature is regulated, created and regulated, the death remedy, I suppose that would be it."
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4137.509,4156.813,"But I would suggest this that if the Harrisburg were overruled and this Court decided that there is a remedy for wrongful death in maritime law aside from the statute, that the heirs of a seaman who's killed on territorial waters would have a right to the warranty of -- or to the doctrine of unseaworthiness --"
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4156.813,4163.639,Not if the Congress intended by the Jones Act to make the remedy of the seaman -- given if the seaman exclusive of all of the remedies.
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4163.639,4166.086,"Well in any event, this is the way we see it."
1969.175,6,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4166.086,4168.243,"Well in any event, that issue is not before us in this event?"
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4168.243,4170.435,"Yes sir, that is correct."
1969.175,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4171.549,4199.504,"While you're talking about the consequences of overruling Harrisburg, assuming for purposes of the moment that you would prevailed and that that did happen, would then be appropriate to call for additional briefs and perhaps argument on the guidelines that are have to be provided as to who may sue and how the recovery will be divided and all the other problems?"
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4199.504,4208.443,"Yes sir, I think it would be appropriate for the Court to that or to say we're going to generally follow the federal statutes that are on existence and --"
1969.175,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4208.443,4209.552,Well which ones?
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4209.552,4217.749,"Well, the Jones Act or Death on a High Seas Act, there's not a great difference between."
1969.175,6,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4217.749,4220.478,"Why would we have to do that, set out guidelines?"
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4220.478,4221.582,"I don't -- well, I don't --"
1969.175,6,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4221.582,4223.116,-- not here.
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4223.116,4225.764,I don't really think that you need to Mr. Justice Black.
1969.175,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4249.913,4254.224,"Who's going to define these people who are injured, that's the whole question, isn't it?"
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4262.627,4265.246,How about his creditors?
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4265.246,4268.98,I don't think -- is there any -- I don't think there's any general law on damages.
1969.175,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4271.15,4272.304,But aren't all statute --
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4272.304,4274.901,That is always pretty generally uniform --
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4274.901,4280.739,We would be -- perhaps we would be fashioning the law on a case by case basis.
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4280.739,4281.572,Yes sir.
1969.175,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4281.572,4288.688,Or wouldn't it be better to hold a hearing and sort of like a legislative hearing and get the whole thing thrust out all at once?
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4288.688,4289.876,I think you do that or --
1969.175,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4289.876,4293.29,Or we start down after all.
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4293.29,4297.864,"We didn't have to that, I think it's McAllister, I forgot the name of it, I guess that's the name."
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4297.864,4298.901,I just don't see --
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4298.901,4306.677,"Well, we did precisely this, when we had a void, we had to fill it, and we found an answer by analogy in other federal statutes."
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4309.926,4311.875,"I think it's very simple, I don't see the problem."
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4311.875,4312.816,"Two different answer, yes."
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4312.816,4316.447,That the respondents see in this case or in that regard.
1969.175,6,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4316.447,4320.175,Did the Court have a legislative hearing when it decided the Harrisburg?
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4320.175,4322.215,"No sir, not that I know of."
1969.175,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4323.309,4327.758,"They didn't have all these acts at that time either, did they?"
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4327.758,4349.979,"No sir, and i think (Voice Overlap), by reason of the Harrisburg, which -- and I think is an amicus of -- the American Trial Lawyers pointed out that this Court is not just an anchorage, it also has a sale, and if you make that law, you can also repeal it, same bad law."
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4377.186,4379.541,(Inaudible)
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4379.541,4380.237,Yes sir.
1969.175,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4380.237,4381.517,(Inaudible)
1969.175,6,19258,charles_hardee,,4381.517,4385.709,"Yes sir, negligence of fellow seaman, assumption to risk, all of those things go with the Florida."
1969.175,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4385.709,4387.363,Thank you Mr. Hardee.
