1990.90-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,11.269,"We'll hear argument now in No. 90-634, Dan Cohen v. the Cowles Media Company, doing business as Minneapolis Star and Tribune Company."
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,12.679,16.383,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,69.907,80.753,"Well, why should the desirability of keeping the promise of confidentiality on the part of a media organization be subject to our decision here?"
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,80.753,90.02,"Because, Your Honor... because, Mr. Chief Justice, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment barred enforceability of these promises."
1990.90-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,90.02,99.978,"Yes, and if... if the Minnesota Supreme Court was wrong on that point, we would say, or if we thought so, we would say that the First Amendment did not bar the enforcement of those promises."
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,106.85,130.656,"Mr. Chief Justice, I was really raising this issue to point out the First Amendment values that are involved that to ensure the free flow of information to the public, news media consider it necessary to make these promises and it's also necessary to keep these promises to avoid drying up the flow of information from sources."
1990.90-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,130.656,137.191,The First Amendment requires that these contractual obligations be enforceable.
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,137.191,138.193,Yes--
1990.90-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,138.193,143.344,You're taking the polar view from the view that the Minnesota Supreme Court took.
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,143.344,144.466,"--Yes, Justice Scalia--"
1990.90-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,144.466,145.195,I--
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,145.195,146.357,--there is no conflict in this case.
1990.90-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,146.357,149.89,--Isn't it conceivable that the First Amendment neither requires nor prohibits?
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,152.851,155.212,"That is a possible resolution, Your Honor."
1990.90-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,179.92,180.609,But--
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,180.609,183.901,"--every other business, every other individual in keeping their promises."
1990.90-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,183.901,191.086,"--Well, then what you're saying is that the First Amendment doesn't accord them any special protection when they break their promises."
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,191.086,192.556,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1990.90-634,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,192.556,207.136,"Well, what would be the result if a State passed a statute which said, as a matter of the public policy of this State, no contract in... for confidential source material shall be enforceable?"
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,209.089,218.914,"Your Honor, Justice Kennedy, it would be our position that that would violate the constitutional provision regarding the impairment of contracts."
1990.90-634,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,219.395,221.027,"No, no, it wouldn't, because it's future."
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,221.027,222.497,--Future.
1990.90-634,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,234.845,235.476,"Well, I... it--"
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,235.476,235.946,--adopted.
1990.90-634,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,239.55,240.752,--Would there be a First Amendment problem?
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,240.752,246.144,--It would certainly violate values of the First Amendment that would be involved in the--
1990.90-634,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,246.144,248.116,"Well, if it violates values of the First Amendment, does it violate the First Amendment?"
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,254.099,269.039,"--Justice Kennedy, it's... that... he was bringing it out to point out there was no necessary conflict between the First Amendment and rules of contract law as applied to this case."
1990.90-634,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,293.425,301.049,"Mr. Rothenberg, the... I have a little difficulty with the opinion that we're asked to review."
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,309.143,310.686,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1990.90-634,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,310.686,315.699,And then it went on to address whether there was promissory estoppel.
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,323.443,324.665,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-634,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,324.665,325.827,Is that correct?
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,325.827,326.455,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-634,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,326.455,330.709,Did you argue promissory estoppel?
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,333.591,339.574,"In Minnesota, Your Honor, promissory estoppel is closely related to the law of contracts."
1990.90-634,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,368.173,378.05,The problem I have is that I didn't understand how the court could address it at all if it was never urged below.
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,378.05,386.695,"It isn't necessary, Justice O'Connor, in Minnesota, to specifically plead promissory estoppel apart from general contract law."
1990.90-634,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,406.698,413.263,"And as a matter of State law, it's possible to sustain a jury verdict that was presented on a different theory--"
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,413.263,415.334,--Yes.
1990.90-634,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,415.334,417.874,--by concluding there was promissory estoppel?
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,419.717,420.368,Uh-huh.
1990.90-634,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,456.731,462.304,"Now, one other question before I finish if I may."
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,482.048,487.882,"Well, Your Honor, Justice O'Connor, plaintiff did not ask that this publication be enjoined."
1990.90-634,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,493.516,494.017,"Yes, I know."
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,499.55,501.5,Plaintiff has not sought an injunction.
1990.90-634,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,502.361,503.072,"Yes, I know that."
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,507.774,510.145,--Could it be sought?
1990.90-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,541.127,545.398,You think maybe only the Government can get prior restraint of publication?
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,551.061,552.313,--It's... it's--
1990.90-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,552.313,553.094,That may be the law.
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,553.094,556.226,"--Not necessarily, Justice Scalia."
1990.90-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,566.074,568.215,You seem very much worried about it.
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,609.082,620.669,"--Your Honor, the holding of the case from the Minnesota Supreme Court we would submit was purely based upon the First Amendment where it says towards the end of the decision,"
1990.90-634,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,627.132,635.398,"Well, isn't the most that you can say is that that was an alternative holding, and in fact the second of the two pieces of reasoning expressed?"
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,648.198,653.36,"--Except, Justice Souter, that was not the arrangement that the parties had made."
1990.90-634,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,659.665,660.436,"No, I realize that."
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,680.979,698.22,"No, Your Honor, Justice Souter, any fair reading of the decision would lead one to conclude that this decision was in fact based on the First Amendment in terms of the promissory estoppel where the court says we conclude that violation of these promises would violate--"
1990.90-634,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,698.22,698.731,Well--
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,698.731,703.222,--would... the enforcement of the promises would violate the First Amendment rights of the newspapers--
1990.90-634,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,703.222,705.733,--Let me just ask you one question.
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,744.839,757.799,"--Justice Souter, we would submit that that would not be the case, because the court, the Minnesota Supreme Court, did find it necessary to examine the First Amendment issues and to make that specific holding--"
1990.90-634,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,757.799,766.384,"Well, they did to go on to demand them, but if the court had stopped right there and said, it seems to us the law best leaves the parties here to their trust in each other, what would the result in the case have been?"
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,773.06,778.824,"--Well, Your Honor, the context in which that statement was made wasn't the context of the First Amendment discussion."
1990.90-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,803.528,811.224,"Mr. Rothenberg, I thought when they said the law best leaves the parties to the trust in each other, they included within the law the First Amendment."
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,812.864,814.797,"Absolutely, Justice Scalia."
1990.90-634,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,814.797,815.396,Oh.
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,851.249,859.575,"If the one statute was ostensibly based upon the First Amendment, Your Honor--"
1990.90-634,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,859.575,864.46,"It said that because the members of the legislature are all convinced that it would violate the First Amendment, we therefore enact this statute."
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,864.46,872.624,"--That would present... that would provide jurisdiction for this Court, Justice Stevens, to consider whether the First Amendment actually requires that the--"
1990.90-634,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,872.624,876.137,"Did we review the reasoning that the legislators adopt, do we?"
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,879.887,882.641,"--I would submit both, Your Honor."
1990.90-634,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,940.749,942.91,"Well, I know, but of course in the future the law will be clearer if this is affirmed."
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,946.542,948.803,"Yes, yes, yes, Your Honor."
1990.90-634,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,963.823,965.863,"Yes, we haven't always agreed with them, though."
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,965.863,966.354,--Right.
1990.90-634,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,988.431,994.994,You seem to be posing the issue as whether we... which result we think will maximize the flow of information.
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,1002.628,1007.942,"Well, Justice Stevens, I was pointing out that the positions of the media have been inconsistent on this issue."
1990.90-634,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1007.942,1008.393,"Well, I understand that."
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,1012.734,1024.342,"But it's been our position, Justice Stevens, if I could perhaps answer the question that, as in the Minnesota Court of Appeals... the First Amendment really ought not to be applicable to this case."
1990.90-634,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1048.067,1058.886,"Well, but the maximum your... result you can achieve here is not just that we remand it to the court of... the Minnesota Supreme Court and say, you're really not required to reach this result by the First Amendment."
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,1064.239,1091.668,"No, Justice Stevens, because the problem that we have if... if you open the door for State courts to say that, although we're not going to judge a case on the amendment or the constitutional provision itself, we're just going to consider the policy of the amendment or the Constitution, that's going to give State courts the opportunity to in effect reach final judgments on constitutional issues without allowing litigants the opportunity to appeal to this Court."
1990.90-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1091.668,1099.522,"Well, certainly the Supreme Court of Minnesota, if we were to reverse its judgment here, and say that it was wrong."
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,1109.88,1121.247,"Your Honor, that issue was raised in the oral argument before the Minnesota Supreme Court and also in briefs by the respondents, particular respondent Cowles Media Company."
1990.90-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1128.681,1133.983,"Well, maybe they were saving it for a situation like the one... my hypothetical."
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,1135.105,1150.406,"--But it's... Your Honor, again we take the position that... and I think it's clear from the decision itself, which is of course all we have to act upon, is that the Supreme Court of Minnesota did not refer to any State constitutional provisions."
1990.90-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1217.178,1222.274,"You have government compulsion just as you have in a liable case, don't you?"
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,1258.597,1267.561,"--Mr. Chief Justice, we would submit that there is a difference between the New York Times v. Sullivan type of situation and this type of case."
1990.90-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1286.944,1289.325,"Well, there are many differences I agree."
1990.90-634,0,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,1293.44,1302.696,"Except, Mr. Chief Justice, that again involves the voluntary agreement."
1990.90-634,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1452.053,1454.464,"Very well, Mr. Rothenberg."
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,1456.854,1462.468,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1504.266,1512.671,"Well, would you be making the same argument that you're going to make if the contract was in writing and there was consideration on both sides?"
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,1512.671,1513.642,"Yes, I would, Your Honor."
1990.90-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1513.642,1514.223,All right.
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,1514.223,1517.386,"I would be making the same argument, but this is an easier case, I think."
1990.90-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1517.386,1518.598,Right.
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,1518.598,1529.875,"The two facts that I believe are beyond dispute is that the publications at issue are entirely true, and that they involved matters of public significance."
1990.90-634,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1544.334,1558.024,"Well, are you... again, are you suggesting that the result would be any different if it weren't... just a low-level news story which may or may not be in the public interest... no public officials involved?"
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,1558.963,1570.673,"--It's the same principle, but the decisions of this Court say, Your Honor, that it is clear that there should be protection accorded to the publication of truthful information about matters of public significance."
1990.90-634,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1581.879,1586.241,May I ask what is public significance?
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,1590.355,1593.458,"The election campaign in toto, Your Honor."
1990.90-634,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1593.458,1600.912,"So that you could have published the information that she'd been arrested or whatever it was and that would have satisfied that requirement without identifying the source, couldn't you?"
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,1600.912,1610.127,The information about Mr. Cohen was information that was a part of a story about matters of public significance.
1990.90-634,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1632.453,1637.746,"Apparently, that indicates that reasonable news editors could differ as to the public significance of the information."
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,1637.746,1638.555,--Absolutely right.
1990.90-634,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1639.527,1642.769,And we should say... we should choose between the two views on that.
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,1642.769,1646.342,"--You should choose to allow reasonable editors to differ, Your Honor."
1990.90-634,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1651.505,1664.413,"No, but you're saying that you sort have got a heightened scrutiny, because it is a matter of public significance, not that whenever editors may differ as to whether it's a matter of public significance, then you get the heightened scrutiny or is that your point?"
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,1664.413,1682.834,"--No, my point, Your Honor, is that if there is any basis for a challenge such as that leveled at these two newspapers by Mr. Cohen, that basis pales to insignificance when the subject is truthful information about a matter of public significance."
1990.90-634,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1682.834,1685.347,Such as there was involved in the Snepp case.
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,1685.347,1699.737,"Such as there was involved in the Snepp case, but in the Snepp case what the Court had before it was, number one, protecting national security, and number two, as the Court said, a fiduciary relationship of the highest order."
1990.90-634,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1709.882,1713.255,He had to pay the consequences for what he did.
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,1719.018,1727.303,"It's not a prepublication case, Your Honor, but I think the case reveals why it comes so close to being prepublication."
1990.90-634,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1755.513,1759.546,It's still something that he could weigh in the balance when they decide whether or not to breach their agreement.
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,1759.546,1764.88,"It's still something they can weigh in the balance, but it's something in my judgment they should not have to weigh in the balance."
1990.90-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1764.88,1784.671,"Mr. French, any number of large concerns which have the potential for doing damage to people, whether they're trucking companies or products... making asbestos and newspaper companies have the potential for doing damage by... have to live with a certain threat of litigation."
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,1787.194,1791.296,"That's absolutely right, Mr. Chief Justice And these newspapers live with it."
1990.90-634,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1848.253,1852.846,"Well, in that light was it wrong for the newspaper reporter to guarantee confidentiality?"
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,1852.846,1855.877,"It was not wrong at the level of the newspaper reporter, Your Honor."
1990.90-634,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1855.877,1864.704,"Suppose the newspaper reporter had known that her editor would countermand her promise, and made... but the newspaper reporter made the promise anyway?"
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,1864.704,1870.498,"You'd have a different case, because I think you'd get closer to fraud and there would be more to weigh in the balance on Mr. Cohen's side."
1990.90-634,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1886.619,1896.365,"Well, then it's the degree of wrong, the egregiousness of the press misrepresentations that controls the case?"
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,1896.365,1898.056,"--No, they do not control the case."
1990.90-634,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1899.967,1902.931,"How would... how should the case come out, the case that I put to you?"
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,1902.931,1913.487,"--The case that you put to you... that you put to me, should in my judgment still be a case in which the First Amendment is relevant."
1990.90-634,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1948.8,1955.045,"Mr. French, on that word ""honest"", did you publish that you promised not to publish that?"
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,1955.045,1960.628,The two reporters gave Mr. Cohen a promise that they wouldn't--
1990.90-634,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1960.628,1965.643,Did you publish that the deal was made not to release it?
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,1965.643,1966.704,"--They did not, Your Honor."
1990.90-634,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1966.704,1968.745,"Well, now you're talking about truth."
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,1971.786,1976.018,The entire truth about everything did not get published.
1990.90-634,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1976.018,1976.629,You did not publish.
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,1976.629,1978.322,But what this Court has said--
1990.90-634,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1978.322,1980.061,You didn't publish all the truth.
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,1980.061,1981.563,"--That's absolutely right, Your Honor."
1990.90-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1998.835,2006.069,So what you're asking us to vindicate is publication of the truth as truth is determined by the editors.
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2006.069,2022.628,What I am asking the Court to do is to conclude that the editors are the repository of First Amendment bestowed rights to make judgments about what to publish and not to publish.
1990.90-634,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2050.568,2051.359,You're saying more than that.
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2083.039,2084.181,"Yes, yes, I do, Your Honor."
1990.90-634,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2084.181,2088.313,Even though he's turning over the most newsworthy material in the world.
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2088.313,2093.444,"I do believe it should be able to sue, and it can sue under precedence of this Court."
1990.90-634,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2106.874,2107.475,"Well, wait, wait, wait... excuse me."
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2113.75,2115.68,"--Yes, that's correct."
1990.90-634,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2115.68,2120.352,"Well, why is that any different from the confidential information that was transmitted to the reporter here?"
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2120.352,2126.878,The reporter obtained that information in the course of performing services for the newspaper.
1990.90-634,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2140.868,2142.427,All important contract rights.
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2142.427,2147.751,Important contract rights which do not suppress publication of the truth.
1990.90-634,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2157.498,2179.223,"It's a very odd calculus that the person closest to the truth... in this case the source... cannot protect his ability to divulge or not to divulge but that as you get further away from the sources of truth, i.e., in the newspaper room, you say, oh, then the newspaper has a right to protect its information by a contract suit."
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2181.253,2183.534,"--I think not, Your Honor."
1990.90-634,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2221.93,2222.941,Mr. French--
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2255.172,2257.873,"No, I would not say that, Your Honor."
1990.90-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2295.258,2296.76,Because of the First Amendment.
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2296.76,2298.489,Because of the First Amendment.
1990.90-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2298.489,2305.374,And so you think this... we really do have a First Amendment question before us?
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2305.374,2306.184,I think the Court--
1990.90-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2306.184,2311.038,"And that the... when we... and that the we certainly have jurisdiction to decide it, is that it?"
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2311.038,2318.282,"--I think the Court could have, Justice White, had the First Amendment before it if that's what the Minnesota Supreme Court had decided."
1990.90-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2318.282,2326.429,"Well, I know, but that's only been argued now is that... is that the... is that the paper has a First Amendment right not to live up to this contract."
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2330.831,2336.874,"I believe the issue is not here, but Mr. Rothenberg says the issue is here, and I think I'm obliged to respond to Mr. Rothenberg."
1990.90-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2337.485,2340.827,Why don't you... why don't you tell us why we don't have to decide it?
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2340.827,2342.117,--I would be delighted to.
1990.90-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2342.117,2345.42,Tell us why we don't have jurisdiction to decide it.
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2345.42,2347.75,"I would be delighted to do that, Your Honor."
1990.90-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2347.75,2352.014,"Well, that's always usually the first part of a question."
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2352.014,2353.404,It is indeed.
1990.90-634,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2402.668,2407.6,"Well, how is it that the court got into its discussion of promissory estoppel?"
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2417.738,2426.904,"--There is not, Justice O'Connor, and with respect I have to... I have to dispute Mr. Rothenberg's representation of Minnesota State law."
1990.90-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2474.594,2486.084,"But surely there's a strong intimation in the part of a majority opinion in the Supreme Court of Minnesota dealing with promissory estoppel that that theory could sustain the judgment, other... otherwise why would they talk about it?"
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2486.084,2493.528,"It is difficult in the context of Minnesota State law to understand why Justice Simonett talked about it, Your Honor."
1990.90-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2493.528,2496.209,"No, it was the court talking about it, wasn't it?"
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2496.209,2498.128,"It was the court, Your Honor."
1990.90-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2499.57,2501.491,And they talked about it.
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2526.509,2527.24,That's correct.
1990.90-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2527.24,2530.941,Under a promissory estoppel analysis there can be no neutrality towards the First Amendment.
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2543.128,2544.07,May I--
1990.90-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2544.07,2548.233,I would think you're defending that... you've been defending that judgment most of the morning.
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2548.233,2552.435,"--May I focus, Justice White, the Court's attention on this sentence."
1990.90-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2560.44,2562.783,"Can you tell us where you're reading from, Mr. French?"
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2562.783,2564.643,--I had it in my notes here in front of me.
1990.90-634,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2564.643,2565.544,It's A-13.
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2569.076,2570.157,"Thank you, Justice Scalia."
1990.90-634,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2607.09,2610.102,"Yes, Mr. French, but the next sentence they use the word ""must""."
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2610.102,2612.055,"--I agree, Your Honor."
1990.90-634,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2642.114,2653.282,"Well, suppose the Supreme of Arizona... of Minnesota has said, we don't think there's any protection for newspapers for confidential sources, and therefore, we apply promissory estoppel."
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2654.123,2655.543,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
1990.90-634,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2655.543,2657.373,"Well, isn't it the same principle?"
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2657.373,2671.264,"If the Supreme Court of Minnesota had said there is no First Amendment protection and Mr. Cohen prevails, that decision under promissory estoppel in my judgment would have infringed our client's First Amendment rights and we certainly would have appealed."
1990.90-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2709.238,2715.372,By the way did you defend in the trial court on the grounds of the First Amendment?
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2715.372,2717.143,"Yes, absolutely, Justice White."
1990.90-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2728.42,2731.832,Was it... was it because there was no State action?
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2732.954,2738.677,"No, he just said... he... there is no First Amendment issue in this case is what the trial judge thought."
1990.90-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2738.677,2745.261,"Well, the intermediate appellate court seemed to think that there was no... First Amendment was out of the case because there was no State action."
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2745.261,2748.054,"No State action and waiver both, Your Honor."
1990.90-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2748.054,2750.975,What your view about the State action issue?
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2750.975,2754.618,"Oh, I think the State action is easy under New York Times against Sullivan."
1990.90-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2755.527,2762.443,"Well, that's because... it's because it's a... would involve a claim of damages against the paper."
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2762.443,2770.938,"--Yes, Justice White, and in addition beyond that, I think Mr. Rothenberg's invocation of voluntary agreement is a bit of a red herring."
1990.90-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2790.589,2791.37,Thank you.
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2814.056,2817.899,"He could have said that, Justice Scalia--"
1990.90-634,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2817.899,2819.619,What page is that?
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2819.619,2820.059,--I'm... I'm--
1990.90-634,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2820.059,2820.9,Page A-14.
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2822.473,2823.261,--Yeah.
1990.90-634,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2934.025,2940.928,"Mr. French, assuming we get to the First Amendment issue, there's one thing you said a little while ago that I'm not... I may have misunderstood."
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2976.602,2982.857,"You're... you're saying, Justice Souter, the reporter does this on his own as a private citizen?"
1990.90-634,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2982.857,2983.217,That's right.
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,2991.961,2997.285,I suppose the reporter would have an argument that the First Amendment applies to me.
1990.90-634,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3002.738,3007.423,"Well, how can you say it would be very... he goes to another newspaper and sells the information and they publish it."
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,3007.423,3010.665,"--Well, I'm back to the other hypothetical."
1990.90-634,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3010.665,3013.627,"Yes, you're exactly... you get exactly the same situation, don't you?"
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,3013.627,3025.916,"If he goes to another newspaper and publishes it, then once again, he has acted contrary to his fiduciary duty to his employer and he has sold a piece of information that doesn't belong to him."
1990.90-634,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3029.736,3038.742,"Does... does it make it easier for you to answer if we assume also that the newspaper is liable for the misdeeds of its agents, so you're stuck for the damages."
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,3040.104,3042.635,The newspaper is stuck for the damages?
1990.90-634,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3042.635,3045.617,"Yes, because of the misdeeds of its agent."
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,3045.617,3060.217,"I believe that in this context since we are talking about assessing damages with respect to the act of publication, the newspaper should not be stuck for the damages, as you put it, Your Honor."
1990.90-634,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3060.217,3063.85,I don't... and... but the reporter is?
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,3063.85,3068.101,"No, I'm... the First Amendment always counts."
1990.90-634,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3070.692,3072.665,But most of all when it's the newspaper that's involved.
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,3072.665,3080.42,--When... what this Court has said is that it is protecting the public's right to know and it is protecting the process of editorial judgment.
1990.90-634,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3090.748,3093.189,But you're not sure as to what happens with the reporter.
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,3109.928,3111.04,--Your Honor--
1990.90-634,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3111.04,3114.672,--And you haven't... and it seems to me that you haven't explained this in a coherent theory.
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,3114.672,3117.245,"--This... what I... I'll try again, Your Honor."
1990.90-634,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3178.335,3181.297,"Mr. French, that depends on what you mean by balancing."
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,3207.385,3208.795,"That's all right, Your Honor."
1990.90-634,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3210.027,3211.406,I think the Chief Justice will let you--
1990.90-634,1,30274,john_d_french,,3212.938,3234.362,"Your Honor, there should I suspect... if we had 100 of these cases and we could see enough fact situations, I think we would find some instances in which we would say if this is the interest that the claimant is trying to protect, it is insignificant in comparison with the First Amendment interest, and the First Amendment interest always overrides."
1990.90-634,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3252.185,3253.463,"Thank you, Mr. French."
1990.90-634,2,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,3257.036,3260.289,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court again:"
1990.90-634,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3397.209,3409.195,"Well, Mr. Rothenberg, that troubles me a little, because Mr. Cohen could have sent the information in an unmarked envelope presumably, and the paper would still have had it, right?"
1990.90-634,2,23004,elliot_c_rothenberg,,3409.195,3416.651,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor, but Mr. Cohen, as many other confidential sources, felt that he could trust the promises of the reporters."
1990.90-634,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3425.746,3436.693,"Of course, you can't say it comes from a reliable source if you get it in an unmarked envelop, and I assume no responsible reporter would use it if it just came... you know, unless it was independently verifiable somehow."
