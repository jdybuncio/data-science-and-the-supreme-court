1986.86-5344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.856,"We will hear arguments next in James Miller against Florida, No. 86-5344."
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,67.525,72.846,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-5344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,117.791,130.348,"Mr. Calvello, as a preliminary matter, would you explain something to me about the effect of the concurrent sentences we see by Mr. Miller?"
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,137.955,138.789,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-5344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,138.789,145.276,And did he receive a concurrent sentence of seven years on the burglary county?
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,145.276,145.793,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-5344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,145.793,150.597,And the guidelines were not changed as to the burglary?
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,150.597,156.501,"Well, Your Honor, as far as the amended guidelines are concerned."
1986.86-5344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,156.501,162.57,So what effect would a decision in your favor on the sex offense have?
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,166.272,167.156,"Oh, no, no."
1986.86-5344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,194.673,213.967,"Well, but if the amendment did not affect the burglary offense, and the guideline was not changed for that, then even if you are correct, would you not look back to the law at the time he was sentenced for burglary, and would that become the primary offense?"
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,213.967,216.317,Under the original guidelines?
1986.86-5344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,216.317,217.002,Yes.
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,217.002,218.602,"That's a possibility, Your Honor."
1986.86-5344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,218.602,221.787,"And if that were the case, then the sentence wouldn't change?"
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,221.787,230.577,"Oh, yes, the sentence would be changed dramatically, because, see, the primary offense would be the most serious offense at the time."
1986.86-5344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,233.077,236.646,"So even if you're right, the burglary would then be the most important offense?"
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,236.646,241.531,--But the sentence would go down to 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 years; the 7 years would be gone.
1986.86-5344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,241.531,246.833,So it's your position that it will have an effect on the burglary sentence as well?
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,246.833,247.249,An enormous effect.
1986.86-5344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,248.351,251.987,So the guideline was changed for burglary as well?
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,251.987,255.355,"No, Your Honor the only--"
1986.86-5344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,255.355,259.724,Burglary was 4-1/2 before and is 4-1/2 now?
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,259.724,272.299,"--No, the... we're talking about under the guidelines in effect at the time of the offense, at the time of the sexual offense, if you would score the sexual offense, and the burglary as an additional offense, it would be 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 years."
1986.86-5344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,401.563,414.454,"Well, Mr. Calvello, what if under the law a judge could go outside the guidelines, for good cause, for example."
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,423.143,425.929,"Your Honor, I would have to say no."
1986.86-5344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,438.336,443.056,Even if the standard for departure is something different that Florida would have?
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,443.056,446.675,--I would have--
1986.86-5344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,446.675,447.742,Than Florida has now?
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,449.794,457.214,"--If it's very, very low, then there's a possibility that might be something that might not implicate the ex post facto law."
1986.86-5344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,469.64,471.023,What about the Federal guidelines?
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,471.023,472.856,The Federal parole... the Federal sentencing?
1986.86-5344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,472.856,473.406,Or parole.
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,473.406,474.891,The Federal parole guidelines.
1986.86-5344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,477.927,480.312,It's not total discretion.
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,484.247,486.533,--They can change the guidelines--
1986.86-5344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,486.533,489.151,"The sentence, the parole guide."
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,489.151,490.317,--The parole commissioners can.
1986.86-5344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,490.317,490.667,Right.
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,490.667,492.167,But here the judge right.
1986.86-5344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,492.167,494.619,"Well, is that procedural under the Federal?"
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,494.619,496.152,The parole guidelines?
1986.86-5344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,496.152,496.654,Yes.
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,496.654,507.177,The courts have held that there is no... Ninth Circuit and Justice Rehnquist has held that there's no ex post facto implication with the parole guidelines.
1986.86-5344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,507.177,507.343,Right.
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,510.961,513.663,"Well, what they say is, they're discretionary."
1986.86-5344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,518.164,519.484,Do you agree with that?
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,519.484,524.786,"--I don't disagree with that, with the... and I don't think that--"
1986.86-5344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,524.786,525.721,"Well, you agree with it, then?"
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,525.721,529.589,--I can understand the rationale of the circuit courts.
1986.86-5344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,557.873,562.144,So does our decision turn on just how strict the standard is?
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,565.762,568.464,--It's--
1986.86-5344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,568.464,574.618,"Just the degree, the difference in degree, as to how strict the standard is?"
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,574.618,575.987,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
1986.86-5344,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,575.987,579.189,"Well, it sounds like that's what we're getting to."
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,579.189,586.426,"No, because what we have here with these guidelines is what would be an affirmative, enforceable right to receive these guidelines."
1986.86-5344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,815.14,826.032,"Before the guidelines were amended, and before your client committed this crime, could he have been sure that he would get no more than 4-1/2 years?"
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,826.032,828.817,"Yes, Your Honor, because the only way--"
1986.86-5344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,828.817,839.69,"It depends on whether there were any aggravating circumstances which a trial judge would say justifies kicking it over to the maximum, 7, wouldn't it?"
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,839.69,841.375,"--Well, not really."
1986.86-5344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,849.529,849.862,"Well, that's--"
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,849.862,855.849,"That's what... see, that's the disadvantage to him, that if... say he would have got 4-1/2 under the original guidelines."
1986.86-5344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,871.525,872.358,"--Well, that may well be."
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,898.573,898.823,"No, Your Honor."
1986.86-5344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,900.442,904.81,"Persistence in believing that what he did was okay, and he'd do it again?"
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,904.81,910.131,"No, none of... all of those grounds have been found to be invalid under Florida law."
1986.86-5344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,910.131,912.897,What kind of grounds are there that are valid?
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,912.897,927.741,"There are extreme psychological trauma to the victim is one, in certain cases, if it's not an element of a crime, can possible be a ground to depart, if the facts are proven beyond a reasonable doubt."
1986.86-5344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,930.877,944.518,"You know, it seems to me the ex post facto protection is meant to prevent somebody from being surprised, thinking he'd committed a minor offense, and it's suddenly an aggravated offense."
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,955.826,961.647,--See... well... the... fair warning is one element of the ex post facto clause.
1986.86-5344,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1005.391,1020.333,"Well, what if after the crime was committed, there were a series of new judges appointed, and all of them were... they were known as hanging judges, they always gave the maximum."
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,1033.576,1039.396,"Oh, well as far as the composition of the bench, no, because we're not dealing with laws."
1986.86-5344,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1082.055,1087.192,"So you were... what your really claim is... claim is, is that you were deprived of leniency?"
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,1087.192,1088.642,No.
1986.86-5344,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1115.878,1124.501,It's still not like the ordinary ex post facto case where the individual at the the time he commits the crime does not think there's a chance of his getting any more than 4-1/2 years.
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,1147.164,1149.282,I think it's exactly the type of unfairness.
1986.86-5344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1197.18,1200.799,"Well, did the Court... did our Court hold anything in that case?"
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,1202.901,1203.734,"Yes, it was, Your Honor."
1986.86-5344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1203.734,1204.853,Did we write an opinion?
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,1204.853,1206.853,"It was a summary affirmance, Your Honor."
1986.86-5344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1213.559,1219.445,"Well, what I asked you was whether our Court held anything in Greenfield?"
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,1219.445,1221.628,It was a summary affirmance?
1986.86-5344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1221.628,1222.397,Without opinion?
1986.86-5344,0,15708,anthony_calvello,,1222.397,1223.747,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-5344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1327.765,1329.0,"Thank you, Mr. Calvello."
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,1330.6,1339.706,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-5344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1403.111,1403.611,But you can't give them?
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,1403.611,1405.877,--They can... the--
1986.86-5344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1405.877,1410.348,"You can't give them unless you have some special factor, right?"
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,1410.348,1418.954,"--The trial judge may depart up to the statutory maximum if there are clear and convincing reasons for doing so, which must be set forth in writing."
1986.86-5344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1418.954,1421.489,So in fact you can't get seven years?
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,1421.489,1422.473,"Well, in--"
1986.86-5344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1422.473,1426.458,Any trial judge can't give you seven years just because he wants to give you seven years.
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,1426.458,1428.642,"--Actually, it's 15 years for sexual battery."
1986.86-5344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1437.182,1442.402,Clear and convincing reasons that are reviewable by other courts.
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,1442.402,1442.952,--That are reviewable.
1986.86-5344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1442.952,1443.969,What are those reasons?
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,1445.688,1449.556,"Well, the court... in my brief, I've listed about 25 reasons."
1986.86-5344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1468.553,1473.338,I'm trying to figure out how many of those are foreseeable by the defendant.
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,1475.79,1476.373,No.
1986.86-5344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1498.469,1500.405,Reading a list--
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,1500.405,1502.357,Threats to the victims and the witnesses.
1986.86-5344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1509.594,1521.652,--It's only the effects on the victim's family that I recall that is something that I would say is not clearly predictable by the criminal.
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,1559.044,1560.61,"--No, that's true."
1986.86-5344,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1626.653,1639.043,"And if this Court were to reverse the Supreme Court of Florida, I suppose a seven year sentence could be imposed under the later guidelines, with the finding of reasons on the appellate review."
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,1639.043,1639.843,That's exactly correct.
1986.86-5344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1722.695,1730.118,"It would be difference in the next case, if indeed, the prosecutor hadn't said, I have aggravating circumstances here?"
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,1730.118,1732.551,"Well, I think--"
1986.86-5344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1732.551,1740.888,"I mean, is that what you're relying on, the fact that the prosecutor here said there were aggravating circumstances, so that he might have gotten the longer sentence anyway?"
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,1740.888,1746.859,"--Well, in any case, that there's aggravating circumstances, whether the prosecutor says it or whether the judge finds it to be so."
1986.86-5344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1755.947,1760.784,"Why didn't the judge just do that, and avoid this whole... just use the old guidelines and find the aggravated circumstances?"
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,1760.784,1774.044,"--Because the judge accepted the prosecutor's argument which we're arguing today, that these were procedural changes, and because the statutory maximum was unaltered, that you could simply use the guidelines in effect on the date of sentencing."
1986.86-5344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1774.727,1778.829,"Do you think... I mean, just for purposes of deciding the case, should we assume there are aggravating circumstances or not?"
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,1785.616,1789.387,"--I don't think we can assume there are none, because the prosecutor urged that there were."
1986.86-5344,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1793.688,1801.194,But the legal question is whether the seven year sentence is adequate on the assumption that he might have found no aggravating circumstances.
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,1801.194,1806.412,But I think we never have really decided ex post facto cases based on what might have been or speculation.
1986.86-5344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1869.052,1869.754,Why is that?
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,1873.372,1875.658,"--Well, they had it for the whole system."
1986.86-5344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1877.108,1879.36,"Well, you gave that away needlessly in that case."
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,1885.014,1887.18,"--Well, this defendant committed the defense after."
1986.86-5344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1887.18,1888.132,"No, I understand."
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,1893.0,1893.452,Right.
1986.86-5344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1893.452,1904.908,"--was based on the fact that, after all, Florida was abolishing parole and it felt that the ex post facto laws required... guarantee required that this adjustment be made."
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,1904.908,1905.658,That's correct.
1986.86-5344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1905.658,1909.61,But you could say the same thing about parole that you've told us for this new sentencing system.
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,1916.047,1918.649,But he was entitled to be considered for parole.
1986.86-5344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1923.886,1930.29,"--Well, you could say here, he was entitled to be considered for the lesser sentence instead of the seven years, that he would have entitled to be considered--"
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,1930.29,1932.575,"--Well, the trial judge could have departed under."
1986.86-5344,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1936.11,1956.273,"--Mr. Shearer, Lindsey against Washington, the case from the '30s in this Court, which was certainly relied on in Dobbert and I think mentioned in Grant, there the Washington State legislature changed max-mix sentence where the max is 15 years, to mandatory 15 years."
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,1975.585,1985.876,"I think that the distinction between Lindsey and this case is that in Lindsey all discretion in sentencing was removed completely, because only the 15 year sentence could be given."
1986.86-5344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2110.523,2113.809,It was especially set up to get around the ex post facto?
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2113.809,2115.375,"No, it was--"
1986.86-5344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2115.375,2116.094,Is that what you're saying?
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2116.094,2126.367,--I'm saying it gives fair warning to offenders that the statute specifically sets up a commission to review and continually revise and amend the guidelines.
1986.86-5344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2126.367,2128.735,To get around the ex post facto part?
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2128.735,2138.507,"No, the purpose is to benefit from our experience with the guidelines and adjust them and fine tune them to deal with problems that come up, because this is a whole new system."
1986.86-5344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2138.507,2148.815,"Suppose the basic statute says, the penalty for sexual assault is 15 years, provided however that this penalty may be changed at any time."
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2158.938,2164.825,"Well, I think here, though, the guidelines, where the statutory maximum stays the same."
1986.86-5344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2166.36,2171.661,"No, but that's back to your other argument that this is not, after all, the statutory sentence or guidelines."
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2178.667,2182.119,"Well, we're not doing it to violate the Constitution. We're--"
1986.86-5344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2182.119,2183.285,"Well, you didn't put it that way."
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2190.373,2196.962,"--Well, but fair warning to offenders that the guidelines are subject to change is one of the crucial factors in the parole cases that--"
1986.86-5344,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2196.962,2198.762,"So you think that statute would be okay, then."
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2205.116,2207.485,"--No, because that's the maximum sentence for the offense."
1986.86-5344,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2251.347,2267.808,"xxx some what differently if the prison authorities had said... or the legislature or someone said... here is gain time, but we may change it, may reduce it, may reduce it."
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2271.093,2276.747,"It may have, if there was some commission that was supposed to annually study the problem and make some determination?"
1986.86-5344,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2276.747,2278.764,"So your answer is yet, if there had been adequate notice?"
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2278.764,2288.037,"Yes, because that was something important in Weaver, that there was no notice to this man that when he went to prison... or actually, when he committed his offense, that his gain time would be altered."
1986.86-5344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2451.292,2461.08,xxx that these guidelines only apply to cases that were tried after the guidelines were passed?
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2463.349,2464.866,"I'm sorry, what?"
1986.86-5344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2464.866,2473.455,"If we said that these guidelines apply only in the future, would that wreck the system of Florida?"
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2473.455,2480.661,"Well, I think that the problem is that the guidelines have to be continually altered and--"
1986.86-5344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2480.661,2482.68,Would that wreck the whole thing?
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2482.68,2486.965,"--It would make it administratively difficult for the courts, and it may--"
1986.86-5344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2486.965,2488.75,How would it be difficult--
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2488.75,2498.273,"--Well, because the courts would have to, when they're sentencing a particular individual, determine the date of his offense, and then determine what guidelines were in effect then."
1986.86-5344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2498.273,2500.006,--That's a problem?
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2500.006,2501.057,It can be.
1986.86-5344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2507.878,2509.33,So one more would be a problem?
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2509.33,2511.547,But there's going to be a fifth and a sixth.
1986.86-5344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2511.547,2513.949,It would be much easier not to try them at all.
1986.86-5344,1,32776,joy_b_shearer,,2513.949,2524.34,"Well, anyway, Your Honor, I think that the administrative problems are a valid concern."
1986.86-5344,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2571.069,2571.654,"Thank you, Ms. Shearer."
1986.86-5344,2,15708,anthony_calvello,,2574.456,2576.373,"I have nothing further, Your Honor."
1986.86-5344,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2577.106,2578.508,The case is submitted.
