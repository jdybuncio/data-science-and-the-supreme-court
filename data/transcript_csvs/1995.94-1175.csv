1995.94-1175,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.487,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 94-1175, Bank One Chicago v. Midwest Bank & Trust Company."
1995.94-1175,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,9.272,12.558,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1175,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,105.383,116.625,"Mr. Long, is there any possibility that Congress intended the regulations promulgated under subsection (f) to be enforced under the Uniform Commercial Code some way?"
1995.94-1175,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,116.625,122.212,--We think that's not a possible interpretation here.
1995.94-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,168.593,183.52,"Mr. Long, would it make any substantive difference whether Federal courts had jurisdiction under section 4010 immediately, or whether they had it only indirectly under section 1331 of title 28?"
1995.94-1175,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,183.52,185.852,I think the short answer is no.
1995.94-1175,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,190.023,201.731,"I take it, in line with your answer to Justice O'Connor, the board has promulgated regulations that require that the checks be honored with diligence and in good faith."
1995.94-1175,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,207.718,214.122,"Yes, Justice Kennedy, they're Federal standards, and they really are a substantial change in this area."
1995.94-1175,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,235.785,248.878,"If the board had determined that it should be the one to determine what is good faith, and that it should adjudicate these claims, could it have set up an adjudicative mechanism under the existing statute, or do you think additional authority would be required for that?"
1995.94-1175,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,248.878,250.997,I think additional authority would be required.
1995.94-1175,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,265.673,270.375,"And there's no statutory mechanism for review, for judicial review of any such administrative--"
1995.94-1175,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,270.375,270.941,--That's right.
1995.94-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,292.437,294.972,"--Well, we have an Administrative Procedure Act which does all of that."
1995.94-1175,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,305.745,315.986,"Well, I agree that presumptively under the APA there would be judicial review, but under a decision such as Coit, where Congress has demonstrated that when it wants an agency to adjudicate--"
1995.94-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,315.986,326.842,"That's a question of whether... whether we should interpret the statute in such a way as to give the board the authority, but if it... if the board has the authority, there's really no problem about what procedures it would have to use, is there?"
1995.94-1175,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,326.842,332.313,"--Well, there would be a problem about what procedures the agency would use."
1995.94-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,338.835,340.851,But that's not all that the Administrative Procedure Act contains.
1995.94-1175,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,346.572,365.486,"--Yes, I agree with that, but again, the Coit decision says that in the context where Congress has been quite specific and precise and explicit about giving adjudicatory authority to an agency to adjudicate private claims, the Court will not infer that authority where it's not been expressly given."
1995.94-1175,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,365.486,374.841,"Mr. Long, is it appropriate for us to give any weight to the Fed's own view that it does not have this adjudicatory authority?"
1995.94-1175,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,374.841,377.46,"Yes, I think it is, Justice Ginsburg."
1995.94-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,382.828,393.97,"Well, don't you think there's a difference when the board is just speaking about its own house, and when the board is not... I mean, when the board says, we don't have it, the board is also saying, you have it, that is, the Federal courts."
1995.94-1175,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,396.255,397.355,Well--
1995.94-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,397.355,402.676,That's different from the usual deference situation when the board is just talking about its own ox.
1995.94-1175,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,409.396,412.265,--I agree the two questions are closely related.
1995.94-1175,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,426.441,435.63,"Well, there wouldn't just be a serious question if the board purported to say that there was Federal jurisdiction, there would be no deference at all, I take it."
1995.94-1175,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,435.63,441.951,"I would concede that, Mr. Chief Justice, but here it's not a question of jurisdiction, because we have subsection (d)."
1995.94-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,576.701,577.284,Mr. Long--
1995.94-1175,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,577.284,577.751,Yes.
1995.94-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,577.751,600.982,"--subsection (e) of 4010 says that no provision of this section imposing any liability shall apply to any act done or omitted in good faith in conformity with any rule, regulation, or interpretation thereof by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System."
1995.94-1175,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,619.444,634.054,"I think, Justice Scalia, the Federal Reserve would have authority to interpret its rules, and, indeed, it's issued an extensive commentary to the rules that accompanies them without conducting any adjudications."
1995.94-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,634.054,636.406,Just issue interpretive bulletins?
1995.94-1175,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,636.406,637.923,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-1175,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,637.923,649.547,"Which would be binding on the courts... well, at least as far as assessing liability when anybody's acting in good faith reliance on--"
1995.94-1175,0,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,649.547,651.165,"To that extent, yes, I think so."
1995.94-1175,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,792.525,793.608,"--Very well, Mr. Long."
1995.94-1175,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,795.41,807.8,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1175,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,864.387,867.422,"Mr. Minear, isn't it odd, the placement of this statute?"
1995.94-1175,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,874.993,891.304,"I think the answer to that is found in the legislative history of the act, that when Congress first provided the bills that... the initial bills, both the House and Senate bills, they provided a provision, subsection (a), that covered any person, including depository institutions."
1995.94-1175,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,919.105,925.96,"It might have been better drafting, then, if they switched to put the jurisdictional provision at the end."
1995.94-1175,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,925.96,927.094,It certainly would have.
1995.94-1175,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1046.489,1056.095,"Mr. Minear, do you agree that it doesn't make any difference whether the Federal court has jurisdiction under 4010 or under section 1331 of title 28?"
1995.94-1175,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1056.095,1060.464,I agree with Mr. Long that ultimately it leads to the same place.
1995.94-1175,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1093.268,1096.304,"Thank you, Mr. Minear."
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1098.422,1104.576,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1175,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1196.17,1228.074,"I'm not sure that that proves your point, because it speaks... as you were quoting it, it speaks of allocating risks, not of imposing liability, which sounds to me as though what it's talking about under (f) is the promulgation of rules which determine who will bear the liability, i.e. the risk of loss, and not a rule which actually imposes liability in a... or an act of the agency which imposes liability in a specific case."
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1228.074,1252.958,"--Justice Souter, my point being is in this case the claim was that Midwest Bank failed to exercise ordinary care as required by 12 C.F.R. 229.38, that that rule, which is part of Regulation CC, is not promulgated under 611(f)."
1995.94-1175,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1255.91,1263.664,"Okay, so you were not quoting that language to show that, or to prove your claim that (f) is an adjudicatory authorization."
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1263.664,1263.88,No.
1995.94-1175,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1264.214,1264.932,That was a separate point.
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1264.932,1265.949,--I was... right.
1995.94-1175,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1293.499,1301.855,"Well, if you do get into the legislative history, I suppose you do rely on the words, impose liability, in the second paragraph--"
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1301.855,1302.239,--Absolutely.
1995.94-1175,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1302.239,1306.343,"--of the thing you quote, which is different from allocating risks, I suppose you say."
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1306.343,1333.243,"Yes, and I would point out that the language and the structure of 611, subpart 6511(a), subsection 611(a) and 611(f) are very different, that under section 611(a), which the petitioner and the United States say are parallel provisions, the language is quite different."
1995.94-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1345.551,1350.955,"I must say, I don't understand what language in (f) you are hanging this legislative history on."
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1366.298,1366.832,--No.
1995.94-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1368.032,1368.6,Well then--
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1368.6,1387.395,"--what I'm suggesting is, it doesn't say rule-making in (f) anywhere, either, and I'm saying that since the Court raised the rule-making question, and seem to believe that rule-making was authorized by (f) and that Regulation CC, the regulation--"
1995.94-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1387.395,1398.519,"--Why not just look up above to (e), reliance on board rulings, which says no provision of this section imposing any liability shall apply to any act done or made in good faith in conforming with any rule, regulation, or interpretation thereof?"
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1401.805,1406.19,"--I think the rule-making is under section 609, Your Honor."
1995.94-1175,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1406.19,1413.945,Did the board purport to be applying either 611 or 609 when it issued Regulation CC?
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1419.766,1426.17,I don't believe it is specific as to which section it is relying on in the act.
1995.94-1175,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1426.17,1446.834,"I mean, just... I'm not certain what the relevance of this argument is to the case question in front of us, but if it is relevant, looking at 609, and I just looked at it briefly, it sounds as if 609 says you can promulgate regulations to tell banks what to do, and it sounds as if 611(f) is saying you can do another thing, too."
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1481.173,1487.411,"Well, I agreed with Your Honor until you got to the last part, with all due respect."
1995.94-1175,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1497.849,1506.038,"The liability part... for example, it says, a bank that fails to act in good faith under this subpart may be liable for other damages."
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1515.078,1537.009,"Because, as that they point out, I believe, in the legislative history, that Congress intended all of the regulation, of these regulations to be promulgated under 609, that I think the rules that they're talking about are perhaps rules for procedures for imposing liability."
1995.94-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1541.795,1545.949,"Mr. Epsteen, is this your second view of the case?"
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1560.292,1561.625,That's true.
1995.94-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1566.529,1574.801,So you're kind of fleshing out the rather terse Seventh Circuit explanation of what it did.
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1574.801,1584.657,"Well, when the Seventh Circuit raised the issue and we looked at it, we became convinced that the Seventh Circuit was correct that there was no Federal question jurisdiction."
1995.94-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1664.907,1667.109,So we're sort of at the mercy of the States.
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1676.381,1686.773,"As far as I know, every State, Your Honor, has the provision which would, with respect to banks incorporates these regulations."
1995.94-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1686.773,1696.129,"Well, I guess that's a lucky thing, because otherwise on your theory there wouldn't be any relief in any court in that State, neither Federal nor State courts."
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1702.198,1717.558,"Well, but that has been around for sometime, Your Honor, and I think the regulations that are promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board and their official commentary throughout them recognizes the interplay between the regulations and the Uniform Commercial Code."
1995.94-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1717.558,1730.35,"Mr. Epsteen, is that indeed your position, or are you recognizing that there is Federal jurisdiction but it's in the agency in the first instance, or are you saying that the only forum for these interbank disputes is the State court?"
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1730.35,1746.942,"Well, I think there would be jurisdiction within the agency if the agency sought to exercise it, but since the agency has declined to exercise it, our point is that there certainly is still a forum in which these claims could be adjudicated in the State courts."
1995.94-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1746.942,1752.846,"So if the agency chose to exercise that authority, where would the next stop be?"
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1756.917,1776.545,"Well, I think the agency's adjudication would then, if it decided... and I think under (f) it can pass and promulgate some rules for its process of adjudication, and I think it would then be subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedures Act."
1995.94-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1776.545,1776.795,Where?
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1776.795,1781.715,I don't have a specific... I'm not sure I understand your question.
1995.94-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1781.715,1789.888,"Well, would it be the D.C. Circuit, would it be any district court where the bank... the same venue as the bank, or what... where would it be?"
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1789.888,1793.923,I think it would be... I must apologize.
1995.94-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1796.958,1797.775,Maybe the district court.
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1801.946,1803.396,I believe it would be in the district court.
1995.94-1175,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1803.396,1814.087,"May I ask, if a proceeding were brought in the State court under your view, trying to enforce the regulation, would we have jurisdiction to review a decision of the State court?"
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1814.087,1821.658,This is the only Federal court that I know of that has jurisdiction to review decisions of State courts.
1995.94-1175,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1821.658,1823.575,"But you said there would be a Federal question, in your view."
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1828.596,1834.417,"Well, I think that this Court always has the jurisdiction to review the decision of the State court."
1995.94-1175,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1849.343,1852.109,"Well, if it's a State law question, then we would not have jurisdiction."
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1858.699,1864.852,I think it is a State law question under the Federal regulations.
1995.94-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1865.635,1887.718,"Well then, how could the agency, if it chose to adjudicate... I mean, if you're right in what you answered before, that the agency if it wanted to could adjudicate, then you'd have APA review in the appropriate district court, it would all be Federal, only you get at the ground floor an agency instead of a court, then it would all be Federal."
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1887.718,1919.07,"--That is correct, but I understood Justice Stevens' question to be that if it were brought in the State court, where the Federal regulations become a part of the State law, they become agreements under the State law under 4-103 of the code, of the Uniform Commercial Code, then it's really proceeding under State law, although I guess construction of any regulations promulgated by the board, if we're talking about how the interpretation or construction, it would be Federal--"
1995.94-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1919.07,1919.537,Of course it has to be a Federal question.
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1919.537,1920.439,--would be Federal--
1995.94-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1920.439,1920.755,Of course.
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1920.755,1921.405,--Yes.
1995.94-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1921.405,1926.593,"And since it is a Federal question, why doesn't section 1331 get you to the same destination anyway?"
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1926.593,1927.659,Well--
1995.94-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1927.659,1951.124,"I know you claim section 1331 is not at issue here, but just indulge me that I think it is, and even if it isn't, if I think that 1331's going to lead you to the same destination anyway, I'm not going to... you know, I'm not going to bend over backwards to hold that, you know, (f) doesn't apply, because what's the difference, you may as well... if it's at all ambiguous you may as well hold that (f) gets you there and have it all in the same statute."
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1953.957,1971.252,"--Well, first of all, 1331 has not... as far as I know never conferred jurisdiction in any Federal regulation case involving the check collection process, and these Federal regulations have been around for some years, and--"
1995.94-1175,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1971.252,1975.322,"Was that merely a matter of fact, or because of the word laws in 1331?"
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1980.124,1986.011,"--No, but what I'm saying is that first of all--"
1995.94-1175,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1986.011,1989.832,"Well, is a regulation a law under 1331?"
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,1989.832,1992.534,--I view a regulation promulgated pursuant to a statute to be a law.
1995.94-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2001.39,2007.544,"I mean, the explanation for the phenomenon you describe is simply that there is a specific jurisdictional provision that covers all these other things."
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2007.544,2008.627,--But--
1995.94-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2008.627,2014.548,"When there isn't one, then you go to the fallback jurisdiction of 1331, and why wouldn't that apply?"
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2014.548,2030.623,"--Well, Your Honor, I think when Congress in 611, and I agree with the United States' position on this that we ought to really confine ourselves to the four corners of this act, when Congress specifically says under (a) there is no juris--"
1995.94-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2030.623,2033.159,It doesn't say there's no jurisdiction on the--
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2033.159,2035.611,--It doesn't say there's no... it says there's no cause of action under (a).
1995.94-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2035.611,2036.377,"--Under (a), that's--"
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2036.377,2038.829,"Under (a), no cause of action for interbank disputes."
1995.94-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2038.829,2039.496,--Right.
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2039.496,2042.246,And under (d)--
1995.94-1175,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2042.246,2044.162,That isn't quite right.
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2047.698,2048.9,--Correct.
1995.94-1175,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2048.9,2049.433,Yes.
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2049.433,2051.435,I misspoke if I said something differently.
1995.94-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2075.632,2078.918,"It says, liability under this subsection."
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2083.656,2084.773,Well--
1995.94-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2084.773,2091.06,"It says, liability under this subsection shall not exceed the amount of the check giving rise to the loss or liability, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2105.986,2111.39,"--That's true, but if you are looking at titles, it is (a), then--"
1995.94-1175,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2111.39,2112.573,I know (a) also says--
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2112.573,2114.925,"--as to civil liability, and (f), which has a very different--"
1995.94-1175,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2114.925,2115.458,--Right.
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2115.458,2116.544,--a very different title--
1995.94-1175,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2116.544,2118.81,Yes.
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2118.81,2130.535,"--and so if you... if the Court were to view (f) as creating a cause of action, I would suggest that when Congress picked the language for (a), it knew that this language in (a) would create a cause of action."
1995.94-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2139.458,2140.743,"Well then, there's no Federal cause of action."
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2150.062,2152.181,--I say there is no Federal cause of action created--
1995.94-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2152.181,2159.101,"Well, then the States can decide it, and they can all come out different ways about what the Federal regulation means, because this is not a Federal question."
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2159.101,2170.475,"--Well, if that were a problem and the Federal Reserve Board perceived a problem in uniformity, and Congress perceived such a problem, it certainly could change the legislation."
1995.94-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2170.475,2185.235,"But if that's your answer, then you would have to go back and revise what you said about the agency, if it wants to get into this act, could set itself up as an adjudicator, and then you'd have district court review, so you can't have it both ways."
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2192.156,2206.649,"Well, I think that the issue of whether the agency could or couldn't do it really arises out of the dicta in the Seventh Circuit's opinion, because the agency has not attempted to do it."
1995.94-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2237.037,2241.572,"Well, again, are you saying that Congress has not provided for the agency either?"
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2258.466,2276.828,--If... I believe that these actions are to be adjudicated under the Uniform Commercial Code in the State courts between banks.
1995.94-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2280.547,2284.434,Which means that the agency could not adjudicate even if it wanted to.
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2284.434,2286.884,I think that... yes.
1995.94-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2288.17,2291.421,That's a different position than the one you were taking up till now.
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2291.421,2292.004,--Yes.
1995.94-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2308.883,2316.12,"But then what do you make of the Seventh Circuit, that says disputes such as this are to be handled administratively before the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System--"
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2316.12,2318.322,--Well--
1995.94-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2318.322,2323.809,"--and then went on to say the board has informed us it doesn't have any mechanism to do this, but that's the board's problem?"
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2323.809,2358.399,"--Well, I think... I think there are times when clearinghouses... and in my experience, I have seen situations where clearinghouses administratively deal with claims of banks without a hearing based on written submissions, but I believe that this is not a Federal cause of action that is enforceable in Federal courts, as cause of action is talked about, let's say in Davis v. Passman, which is cited in the Government's brief."
1995.94-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2371.374,2392.787,"You have a different spin on it than the Seventh Circuit, because as I read the Seventh Circuit's opinion, the Seventh Circuit was pretty sure about the Federal Reserve System but not so sure about State courts, because it said, or perhaps in State court, so the Seventh Circuit seemed to think of this as an agency adjudication, correct?"
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2392.787,2408.832,"--That's... they did, and the initial decision of the Seventh Circuit didn't refer to the State courts, and there was some concern that they might have been blocking out the State courts, and then on rehearing they revised their opinion and put their phrase in, oh, perhaps in State courts."
1995.94-1175,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2408.832,2417.354,"But... so that theory, whatever it was, is quite different from yours, because theirs did not turn on the State courts as being the adjudicator."
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2420.222,2442.403,"They had a question mark about State court, they... but they believed that the board could administratively decide interbank disputes, that's true, but I don't believe that they create a type of cause of action that would be a judicially enforceable cause of action that would trigger 611(d)."
1995.94-1175,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2442.403,2444.922,"May I ask you a question, Mr. Epstein?"
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2454.294,2458.062,"There is... in the district court, the Standard Bank case."
1995.94-1175,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2461.014,2465.132,"It's kind of interesting, because there must be zillions of these transactions, and so scarce litigation."
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2467.668,2493.133,"Well, one of the things we did in preparing for this case, Your Honor, was went to the computer research and punched in the regulations, and to see the cases, and I was unable to find a single Federal case where there was Federal question subject matter jurisdiction in Regulation J or Regulation CC."
1995.94-1175,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2505.293,2509.161,"But just a few, isn't that correct, or were there a lot of them?"
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2509.161,2515.315,"Not a large number, but I'd say maybe a dozen cases."
1995.94-1175,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2515.315,2519.101,"Yes, and that's since... Regulation J has been on the books about 15 years, hasn't it?"
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2519.101,2558.309,"Yes, since 1980, although Regulation J was amended a few times and got certainly more substance in '85 and '86, and one of the interesting parts of Regulation J in '86 is that the Federal Reserve Board, while these were all being enforced through State courts, said there's one area of nonuniformity which is a statute of limitations, and in 1986 they put a 2-year statute of limitations in Regulation J so that when it was enforced through the Uniform Commercial Code in all the State courts, there would be a uniform statute of limitations."
1995.94-1175,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2558.309,2565.164,"Mr. Epsteen, I ought to know this, but I don't, does the board do any other adjudication?"
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2575.937,2580.924,"Your Honor, I do not know the answer to that question, I'm sorry."
1995.94-1175,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2637.278,2638.713,"Thank you, Mr. Epsteen."
1995.94-1175,2,39139,robert_g_epsteen,,2638.713,2639.213,Thank you.
1995.94-1175,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2639.213,2641.664,"Mr. Long, you have 6 minutes remaining."
1995.94-1175,3,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2641.664,2649.235,"When the Expedited Funds Act was passed, the Federal Reserve Board had no administrative law judges at all."
1995.94-1175,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2662.828,2667.363,"They need them at least for personnel matters on occasion, and would have to borrow them for that, I would assume."
1995.94-1175,3,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2667.363,2667.899,"Yes, sir."
1995.94-1175,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2667.899,2675.136,Does the fact that they get their administrative law judges out of a pool cut one way or another in this case?
1995.94-1175,3,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2675.136,2684.158,"Well, I think it emphasizes how unusual it would be to assume that Congress intended the agency to start adjudicating all these interbank claims."
1995.94-1175,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2684.158,2686.526,But not if you don't expect there to be very many.
1995.94-1175,3,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2688.16,2688.978,Well--
1995.94-1175,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2688.978,2690.778,--piece of litigation.
1995.94-1175,3,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2694.014,2699.001,"--Very few checks are returned, but it still adds up to hundreds and hundreds of millions a year."
1995.94-1175,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2699.001,2710.059,"But still, 10 or 12 cases in 15 years out of hundreds and hundreds of millions of transactions indicates it's a fairly rare situation when you get into court over something like this."
1995.94-1175,3,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2710.059,2718.848,"I think banks seem to be fairly good at working out their differences, but it does come up, and they need a place to go to work them out."
1995.94-1175,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2718.848,2719.398,I wonder what their secret is.
1995.94-1175,3,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2720.95,2723.667,Good rational--
1995.94-1175,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2723.667,2727.937,"Well, their secret is that a bad settlement is better than a good lawsuit."
1995.94-1175,3,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2729.003,2738.043,"--Justice Scalia, you had mentioned 4010(e) in the interpretations of the board."
1995.94-1175,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2773.216,2780.488,Do you have any explanation for the lack of lawsuits in Federal court under other board regulations?
1995.94-1175,3,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2781.022,2785.726,"Well, Regulation J has been around for quite a long time."
1995.94-1175,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2834.123,2839.611,"--The Federal Reserve bank jurisdictional provision, it doesn't just mean if you're insured."
1995.94-1175,3,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2845.097,2847.799,"I believe so, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.94-1175,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2871.498,2875.534,--But you're not disputing that the State courts are an appropriate forum.
1995.94-1175,3,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2875.534,2878.652,"Oh, no, and 4010(d) gives the concurrent jurisdiction."
1995.94-1175,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2900.999,2902.499,"Thank you, Mr. Long."
