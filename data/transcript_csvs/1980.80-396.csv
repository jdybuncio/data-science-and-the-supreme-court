1980.80-396,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.154,We'll hear arguments next in City of Newport v. Fact Concerts.
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,45.217,47.653,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.80-396,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,278.622,286.854,You wouldn't suggest that punitive damages would have been improper in just the ordinary case.
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,288.728,294.023,"Well, I am limited here to talking because of the--"
1980.80-396,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,294.023,302.518,"Well, I know, but is your argument that no punitive damages against municipalities because no punitive damages against anyone?"
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,302.518,303.378,"--No, no, sir."
1980.80-396,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,311.703,317.935,"The legislative history you're citing goes only to, or the case law that you're citing goes only to municipalities?"
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,317.935,319.248,"--It does, sir, yes."
1980.80-396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,319.248,325.089,And these Congressmen whose views you have cited were proponents of the Sherman Amendment?
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,325.089,327.572,I believe Representative Butler was.
1980.80-396,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,421.254,431.595,I suppose you'd make an exception of those cities and towns that happen to like rock concerts?
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,431.595,437.826,"Well, you see, perhaps that is so."
1980.80-396,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,460.707,469.392,But you say that the issue is whether punitive damages would ever be allowed against a municipality?
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,469.392,470.624,"That's true, sir."
1980.80-396,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,470.624,485.009,"And that even if there's a deliberate denial of First Amendment rights or malice or what have you, the normal underpinnings of punitive damages, if they're all there, nevertheless, no damages like that against a municipality?"
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,485.009,486.29,"Yes, I say that, sir."
1980.80-396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,487.227,499.8,"And furthermore, Mr. Wells, I gather you say that... I guess you've settled that the 1983 liability of a municipality requires the plaintiff to prove that it is a matter of municipal policy?"
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,499.8,500.847,"--That's true, sir."
1980.80-396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,500.847,510.781,"Not just accident, but affirmative policy: the municipality has violated the federal constitutional statutory rights of the plaintiff, on purpose, done it on purpose."
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,510.781,511.188,"Yes, sir."
1980.80-396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,511.188,514.264,"And notwithstanding all that, you say, no punitive damages?"
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,514.264,516.434,No punitive damages against the municipality.
1980.80-396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,521.51,523.54,"Of course, the municipality has no immunity defense either."
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,523.54,525.087,--That's quite true.
1980.80-396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,525.087,526.367,After City of Independence.
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,526.367,527.961,"That's quite true, sir."
1980.80-396,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,527.961,538.503,"And the holding that my brother Brennan referred to means you have to prove all of that before you can even get compensatory damages, doesn't it?"
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,538.503,538.862,"Yes, sir."
1980.80-396,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,606.584,608.803,"They are the same people that are on the jury too, aren't they?"
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,608.803,611.193,"--Not necessarily, Your Honor."
1980.80-396,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,614.94,619.049,Do you mean that there are people on juries in Rhode Island that are not taxpayers?
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,619.049,621.61,"--Oh, yes, sir; oh, absolutely."
1980.80-396,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,621.61,622.235,Who are not taxpayers?
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,622.235,623.844,And there are people on juries--
1980.80-396,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,623.844,626.297,"In this day and age, who is not a taxpayer?"
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,626.297,631.155,"--Well, there are people who are not taxpayers on juries, and--"
1980.80-396,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,631.155,632.607,How could they be?
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,632.607,634.123,"--Well, there may be--"
1980.80-396,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,634.123,637.075,Don't you have sales tax in Rhode Island?
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,637.669,639.98,"--Well, but they... they don't go to the municipalities."
1980.80-396,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,645.446,646.571,But they are taxpayers.
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,646.571,666.39,"True, but you see, again, in Rhode Island, we will be drawing juries, any jury in our federal court comes from every city and town in the state, so in a trial against the City of Newport, for instance, the plaintiff would excuse, and properly so, all residents of Newport."
1980.80-396,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,682.354,683.102,I didn't say identical.
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,684.227,685.118,Yes.
1980.80-396,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,685.118,687.68,That's all I said.
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,700.423,701.079,True.
1980.80-396,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,706.89,707.905,No insurance?
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,707.905,711.357,"--You can't buy insurance against punitive damages, Your Honor."
1980.80-396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,722.556,725.633,Is Rhode Island one of them?
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,725.633,732.708,I have never known of a policy issued in Rhode Island that covered punitive damages.
1980.80-396,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,732.708,735.019,Even in auto--
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,735.019,737.081,In automobile cases they're excluded.
1980.80-396,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,737.081,739.189,--You mean that you can buy it for that?
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,739.189,745.28,"Well, under the statutory policy in Rhode Island, that's excluded."
1980.80-396,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,746.984,747.921,"Oh, I see."
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,751.514,752.123,"No, sir."
1980.80-396,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,756.027,759.339,--Which would be uninsurable?
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,759.339,759.745,That's right.
1980.80-396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,874.45,879.744,"Mr. Wells, Judge Pettine did grant a remittitur of the punitive damages, didn't he?"
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,879.744,880.135,"Yes, he did."
1980.80-396,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,957.401,976.892,"Could I ask you, for a moment, what your response is now to the argument that this issue isn't really properly before us in the sense that if there's an argument like this in this Court, how could it possibly have been plain error?"
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,991.918,992.308,"No, Your Honor."
1980.80-396,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,992.308,998.415,We cannot because the respondent is defending the judgment below on that ground.
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,998.415,1004.256,"Your Honor, I understand that and I had intended to address it a little later on, but--"
1980.80-396,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1004.256,1005.803,Excuse me; you take your own time.
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,1005.803,1007.27,"--I should... no, I'll meet the argument now."
1980.80-396,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1026.404,1029.824,"You mean, for relaxing the plain error rule?"
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,1029.824,1031.199,"Well, yes, sir."
1980.80-396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1031.199,1036.493,"Well, Mr. Wells, let me ask you this, if I may, along the lines of Justice White's question."
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,1097.0,1098.483,Quite true.
1980.80-396,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1160.538,1169.705,"Of course, it may be that a good answer to my question is, well, I rely on the grant of certiorari, which is limited to one question."
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,1169.705,1171.377,"--Well, yes, that's correct, Your Honor."
1980.80-396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1197.132,1221.403,"That could be said with respect to plain and flagrant violations of the rules for preserving errors through the... But we know we didn't assert it in the trial court or in the court of appeals and we didn't raise it as a question to be presented on this petition, but it's a question that needs answering sooner or later so let's answer it now."
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,1221.403,1234.616,"Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I think this is a little different because of the volume of cases in which the punitive damages issue is a real issue."
1980.80-396,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1273.022,1299.855,"Well, when you say, we ought to ""relax"" the rule as to noticing plain error, are you saving that we should review the court of appeals' refusal to note plain error, or that in effect the court of appeals did regard this as plain error and, as you say, grappled with it in an entire paragraph rather than just brushing it off and saying, it wasn't raised?"
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,1299.855,1313.319,"I think the court of appeals really believed it was plain error, and that that's why you find that language you referred to as kind of fuzzy language, in what is apparently close to the last paragraph."
1980.80-396,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1313.319,1324.064,"Of course, you could say, you could ask us to waive our own rule against considering questions not raised below but presented here."
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,1324.064,1328.673,"Well, the question was raised below."
1980.80-396,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1328.673,1337.28,May I ask a question about the judgments related to this?
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,1346.932,1348.479,"Yes, there were."
1980.80-396,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1348.479,1351.774,"For how much, and is that a joint and several liability, or a separate judgment?"
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,1351.774,1352.164,"No, no."
1980.80-396,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1378.154,1379.262,You're way over 75 by now.
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,1379.262,1379.699,--Pardon?
1980.80-396,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1379.699,1382.277,You're way over 75 with two over 40 and--
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,1382.277,1384.136,"Well, I don't have the precise numbers in mind."
1980.80-396,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1384.136,1390.664,"--Well, now, were those... if they collected those, that 75 from the individuals, could they get this 75 from the city in addition?"
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,1390.664,1404.159,"Absolutely, and that's the interesting thing about punitive damages, because, for instance, there was a $72,000 compensatory damage award against the councilmen and against the city."
1980.80-396,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1446.891,1456.106,May I ask you if the record tells us whether the city or some insurance company or who will actually pay the punitive damage award against the individuals?
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,1456.106,1462.51,"The record does not disclose that, and I don't know the answer to that."
1980.80-396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1464.431,1473.302,"Mr. Wells, as you've been talking deterrents, you've been arguing no deterrents, am I wrong?"
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,1479.785,1481.473,"Yes, sir, I've seen that phrase."
1980.80-396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1481.473,1485.125,"That's a different element from deterrents, isn't it?"
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,1485.125,1491.81,"Well, I've never been sure what the adjective ""smart"" meant, whether it's ""smarts"" or--"
1980.80-396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1491.81,1494.419,"Well, that's what I understood it to mean."
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,1494.888,1495.279,--Yes.
1980.80-396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1495.279,1501.808,"It smarts, and you did it to punish somebody, if you please, for having done the sort of thing that the jury said--"
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,1501.808,1502.573,"Precisely, but--"
1980.80-396,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1502.573,1506.728,"--Well, it's another form of exemplary, to make an example, is it not?"
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,1506.728,1507.509,--That's true.
1980.80-396,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1573.903,1577.558,Was there any showing here as to the resources of the individual defendants?
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,1577.558,1582.822,"Absolutely none, and there's absolutely none against the municipality."
1980.80-396,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1631.381,1639.22,"Incidentally, I gather the punitive awards against the individual councilmen have not been appealed?"
1980.80-396,0,26292,guy_j_wells,,1639.22,1641.907,"--No, Your Honor, they were not."
1980.80-396,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1695.026,1702.164,Mr. Decof.
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,1702.164,1705.554,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-396,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1766.778,1772.807,How does that relate to this kind of an award in this setting?
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,1772.807,1780.351,With reference... Mr. Wells was making the argument that the innocent taxpayer carries the burden of the punitive damage award.
1980.80-396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1886.433,1888.541,"But by hypothesis, the least damaging?"
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,1888.541,1893.508,"Not necessarily, Your Honor, for this reason."
1980.80-396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1898.413,1903.036,"I thought that was your point, that you can't compensate them in money because you can't show damages?"
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,1903.036,1904.442,--You can't show damages.
1980.80-396,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1943.035,1943.785,What is this?
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,1946.58,1953.266,--This case... and I would like to go into the facts; I know the facts are not before the Court but they--
1980.80-396,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1953.266,1956.124,"Before you get to all the facts, answer my question."
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,1956.124,1962.7,--This case was a case where the City of Newport wanted to dictate what kind of music would be played.
1980.80-396,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1962.7,1966.26,So the question was the right to hear it or the right to play it?
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,1966.26,1968.088,It's the right to perform it.
1980.80-396,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1974.882,1975.943,And that affects a whole lot of people.
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,1975.943,1977.365,"--Yes, it does, Your Honor."
1980.80-396,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1977.365,1979.301,"Yes, it really does."
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,1990.797,1997.842,"With reference to those cases, Your Honor, we get into the question of public nuisance, public safety."
1980.80-396,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2036.389,2037.108,What's a tiger case?
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2037.108,2038.278,"--Please, Your Honor?"
1980.80-396,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2038.278,2039.372,"You mean, a cage?"
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2039.372,2040.668,It was a tiger cage; yes.
1980.80-396,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2064.704,2066.985,What case was that?
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2067.937,2084.416,"--That is cited, if the Court please, in the Joint Appendix at page 41 and in the Record Appendix which was filed before the Circuit Court of Appeals at page 305."
1980.80-396,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2084.416,2086.101,What was the Joint Appendix cite?
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2086.101,2087.945,"Page 41, Your Honor."
1980.80-396,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2095.035,2098.863,Is the Joint Appendix the tan?
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2098.863,2099.597,"Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1980.80-396,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2099.597,2107.14,"Just glancing at it, page 41, I don't see a case citation."
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2107.14,2109.983,It isn't a case citation.
1980.80-396,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2118.198,2118.667,Oh.
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2122.947,2133.598,"--The case never went further than the restraining order so there is no appellate citation of that case, if the Court please."
1980.80-396,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2133.598,2135.191,"Well, if it came here and was heard, I--"
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2135.191,2136.753,"It did not come here, if the Court please."
1980.80-396,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2136.753,2139.127,--I thought you said it was this Court's case?
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2139.127,2139.565,"No, no."
1980.80-396,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2141.002,2142.86,Oh... the district court.
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2142.86,2143.751,--the district; yes.
1980.80-396,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2150.405,2153.935,Was it not pursued in that court beyond a temporary restraining order?
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2153.935,2155.872,"it was not pursued in that court, Your Honor."
1980.80-396,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2155.872,2158.996,"Well, then, how do we know whether the judge was right or not?"
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2158.996,2170.54,"The problem, whether the judge was right or not, if the Court please, the question is a question of knowledge, foreknowledge by this council in going back in again and doing the same thing."
1980.80-396,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2209.382,2211.554,"Now, what they did was deny a permit, was that it?"
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2211.554,2232.95,"--No, Your Honor, what they did was, my clients, Facts Concerts, had a license from the City of Newport to promote a musical concert at Fort Adams, and they had lined up the greatest jazz stars in the country, and one of them, outstanding performer Sarah Vaughn, had to cancel out."
1980.80-396,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2250.57,2252.052,And did they cancel the license?
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2252.052,2258.644,"They did cancel the license, Your Honor, but on the pretext, which the jury found to be a ruse, of some chairs not having been wired together."
1980.80-396,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2260.127,2263.422,Is this the old Newport Jazz Festival of years back or what?
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2263.422,2267.39,--This is... that was... there's a jazz festival in Newport every year.
1980.80-396,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2278.605,2281.946,"The Newport Festival is now in New York City, isn't it?"
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2281.946,2282.353,"--Yes, it is, Your Honor."
1980.80-396,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2282.353,2283.134,It isn't even up there.
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2283.134,2283.789,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.80-396,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2283.789,2285.305,"And it wasn't up there this time either, was it?"
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2285.305,2287.898,"No, this was... it had a different name."
1980.80-396,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2287.898,2289.662,"It was riding on the name, yes."
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2289.662,2291.334,"Yes, it was a jazz festival at Newport."
1980.80-396,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2291.334,2301.876,"Mr. Decof, what do you make of the language in Carey v. Piphus at 256 of 435, where it says that,"
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2317.308,2333.676,"What I say to that is that Carey v. Piphus, Your Honor, was footnoted to the effect that... I think I paraphrase correctly... this is not to say that we indicate that punitive damages would not be properly awarded in the proper case."
1980.80-396,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2380.672,2395.525,"Well, do you take issue with the submission that at the time 1983 was adopted the controlling case law was against punitive damages against municipalities?"
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2395.525,2397.54,"--I take issue with that for this reason, Your Honor."
1980.80-396,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2420.657,2435.822,"That may be, but then your answer to me is, no, you do not take issue with the fact that the law as it was at the time of 1983 did not normally contemplate the... for whatever reason--"
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2435.822,2436.603,"--Yes, yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-396,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2436.603,2446.896,"--Did not contemplate the issuance, or the imposing of punitive damages on municipalities."
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2446.896,2447.286,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-396,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2459.984,2460.718,"So, I guess--"
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2460.718,2465.123,"--a state said, we will assume liability, but we'll put a cap on it; this is the trade-off."
1980.80-396,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2465.123,2474.556,"--In holding that municipalities are subject to 1983, in Monell--"
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2474.556,2475.024,"Yes, Your Honor?"
1980.80-396,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2475.024,2478.711,"--We said, but only if it's municipal policy."
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2478.711,2481.147,"But I think also, Your Honor--"
1980.80-396,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2481.147,2493.283,"And so we did, we apparently, according to your reading of the cases, we construed 1983 not to reflect the common law in that case."
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2493.283,2494.611,--If the Court please--
1980.80-396,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2494.611,2496.626,Because we didn't permit respondeat superior.
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2496.626,2504.669,"--Yes, this is... you took away respondeat superior and you established municipal liability--"
1980.80-396,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2504.669,2506.216,And you say that's why you--
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2506.216,2507.402,"--and to my way of thinking, you narrowed--"
1980.80-396,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2507.402,2508.417,--should have punitive damages?
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2510.384,2511.665,--Not really because of that.
1980.80-396,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2531.236,2535.125,You say that Monell and such narrowed it--
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2535.125,2536.141,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-396,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2536.141,2544.841,"--Abolishing respondeat superior, because it requires now, before a municipality may be liable, proof of policy."
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2544.841,2545.544,"Precisely, Your Honor."
1980.80-396,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2580.373,2586.574,And I gather your argument also is that policy necessarily means proof of intention?
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2586.574,2587.509,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1980.80-396,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2587.509,2589.65,To deny the constitutional or federal statutory--
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2589.65,2595.117,"Exactly, Your Honor; if the taking away of a good faith defense does not mean there will be liability without fault."
1980.80-396,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2626.01,2631.055,"--Well, Mr. Decof, what of the situation in this very case, for example?"
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2657.873,2658.669,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1980.80-396,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2658.669,2661.589,--but a finding of liability on the part of the municipality.
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2663.401,2667.556,If... but they would have had to find that the municipality acted maliciously.
1980.80-396,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2718.723,2723.175,But they are not here.
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2723.175,2724.174,"--But they were the city, Your Honor."
1980.80-396,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2724.174,2725.221,"They are not here, are they?"
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2725.221,2726.376,If Your Honor please--
1980.80-396,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2726.376,2728.235,I thought you said you didn't appeal that?
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2728.235,2729.936,--They did.
1980.80-396,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2729.936,2730.655,They did?
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2730.655,2732.092,"No, no, that's not before this Court."
1980.80-396,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2733.654,2734.951,"The councilmen are not here, are they?"
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2734.951,2738.794,"No, but if Your Honor please, the councilmen were the city, because they acted by unanimous vote."
1980.80-396,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2738.794,2745.308,"About two-thirds of your time you've been quoting councilmen, and they're not here."
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2745.308,2746.98,"Because... that's correct, Your Honor."
1980.80-396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2768.391,2770.516,Were punitive damages awarded against the councilmen also?
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2770.516,2771.781,"Yes, they were, Your Honor."
1980.80-396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2771.781,2774.265,In addition to the punitive damages awarded against the city?
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2774.265,2774.64,"Yes, they were, Your Honor."
1980.80-396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2776.406,2777.638,In cumulative amounts?
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2777.638,2778.826,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-396,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2786.558,2788.105,"Now, $75,000?"
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2788.105,2788.745,"Yes, now, Your Honor."
1980.80-396,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2789.776,2792.602,Have those damages been collected from the individuals?
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2792.602,2793.993,"No, not a penny has been collected, and there's--"
1980.80-396,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2793.993,2795.805,Is it collectible?
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2795.805,2798.539,"--That's another question, Your Honor."
1980.80-396,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2828.635,2829.963,I don't think you've answered my question.
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2829.963,2830.87,I don't know--
1980.80-396,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2830.87,2832.603,Is it collectible?
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2832.603,2834.57,--I don't know if it would be collectible or not.
1980.80-396,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2834.57,2835.914,"You're the attorney, you have a judgment."
1980.80-396,1,34329,leonard_decof,,2836.945,2840.427,"The judgments are on appeal, if the Court please."
1980.80-396,2,26292,guy_j_wells,,3497.446,3499.602,"No, Your Honor."
1980.80-396,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3499.602,3500.133,"Thank you, gentlemen."
