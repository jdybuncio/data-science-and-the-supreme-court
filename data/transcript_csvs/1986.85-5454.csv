1986.85-5454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,53.385,"You may begin whenever you're ready, Mr. Volinsky."
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,53.385,57.187,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-5454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,70.06,75.714,"Let me ask you one question, Mr. Volinsky, just based on your first sentence, if I may."
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,75.714,76.75,--Right out of the box.
1986.85-5454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,76.75,83.404,"You say the Court's holding could be based on a legal error, on a narrow constitutional ground, or on a broad constitutional ground."
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,89.724,94.093,That's in essence what I meant with the legal error.
1986.85-5454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,152.731,162.004,"Well, then if that is your example of legal error, which I believe was one of the things, that itself would be a constitutional ground, wouldn't it?"
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,162.004,165.022,I don't want to argue with the Court about whether it should be legal or constitutional.
1986.85-5454,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,235.968,238.704,Is that the standard Mississippi procedure?
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,238.704,241.439,"I believe it is, although my experience is--"
1986.85-5454,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,241.439,242.474,You're from New Hampshire.
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,242.474,244.658,"--I'm from New Hampshire, Your Honor."
1986.85-5454,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,274.427,281.766,"Well, can't counsel move that the waiting members of the panel be taken out of the courtroom?"
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,281.766,283.718,I believe they can.
1986.85-5454,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,291.605,293.824,No such motion was made here.
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,293.824,295.007,I'm sorry?
1986.85-5454,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,295.007,296.176,No such motion was made here.
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,296.176,296.693,"No, Your Honor."
1986.85-5454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,363.651,365.586,"That's a little ambiguous, ""I'll try""."
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,365.586,366.369,--Well--
1986.85-5454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,366.369,367.621,"It's not quite a yes, is it?"
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,367.621,376.227,"--It's not quite a yes, but I think you'll see later on that she's been listening to this judge say, would you automatically vote against the death penalty regardless of the evidence."
1986.85-5454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,383.931,384.731,That may not be good enough.
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,384.731,385.117,--Excuse me?
1986.85-5454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,385.117,386.283,That may not be good enough.
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,386.283,394.705,"Well, any ambiguity on whether she can do the job or not, whether she's qualified or not, is cleared up later in the record, and I don't think there's a problem with that."
1986.85-5454,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,552.24,556.342,"Well, Mr. Volinsky, I suppose the trial judge messed up the whole thing, didn't he?"
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,558.794,559.66,I certainly--
1986.85-5454,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,559.66,569.935,"What do you think he should have done at the time this long exchange, which we're all familiar with, I might say, with Mrs. Bounds was concluded?"
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,574.804,577.606,--That would have been a certain way out of this quagmire.
1986.85-5454,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,588.163,590.265,"Say it again, that this trial judge believed what?"
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,590.265,595.567,That he had indeed erred previously with respect to the five early jurors.
1986.85-5454,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,629.14,631.156,Were you of counsel below?
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,631.156,636.294,"No, I was not."
1986.85-5454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,755.055,755.74,"Well, that isn't the theory."
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,774.535,782.307,"Number one, I'm not clear that the Mississippi Supreme Court quite spelled it out, but that was my impression, as is yours."
1986.85-5454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,790.895,791.313,Right.
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,791.313,811.743,"The Respondent in this case in their brief at 25 seems to distinguish the instant matter from an unused peremptories issue by saying that they would have, if they could."
1986.85-5454,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,811.743,813.96,"Of course, how do we know that they would have?"
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,813.96,817.897,I think that's the problem with the unused peremptories argument.
1986.85-5454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,847.031,856.821,"You can't be 100 percent certain, but there can be no doctrine of harmless error, Mr. Volinsky, if you require 100 percent certainty."
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,864.942,865.676,I agree.
1986.85-5454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,865.676,878.436,"All you're saying here is that you can't say for sure that the prosecution would have challenged this juror had the prosecution had one more left, but gee, doesn't it seem very, very likely indeed."
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,905.919,913.323,I think the nature of her responses changed dramatically from the very front to the very end.
1986.85-5454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,913.323,922.548,"Why was the prosecutor asking to have some of his peremptories back, then, if he didn't intend to use them?"
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,930.752,935.537,"Well, I'm not 100 percent sure that he would have used them there, and you've said that 100 percent sure--"
1986.85-5454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,935.537,939.089,"He would have had one mad trial judge on his hands if he didn't, wouldn't he?"
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,939.089,940.358,"--You bet, you bet."
1986.85-5454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,942.174,946.844,"What are you assuming, that he gets one peremptory back or all five, when you're in this debate?"
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,946.844,948.546,--I don't know how we tell.
1986.85-5454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,970.627,1000.229,"Mr. Volinsky, if we had a case where all the other eleven jurors had been selected at the time a Mrs. Bounds was examined and the state still had ten peremptory challenges left and the trial judge is convinced from the testimony of the prosecutor that indeed the prosecutor would have used one of them on Mrs. Bounds, could we have a harmless error inquiry?"
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,1000.229,1014.72,"I think in that circumstance, Your Honor, you have to look at Judge Goldberg's concurrence, where he talks about not only the impact of the erroneous ruling as to juror X, but the impact of the erroneous ruling as to the rest of the panel."
1986.85-5454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1019.691,1029.665,"Well, on the facts that I pose, in your view could we have a harmless error inquiry perhaps?"
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,1029.665,1032.617,--I think there's a problem with it.
1986.85-5454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1065.254,1075.794,"I must confess, I really don't understand this part of the argument, because no matter whether the trial judge was right or wrong, the state did elect to use its peremptories."
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,1096.024,1096.391,Right.
1986.85-5454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1096.391,1101.845,So I don't understand how there's even an arguable basis for saying the prosecutor wouldn't have used his peremptories.
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,1103.964,1105.13,I think he would have used them.
1986.85-5454,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1105.747,1107.165,"Well, he did use them and that's--"
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,1107.165,1112.319,"--Yes, I agree, I agree."
1986.85-5454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1330.659,1333.528,--What more could he have done?
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,1333.528,1342.816,"This is distinguishable from the Strickland scenario, where the prosecutor can't prevent the error because he doesn't control what the defense lawyer does."
1986.85-5454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1366.915,1384.126,"Well, but it wasn't realistically... it wasn't realistically within his power to do anything otherwise unless, and not have this juror seated, unless he were given back one of the peremptories that had been taken away earlier."
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,1384.126,1387.262,That presumes that he has a right not to have this juror seated.
1986.85-5454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1387.262,1387.795,That's right.
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,1387.795,1394.601,He didn't have that right under these circumstances.
1986.85-5454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1402.272,1403.624,"Thank you, Mr. Volinsky."
1986.85-5454,0,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,1403.624,1404.557,Thank you.
1986.85-5454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1404.557,1409.028,"We'll hear now from you, Mr. White."
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1409.028,1411.98,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1986.85-5454,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1434.976,1439.213,"Of course, the trial court never made a finding to that effect, did he?"
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1439.213,1446.367,"--I think the trial court said that, in the paragraph where the trial court is talking about that, he said: I have cheated the state out of this."
1986.85-5454,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1486.092,1494.514,Then I'll ask you what I asked your opposing counsel: What should the trial judge have done in order to clean up this mess that he created?
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1494.514,1500.668,"I think he probably should have used the word ""peremptory"" instead of ""cause"" there, and I think that's probably what he meant to say."
1986.85-5454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1518.729,1521.165,"Well now, it's not just inadvertent, because he says later:"
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1531.073,1532.306,"He says, I'm not going to give you five more."
1986.85-5454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1532.306,1535.608,"It would have been smarter, perhaps, to give the prosecutor another peremptory, but he didn't."
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1539.227,1554.588,"And I think he was backing off and excusing her because she was indecisive in her answers and he was not satisfied that she was in fact rehabilitated and everything else, and was saying there that he was going to excuse for cause."
1986.85-5454,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1579.47,1584.357,"Mr. White, let me ask you, too, about Mississippi procedures."
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1590.011,1590.561,Pretty much typical.
1986.85-5454,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1608.223,1611.775,"Is that similar to Alabama and Louisiana, Tennessee?"
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1611.775,1613.46,I'm not familiar with their practice--
1986.85-5454,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1613.46,1616.495,"It seems very strange to me, an unusual kind of a way."
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1616.495,1619.614,"--It's called the Stennis method of jury selection, and it's name after Senator Stennis."
1986.85-5454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1771.893,1775.928,"General White, I was just reading over again the colloquy."
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1796.924,1800.193,"Well, I don't know."
1986.85-5454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1801.728,1810.5,"See, it's conceivable that they might have been very happy to get off the jury because of this, and they may have perhaps just emphasized, given more emphatic answers or something."
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1812.316,1813.116,--And I don't either.
1986.85-5454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1845.721,1859.045,"Doesn't it have to be part of your case that he says at least as with respect to one, because he says at least one person that I'm positive of, that that's pretty much the equivalent of saying I think that prospective juror was lying?"
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1859.045,1860.814,--I think he probably does.
1986.85-5454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1874.372,1883.68,Would that gut feeling be adequate to justify excusing him for cause without finding that he was not telling the truth?
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1883.68,1889.417,I think that would be adequate reason if someone... if the judge feels like he's lying in the voir dire.
1986.85-5454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1892.952,1898.004,You wouldn't remove him; you'd leave him on.
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1902.507,1905.259,I think the judge could remove him on his own motion.
1986.85-5454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1918.667,1920.353,To remove him as a perjurer?
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1920.353,1923.138,"Right, or for whatever cause."
1986.85-5454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1931.911,1932.611,But that's not what he did.
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1933.779,1934.129,--Yes.
1986.85-5454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1934.129,1939.398,He left them on because they were lying.
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1939.398,1939.749,Yes.
1986.85-5454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1939.749,1943.051,"He said, these people who say that they can't vote against capital punishment, they're lying."
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1943.051,1943.834,"Yes, I see."
1986.85-5454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1945.936,1948.622,"Did the state, with respect... and we don't know which juror this is."
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1962.196,1963.715,"Well, are we talking about Juror Bounds now?"
1986.85-5454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1963.715,1964.365,"No, no, no."
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1965.948,1968.267,"Not that I recall on the record, I don't think."
1986.85-5454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1969.702,1980.843,--So that the notion that the judge was too tough on the state and perhaps should have granted the motions for cause really arises during the colloquy about Mrs. Bounds for the first time?
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1980.843,1988.413,"--Well, I think he took exception to that in the very... with the Juror Ruiz, and he says--"
1986.85-5454,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1988.413,1990.615,"What page are you on, Mr. White?"
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,1990.615,1994.001,--It's on the first.
1986.85-5454,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2029.907,2034.728,"The top of page 4, possibly?"
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2034.728,2035.078,--Yes.
1986.85-5454,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2113.477,2143.414,"Mr. White, if the state had no peremptory challenges left and there was no question that earlier jurors had been properly excused... assume that it's not the facts that you are alleging here... and the state had no peremptories left at the time that Mrs. Bounds or someone like her is erroneously excused for cause, would you still urge a harmless error inquiry?"
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2143.414,2158.256,"If there had been no request for an additional peremptory... I mean, that's within the discretion of the trial judge, there, too... I don't think we would be here, if we hadn't requested an extra peremptory, which he could have given to the other side."
1986.85-5454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2158.256,2173.183,"But if we were to agree with you, what is to protect us from an assertion every time that there is a Davis versus Georgia error on the part of the trial court?"
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2173.183,2174.066,Davis versus Georgia--
1986.85-5454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2174.066,2193.846,"What is to protect us from the prosecution coming in and saying: Well, yes, this juror shouldn't have been discharged, but nonetheless, but nonetheless the trial court made these five errors earlier in not allowing peremptories, and therefore we want you to review the disallowance of all of the peremptories?"
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2196.048,2201.766,"--Well, as most harmless error cases must be, they must be looked at on a case by case basis."
1986.85-5454,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2211.891,2223.199,"--Well, at least here you've got a finding by the State Supreme Court that there was an error in dismissing those earlier jurors."
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2223.199,2223.832,"--That's true, we have."
1986.85-5454,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2224.749,2232.071,"And also, that a subsequent juror was entitled to sit, except for."
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2236.773,2242.26,"--Well, they did say in there that they could show no prejudice, the defendant could show no prejudice."
1986.85-5454,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2251.383,2259.972,"Well, normally wouldn't we remand to a state court to find harmless error if it hadn't found it?"
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2259.972,2265.257,"That's what's been done, I think, in Rose v. Clark and Delaware versus Van Arsdale."
1986.85-5454,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2267.459,2277.315,"Mr. Attorney General, about how much time would it be if the judge at that point had said, okay, there's nothing else I can do, I'll throw the whole jury out?"
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2279.684,2296.943,"--It would have probably in this particular case, since this is one of the populous counties and they do have a term of court starting every other month, it could have been probably within a month, because in a capital case a special venire is drawn and it takes a couple of weeks to compile and draw and serve a special venire."
1986.85-5454,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2296.943,2298.478,It would take about a month?
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2298.478,2302.947,"A month or two, if that's the situation there."
1986.85-5454,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2302.947,2305.882,"Mr. White, let me follow up on Justice Scalia's question."
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2316.023,2318.392,"Well, I don't know that we've ever had a case--"
1986.85-5454,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2318.392,2319.292,You have no cases on that?
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2319.292,2320.109,--on that.
1986.85-5454,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2338.286,2339.888,One last question.
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2341.84,2342.59,"--No, it is not."
1986.85-5454,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2348.744,2350.294,Not a small rural county?
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2350.294,2350.863,"--No, it is not."
1986.85-5454,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2352.58,2358.267,Did you say there are actual cases where the trial judge has given more peremptories?
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2358.267,2358.95,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-5454,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2358.95,2361.569,To both sides or just to the prosecution?
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2361.569,2363.652,"Well, it's usually been both, to both sides."
1986.85-5454,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2388.664,2390.699,Feeling good that day.
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2390.699,2391.416,"--Yes, feeling good."
1986.85-5454,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2396.77,2401.138,Was there a request for another peremptory here?
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2401.138,2401.622,In this case?
1986.85-5454,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2401.622,2402.388,Yes.
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2402.388,2409.161,"No, he said we're not asking for an extra one, we're just asking you to give us back the one that you erroneously made us use."
1986.85-5454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2413.03,2414.363,Can I ask you.
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2461.742,2466.212,"Well, that is one way to look at it, I think, that it could have been that."
1986.85-5454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2496.148,2508.706,"Well, but isn't the answer that the Supreme Court's opinion later makes it clear that the Supreme Court, does not, does not think that there was a finding of fact that these jurors were lying?"
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2526.417,2526.917,"Sure, and I think that's what it is."
1986.85-5454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2539.225,2541.527,"Well, that's certainly how I understood it."
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2541.527,2541.81,Yes.
1986.85-5454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2608.399,2631.264,"Mr. White, how clear is it that, assuming the mistakes hadn't been made and assuming they were mistakes concerning the earlier refusals to dismiss for cause... assuming those mistakes had not been made, how do we know that the peremptory challenges that the state would thereby have had in its pocket wouldn't have been used up by the time this juror came around?"
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2631.264,2639.02,"Well, as I said, in the method of choosing jurors, the jurors are numbered and they are put in there numerically."
1986.85-5454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2658.665,2661.783,"If that's in answer to my question, I don't understand it."
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2667.771,2668.956,Okay.
1986.85-5454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2668.956,2682.347,"--initially and had not required the state to use its peremptory challenges, right, how do we know what those peremptory challenges wouldn't have been used up on some other juror before this juror, before Mrs. Couch?"
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2683.114,2684.716,Because of... Mrs. Bounds.
1986.85-5454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2689.62,2689.936,Right.
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2689.936,2692.42,--and Mrs. Bounds are the same ones that are sitting there.
1986.85-5454,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2701.677,2705.812,"Yes, but he might have used the peremptories if he had had them at hand."
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2705.812,2714.568,But we have... he did use some peremptories in the meantime and strike other jurors in between those five and Mrs. Bounds.
1986.85-5454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2714.568,2717.453,When was the last one before Mrs. Bounds?
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2717.453,2719.103,I'm not just sure.
1986.85-5454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2719.103,2728.661,"What I'm saying is that if there were, you know, five people that came in before Mrs. Bounds, if he had had another three peremptories he might have used up those three."
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2728.661,2729.578,"Well, that's true."
1986.85-5454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2741.635,2742.385,Of course they weren't.
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2743.018,2745.353,"Yes, but I mean he didn't ask for any, either."
1986.85-5454,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2751.574,2755.043,"Well, maybe his concern was less with them than with Mrs. Bounds."
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2758.145,2759.53,He very well may have.
1986.85-5454,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2759.53,2761.513,So it's all speculation that we're dealing with.
1986.85-5454,1,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,2761.513,2765.798,"Well, I think that it's reasoned speculation, though."
1986.85-5454,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2798.786,2799.619,"Thank you, Mr. White."

1986.85-5454,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2864.913,2865.763,He says:
1986.85-5454,2,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,2871.734,2878.971,"It's correct the erroneous ruling if you misunderstand Witt, and I think that's what happened with the Mississippi Supreme Court."
1986.85-5454,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2888.779,2898.985,"""Notions of judicial economy make it clear that the trial court should be allowed to recognize and correct its error early in the proceedings. """
1986.85-5454,2,17164,andru_h_volinsky,,2906.74,2912.394,--I guess my concern is that this record doesn't support your interpretation.
