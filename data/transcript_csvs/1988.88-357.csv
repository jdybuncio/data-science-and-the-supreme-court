1988.88-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.206,"We'll hear argument next in No. 88-357, Norm Maleng v. Mark Edwin Cook."
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,13.991,17.61,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.88-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,72.946,88.908,"I take it that... may we consider this case just as though he was actually serving a state... what if the state is the one that had him in jail, that has him in jail now?"
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,90.508,91.391,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1988.88-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,97.062,102.482,"Yes, but suppose he was now serving the '78 sentence, state sentence?"
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,104.251,105.918,"Yes, Your Honor, we would."
1988.88-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,113.439,115.939,"Well, I didn't think it would have any bearing."
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,123.295,127.747,"The thing I'd like to do, Your Honor, is posture this so that we're focusing on the distinction."
1988.88-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,127.747,130.532,The latest state sentence is '78?
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,130.532,131.334,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.88-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,131.334,137.988,"And that's the one that was enhanced by the '58 sentence, is that right?"
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,137.988,140.44,"Well, we'd like to reserve using the word ""enhancement"", Your Honor, and get to that."
1988.88-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,140.44,140.79,Okay.
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,140.79,150.996,"But the beginning point, of course, was in 1958, where Mr. Cook was convicted of three counts of robbery and sentenced to three terms of not more than 20 years."
1988.88-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,211.636,219.54,Was that sentence enhanced by reason of the '58?
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,219.54,228.646,"Your Honor, there was no grid or anything at that point which we would say that the court looked in determining what length of time there would be."
1988.88-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,242.905,243.355,I know.
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,250.844,251.661,"Yes, Your Honor, we would be."
1988.88-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,253.129,255.998,"General Eikenberry, there's something that gives me pause here."
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,271.175,272.808,"That's absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1988.88-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,286.034,291.252,"Well, what of our cases would you say supported that proposition?"
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,291.252,293.721,"I would suggest, Your Honor, the custody cases such as--"
1988.88-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,293.721,294.29,Such as?
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,307.698,339.383,"--Well, I would suggest the Carafas case, the Jones and the Hensley cases all suggest that the kind of detainer restraint based on the '78 sentence that has been placed against Mr. Cook would be equivalents, Hensley being an individual out on bond during appeal, Jones being a person who had been paroled, and then Carafas being a person who had filed, of course, while he was in custody serving a term."
1988.88-357,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,339.383,341.919,How long remains on the federal sentence?
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,341.919,342.585,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1988.88-357,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,342.585,345.471,How long remains on the federal sentence?
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,345.471,346.906,I cannot say.
1988.88-357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,362.349,370.688,Was the federal sentence expressly enhanced by virtue of the '58 conviction?
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,370.688,393.202,"We do not know, Your Honor, but the point of the question I think is extremely important because we are seeing the prospect here that we must imagine that that court also was aware that a '58 conviction had occurred and would have had it in mind, taken it into account as the court settled on the 25-year term."
1988.88-357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,414.05,418.002,"Well, he certainly is in custody under the federal sentence."
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,418.002,420.371,"Physical custody, yes, Your Honor."
1988.88-357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,420.371,428.977,So presumably he can raise whatever he wants to with regard to the basis for that sentence.
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,428.977,436.547,He can raise the... he is in custody for the physical custody that he's in under the federal case.
1988.88-357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,439.683,444.087,Is that part of what his amended pleadings now challenge and raise?
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,444.087,444.953,"--No, Your Honor."
1988.88-357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,466.9,477.124,"Well, I thought there was a specific notice of amendment of the original petition that has filed in the District Court in Washington."
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,477.124,479.326,"Just last week, Your Honor, yes."
1988.88-357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,479.326,481.526,"Not a letter, a notice of an amendment?"
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,481.526,482.028,"I'm sorry, yes."
1988.88-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,500.188,506.341,"General Eikenberry, can I ask you just a question going to sort of what I understand to be your basic position?"
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,529.023,535.611,"There would be jurisdiction to consider the sentence under which he is in immediate restraint, Your Honor."
1988.88-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,535.611,539.129,"Well, he's immediately under on a capital sentence."
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,539.129,540.163,Exactly.
1988.88-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,627.203,632.072,"If I understand you correctly, your answer to my question is yes, that you could look at the old conviction."
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,632.072,632.824,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1988.88-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,632.824,635.776,And why is this different?
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,637.392,639.408,What I'm saying is--
1988.88-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,639.408,643.193,It wasn't very clear.
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,643.193,646.728,"--What I'm suggesting, Your Honor, is the court would use a very narrow scope of review."
1988.88-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,646.728,648.347,"Well, but that may be a narrow scope of review."
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,659.803,660.337,Yes.
1988.88-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,672.795,677.949,"Well, now what if the '78 conviction were a habitual offender."
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,702.831,708.218,"Yes, because there is a critical difference in the kind of proceeding the Court's just described."
1988.88-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,721.71,722.062,Okay.
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,738.905,751.145,"No, Your Honor, he did not say that, and we cannot, I don't think we can know at this point exactly what role, if any role, it had in determining that Mr. Cook should be sentenced to two life terms."
1988.88-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,771.243,786.068,"The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit thought that the '78 sentence was enhanced by the '58, didn't it?"
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,787.92,789.42,"Yes, Your Honor, that's correct."
1988.88-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,789.42,816.005,And you say that whatever enhancement there was was permissible and if there was an enhancement it was permissible and that since the '58... and it doesn't make any difference whether the '58 conviction was valid or not because it's expired and you just can't be in custody under that.
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,816.005,816.94,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1988.88-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,816.94,818.457,Don't let anybody put words in your mouth.
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,818.457,825.629,"Your Honor, we are saying he's not in custody on a 1958 conviction, but we may review the '78 conviction--"
1988.88-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,825.629,832.283,"Even if, as CA 9 held, there was enhancement by reason of the '58 conviction?"
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,832.283,834.318,"--Yes, Your Honor, that's true."
1988.88-357,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,849.761,859.784,And would you have the same qualification for review in the case that the Chief Justice put to you where there's a habitual offender statute?
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,859.784,861.553,"--The review would be broader, Your Honor."
1988.88-357,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,861.553,861.953,Why?
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,861.953,873.276,"Because there we're looking at the conviction and the basis for it, and just as an entire larceny trial would be, conviction would be subject to review."
1988.88-357,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,876.145,883.882,So under a habitual offender statute a previous offense can be tested on habeas?
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,883.882,884.418,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.88-357,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,884.418,887.703,For invalidity in any respect?
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,887.703,889.17,"For this reason, Your Honor."
1988.88-357,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,899.928,903.046,"Well, then suppose all of those convictions are valid on their face."
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,914.937,919.489,"Yes, Your Honor, because they are elements of the new conviction that the court has just reached in sentencing."
1988.88-357,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,919.489,921.957,"Well, what's the federal violation?"
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,928.863,931.363,I'm not understanding the Court's last question.
1988.88-357,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,931.363,937.35,"The hypothetical is the habitual offender statute, previous convictions."
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,960.38,973.123,"I'm assuming the prisoner would be pleading that some constitutional defect had occurred in the process, in the trial process, that resulted in his habitual criminal conviction."
1988.88-357,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,973.123,980.359,"And if he raises any federal constitutional issue at all, he can have habeas to test those earlier convictions?"
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,980.359,984.228,"Yes, Your Honor, providing he's exhausted his remedies in state court."
1988.88-357,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,984.228,985.397,"Yes, assuming that."
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,985.397,986.663,Yes.
1988.88-357,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,986.663,993.369,"Well, I'm not so sure why that doesn't foreclose your argument here, then."
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,993.369,1010.129,"Let me, if I may, Your Honor, go to the sentencing standards that this Court has established in three cases because I think that might bring us to the question that's been raised here."
1988.88-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1085.629,1092.383,"Mr. Eikenberry, if you are answering Judge Kennedy's question, go ahead and then I have a question for you."
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1092.383,1124.171,"Well, what I'm attempting... the reason for reading that quotation was simply to indicate the general rule and indicate that there is... that a sentencing court has a looser set of restrictions, If you will, on what factors may be considered in arriving at a sentence, but, conversely, when this Court is reviewing that process we must recognize that that court had a wide discretion and therefore the only thing we would look at at the '58 conviction, with an expired sentence, is is it valid on its face."
1988.88-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1124.171,1143.834,"General Eikenberry, the Court of Appeals said, on page A3 of the appendix, its opinion that the respondent's conviction was lengthened by two and one-half years because of his prior convictions."
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1151.988,1154.207,"A couple of important things, Your Honor."
1988.88-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1180.007,1192.915,"And it was specifically taken into account in some way by the judge who sentenced in 1978, so that the '78 sentence was longer by reason of the '58 conviction?"
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1192.915,1194.434,"We cannot know that, Your Honor."
1988.88-357,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1194.434,1196.767,"Well, we are judging the case that way, aren't we?"
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1199.719,1200.921,We'll accept that.
1988.88-357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1219.048,1231.79,"Well, General Eikenberry, if I understand it correctly, we don't yet know how long this defendant will have to serve in the 1978 conviction in state court; is that right?"
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1231.79,1232.892,"Absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1988.88-357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1232.892,1245.033,"Because under Washington law a board, a state board, will make that determination at such time as he finally is turned over to state authorities, is that correct?"
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1245.033,1246.066,"That's absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1988.88-357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1246.066,1259.642,"And under the new Washington law that would be applied they apply a grid which includes giving factors or points for prior convictions, including the '58 conviction; is that correct?"
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1259.642,1260.425,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1988.88-357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1260.425,1271.183,And you concede that if the board were to apply that grid as it is designed it would lengthen the sentence he otherwise would serve on the '78 conviction?
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1271.183,1272.3,"That, too, is correct, Your Honor."
1988.88-357,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1272.3,1274.135,Okay.
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1274.135,1290.662,"With one addition, if I may, and that is that that will then establish the median from which the board may deviate in any direction they wish, according to what they see as mitigating or aggravating circumstances completely different from--"
1988.88-357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1290.662,1290.879,Right.
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1300.001,1301.452,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1988.88-357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1301.452,1303.968,So we can assume that this is going to have an effect on his sentence?
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1303.968,1308.939,"For the purpose of this Court's decision, absolutely, yes, Your Honor."
1988.88-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1308.939,1310.891,May I then ask you another question?
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1342.327,1352.218,"If, as the Court said, we know that he has an unconstitutional conviction, then certainly in that narrow scope of review--"
1988.88-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1352.218,1357.186,And then would a federal court have Jurisdiction to correct that constitutional error five years in the future?
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1357.186,1361.157,"--This Court would certainly grant relief and the Court, the District Court would certainly grant relief."
1988.88-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1361.157,1362.674,"Well, what are you arguing here?"
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1362.674,1374.148,What I'm arguing is that we don't have habeas corpus custody jurisdiction that will grant the broad kind of relief to 1958 in the same way that we do for the '78.
1988.88-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1374.148,1379.95,Are you just arguing scope of review rather than jurisdiction?
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1379.95,1380.302,No.
1988.88-357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1381.202,1382.452,You're saying we don't know it here.
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1394.526,1395.061,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1988.88-357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1395.061,1399.279,"But if we don't know it, a federal court cannot inquire into it?"
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1399.279,1400.629,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1988.88-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1406.869,1407.452,That's always true.
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1422.36,1423.295,"Let's put it this way, Your Honor."
1988.88-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1444.041,1444.791,That isn't the language of the statute.
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1451.979,1455.349,"--The previous language, Your Honors, is ""in custody pursuant to""."
1988.88-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1455.349,1457.783,"Well, he is in custody pursuant to the Judgment of a state court."
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1461.087,1463.437,"But not for the '58 conviction, Your Honor."
1988.88-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1463.437,1463.92,No.
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1484.433,1491.022,"And the sequence of steps, Your Honor, is that he has been... he is in custody pursuant to the 1978 sentence."
1988.88-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1491.022,1491.956,Correct.
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1491.956,1502.128,"And any review of the 1958 conviction, which has an expired sentence, may only be to look to see if it's invalid on its face."
1988.88-357,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1502.128,1504.164,If he's in custody in violation of the Constitution.
1988.88-357,0,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,1526.279,1538.253,"And the point I've been attempting to make, Your Honor, is that there are different standards of review depending on whether we're challenging a conviction or whether we're challenging a sentence."
1988.88-357,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1545.574,1548.026,"Very well, General Eikenberry."
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,1558.132,1562.619,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.88-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1585.068,1592.488,"Is that strictly accurate, to say that he is presently in prison by virtue of the state sentence as well as the federal sentence?"
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,1592.488,1602.511,"Mr. Chief Justice, I believe it is correct under a combination of both Peyton versus Rowe and Braden versus the Thirtieth Judicial District cases."
1988.88-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1622.341,1634.03,"He may be in custody under our cases pursuant to the Washington, but I think you said he was in prison presently pursuant to the Washington conviction."
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,1636.665,1639.017,"Well, he is in... that's right."
1988.88-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1640.469,1641.319,For the federal sentence.
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,1641.319,1642.269,--On the aggregate.
1988.88-357,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1723.54,1740.584,"And then I take it the same would be true if a judge in sentencing, without reference to any specific enhancement provisions in a statute, simply said I have looked at your record and I take into account the fact that you've been convicted two or three previous times and I'm going to take that into account."
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,1740.584,1747.672,"That's not this case, because in this case state statutes require that a particular amount of time be added to his prison term."
1988.88-357,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1747.672,1749.524,But under your argument wouldn't the same follow?
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,1749.524,1752.726,"It would probably follow and, frankly, I think that's the Tucker case."
1988.88-357,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1755.694,1760.296,"Well, but in Tucker the conviction was invalid on its face."
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,1760.296,1784.327,"--Well, I believe, Justice Kennedy, that in Tucker what had happened is Mr. Tucker had gotten another court, a California court, to rule his Louisiana and Florida prior convictions unconstitutional and refused to use them for enhancement of a California conviction, and in Tucker there's a footnote where the Court said that there is still an issue regarding the third conviction."
1988.88-357,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1793.6,1804.473,But it's certainly not a holding that a federal habeas action lies in order to inquire into the validity of any conviction that the court might have made reference to in sentencing.
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,1804.473,1813.161,"It is not a holding of Tucker, because Tucker, although Tucker is a 2255 case, Tucker does not hold that."
1988.88-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1837.796,1843.883,"Mr. Midgley, your client is not being punished for the 1958 act."
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,1860.661,1870.683,"I wouldn't argue that in an double jeopardy sense he's being repunished for the '58 crime, but he is in... he will be in state prison pursuant to the '78 Judgment."
1988.88-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1870.683,1871.117,That's right.
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,1871.117,1873.219,And the '58 lengthens the term.
1988.88-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1873.219,1892.53,"And in deciding how much he should be punished for the '78 crime the states take account of all sorts of things, not just prior crimes, but maybe the degree of remorse he has shown, which may be evidenced by various things, and they are really... how dangerous he will be if let out."
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,1942.196,1944.748,"Justice Scalia, there are a number of answers to your question."
1988.88-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1973.0,1976.119,Why does my question assume that he knew that he had something to challenge?
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,1976.119,1979.404,It assumes that there would have been an attack earlier.
1988.88-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1979.404,1979.921,"No, it doesn't."
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,1995.164,1996.7,The states... yes.
1988.88-357,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2013.809,2017.177,But of course that isn't the question in this case.
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2030.752,2040.024,"Well, that's not the issue in this case, because the issue in this case is that the state statutes require that a particular amount of time be added under those."
1988.88-357,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2049.232,2052.35,But what's the constitutional difference between the two?
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2052.35,2055.886,--The constitutional difference between the two is two.
1988.88-357,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2076.382,2077.349,We're back where we started.
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2081.001,2081.703,"No, that's not my premise."
1988.88-357,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2081.703,2082.969,That's the whole question.
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2082.969,2085.321,"That's not my premise, that it's invalid on its face."
1988.88-357,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2086.554,2089.206,Except that that's what happened in Tucker.
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2089.206,2096.713,"--Well, the convictions were not invalid on their face in Tucker at the time sentence was imposed."
1988.88-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2146.646,2152.264,"Well, we didn't certiorarily take this case to pass on some peculiarity of Washington law."
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2152.264,2154.05,--I understand that.
1988.88-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2176.765,2196.21,"So supposing that we get to the parole board situation after your client has served his federal sentence and suppose the parole statute simply says that the parole board may take into consideration, among a number of other factors, previous convictions."
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2202.113,2204.982,"I would... first of all, that isn't the case that's before us."
1988.88-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2204.982,2209.386,But we need to probe a little bit to find out what you're getting and what we're getting at.
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2209.386,2222.794,"I think that Tucker says that any consideration... that Tucker implies, if you will, that any consideration of invalid priors is... would give grounds for collateral relief."
1988.88-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2234.685,2244.457,"So that if the claim as to the '58 conviction were that his Miranda rights were violated, that could be litigated in this case now."
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2244.457,2283.016,"I think that that is... the state has brought this up on a custody question and I think that is a substantive constitutional question which is not before the Court because whether a particular kind of claim can be brought is not a custody issue; it is a question of substantive constitutional law about whether, for example, an uncounseled conviction... I think Tucker and Burgett talk specifically about uncounseled convictions, and I think that the state essentially is asking this Court to decide in advance a whole array of substantive constitutional questions about which kinds of convictions."
1988.88-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2291.355,2297.675,"--Well, do you say that you can attack a prior under these circumstances when there was simply a violation of the Miranda rule?"
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2297.675,2320.688,"I think that, to address the issue that's before the Court in this case, I think there would be custody to make that claim, and it would then be a substantive constitutional question whether a Miranda violation, using a conviction which was allegedly invalid under a Miranda violation, is itself a constitutional violation."
1988.88-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2320.688,2321.088,Yes.
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2324.492,2325.642,I understand that.
1988.88-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2325.642,2326.908,So what's your answer?
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2326.908,2333.181,My answer is I think that that could be determined in habeas proceedings.
1988.88-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2333.181,2336.466,So that would be something that could be litigated in a habeas proceeding?
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2336.466,2337.283,"Yes, it could be."
1988.88-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2338.466,2346.589,"Well, the Chief Justice read a sentence out of the Court of Appeals opinion about two and a half years."
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2346.589,2348.191,Yes.
1988.88-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2348.191,2350.208,Is that statement correct?
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2355.862,2365.569,"Yes, it has been enhanced in the sense that there has been a finding by the trial court that he was armed with both what's called under Washington law a deadly weapon and a firearm."
1988.88-357,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2377.627,2380.745,So that statement is correct by the Court of Appeals?
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2380.745,2386.733,The statement is correct that it is available for use when the board actually sets the term.
1988.88-357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2386.733,2388.866,"Well, it says it was lengthened."
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2394.62,2401.908,"It's not correct that it was lengthened, but it is very certain, because of the provisions of state law, that it will be."
1988.88-357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2415.383,2421.054,"Well, I think General Eikenberry conceded that it will have some effect ultimately today."
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2437.832,2438.949,"Justice O'Connor, there is--"
1988.88-357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2438.949,2441.617,"This was 27 years ago, for goodness sakes."
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2441.617,2445.437,"--Yes, and there are proof problems in there, but there are proof problems on both sides."
1988.88-357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2454.377,2462.381,"So laches might properly, in some cases, be raised by the state and say, look, we've been harmed by this."
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2463.983,2465.066,"Yes, I think that's correct."
1988.88-357,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2476.057,2486.229,"Because at least this defendant presumably could have made this very claim long before now, when the '58 conviction was still alive and kicking."
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2486.229,2497.954,"Well, I would suggest that on this record we don't know that and that that's one thing that the district court needs to inquire into, is he had been incarcerated in mental hospitals."
1988.88-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2514.516,2518.634,I really don't see how that fits with your theory of laches.
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2554.057,2561.211,"Well, I didn't mean to say that laches would necessarily keep the challenge out in every case."
1988.88-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2570.853,2574.388,"If your theory is correct, I don't see how laches applies in any case."
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2584.243,2588.897,"Well, to say that it's laches is perhaps not the right use of the term."
1988.88-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2616.648,2618.166,"Mr. Midgley, let me ask you this."
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2645.084,2645.851,A judge in sentencing--
1988.88-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2645.851,2650.888,And that would have been okay and had the enhancement been based on that you could keep him in jail.
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2665.647,2675.586,"--Well, the problem is that the parole board is not now free to add that time on that grid based on mere arrest."
1988.88-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2683.026,2684.242,"Well, I'm not concerned about Washington."
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2708.057,2717.097,"--The answer is yes, that the judge could consider that in sentencing, but it has no effect on the parole board because the judge has only set that maximum sentence."
1988.88-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2730.59,2734.075,But don't you start with the sentence that's been imposed?
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2734.075,2735.492,"No, you do not."
1988.88-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2735.492,2736.327,You don't start with the sentence imposed?
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2736.327,2746.349,"The board can't go over the maximum on this grid, but the board now must start with the two-factor grid... the seriousness of the crime and prior record."
1988.88-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2764.811,2778.071,"Well, I think that shows that the discrepancy does not exist under this state sentencing scheme, but still as a theoretical matter it seems to me you are proposing something that looks very strange in another context."
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2797.632,2801.85,I think there is certainly a question about how they come to that evidence.
1988.88-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2804.119,2804.402,Sure.
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2804.402,2806.237,And about what the quality of that evidence is.
1988.88-357,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2886.272,2896.378,"Are you saying that it's open to the state, then, on remand to argue that habeas doesn't lie to cure... to inquire into this particular defect?"
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2896.378,2900.58,"--I think that that's a question, a legitimate question, in any habeas corpus cases."
1988.88-357,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2907.417,2911.436,"Well, there's a constitutional requirement for a competency hearing, isn't there?"
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2911.436,2912.821,"--Yes, there is."
1988.88-357,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2942.687,2951.493,"And you say that for years the circuits have been, and the district courts have been holding habeas hearings on these kinds of questions?"
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2951.493,2971.49,"They have, and we've cited cases in our brief and both of the amicus briefs have cited circuit cases from as far back, I believe, as the '60s, following, but at least from the early '70s following this Court's lead in Burgett and Tucker, and looking at priors which do make these kinds of enhancements."
1988.88-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2971.49,2974.175,"Of course, both Burgett and Tucker were uncounselled."
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2974.175,2975.794,"Yes, that's correct."
1988.88-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2975.794,2977.644,This Court has never gone beyond that.
1988.88-357,1,31915,john_b_midgley,,2977.644,2979.246,This Court has not gone beyond that.
1988.88-357,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3052.392,3053.744,"Thank you, Mr. Midgley."
1988.88-357,2,33815,kenneth_o_eikenberry,,3058.614,3059.181,Yes.
1988.88-357,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3147.437,3148.705,"Thank you, General Eikenberry."
