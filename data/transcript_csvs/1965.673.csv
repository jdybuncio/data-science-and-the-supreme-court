1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,28.08,31.354,"Chief Justice, members of the Court."
1965.673,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,31.354,34.274,Mr. Dwyer -- O'Dwyer.
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,34.274,47.979,I think it might be well at the outset to give some facts surrounding the history of literacy test in the 19 states where they are in existence.
1965.673,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,259.252,276.414,"I should think the effect whatever the -- whatever the rhetoric was and I've seen in your brief, there was some rhetoric along racial lines and the lines of bigotry but I see the effect would be an effect of assimilation into American society rather than the dissimilation?"
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,276.414,286.583,"Whatever -- whatever the end result was, I am speaking here to the point of the polluted origin of the legislation in the first instance."
1965.673,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,320.97,325.856,Was the legislation signed by the Governor?
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,325.856,328.253,It was signed by the Governor.
1965.673,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,423.735,424.953,May I ask you?
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,424.953,425.156,"Yes, sir."
1965.673,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,425.156,426.027,You said children?
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,429.779,430.18,No.
1965.673,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,436.733,438.327,When did she come to New York?
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,438.327,443.779,She came about approximately 1950.
1965.673,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,447.869,449.704,Has she not learned any English since that time?
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,449.704,452.668,She has not learned any English since that time.
1965.673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,538.246,539.543,May I ask Mr. O'Dwyer?
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,539.543,540.019,"Yes, sir."
1965.673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,540.019,544.752,"I gather if the Government wins the previous case, your case is moot, isn't it?"
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,544.752,545.987,"No, it is not sir."
1965.673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,571.103,571.668,"Well, let me see."
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,576.413,576.768,That only --
1965.673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,576.768,581.594,"Then under the Supremacy Clause, will not that supersede the New York statute?"
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,581.594,582.003,No.
1965.673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,592.432,599.691,"That doesn't include -- that doesn't include the Puerto Rican who is involved here, isn't it?"
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,599.691,602.182,It will not include Puerto Rican --
1965.673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,602.182,603.036,If she's had a certificate?
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,603.036,603.575,Yes.
1965.673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,607.76,615.467,"Her case is solved then and if -- if the Government wins the other case, this party's case is solved?"
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,615.467,616.7,"This, it's true."
1965.673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,621.921,623.838,That -- that case?
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,623.838,646.188,"That -- however, I may say that I think -- I think we should to attempt to solve the Cardona case first and then proceed from that to deal with the 4 (e) case because on the contrary, I think if the -- in order to solve the -- to the case arising under Provision 4 (e), this Court must come to the conclusion that the New York State law is discriminatory."
1965.673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,653.367,666.102,"Well actually, would this be right Mr. O'Dwyer if you're right and if the New York statute independently of 4 (e) is unconstitutional, and is stricken down in your case so we never have to reach the 4 (e) question."
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,666.102,668.645,You will never -- precisely Judge Brennan.
1965.673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,704.631,708.443,Maybe is solve when you decide what constitutional questions to avoid solving another?
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,708.443,713.42,"Well, it will dispose of the total because it will have done far deeper."
1965.673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,751.538,753.152,"Well, of course you could take both."
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,757.626,808.808,"Yes, it would seem that way and I may say that it is not so that we are confined purely to the -- to -- we confine totally and completely to the pronouncements on the day when this was argued which incidentally was three days after the arguments and all of the United States Court of Appeals in the Cardona case and all of the people who did the arguing, both in the House and in the Senate had before them the various information which was available in the case at that time and based their arguments on the Cardona case, but there was -- there were various hearings before the congressional committees dealing with voting practices in the various states previously and among them was the inequities in connection with the establishment of these laws."
1965.673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,810.096,813.452,Specifically of the New York statute Mr. O'Dwyer?
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,813.452,815.033,The hearings which took place --
1965.673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,815.033,815.57,"Yes, fairly."
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,815.57,828.216,"– Not precisely at that time Judge Brennan but took place about two years before that, had also call into question these very enactments not merely here, but in other places as well."
1965.673,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,914.002,914.079,Mr. O'Dwyer --
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,914.079,942.669,"The pronouncement the -- a statement has been made on the record here that from -- on the basis of the information which is imparted to the Spanish-speaking community in New York are through the newspapers, through the magazines, and through the radio that if they are as intelligent, the Spanish-speaking voter is just as in -- as just enlightened on the issues as any of the other fellow citizens who are not Spanish-speaking."
1965.673,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1019.056,1020.378,Mr. O'Dwyer.
1965.673,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1020.378,1021.868,Excuse me Mr. O'Dwyer.
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1021.868,1022.706,"Yes, sir."
1965.673,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1022.706,1041.867,"I dislike interrupting the order of your argument but I like to get back to this question of whether your case is moot, if we should sustain the 4 (e) in the previous case."
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1082.776,1083.369,Yes --
1965.673,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1083.369,1085.536,-- person concern speaks of a Spanish.
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1097.366,1097.831,That's right sir.
1965.673,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1097.831,1099.589,So we would have to go further --
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1099.589,1099.916,Indeed Your Honor.
1965.673,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1099.916,1109.306,-- than we have to go in the previous case under 4 (e) which involves -- which raises only the question of the sixth grade education.
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1109.306,1110.0,That is correct.
1965.673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1135.419,1141.674,That is if -- those are impermissible -- it's an impermissible classification in light of the exceptions for veterans and grandfather and so forth.
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1141.674,1142.418,Correct.
1965.673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1142.893,1144.756,What if they eliminated the exemptions?
1965.673,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1144.756,1145.502,Yes.
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1145.502,1148.588,If -- I'm not quite sure I follow you Judge --
1965.673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1148.588,1152.176,"Well, what if they eliminated those aspects of the law which you say deny the protection?"
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1152.176,1155.419,"Well, this is on the more -- in the broader aspect."
1965.673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1182.944,1188.391,Well if that aspect to your argument would be solved by the deciding the other case in favor of the Government?
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1188.391,1193.899,It would be solved insofar as this particular person is concerned is true.
1965.673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1193.899,1195.008,Or any other person --
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1195.008,1195.119,No --
1965.673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1195.119,1197.799,-- insofar as your -- that last page to your argument?
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1197.799,1204.955,That only a person who can pass the sixth grade education in Spanish.
1965.673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1206.36,1211.651,You're saying -- you're suggesting that New York may not impose literacy test at all.
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1211.651,1212.099,I may --
1965.673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1212.099,1215.965,If you -- if it requires at least a sixth grade education?
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1215.965,1220.584,I would say that New York State insofar as a Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican citizen --
1965.673,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1220.584,1224.326,Or an English-speaking person who has passed the sixth-grade English exam.
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1224.326,1233.711,"I would say that if -- that would fall under the grandfather provisions enacted in 1922, that the whole thing collapses by virtue of that."
1965.673,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1233.711,1240.648,But an American born citizen who speaks only Chinese or Yiddish or French and I suppose there are such?
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1240.648,1241.595,I'm not able to answer that --
1965.673,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1241.595,1242.261,(Voice Overlap) -- who's letter for those --
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1242.261,1249.295,-- it's an interesting question raise here somebody that went to a foreign country when they were a child and came back.
1965.673,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1259.716,1288.649,"We're not here to take care of the situations but to decide constitutional issues and I was wondering if your -- the argument that you make is solely on behalf of native-born American born in Puerto Rico and if so, if that's a very good argument under the Equal Protection Clause because you're saying that the -- only the special group should be protected and that is -- and it was denial of equal protection for New York to different franchise only the special group."
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1288.649,1289.003,It would seem --
1965.673,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1289.003,1299.812,"Now, if the denial of equal protection to have a literacy test in English, isn't it just as much a denial as against the native-born American citizen who speaks only French and is very literate in that language --"
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1299.812,1299.974,"Yes, sir."
1965.673,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1299.974,1306.826,-- or only Chinese or only Swedish or only Portuguese or only Yiddish and I suppose that the --
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1306.826,1307.236,There are some --
1965.673,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1307.236,1307.537,-- those such could be found?
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1307.537,1309.326,-- there are many -- I assumed.
1965.673,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1320.904,1321.942,But any literacy test in English --
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1321.942,1322.564,Yes.
1965.673,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1323.538,1328.104,"-- is the denial of equal protection to American citizens who are literate but not literate in English, is that it?"
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1328.104,1353.278,"Yes, sir and when we have -- when we come to the whole -- we had then -- we have to survey -- in the light of this argument, we have to survey whether or not the literacy test really has done what it is set out to do or whether or not as historically is the fact that it was a provision to prevent people from voting every state where it existed and that I may say that apparently 31 states have done very well without it."
1965.673,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1373.383,1374.318,May I ask you.
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1391.914,1397.696,I would say that any enactment by Congress under those circumstances would be invalid.
1965.673,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1397.696,1399.878,What would -- on what credentials --
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1399.878,1416.249,"If the State of New York which will enact -- to make some enactment which would grant literacy -- which would grant voting rights to a citizen and Congress were to take that right away by its enactment, I think that enactment should be -- should be --"
1965.673,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1416.249,1424.846,"Well, if Congress has the supreme power to pass legislation in that field, why could it not do so even if the situation were reversed?"
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1424.846,1425.803,Because Judge Black --
1965.673,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1425.803,1430.617,If the power is in Congress to pick the qualification to voters in this respect.
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1430.617,1441.941,"Because Judge Black, I would regard the grabble of the complaint to be taking rights away and that's what New York State would not have done under the proposal which you have suggested."
1965.673,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1447.075,1450.568,You're saying -- are you saying -- I'm just asking --
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1450.568,1450.885,Yes sir.
1965.673,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1450.885,1451.838,-- because they thought that it could --
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1451.838,1452.122,Right.
1965.673,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1452.122,1453.943,-- to this argument that's going on.
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1453.943,1454.249,Yes.
1965.673,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1455.282,1463.546,Are you saying that the Congress that they have a constitutional right to vote without qualification with reference to literature?
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1463.546,1463.95,I would say that --
1965.673,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1463.95,1466.306,Or knowledge of the English language?
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1466.306,1469.841,"I would say, that unless there is -- I do not contend --"
1965.673,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1469.841,1471.687,Federal Constitution [Inaudible]
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1471.687,1481.023,I do not contend here that the states do not have a right to setup reasonable requirements with respect to voting.
1965.673,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1495.424,1512.487,Unless it is undoubtedly as to keep them from voting when you say you can't vote it -- you up over unless you are 21 or reduce it to 18 and nearly all these things are to prevent people from voting unless it meets some qualification.
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1512.487,1529.152,I would say that Congress at that point if the State of New York extend its power to those to -- to vote and that Congress took that power away that such an Act would be unconstitutional because they would have been taking away a right from the citizen that it had acquired under the State.
1965.673,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1529.152,1530.162,Under the state law?
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1530.162,1530.334,Under the state --
1965.673,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1530.334,1532.043,State supreme in that field?
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1532.043,1581.518,"I would say that the State is supreme provided that it is not done for the purpose and it does not interfere with -- as it does here, rights which had been acquired by the Treaty of Paris, by enactments of Congress, by proposal submitted to the United Nations which makes this a unique and different situation and I would say that Congress -- that the State would be supreme with the development of its voting rights provided however, that it did not interfere with the basic constitutional rights of any citizens such as in -- Judge Black, you asked whether or not there was any proposal here -- there was any suggestion that this was violative of the Fifteenth Amendment and we make -- we claim that it is, not under the colored provisions but under the race provision."
1965.673,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1613.07,1617.053,"Now, let's get back to the questions that Justice Stewart asked a while ago."
1965.673,0,38206,paul_odwyer,,1622.056,1626.674,"Any country -- American citizens in any country, I would -- well, I'm not prepared to argue that."
1965.673,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1651.175,1657.635,Mr. Hirshowitz.
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,1657.635,1663.754,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.673,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2397.338,2400.951,Did they have the exemptions you have in that?
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2400.951,2401.674,The exemptions?
1965.673,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2401.674,2407.018,"You have in your Act as being model, a model Act?"
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2407.018,2407.231,The exempt --
1965.673,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2407.231,2425.215,"You exempt from it -- not only veterans who are in a veterans' hospital, but you say by a reason of their being in a hospital, their parents and their spouses (Voice Overlap) and all of their children are thereby qualified to vote?"
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2425.215,2427.29,Let me clarify that Mr. Chief Justice.
1965.673,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2427.29,2430.999,Well I wondered if the fact was in the model Act --
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2430.999,2431.951,"No, no, no."
1965.673,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2437.341,2439.354,What test?
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2439.354,2440.761,"-- is a model, is here --"
1965.673,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2440.761,2440.946,Yes.
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2440.946,2442.59,-- as a model throughout the country.
1965.673,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2442.59,2443.188,Yes.
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2443.188,2447.8,"Now, I will deal with the exemptions very quickly."
1965.673,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2447.8,2448.385,Do it in your own time.
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2448.385,2451.536,"The exemptions are -- no, I will deal with him right now."
1965.673,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2540.131,2560.372,"No, I don't know that either, but I was reading from page 10 of the appellant's brief and he says that under the New York law and he lists four subdivisions and in five, he says, spouses, parents, and children of veterans in veterans hospitals."
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2560.372,2580.166,"Yes, but the only thing that says Mr. Chief Justice is, it sets up a system for absentee registration where a spouse is living with a veteran at a veterans hospital somewhere say around Buffalo and they should register and vote say in Brooklyn."
1965.673,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2594.216,2599.897,This says whether the veteran is living or dead.
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2599.897,2625.525,"Only when the veteran is in the hospital or the spouse of the veteran is in the hospital or under -- I don't know too much about the federal veterans hospital legislation but I surmise that a wife of a veteran may have a right to get hospitalization in veterans hospital, but the principles are the same to provide for absentee registration and voting."
1965.673,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2808.444,2812.855,Doesn't apply to Puerto Ricans because they are citizens.
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2812.855,2813.353,No.
1965.673,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2813.353,2816.043,It doesn't apply to Puerto Rican because they are citizens.
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,2816.043,2828.142,"They are citizens, and because they have not up to that point satisfied anybody that they can read and write English, sixth grade or any grade for that matter."
1965.673,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3020.697,3031.635,"May I ask you, may I ask you, what's your thought is on the mootness question that was raised by Mr. Justice Fortas, Mr. Justice Brennan with this case (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3031.635,3033.815,You mean about that New Mexico case?
1965.673,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3033.815,3034.061,No.
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3036.465,3036.558,We suggest that --
1965.673,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3036.558,3040.114,-- Government prevailed in the case preceding this?
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3040.114,3079.478,"We suggested in our original brief and in support of our motion to dismiss that the case might be moot and in a footnote in our present brief, we have renewed that suggestion on the theory that if 4 (e) is upheld by this Court, the Court doesn't have to reach the constitutional questions raised in the Cardona case and that I believe there's a general principle of the -- adopted by the judiciary to avoid constitutional questions if that can be accomplished."
1965.673,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3079.478,3082.645,"Now, 4 (e) is a constitutional question?"
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3082.645,3083.914,4 (e) is what sir?
1965.673,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3083.914,3085.952,"A constitutional question, is that a constitutional question?"
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3085.952,3086.428,Yes.
1965.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3088.735,3093.118,Do you think the New York law is in conflict with 4 (e)?
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3093.118,3100.889,"We -- well, New York law wouldn't be in conflict under 4 (e)."
1965.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3124.478,3131.35,"I suppose -- supposed that law is valid that the federal statute, why isn't your law in conflict with it?"
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3131.35,3163.21,"The law is not in conflict because as I understand -- as I understand the argument being made -- whether it was made this morning by the Solicitor General and by his associates, they were contending that under the -- under that subdivision 5 of Fourteenth Amendment, Section 5, the Congress had the power to go further than the courts in implementing --"
1965.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3163.21,3166.271,But you're saying that you're challenging that are you?
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3166.271,3168.361,We're challenging that in the Florie case.
1965.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3168.361,3171.806,I suppose Section 5 does give power --
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3171.806,3172.18,But then --
1965.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3172.18,3173.315,– Congress should do this.
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3175.667,3175.802,No.
1965.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3185.52,3188.619,"It would be the supreme law of the land, wouldn't it?"
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3188.619,3188.963,I didn't get --
1965.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3188.963,3191.362,"If it's valid, it would be the supreme law, would it not?"
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3191.362,3193.899,"It would be the supreme law, yes sir."
1965.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3193.899,3194.464,Now --
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3194.464,3196.755,And would be followed by New York right away --
1965.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3196.755,3199.349,Are you arguing that it is invalid?
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3199.349,3223.648,"We're arguing in the first case that the 4 (e) is invalid for the primary reason, the territory argument, I don't think anybody on either side puts much stock in, but the primary argument being that in order for a Congress to take action, they must first show that there's discrimination."
1965.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3224.618,3230.405,"Now, suppose it has -- that that's what I want to get it so I'm not interested in that part of the argument."
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3246.14,3246.566,"Well, they --"
1965.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3246.566,3254.506,"Well, and there's any rational ground that anybody could think about, or conceive of to say that Congress had the right to do that, what about it then?"
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3254.506,3258.213,Not simply necessary to protect people from voting Mr. Chief Justice --
1965.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3258.213,3260.313,"Well, the protection from discrimination."
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3260.313,3261.185,That's different Mr. --
1965.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3261.185,3261.62,Alright.
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3279.778,3279.914,I'll --
1965.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3279.914,3281.806,– how wouldn't the law be valid?
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3281.806,3303.42,Our view would be as in the -- that the view expressed in the South Carolina case is the proper application of Section 5 because in that case the Court went out of its way in the opinion to indicate the great effort that was made by federal authorities --
1965.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3303.42,3311.514,"Are you saying, if Congress has to make -- has to produce evidence to show that had a -- that it had a right to believe, what --"
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3311.514,3317.91,"The Section 5 as I recall which says, Congress may make laws from foster prohibitions I think."
1965.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3317.91,3323.71,"Yes, have found the -- enforced by appropriate legislation, the provision to this Section."
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3323.71,3324.102,Yes.
1965.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3332.86,3334.12,"Well, who would have show it? Does Congress --"
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3334.12,3334.215,The extent of --
1965.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3334.215,3343.849,-- have to produce evidence to show that it has grounds to believe that the law ought to be passed or is it -- very heavy burden on the people who attack its law?
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3343.849,3344.245,I think there's --
1965.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3344.245,3346.389,It's all that it had no ground.
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3346.389,3359.179,"Mr. Justice Black, I think this would be too easy in application of that section of the Fourteenth Amendment because the Congress would be enacting legislation without any proper background."
1965.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3397.684,3400.788,"Well, they could step in, in many fields where --"
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3400.788,3401.075,No.
1965.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3401.075,3411.715,-- it has power to enact legislation in that field without having in a burden put on the Congress to show that it had a right to do it?
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3411.715,3417.75,"Well Mr. Justice Black, the best illustration on what I'm trying to say is what happened in this 4 (e)."
1965.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3435.875,3448.897,"Most Congress believed that there was enough probability of it that it is necessary in the public interest to protect against discrimination on account of race or color or what not, why wouldn't have a right to do it under Section 5?"
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3450.495,3450.736,I --
1965.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3450.736,3456.226,Or the Government to show that it had grounds for it or put on the people who attack the law?
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3456.226,3464.975,"I would suggest first as you say Mr. Justice Black, it would have to be evidence of actual discrimination and secondly, --"
1965.673,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3464.975,3466.704,I don't suggest that.
1965.673,1,41446,samuel_a_hirshowitz,,3466.704,3469.076,"Well, as stated for you."
1965.673,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3538.82,3540.574,Very well.
1965.673,2,38206,paul_odwyer,,3540.574,3541.701,May I just for a moment.
1965.673,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3541.701,3543.303,You may just have a moment.
1965.673,2,38206,paul_odwyer,,3543.303,3556.844,Your Honors that I think that the burden placed upon this Court in dealing with the 4 (e) matter has been considerably lightened by consideration of the facts outlined in the Cardona case which have not been questioned.
1965.673,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3601.751,3608.298,We'll return.
