1983.82-1260,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,111.311,"Mr. Griswold, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1983.82-1260,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,111.311,125.9,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1260,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,865.021,878.934,"Dean Griswold, would you think that would be possible if, despite complete ownership, there were different officers and directors of the two companies?"
1983.82-1260,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,878.934,892.431,"I think that no matter how the intraenterprise organization is carried out, the subsidiary is always subject to the complete control of the parent."
1983.82-1260,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,892.431,903.739,Does it matter if it is anything over 51 percent ownership or do you get different questions if it isn't 100 percent?
1983.82-1260,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,903.739,906.348,We don't need to decide that question here.
1983.82-1260,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,908.782,912.611,"That is true, but, of course, you would have to look to the future."
1983.82-1260,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,912.611,928.696,"I would think that a good approach would be in such a case when it comes up that if the corporation was subject to... if the subsidiary was subject to the legal control of the parent, that the same rule ought to apply."
1983.82-1260,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,940.426,952.749,"Well, may I ask, Dean Griswold, suppose... As I understand it Regal and Copperweld really functioned in different markets and produced different products."
1983.82-1260,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,982.455,982.877,No.
1983.82-1260,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1022.534,1035.419,"Yes, but I guess I correctly understand your argument as being no matter what the agreement may be, if one is wholly owned by the other, it can never be a conspiracy within Section 1."
1983.82-1260,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1035.419,1042.21,"Yes, Mr. Justice, that would be my argument, but we don't need to go quite that far to decide this case."
1983.82-1260,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1042.21,1047.366,"Well, we certainly have to consider that possibility, don't we, in deciding this case?"
1983.82-1260,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1047.366,1048.992,Almost--
1983.82-1260,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1048.992,1054.471,"How far your proposition, if we accept it, is to take us."
1983.82-1260,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1054.471,1072.354,"--You would have to say that some of your language used in earlier opinions was not required for the decisions in those cases and may have been too broad, and as so often happens in the development of law, should now be qualified."
1983.82-1260,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1094.082,1097.175,"Do you think we would have to repudiate any holdings, Mr. Griswold?"
1983.82-1260,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1097.175,1098.158,Do I think--
1983.82-1260,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1098.158,1101.64,Do you think we would have to repudiate any holdings as opposed to any language?
1983.82-1260,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1101.64,1104.592,--The only one that worries me is Kiefer-Stewart.
1983.82-1260,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1199.915,1202.192,"That was Justice Clark's opinion, wasn't it?"
1983.82-1260,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1202.192,1203.257,--I believe it was.
1983.82-1260,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1203.257,1206.146,Did he cite Yellow Cab?
1983.82-1260,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1208.065,1216.375,"I believe it was cited in a dissenting opinion, so at least it was brought to the Court's attention."
1983.82-1260,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1216.375,1221.749,"Dean Griswold, do you think Parke-Davis can be reconciled with your view?"
1983.82-1260,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1221.749,1227.996,"Yes, I think so, though it is a somewhat complicated matter."
1983.82-1260,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1227.996,1232.292,How would you distinguish it?
1983.82-1260,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1232.292,1245.91,"I am sorry, Madam Justice, I would have to refresh myself on Parke-Davis."
1983.82-1260,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1435.177,1454.186,Mr. Wallace?
1983.82-1260,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1454.186,1460.901,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1260,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1556.673,1563.298,"Mr. Wallace, has Section 5 as a practical matter been used frequently?"
1983.82-1260,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1563.298,1574.669,"Not frequently, but there is potential for use there that could go beyond Section 2."
1983.82-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1711.238,1712.08,"Mr. Wallace, may I ask one question?"
1983.82-1260,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1732.385,1739.817,We don't believe that that is a valid basis for distinction here.
1983.82-1260,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1811.01,1819.426,"Would you take the view that the activity shown by this record, if performed by independent corporations, constituted a violation of Section 1?"
1983.82-1260,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1825.408,1839.543,"Well, I haven't really considered whether there would be a violation of Section 1 if these were independent organizations."
1983.82-1260,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2104.094,2113.62,"Your time has expired, Mr. Wallace."
1983.82-1260,2,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2117.086,2125.704,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1260,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2138.029,2151.444,"May I ask, Mr. Grimm, could Copperweld have avoided all this difficulty had it just made this a division when it acquired Regal?"
1983.82-1260,2,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2151.444,2156.147,"Well, there certainly is a distinction that is made in the statute."
1983.82-1260,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2156.147,2161.25,"No, but... Would it have avoided any Section 1 problems if it had done it that way?"
1983.82-1260,2,43590,victor_e_grimm,,2161.25,2174.544,"If there had not been a separate corporation, there would not be a Section 1 claim particularly because the statute requires the existence of two separate legal persons which this Court has always held."
