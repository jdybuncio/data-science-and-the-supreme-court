1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,12.117,14.998,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1981.80-6298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,144.915,161.745,"Counsel, I noticed in the very short opinion of the Texas Court of Civil Appeals on page 16 of the appendix beginning there that there's simply -- about one sentence is devoted to the constitutional --"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,161.745,162.336,That's correct.
1981.80-6298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,162.336,162.658,-- provision.
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,195.856,203.76,"The only thing you have to look to Hernandez itself, I think we did quote some of Hernandez in our joint appendix."
1981.80-6298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,205.781,207.496,"In Hernandez, they don't either, do they?"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,207.496,208.938,Okay.
1981.80-6298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,268.623,271.247,"And I gather, whose statute has no tolling provision either?"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,271.247,272.602,There's no tolling provision.
1981.80-6298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,277.297,283.548,Now did you say that the tolling provisions are either by statute or decision?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,288.132,298.875,"Yes, it's Article 5535 of the Texas Revised Civil Statutes that toll all of the limitations found in Title 91 of the Texas laws."
1981.80-6298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,352.136,355.375,"It's only 13.01, which is not tolled."
1981.80-6298,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,355.375,362.718,"Mr. Mankins, would it be your position that a longer statute of limitations than the one year might be valid?"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,362.718,373.203,"Well one year, if you look at what illegitimate children can do which is filed at any time up until they are no longer minors, which is 18 in Texas."
1981.80-6298,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,405.717,408.318,Can you think of any reason why they did that?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,408.318,424.498,Well the only reason we have is what the Texas courts have said and this is the standard reasons that first-year law students learned and also the standard reasons that's been cited in other states that have upheld this type of limitations for illegitimate children.
1981.80-6298,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,429.314,429.452,There's no --
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,429.452,429.708,-- reasons.
1981.80-6298,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,429.708,431.957,-- problem of proof with paternity --
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,431.957,432.186,"Well, that's my --"
1981.80-6298,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,432.186,434.144,"-- with respect to a legitimate child, is there?"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,434.144,434.462,No.
1981.80-6298,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,441.592,447.72,And you don't think that that difference is enough to justify a statute of limitations --
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,447.72,447.952,Well --
1981.80-6298,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,447.952,449.088,-- any time?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,449.088,485.802,"I don't think it is mainly because first, the blood test evidence which, I think, just to recognize the validity of which in Little v. Streater in deciding June of last year, plus the fact that you got the situation where -- which has happened in Texas, where the -- under Texas law, a husband, a father of children born during a marriage can disclaim paternity at any time during a divorce proceeding and show through blood test that he is not in fact the natural father of the children or the child of the marriage."
1981.80-6298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,495.216,504.463,"Tell me Mr. Mankins, those statutes that you said tolled during infancy this by legislation."
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,508.596,511.751,"Illegitimates on a -- on any other type of claim, yes sir."
1981.80-6298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,512.283,517.745,"In other words -- in other words, the limitation without tolling is limited to a paternity suit, is that it?"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,517.745,519.018,Only in paternity suit it's --
1981.80-6298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,519.018,522.89,"In -- in every other respect, there would be tolling in favor of (Voice Overlap) --"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,522.89,523.556,That correct.
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,532.582,544.915,"Mr. Mankins, do I correctly understand that the Texas Supreme Court has now under consideration a case involved in this very statute in (Voice Overlap) the Constitutional Law?"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,544.915,546.361,Yes Your Honor.
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,579.503,580.539,Hasn't decided yet?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,580.539,584.306,"Has not decided the opinion the last time I checked, which was about a week ago."
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,584.306,587.646,Are they waiting for this Court or should we wait for them?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,587.646,590.378,"Well, I don't personally don't know."
1981.80-6298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,596.106,599.996,What's the normal pattern in that court in terms of the time?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,600.707,602.481,Normally they are much quicker --
1981.80-6298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,602.481,604.308,-- before they rise?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,604.308,607.827,They're determined generally much quicker than that.
1981.80-6298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,618.087,619.84,You're not in the Fort Worth case?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,619.84,620.944,"No, Your Honor."
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,656.756,662.724,"Can you tell me whether there was challenge to Statute, on the Texas Constitution in that case or is it just a federal question you know?"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,662.724,664.029,In -- in the Fort Worth case?
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,664.029,664.522,Yes.
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,664.522,666.902,I do not know.
1981.80-6298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,673.459,690.414,"This case is styled and the Court of Civil Appeals in the matter of ABD, a minor child, and one gets the impression from reading it being -- being unfamiliar with Texas procedure the way as I am, but the Texas Department of Human Resources was the plaintiff."
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,690.414,697.175,"Well, the Department of Human Resources by both federal law and state law, they were supplying support."
1981.80-6298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,717.081,719.581,And the state must -- can bring the action.
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,719.581,728.989,"And the state must bring the act -- well, the mother could theoretically bring the action by herself but generally in a AFDC case, it will be the state who will bring the action."
1981.80-6298,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,728.989,734.399,Well and did you represent the Texas Department of Human Resources in the state proceedings?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,734.399,736.456,Not in this proceeding.
1981.80-6298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,767.684,772.51,Well is -- isn't there something of a party's problem there?
1981.80-6298,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,772.51,773.478,"I'm sorry, I don't understand."
1981.80-6298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,773.478,785.925,"Well, if your client, Lois Mae Mills wasn't the party before the Texas Court of Civil Appeals, can she then step in and be a party?"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,785.925,788.231,It was a party at the Court of Civil Appeals.
1981.80-6298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,788.231,789.814,Well that's probably what I don't understand.
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,790.729,792.059,She was a party.
1981.80-6298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,925.246,934.482,Did I get the impression from what you've said earlier that's any limitation short of age 18 years would be unconstitutional?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,934.482,936.481,"No, I don't."
1981.80-6298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,950.771,955.777,"That's what I'm talking about, just the -- this case for illegitimate children."
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,963.165,968.518,"I think as long as its legitimate children have that right until 18, I think illegitimate children should have that right."
1981.80-6298,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,969.22,981.154,"Well, Mr. Mankins, do you also have an argument that in any event illegitimates are discriminated only in against -- only in paternity suits?"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,981.98,982.777,That -- that is (Voice Overlap) --
1981.80-6298,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,982.777,991.847,That in every other kind of suit where a legitimate may benefit from tolling and -- a minor benefits from tolling so also does an illegitimate.
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,991.847,992.316,That's correct.
1981.80-6298,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,992.316,997.56,It's only in this particular kind of proceeding that there's a discrimination against the illegitimate.
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,997.56,998.282,That's right.
1981.80-6298,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,998.282,1005.236,"So that it's a -- it's more than just a discrimination as between legitimates and illegitimates, isn't it?"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1005.236,1005.779,"That's -- well, that's correct."
1981.80-6298,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1005.779,1008.71,It's within the class of illegitimates is also a --
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1008.71,1008.827,That's correct.
1981.80-6298,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1008.827,1009.997,-- discrimination you can tell.
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1009.997,1012.194,That's correct.
1981.80-6298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1049.941,1053.814,"Well, do you have -- do you have a paternity issue with these other cases?"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1053.814,1055.133,"No, you don't."
1981.80-6298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1055.133,1056.76,Is that not the difference that Texas relies on?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1056.76,1077.951,"Well, the problem with that is that its paternity is probably -- paternity suits are probably better at withstanding time as far as evidence is concerned, the stale evidence argument for restricting these cases because of the availability of the blood test."
1981.80-6298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1087.85,1091.742,"A blood test is only a negative test, is it not?"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1091.742,1099.237,"Well it is a negative test, but the exclusion rates are so high, routinely 98 to 99%."
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1164.915,1177.887,Would you agree that the state could rationally require the plaintiff in this case to have a heavier burden of proof and the plaintiff in a case establishing paternity by a legitimate parent?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1201.726,1202.014,Well --
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1202.014,1203.171,-- constitutional?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1203.171,1205.88,I wouldn't see -- I would say that it would not be.
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1223.896,1232.896,Well I supposed the answer that might be that the common experience teaches us is a greater probability of accuracy in one situation than the other.
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1232.896,1234.826,"Well, if that could be shown, I'm not sure that --"
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1234.826,1238.954,There are more false claims in the illegitimacy area than there are in the illegitimacy.
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1238.954,1262.918,"Well, the problem with that is that I have had simply never -- everybody talks about these fraudulent claims as the attempt for blackmail, but with the type of testing procedures we have in blood test with the other protections that the alleged father has, the actual -- the actuality of fraudulent claims is virtually nonexistent."
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1270.577,1272.614,(Inaudible) we know they happened in Texas anyway.
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1272.614,1275.747,"Well -- yes, that would be where my experience is clearly."
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1368.224,1369.675,Let me put the question little differently.
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1379.364,1381.377,"Well, I think that is the law in Texas."
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1381.377,1384.664,"But that is, then there is some difference in the treatment of their (Voice Overlap) --"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1384.664,1387.964,There is some difference and we don't have a problem with that.
1981.80-6298,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1432.521,1439.303,"Did you say that if the putative father refuses to take the blood test, there's a sanction of contempt?"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1439.303,1441.922,"Contempt, $500 and six months in jail --"
1981.80-6298,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1441.922,1444.724,"Well, there may also be a finding of paternity against him?"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1444.724,1446.644,No.
1981.80-6298,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1468.344,1475.2,"Well, what happens to the mother's paternity claim if a -- if a putative father refuses to submit?"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1475.2,1477.699,She's got real tough case.
1981.80-6298,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1477.699,1478.702,She cannot --
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1478.702,1481.079,"No, she can go forward with the law suit."
1981.80-6298,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1487.087,1489.452,"Well, I know, but if she does, she may prevail and (Voice Overlap) --"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1489.452,1489.67,She may.
1981.80-6298,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1489.67,1490.753,-- judgment of the of paternity --
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1490.753,1491.328,She may.
1981.80-6298,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1491.328,1492.041,"Well, that's right."
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1493.928,1494.498,Right.
1981.80-6298,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1494.498,1495.131,I see.
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1495.131,1495.428,Right.
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1508.462,1518.064,"It's definitely a blood testing hasn't yet, if they ever can, evolve -- the technology hasn't evolved to the point where it can be affirmative on the issue of it (Voice Overlap) --"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1518.064,1528.044,"Well, once again you were talking about medical terms and if it's a double negative, Dr. Terasaki says, he can get 100% exclusion rate now."
1981.80-6298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1528.044,1529.103,What does that mean?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1529.103,1533.267,It means that all possible non-fathers would be excluded.
1981.80-6298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1533.267,1543.496,"Well, I -- does that necessary, then does it follow then -- does it follow then that this particular person is the father?"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1543.496,1544.856,That's what I think.
1981.80-6298,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1551.258,1557.21,"If you look at our recent case, I think under the Connecticut you'll find that all it does this prove who (Voice Overlap) --"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1557.21,1558.446,"Who could not be a father, that's correct."
1981.80-6298,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1558.446,1567.815,"-- it's a negative test which is only a fraction although a large fraction with the total, but it's nothing like a 100% as you're suggesting."
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1567.815,1568.222,"Well, I do --"
1981.80-6298,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1568.222,1570.389,That's simply an incorrect statement.
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1570.389,1576.362,"Well, Dr. Terasaki made that statement in one of his articles which we have cited in the brief."
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1585.049,1586.546,What do you mean you have seen them?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1586.546,1590.168,I had them in our cases where we have done blood testing.
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1604.172,1608.199,That would still leave the -- that would still leave the defendants some others.
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1608.199,1615.295,It still would leave the defendant and some others and of course that is for him to argue to the judge or the jury.
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1624.008,1629.259,"Well, even the doctor's article about the 100% exclusion rate, he didn't say that's true with all cases."
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1631.14,1631.707,Well --
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1631.707,1633.0,Isn't that right?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1633.0,1633.311,No.
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1642.503,1643.657,In all cases?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1643.657,1645.076,"Well, that's the way I understood."
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1645.076,1645.239,I see.
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1645.239,1648.032,He did not go into any details on this.
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1650.934,1657.096,"But a part from that article, isn't the general understanding that the degree of reliability varies with the various factor (Voice Overlap)."
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1657.096,1672.661,It does very -- it does very -- almost of them are in the 90% rate with about 25% now according to some of the experts we cited over 98%.
1981.80-6298,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1677.506,1679.974,"Mr. Mankins, may I back up a minute."
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1689.85,1692.489,"Once again, this confusing in Texas law."
1981.80-6298,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1724.856,1728.598,"So there is great protection on the father, still?"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1728.598,1732.835,I think there's abundant protection on the father.
1981.80-6298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1747.152,1753.248,"Mr. Mankins, the reason for your paternity suit I supposed is to establish the base for support."
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1753.248,1753.736,Right.
1981.80-6298,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1754.568,1764.79,"Suppose the putative father, knowing the mother tendered support for 18 months and then decided to quit."
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1766.358,1768.268,I think she would be under Texas law.
1981.80-6298,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1838.12,1849.16,Early in your argument you talked about the change in the law.Must we decide that the one -- that the one year statute is unconstitutional or the four or both?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1849.16,1851.545,"Well, because four is simply not for the Court."
1981.80-6298,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1856.916,1858.494,Why is it within the case?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1858.494,1862.366,"Well, because we -- we -- only the one year applies to us."
1981.80-6298,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1875.966,1885.449,"Well, that maybe so, what if we agreed with you that well therefore because of that rule, the one year statute is here supposed we said that unconstitutional?"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1885.449,1886.243,Well -- I -- my --
1981.80-6298,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1886.243,1890.501,"Well then, wouldn't you have to reach the four-year statute?"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1890.501,1891.305,I think all the (Voice Overlap) argument --
1981.80-6298,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1891.305,1898.424,"Then the question would be are you barred by some other rule and they would say, “Yes, you're barred by the four-year statute”, and then (Voice Overlap) you'd have to reach that, wouldn't you?"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1898.424,1901.45,The Texas Supreme Court could very well make that determination.
1981.80-6298,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1901.45,1903.443,What do you mean the Texas Supreme Court?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1903.443,1911.726,"Well, they would have to read the opinion and if it was nearly written only applying the one year."
1981.80-6298,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1927.889,1931.432,Is -- isn't there another reason why the four-year statute isn't before us?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1937.994,1939.383,"No, because it did, in one law (Voice Overlap) --"
1981.80-6298,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1939.383,1940.755,"Well, how can it be before us?"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1940.755,1941.67,"Well, that's -- that's one thing."
1981.80-6298,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1968.429,1978.69,"On page 6 of your brief, you have the statement, “Blood test has -- is virtually can prove or disprove paternity” because it last -- that last forever."
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1983.143,1984.173,"Well, it's incorrect and that --"
1981.80-6298,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1984.173,1991.692,It can only improve in 99% or whatever the doctor said.
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,1991.692,1999.001,"Well, it's incorrect in that as you state it does not affirm -- affirmatively state who the father is."
1981.80-6298,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2011.199,2015.525,(Inaudible) statment would be blood tests can disprove paternity.
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,2015.525,2018.248,Blood test can certainly disprove paternity at anytime.
1981.80-6298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2018.248,2021.954,"Of course, your statement is, that it virtually can prove."
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,2021.954,2032.661,"Well, that is from a lawyer who's tried about 60 of these and this type of evidence is overwhelming when you get it to the jury and the judge for that matter."
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2037.097,2042.706,"Of course, you can't make the statement rely on a -- on the one-year statute."
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,2042.706,2043.769,I don't understand Your Honor.
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2043.769,2052.594,"Well, you say the -- that defendant -- the defendant has a -- has a vested interest in the one-year statute and even if it's repealed, it can rely on it."
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,2052.594,2055.648,"No, if it's repealed then we would go back to the (Voice Overlap) --"
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2055.648,2058.406,"Well, I know but if it's amended like it has been."
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,2058.406,2060.973,"He can't rely on in this case, no."
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2060.973,2062.05,What do you mean he can't?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,2062.05,2070.772,"Well, because the one-year had already run when we filed the case under Texas Law and plus the child was over four when (Voice Overlap) the four-year went to effect."
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2070.772,2075.88,I just don't -- my question is why hasn't the case moved when one-year statute is gone?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,2075.88,2077.889,"Well, it's not gone in Texas."
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2077.889,2078.639,Why?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,2078.639,2084.62,Because Texas court has not ruled that it's unconstitutional other than in the -- in the Courts of Appeals.
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2084.62,2086.346,I know but it's been repealed.
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,2089.128,2089.415,But there --
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2089.415,2091.036,Once have we decided on the one year?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,2091.036,2106.899,"Well, because all children born after September 1, 1975 who are illegitimate, and who were not one-year old by September 1, 1981, and who have not had a lawsuit to determine paternity are still barred by 13.01."
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2106.899,2108.007,Why?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,2108.007,2113.255,Because 13.01 was the law that was in effect when they were born.
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2113.255,2117.705,"Yes, but if the state didn't plead the one-year statute you wouldn't be barred by it."
1981.80-6298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2117.705,2119.285,But they did plead the one-year statute.
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,2119.285,2120.068,The defendant.
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2120.068,2123.809,I know but you can't -- if the state got up and said he waived the one-year statute.
1981.80-6298,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2123.809,2125.395,"Oh, the state can't waive it though."
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,2125.395,2129.417,"The defendant -- the defendant, it's he's vested right under the Texas Constitution."
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2134.909,2136.504,The defendant's vested right?
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,2136.504,2137.667,Defendant's vested right.
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2137.667,2141.459,"Well, that's -- that's the -- and what does he do?"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,2141.459,2144.017,He's the -- he's the alleged father.
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2155.82,2161.347,"You don't have to make it hypothetical, the reason you're going to lose this case is because that one-year statute."
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,2163.53,2164.078,That's correct.
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2164.078,2166.412,And we don't have to talk about hypothetical cases.
1981.80-6298,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2166.412,2166.747,You can --
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,2166.747,2167.704,I cannot go back.
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2167.704,2172.636,"And the four-year statute can't be involved because you did file within less than four years, didn't you?"
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,2172.636,2174.509,"Well, the child was -- yes."
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2174.509,2177.534,"I mean when you brought this proceeding, it was within four years."
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,2177.534,2177.544,That's correct.
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2177.544,2179.884,So the four-year statute can't be barred in this proceeding.
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,2179.884,2180.301,That's correct.
1981.80-6298,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2180.301,2184.602,The only thing at issue here is whether the one-year statute prevents you from recovering.
1981.80-6298,0,36317,michael_e_mankins,,2184.602,2194.145,That's correct.
1981.80-6298,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2194.145,2195.327,Ms. Bonner.
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2195.327,2197.698,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1981.80-6298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2250.713,2261.063,Are you suggesting that a proper remedy would have been to bring a new suit to a year ago before the four years had elapsed?
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2261.063,2261.633,It's true.
1981.80-6298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2264.806,2267.423,"Ms. Bonner, you represent the punitive father, right?"
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2267.423,2268.123,I do.
1981.80-6298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2268.123,2269.87,Have you waived that defense?
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2269.87,2270.0,Not -- (Voice Overlap).
1981.80-6298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2270.0,2274.644,You are now contending that's an obstacle to your client having the basic work money are you not?
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2274.644,2275.88,"Not at all, sir, because the child --"
1981.80-6298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2275.88,2277.412,"Well, then why don't you waive the defense?"
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2277.412,2280.195,The child in this case was born in February of 1977.
1981.80-6298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2280.195,2284.291,But he filed suit less than four years after he was born.
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2291.033,2302.784,"Well, I don't see that I was -- that the appellee in this case was in a position to do that because by the time, our legislator promulgated and formulated the new four-year statute."
1981.80-6298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2309.07,2316.497,"See, but you don't -- haven't loss your right to waive the defense, you could say right now, well, waive the defense and go to trial."
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2321.067,2343.425,"What -- what the appellee was attempting to do was give the Texas courts an opportunity to decide whether or not they would apply a -- retroactivity to the new statute before we came up here, because it would appear to me and I disagree with Mr. Mankins when he -- when he suggested that the Texas courts are not going to give retroactivity for this reason."
1981.80-6298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2484.353,2489.274,"Now, they can do it over a span of four years to establish --"
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2489.274,2489.36,That --
1981.80-6298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2489.36,2489.386,-- paternity.
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2489.386,2495.415,"-- is correct, establish paternity, which is a necessary prerequisite in illegitimacy."
1981.80-6298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2539.858,2542.847,Who would the father sue in such litigation?
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2542.847,2543.804,To establish paternity?
1981.80-6298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2543.804,2544.143,Yes.
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2544.143,2546.73,He may establish paternity voluntarily by going into court.
1981.80-6298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2546.73,2548.569,Without doing or require a lawsuit.
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2548.569,2550.387,"That's -- that will, --"
1981.80-6298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2550.387,2550.746,And he --
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2550.746,2550.827,-- but he may.
1981.80-6298,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2550.827,2553.698,"-- could do it more than one year after the child was born, couldn't he?"
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2553.698,2553.883,Yes.
1981.80-6298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2637.071,2639.66,How does that help the chid then?
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2639.66,2640.708,I am sorry I did not understand.
1981.80-6298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2640.708,2644.338,How does that help the child involved in this case?
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2644.338,2649.186,It wouldn't help any child because his -- his right to support has -- has --
1981.80-6298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2649.186,2657.603,How could you say that this child went down with a one-year statute and therefore has no cause of action?
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2664.161,2664.343,Only --
1981.80-6298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2664.343,2665.938,-- say that it is the same person?
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2665.938,2673.621,Only if this Court says that that one-year statute of limitations which governed this case is unconstitutional.
1981.80-6298,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2673.621,2676.251,(Inaudible)
1981.80-6298,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2676.251,2691.572,"Mrs. Bonner, just to clarify this a little more, if this Court were to rule the one-year statute of limitations invalid, then the appellant would be able to proceed to a established paternity"
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2691.572,2692.839,That is correct.
1981.80-6298,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2692.839,2701.366,"And then, thereafter, conceivably could seek support (Voice Overlap) from the father if paternity is established."
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2701.366,2702.502,Right.
1981.80-6298,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2702.908,2710.189,And you were still asserting the one-year statute of limitations as a defense on behalf of your client.
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2710.189,2714.261,"I did at the trial level of this case, yes."
1981.80-6298,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2727.026,2727.405,Right.
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2727.405,2747.212,-- which is the reason I requested in the Texas Court that the style will be changed to in re ABD in lieu of the manner in which appeal was taken at United States of America because -- and counsel pointed out the fact that -- that these cases are confidential.
1981.80-6298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2798.87,2802.545,"It would be unlikely, you have a 21-year old suing for support, isn't it?"
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2802.545,2803.529,That is correct.
1981.80-6298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2808.196,2813.539,"But you were -- but you were referring to the other consequences, rights of inheritance and so forth."
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2813.539,2813.885,That is correct.
1981.80-6298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2813.885,2816.672,-- which might be worth to -- to you more than the support.
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2816.672,2818.607,"Absolutely, absolutely."
1981.80-6298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2818.691,2828.632,"Now, are you -- are you saying in your earlier remarks and -- but essentially this is not a support case, this is just another paternity case."
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2828.632,2828.974,"No, this --"
1981.80-6298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2828.974,2836.681,And that the support is simply a collateral consequence of the results of the paternity case.
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2836.681,2839.126,This is a support case.
1981.80-6298,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2931.969,2940.474,"But in any event, you do concede that the statute was the Texas legislature's response to Gomez against Perez?"
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2940.474,2942.34,I -- I think I would have to say that as --
1981.80-6298,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2942.34,2949.411,To that extent -- it's a support statute to that extent anyway.
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,2949.411,2950.808,I think that's true.
1981.80-6298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3014.072,3017.664,"Well, Texas could enact -- enact another statute to take care of that kid thing."
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,3017.664,3018.205,I beg your pardon?
1981.80-6298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3018.205,3020.566,Texas could enact another statute that to --
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,3020.566,3021.047,Yes.
1981.80-6298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3021.047,3021.183,-- take --
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,3021.183,3021.35,-- they do.
1981.80-6298,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3021.35,3022.358,-- take are of that problem.
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,3022.358,3031.379,"And at -- frankly, anticipated the question, why do you think the Texas legislature said one year at first and now it is saying four."
1981.80-6298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3057.066,3085.27,"(Voice Overlap) Ms. Bonner, do you argued that the four-year statute had run and that he would be barred if for one reason or another he went back, but if he has a pending case which he surely has, under the one-year statute, do you believe that the four-year statute has already run on him?"
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,3085.27,3086.054,I do.
1981.80-6298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3106.435,3106.75,Even though --
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,3106.75,3106.791,That's just now --
1981.80-6298,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3106.791,3111.506,-- the kid was brought within the four years?
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,3111.506,3112.473,Yes sir.
1981.80-6298,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3116.208,3128.151,"Ms. Bonner, do you know anything about that Miller case -- it is the situation challenged under the Texas Constitution as well as the United States Constitution?"
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,3128.151,3130.997,Article 1 of the Texas Constitution is mentioned.
1981.80-6298,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3165.371,3171.429,Do you have any guess as to why the case is pending undecided that they're waiting for this case?
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,3171.429,3175.266,I would concur with my opposing counsel.
1981.80-6298,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3175.266,3177.778,I suppose we could find out.
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,3177.778,3182.829,I'm sure that this Court could.
1981.80-6298,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3182.829,3190.217,Did you -- did you say that the -- was the judgment in the Fort Worth case based on the federal constitution?
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,3190.217,3190.927,Yes.
1981.80-6298,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3190.927,3192.052,Only?
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,3192.052,3199.51,It -- it mentioned in the Texas Constitution but not in -- as it related to the discrimination because it was a paternity suit and not a maternity suit.
1981.80-6298,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3203.752,3207.83,Is there a great demand from maternity -- maternity suits?
1981.80-6298,1,34177,lola_l_bonner,,3207.83,3218.321,Not to my knowledge.
