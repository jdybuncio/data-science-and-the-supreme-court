1991.90-1912,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,6.896,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 90-1912, Stephanie Nordlinger against Kenneth Hahn."
1991.90-1912,0,19222,carlyle_w_hall_jr,,8.358,13.25,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1912,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,55.298,57.14,"We did reserve that question in the Allegheny case, did we not?"
1991.90-1912,0,19222,carlyle_w_hall_jr,,57.14,57.801,"--Yes, you did."
1991.90-1912,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,109.445,111.037,"Of course, these are not static groups, are they?"
1991.90-1912,0,19222,carlyle_w_hall_jr,,111.337,112.437,"No, that's exactly."
1991.90-1912,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,112.437,115.389,"--today you may be a continuing resident, tomorrow decide to move."
1991.90-1912,0,19222,carlyle_w_hall_jr,,121.101,124.734,"No, that is true, that citizens are not identified permanently."
1991.90-1912,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,228.734,239.148,"Well, Mr. Hall, in West Virginia, I suppose the State law required that properties be put on the rolls at current value."
1991.90-1912,0,19222,carlyle_w_hall_jr,,239.148,245.683,"--No, Your Honor, that's... the State law was a current market value system."
1991.90-1912,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,256.899,263.125,But at least the State law in West Virginia said you will place properties on at market value.
1991.90-1912,0,19222,carlyle_w_hall_jr,,263.125,263.926,--Yes.
1991.90-1912,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,263.926,269.209,And in California the constitution has been amended to provide something other than that.
1991.90-1912,0,19222,carlyle_w_hall_jr,,269.209,270.26,That's true.
1991.90-1912,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,270.26,271.53,Acquisition value.
1991.90-1912,0,19222,carlyle_w_hall_jr,,271.53,272.311,"That's true, but--"
1991.90-1912,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,272.311,276.803,And how do we normally measure an equal protection claim?
1991.90-1912,0,19222,carlyle_w_hall_jr,,278.856,279.557,--When--
1991.90-1912,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,279.557,281.487,"A rational basis test, normally?"
1991.90-1912,0,19222,carlyle_w_hall_jr,,281.487,281.888,--Yes.
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1509.303,1520.701,The equal protection analysis of this case is just as simple as it is compelling.
1991.90-1912,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1682.858,1690.972,"Well, they certainly could have by insisting that the local and State governing bodies spend less money."
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1690.972,1692.252,--That is correct.
1991.90-1912,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1695.555,1700.738,And that choice inevitably placed a burden on a different group of people.
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1700.738,1701.569,That is correct.
1991.90-1912,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1720.593,1722.282,"Well, Mr.--"
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1724.894,1733.87,"No, but you look at... there are anomalies, there are inequities, there are windfalls throughout the Federal income tax code, and necessarily so."
1991.90-1912,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1748.931,1753.896,Because why wouldn't that conceivable test satisfy... been satisfied in the West Virginia case?
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1753.896,1756.647,For this reason--
1991.90-1912,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1756.647,1758.287,Because the same arguments could have been made there.
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1758.287,1758.647,--Yeah.
1991.90-1912,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1808.539,1821.519,"But Mr. Lee, if you base it on the difference between the State law in West Virginia and California, what do you do with the dictum from the Sunday Lake Iron Company case that your opponents quoted at page 25 of their brief and you didn't even mention in your brief?"
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1823.93,1824.922,--I stood--
1991.90-1912,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1824.922,1826.494,--It doesn't matter whether it's part of the expressed terms of the statute--
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1826.494,1826.694,--Oh.
1991.90-1912,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1826.895,1829.516,--or by its improper execution through duly constituted agents.
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1829.516,1829.937,Yes.
1991.90-1912,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1829.937,1831.857,Do you think there is... does make a difference?
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1831.857,1832.298,"Well, I think we do."
1991.90-1912,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1841.545,1843.225,"Well, do you think that's a correct statement of the law?"
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1843.225,1844.877,"--Of course it is, but it has nothing to do with this case."
1991.90-1912,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1955.859,1969.606,"Well, Mr. Lee, in the Allegheny case, the opinion says the constitutional requirement is the seasonable attainment of a rough equality in the tax treatment of similarly situated property owners."
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1972.13,1973.259,Of course it is.
1991.90-1912,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1975.292,1976.501,And how does Proposition 13 meet that?
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1976.501,1978.073,In this way.
1991.90-1912,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2000.438,2009.945,"Well, do you say that the California treatment is a seasonable attainment of equality?"
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2009.945,2018.811,"Well, I really think that that word seasonable means... just recognizes that even with a current value system, it's going to take some time to make some adjustments."
1991.90-1912,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2052.563,2082.664,"Mr. Lee, before you get off of Allegheny Pittsburgh, suppose the West Virginia legislature in Allegheny Pittsburgh had passed a statute that said, yes, we know we have a current market value system, but elderly people who shouldn't be assessed on their current value, and we think this is a competing State policy and, although we are using a current market value system, the elderly should not be taxed on their unrealized income."
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2091.77,2093.56,"--I would surely hope not, Justice."
1991.90-1912,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2093.56,2099.634,"Okay, now what if the tax assessor makes the same conclusion and just doesn't move against elderly people?"
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2121.869,2144.875,"It feels most comfortable, most logical to me, in light of what this Court has said about rational basis and particularly in tax cases and the difficulties that you've just mentioned, to draw that line between those instances where the official policy makers of the State, the legislature or the constitution makers, have set forth the policy."
1991.90-1912,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2157.703,2172.564,"And the effect of the runaway assessor was that, taking Justice Scalia's hypothesis, that in West Virginia, as it were, some young taxpayers, to use his term, were subsidizing the old taxpayers and other young taxpayers weren't."
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2175.465,2177.346,"Yes, Justice Souter."
1991.90-1912,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2182.168,2185.22,"Well, I'm not sure what your equal protection principle is."
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2194.547,2200.49,"--Well, I would prefer to look at it, Justice Kennedy, through a slightly different prism."
1991.90-1912,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2223.748,2238.157,"Mr.... no, but the hypothetical put to you by Justice Scalia and I think echoed by Justice Souter and the one I'm interested in, is what happens if the official refuses to enforce the State policy as written?"
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2240.588,2244.619,I think that falls closer to the Allegheny Pittsburgh side of the line.
1991.90-1912,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2255.996,2260.341,"And what is the best authority you have for that proposition, other than Allegheny?"
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2260.341,2266.735,I cannot think of any other than just the general ones that establish the rational basis test and the general approach.
1991.90-1912,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2271.727,2288.988,"Because it seems to me that that is a far more vast expansion of equal protection jurisprudence than the petitioner's submission here, which is that equal property tax... that property tax should be treated equally for similarly situated persons."
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2293.372,2295.262,"Well, maybe I don't understand your position."
1991.90-1912,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2312.414,2321.281,We don't want to review every State decision to decide whether every State administrative official is being faithful to the constitution.
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2350.351,2351.019,Yes.
1991.90-1912,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2351.019,2353.601,Isn't that an adequate explanation of Allegheny Pittsburgh?
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2353.601,2354.672,It may well be.
1991.90-1912,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2394.479,2398.302,May I ask this question about the elderly people justification for the statute.
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2415.803,2420.135,--It's just another policy judgment that has been made by the State of California.
1991.90-1912,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2426.75,2431.251,"Well, but Mr. Lee, you've argued that this is an acquisition-based value tax."
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2469.887,2471.009,--It is inconsistent.
1991.90-1912,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2509.864,2514.376,"But it hardly fits the acquisition value theory, because at the time of the transfer within the family--"
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2514.376,2515.337,That is correct.
1991.90-1912,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2515.337,2518.58,--there should be some kind of valuation capable of being placed on it.
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2518.58,2527.566,"Of course there could, just like there could at the time that my grandfather died and my father got a step up in basis in his income tax property."
1991.90-1912,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2575.398,2586.084,"It really isn't similar, because the real estate property tax pays for a group of services that the owner of the property gets... police protection, fire protection, schools, as so forth."
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2597.16,2597.44,--Sure.
1991.90-1912,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2597.44,2599.423,Something counter-intuitive about this.
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2602.655,2606.957,"Well, I think what's really counter-intuitive is just the assumption... just the assumption that that's the way we've done it over the years."
1991.90-1912,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2811.441,2816.975,"Of course, an easy way to solve it would just be as inflation pushes the price up and up, just lower the tax."
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2825.129,2826.391,You're dead right.
1991.90-1912,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2835.366,2841.591,"Of course, there's another solution for some of these elderly people who have suddenly found their $10,000 homes are worth a million dollars."
1991.90-1912,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2843.051,2844.723,--Of course.
1991.90-1912,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2893.675,2895.705,Thank you Mr. Lee.
1991.90-1912,2,19222,carlyle_w_hall_jr,,2897.949,2898.968,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1991.90-1912,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3015.785,3017.407,"Thank you, Mr. Hall."
