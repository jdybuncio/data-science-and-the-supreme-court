2002.02-516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.467,"We will hear argument next in No. 02-516, Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher v. Lee Bollinger."
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,40.692,43.604,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-516,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,108.838,126.498,"Mr.... Mr. Kolbo, as a preliminary matter, would you address the question of whether the named plaintiff Patrick Hamacher has standing in this case."
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,131.643,132.426,"Correct, Your Honor."
2002.02-516,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,132.426,149.461,"And he claimed that he intended to apply to transfer to the University of Michigan, from wherever he was going to school, and yet the transfer admissions policy, I guess isn't before us."
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,149.461,153.778,"The transfer admissions policy itself is not before you... the Court, Your Honor."
2002.02-516,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,153.778,153.919,No--
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,153.919,165.797,"--but the policy is essentially the same with respect to the consideration of race and the Court did... we did certify a class in this case, with respect to Mr. Hamacher, and I believe it was December of 1998."
2002.02-516,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,178.283,183.045,--Are you sure that the transfer policy is the same as the admissions policy for new freshmen?
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,183.045,184.121,"Well, it's not exactly the--"
2002.02-516,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,184.121,185.603,We didn't find any such finding.
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,190.104,192.492,"--The transfer policy considers race, Your Honor."
2002.02-516,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,192.492,196.538,"I know it considered race, but not in precisely the same way as this--"
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,196.538,208.476,"Not in precisely the same way, and the Court... there... there is nothing... it may be, perhaps included in parts of the appendix materials, but the district court did not address the issue of the transfer policy when it... in Mr. Hamacher's potential for transferring under the policy."
2002.02-516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,208.476,218.22,"Well, there's nothing, I take it... if Mr. Hamacher prevails on the transfer... there is nothing in his prevailing that would hurt any other class member."
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,218.22,219.762,"Nothing at all, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.02-516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,219.762,220.875,It's not a... okay.
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,220.875,221.071,No.
2002.02-516,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,229.894,235.645,Of course that would be true even if he doesn't have standing.
2002.02-516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,235.645,237.465,[Laughter]
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,237.465,237.911,That's true.
2002.02-516,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,242.925,253.387,"I understand if it's struck down, but that... that begs the question of whether the named plaintiff has standing to represent a class of people who want to get into the freshman class."
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,264.746,277.523,"No, Your Honor, but we... we do believe that because the... the transfer policy and the original admissions policy are fundamentally the same in the respect that they both consider race in the admissions process in a way that is discriminatory and we believe that's--"
2002.02-516,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,277.523,292.715,"And therefore if you're right that any consideration of a race is enough to condemn the program, then he would have standing, but if it... if it requires analysis of the particular components of the policy, then we ought to know whether the transfer policy is the same as the original policy."
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,292.715,310.629,"--That would be true, Your Honor, if the case were decided strictly on the issue of narrow tailoring, but my understanding is that the University considers race for a purpose to achieve a diversity that we believe is not compelling, and if that is struck down as a rationale, then the law would be same with respect to the transfer policy as with respect to the original admissions policy, Your Honor."
2002.02-516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,310.629,313.153,"Oh, he has standing to challenge."
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,329.468,334.095,"He would be... it seems to me, perhaps, Your Honor, entitled for relief for damages."
2002.02-516,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,346.207,351.722,And the court agreed with him as far as the program that was in place when he applied.
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,355.403,356.086,"It did, Your Honor."
2002.02-516,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,356.086,379.293,"And... but upheld the program that came into being after his application, and he hasn't reapplied under the new... but he... but there was a class certified, so I suppose you could substitute another plaintiff, someone who is applying under the current system."
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,379.293,390.343,"Well... well, our position, Your Honor, is that because the class was certified with respect to Mr. Hamacher, that that's sufficient; that if the... if the system is found unconstitutional, he is an adequate class representative."
2002.02-516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,534.668,538.195,How... how does the University of Michigan decide those things?
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,542.141,545.787,"--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, it's a matter essentially of self-identification."
2002.02-516,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,563.723,564.829,And... and the reason that these--
2002.02-516,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,564.829,571.738,--One thing I don't quite understand what difference does it make to your client whether they're three or four races or five or six races as long as she's not one of them?
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,571.738,575.541,"Well, it seems to me, Your Honor, it... the problem--"
2002.02-516,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,575.541,581.521,"She's equally being discriminated against as a Caucasian, no matter how many other races are preferred."
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,581.521,582.825,"--That's true, Your Honor."
2002.02-516,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,598.165,605.932,"So is it entirely discretionary when you read a set of exam books, you know, it's highly subjective, which is a little better than its--"
2002.02-516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,632.215,633.094,[Laughter]
2002.02-516,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,633.094,650.985,"But... but I don't... if you said to a businessperson, this doesn't have standards, such a thing, I think they might laugh and say my job and experience is to select who's better for this slot, so... so I'm not sure of the constitutional relevance of what you say, which seems to me to me to grow out of the nature of the problem."
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,650.985,659.392,"Well, again, Justice Breyer, the constitutional relevance derives from the fact that we're talking about a constitutional right here, the use of race, which is not the same thing as--"
2002.02-516,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,659.392,673.465,"Yes, yes, but I mean, as Justice Stevens just said, the constitutional problem consists of the injury to your client and that injury is the same irrespective of the precise nature of the standards on the other side."
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,697.613,715.843,"--Well, Your Honor, what I'm suggesting is the Court itself has made clear that for an interest to be compelling, one of the considerations that the Court must look at is whether there are standards... independent, ascertainable standards apart from the discretion exercised by, say, an employer to determine whether the interest is one that's compelling and one that the Court can oversee."
2002.02-516,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,736.83,754.314,"Mr. Kolbo, because you mentioned the employer and the employer's judgment, I gathered from your brief that this case is not simply about public universities."
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,766.214,769.305,"The same standard would apply, Justice Ginsburg, that's correct."
2002.02-516,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,769.305,774.654,"And it... and in the private sector, employment in the private sector, there's 1981."
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,787.993,791.846,"Well, Your Honor, I want to be clear about what it is that we're arguing for here today."
2002.02-516,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,812.797,813.925,As far as--
2002.02-516,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,813.925,818.137,--But I think you are arguing that anything except remedies for past discrimination is impermissible.
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,818.137,822.209,"--Your Honor, that is not a conclusion that we need to follow from this Court's decision."
2002.02-516,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,822.209,824.564,"No, I... I think that's your position, is it not?"
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,829.09,831.78,"I would not go that far, Justice Stevens, there may be other reasons."
2002.02-516,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,840.272,843.077,"What about Weber, to take a specific case?"
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,856.602,861.511,"Weber, as I understand it, is a Title VII case, Your Honor and it's not implicated by this decision."
2002.02-516,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,861.511,876.393,"But there's 1981, then... then the person who was attacking it on grounds that it's racially discriminatory just says my lawsuit is under 1981, which it could be as well as Title VII and then what is the result?"
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,876.393,883.806,"Well, it seems to me, Your Honor, that... if the Court could resolve the issue consistent with Title VII, which has remedial--"
2002.02-516,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,883.806,889.323,"If the suit is brought under 1981, the Court can decide what the plaintiff's complaint should be?"
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,889.323,897.566,"--No, no, if this Court decides this case under section 1981, the only interest asserted here at least is an interest in diversity that we are asking to strike down."
2002.02-516,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,903.811,909.422,"But there was no... this is a voluntary affirmative action plan, no admission of prior discrimination."
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,917.266,921.704,"The use of race to exceed nonremedial objectives, I think would have problems, Your Honor."
2002.02-516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,921.704,933.571,"Congress wanted race to be considered by private institutions such as Harvard and what-not, if there's a problem with 1981, or any of the other Federal statutes, they can simply amend it."
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,937.952,939.203,"Yes, that's correct, Justice Scalia."
2002.02-516,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,939.203,949.145,"And all the rest is simply Congress' decision to impose a similar restriction upon private actors, which decision it can change if it wishes."
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,949.145,951.053,"That's my understanding, Your Honor."
2002.02-516,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,951.053,979.803,"Or suppose you say you used the word extraordinary as compelling justification, and the other side says, yes, extraordinary, we're 280 million people, we have large racial diversity within the country, the world is even more diverse, and we think from the point of view of business, the Armed Forces, law, et cetera, that this is an extraordinary need to have diversity among elites throughout the country."
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,1006.619,1010.0,"Your Honor, because there are important constitutional rights at stake."
2002.02-516,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1025.271,1036.407,"So if the University president or the dean told you just what Justice Breyer said, you would tell them there's... and that we have underrepresentation of minorities, you would tell them there's nothing you can do about it?"
2002.02-516,0,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,1036.407,1039.099,"--I would say, Your Honor, that racial preferences are not the answer."
2002.02-516,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1059.358,1060.152,"Very well, Mr. Kolbo."
2002.02-516,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1062.197,1071.508,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-516,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1170.288,1176.307,First the changes were sufficient to convince the district judge that it was on the other side of the constitutional line?
2002.02-516,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1176.307,1187.873,"Notwithstanding the fact that the... the University... we... we respectfully disagree with that conclusion, because the... the University itself admitted that it only changed the mechanics."
2002.02-516,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1189.868,1193.829,"Yes, but isn't... isn't... I mean, mechanics is another word for tailoring."
2002.02-516,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1209.949,1222.954,"--We submit Justice Souter, that the changes which they referred to as mechanics were cosmetics, that ultimately, the system was intended to, and they acknowledge, to produce the same outcome as the prior system."
2002.02-516,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1222.954,1223.461,Yes.
2002.02-516,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1229.233,1231.011,"Correct, Justice Kennedy."
2002.02-516,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1254.175,1259.097,It was the same 20 points given socioeconomic status also had 20 points?
2002.02-516,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1259.097,1260.406,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
2002.02-516,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1260.406,1261.831,"And atlethics, too, I think?"
2002.02-516,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1261.831,1263.961,"Yes, and you couldn't get both."
2002.02-516,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1276.074,1278.089,I thought you got only one 20?
2002.02-516,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1278.089,1278.386,That's correct.
2002.02-516,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1278.386,1279.908,So if you were an athlete you wouldn't get race?
2002.02-516,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1279.908,1281.155,That's correct.
2002.02-516,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1338.036,1353.165,"What do you say to the argument that number one, it's not stigmatizing, because the box study certainly didn't show that it was, and number two, the objective is not to show that there is a correlation between race and one point of view."
2002.02-516,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1369.812,1384.388,"What we're saying is that if you assume that because you are white or you are red or you are brown or you are black, you must have certain experiences and you must have certain viewpoints."
2002.02-516,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1384.388,1391.18,The argument is that you need to have enough of them to demonstrate that the point of view does not always fit just one person.
2002.02-516,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1391.18,1392.443,"Well, but Justice Stevens--"
2002.02-516,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1392.443,1393.827,And that was a finding I think?
2002.02-516,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1393.827,1398.078,--that's a self-contradictory rational that they've come up.
2002.02-516,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1408.641,1432.12,"No that is not... the argument is basically that, look, people who have grown up in America and are black, regardless of race, no, not regardless of race, regardless of socioeconomic background have probably, though not certainly, shared the experience of being subject to certain stereotypical reactions from people throughout their lives."
2002.02-516,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1478.276,1507.103,"--Well, their argument, A, takes several forms, at one point it's that, at one point, it's the need to get more people elite... of different backgrounds, it's a... but what this Court has said that racial preferences, racial stereotyping, which it is, is stigmatizing, it's divisive, it's damaging to the fabric of society, it's damaging to the goal ultimately to eliminate the problems that racial discrimination and racial differences have created."
2002.02-516,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1507.103,1513.919,"General... we're part of a world, and this problem is a global problem."
2002.02-516,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1554.717,1588.984,"I submit, Justice Ginsburg that none of those countries has our history, none of those countries has the Fourteenth Amendment, none of those histories has the history of the statements by this Court which has examined the question over and over again that the ultimate damage that is done by racial preferences is such that if there ever is a situation in which such factors must be used that they must be... race neutral means must be used to accomplish those objective, narrow tailoring must be applied, and this... this... these programs fail all of those tests."
2002.02-516,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1588.984,1602.982,"General Olson, do you know whether any of those countries that Justice Ginsburg referred to that have gone down the road of racial preferences, racial entitlements, have ever gotten rid of racial preferences or racial entitlements?"
2002.02-516,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1602.982,1603.453,There--
2002.02-516,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1603.453,1614.391,Has it been the road to ultimately a color blind society or has it been the road to a society that has percentage entitlements for the various races?
2002.02-516,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1614.391,1627.092,"--Sadly, I believe that that is correct, Justice Scalia, and let me conclude by saying that the Michigan Law School and the University of Michigan ultimately must make a choice."
2002.02-516,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1657.123,1660.117,Is it also forbidden for the United States military academy?
2002.02-516,1,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1660.117,1662.373,It may well be Justice Stevens.
2002.02-516,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1684.151,1685.038,Thank you General Olson.
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,1687.228,1694.196,"Mr. Chief Justice and, may it please the Court:"
2002.02-516,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1740.915,1743.048,Half of the ones who come from Michigan come from Detroit?
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,1743.048,1744.217,Yes.
2002.02-516,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1866.438,1870.791,"Mr. Payton, what is a meaningful number?"
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,1870.791,1873.465,It's what we've been referring to as critical mass.
2002.02-516,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1873.465,1875.25,What is critical mass?
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,1875.25,1882.205,Critical mass is when you have enough of those students so they feel comfortable acting as individuals.
2002.02-516,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1882.205,1883.027,How do you know that?
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,1883.027,1892.16,"I think you know it, because as educators, the educators see it in the students that come before them, they see it on the campus."
2002.02-516,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1892.16,1895.834,Do they... professors at the University of Michigan spend a lot of time with the students?
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,1895.834,1896.796,"Yes, they do."
2002.02-516,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1906.996,1909.397,Do they spend a lot of time with them other than lecturing to them?
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,1909.397,1910.412,--They do.
2002.02-516,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1930.643,1931.501,What do they say?
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,1931.501,1939.437,"They said that given the numbers that have been coming through in the last several years, we are just getting to that critical mass."
2002.02-516,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1959.448,1969.052,"Does Michigan have, as some schools I know have, schools that have affirmative action program, does it have a minority dormitory?"
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,1969.052,1969.625,No.
2002.02-516,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1991.325,2008.215,"I mean, apart from being excluded, if... it is in fact the residential pattern quite mixed and there are no dormitories that are, you know, just as sometimes there is... there is the jocks dormitory, there is really no African American dormitory?"
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2008.215,2013.258,"--The answer is there is no African American dormitory, put it... the full answer is more complex."
2002.02-516,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2090.947,2105.451,"But where we are is, there's an assumption, you may not agree with it, but it's one beginning assumption in this area, that there may not be a quota, every... all of the eloquent things you said could be easily met by a quota."
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2132.515,2138.511,Here's how our system works and I believe it's not a quota at all and I can believe... I can simply explain this.
2002.02-516,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2170.276,2171.032,But none of that matters.
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2171.032,2171.255,Your grades--
2002.02-516,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2171.255,2179.779,"None of that matters if you're minimally qualified and you're one of the minority races that gets the 20 points, you're in, correct?"
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2181.627,2198.469,"--The way it works is that every application comes through and it's read in its entirety, it is evaluated taking all of these factors into account, and then based upon the number that comes off the selection index which can go up to 150, the students are all competing against each other."
2002.02-516,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2223.166,2237.181,"Mr. Payton, in your brief, you say the volume of applications and the presentation of applicant information may get impractical for LSA to use the same admissions system as the much smaller University of Michigan Law School."
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2245.162,2245.632,Yes.
2002.02-516,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2277.153,2284.828,"When you say underrepresented minorities, what comparison are you making to say that it's underrepresented?"
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2284.828,2293.11,"I think we're taking that term as the Federal Government has used it, and the reason Asians aren't included, just to pick up one of the--"
2002.02-516,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2293.11,2295.316,How does the Federal Government use it?
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2295.316,2298.959,"--I think there are three minority groups, you know."
2002.02-516,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2302.178,2304.236,"Well, I think perhaps I could get a more direct answer."
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2311.283,2313.916,I think this is actually a very important point.
2002.02-516,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2316.276,2319.324,Compared to what?
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2319.324,2344.572,"Compared to... we have very small pools of African Americans, for example, that are qualified to the extent that we require students to be qualified to do the work at the University of Michigan and what that means is that if we didn't take race into account, we would not be able to get the numbers of those students, the critical mass, necessary for the educational benefits that we want."
2002.02-516,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2344.572,2344.77,But--
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2344.77,2345.985,That's underrepresented.
2002.02-516,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2345.985,2358.212,"--When you say underrepresented, it sounds like something almost mathematical, that you're saying, we only have a certain percentage of... and we should have this percentage, well, what is this percentage?"
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2358.212,2365.778,It's actually not a percentage at all and it really is driven by the educational benefits that we want from our diverse student body.
2002.02-516,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2372.967,2373.595,What is a sufficient number?
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2373.595,2375.738,--So that when we made our selection--
2002.02-516,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2375.738,2378.53,"I asked you, what is a sufficient number?"
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2378.53,2379.225,--Yes.
2002.02-516,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2379.225,2380.769,An answer... would you answer it?
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2380.769,2390.027,"A sufficient number so that when we made our selections, we were achieving the critical mass of students that we need for the benefits I described."
2002.02-516,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2416.126,2420.451,"Because your standards are so high, you say that there are very few of those who can meet your standards."
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2427.999,2435.82,We do have sufficient numbers in our applicant pool to achieve the critical mass that we're achieving.
2002.02-516,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2437.369,2439.013,"By taking race into account, you can you can do it."
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2439.413,2442.959,"--But we're not taking students that aren't qualified, you are correct about that, Justice Scalia."
2002.02-516,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2442.959,2456.869,"--But just lower your qualification standards, if... if this value of... of having everybody in a mix with people of other races is so significant to you, just lower your qualifications."
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2456.869,2457.901,It is that significant to us.
2002.02-516,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2458.077,2464.155,"You don't have to be the great college you are, you can be a lessor college if that value is important enough to you."
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2464.155,2472.807,"--I think that decision which would say that we have to choose, would be a Hobbesian choice here."
2002.02-516,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2529.441,2533.083,And anything that contradicts that mission is automatically a compelling State interest?
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2533.083,2533.823,No.
2002.02-516,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2556.532,2557.72,Go ahead.
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2558.669,2559.131,--Yes.
2002.02-516,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2559.131,2562.389,I wanted to go back to Justice Kennedy's question.
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2622.474,2623.464,I have two responses.
2002.02-516,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2633.101,2636.719,But remember he has that and gets 20 points for it?
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2636.719,2637.267,Yes.
2002.02-516,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2637.267,2650.663,"And he also is a great athlete and I've constructed this example to make it difficult for you, and... but I mean you see he can only get 20 points, no matter how poor he is."
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2658.79,2659.198,Yes.
2002.02-516,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2659.198,2667.097,"But on individualized consideration, the black student might lose, if there were the individualized consideration."
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2667.097,2667.643,"Well, he might--"
2002.02-516,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2667.643,2670.484,And that's... and that's what you're giving him.
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2673.497,2676.086,--The answer is we value both of those aspects of diversity.
2002.02-516,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2684.864,2687.936,What you're saying is that race is individualized consideration?
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2687.936,2689.581,I'm saying that each student--
2002.02-516,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2689.581,2694.872,Otherwise you're saying that only in the hypothetical given that only the white student receives individualized consideration?
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2694.872,2695.242,"--No, no."
2002.02-516,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2695.892,2696.927,Some are more equal than others?
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2696.927,2698.935,--They both receive individualized consideration.
2002.02-516,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2708.076,2741.214,"If in those circumstances, because we have the white student who is both a good athlete and also very poor, and the other student, the minority is not, could that be sent to the... the individual... could that be sent to the review committee and the review committee would say, well, we have a special circumstance here, and even though the points tie, nonetheless when we look at it carefully, we see that the white student has these extra pluses, despite the points, we let in the white student?"
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2741.214,2751.765,--The admissions review committee... about 70 percent of the applications that it reviews in any given year are white student applications that are sent to it.
2002.02-516,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2757.139,2759.279,So they can ignore the points?
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2759.279,2763.131,They can... actually once it goes to them they simply look at the application and make a judgment.
2002.02-516,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2763.131,2764.707,So I want a clear answer to this.
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2770.25,2770.795,It does.
2002.02-516,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2770.795,2771.653,Yes.
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2772.509,2772.735,The answer is yes.
2002.02-516,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2772.735,2773.266,Okay.
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2773.266,2789.59,"And it does. In Bakke, where Justice Powell says that he could look at one example of an admissions policy and he discusses briefly the Harvard plan and then he has a long quote from it, there is the footnote 50 that Ms. Mahoney mentioned."
2002.02-516,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2819.693,2823.147,"Mr. Payton, it's easy to say they can ignore the points."
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2840.811,2844.734,"I don't know, Justice Scalia."
2002.02-516,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2844.734,2849.703,"It's important, I mean, to say theoretically, it's fine, yes, theoretically, you can reject it."
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2859.422,2860.045,Actually--
2002.02-516,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2860.045,2861.905,"Now, do you assert that that is false?"
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2861.905,2864.665,--That is not correctly describing what happens.
2002.02-516,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2904.651,2909.266,So there are some qualified minorities who get the 20 points and who are rejected?
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2909.266,2920.198,"I believe that is the case, all the record says in this is that virtually all of the minority students, as a result of the policy ended up being admitted."
2002.02-516,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2929.499,2940.886,"But the design is to admit a higher percentage of the qualified minority applicants that you get, given the numbers that there are today, because if you do that you won't get your mix?"
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2940.886,2961.938,"The design is to make sure we get to the critical mass of the meaningful numbers and given the small pool size we have, the way it operates is as you just described, but that's the way it operates, the design is to make sure we get the critical mass of students that are, in fact, necessary for the educational benefits that we are asserting here."
2002.02-516,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2961.938,2970.855,Has anyone at Michigan ever defined critical mass as being anything more specific than something beyond token numbers?
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,2970.855,2999.907,"I think that the reason I referenced the two expert reports by Professor Raudenbush and Professor Gurin is to try to see this... those two reports try to put this in sort of an everyday example, you know, students don't interact with the student body as a whole, they interact in small settings and it's to see if you see what our minority student population is how that would distribute into these small settings."
2002.02-516,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3012.459,3021.217,"But in the criteria used by the admissions committee, did anyone put a percentage figure or a specific number--"
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,3021.217,3021.865,No.
2002.02-516,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3021.865,3026.488,--beyond the concept you've got to get more than just token representation?
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,3026.488,3026.849,No.
2002.02-516,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3028.637,3038.115,"Mr. Payton, do you know the origin of critical mass that is being spoken of here as though it were something that were invented?"
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,3074.187,3080.988,"--It does, and I think you described it exactly as how it has come about with respect to diversity and critical mass."
2002.02-516,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3101.161,3111.95,"In the law school context, there was testimony, I think from one of the admissions officers that said 5 percent is too few, 10 percent might suffice."
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,3125.367,3134.555,"I think that in all of this, you know, there's a false precision here that everybody wants, which is tell me exactly what this is, and I don't think it exactly works like that."
2002.02-516,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3173.172,3180.075,"Mr. Payton, let me ask Justice O'Connor's question, when does all of this come to an end?"
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,3180.075,3188.051,I think that we all certainly expect it to come to an end.
2002.02-516,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3247.115,3258.245,Suppose the Court were to say that the 20-point system and the law school system looked just too much like a quota and that quotas are impermissible?
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,3275.51,3282.591,I guess I'm not sure what the more individualized assessment would be here.
2002.02-516,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3393.859,3404.834,"Mr. Payton, do you think that your admissions standards overall at least provide some headwind to the efforts that you're taking about?"
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,3404.834,3406.473,"Yes, I do."
2002.02-516,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3419.795,3421.365,You may have misunderstood me.
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,3458.651,3460.17,I think that--
2002.02-516,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3460.17,3465.902,"Now, I know you don't want to make the choice, but will you at least acknowledge that there is a tension?"
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,3465.902,3487.642,"--I think, you know, some of our other schools, the nonselective schools, actually some can end up with completely undiverse populations as well; that the fact that a school does not have selectivity doesn't mean that the community college, in fact, is diverse."
2002.02-516,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3498.255,3504.892,"Now... about 10 terms ago, we had the University of Mississippi higher ed. case in here--"
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,3504.892,3505.198,Yes.
2002.02-516,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3505.198,3515.505,"--and the argument was made that the historically... the HBCs, the historically black colleges provided a different benefit to minorities."
2002.02-516,2,32309,john_payton,,3521.127,3522.067,Yes.
2002.02-516,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3530.378,3531.409,"Thank you, Mr. Payton."
2002.02-516,3,33878,kirk_o_kolbo,,3536.596,3551.349,"With respect to the point system, Counsel has made it sound as if it's sort of a fortuity that the University of Michigan has an admissions system that ends up admitting... admitting virtually all minority students."
2002.02-516,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3738.693,3739.865,Thank you Mr. Kolbo.
