1986.85-1772,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.772,"We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 85-1772, Utah Division of Lands against the United States, et al.--"
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,12.308,16.843,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1772,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,46.129,47.814,Is Provo on the lake?
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,47.814,55.051,"Yes, not right adjacent, but within a few miles, Your Honor."
1986.85-1772,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,257.615,266.721,"Mr. Jensen, do you think the public exigency requirement is anything more than a congressional policy?"
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,270.505,286.384,"I do, Your Honor, in the sense that in order to defeat state title, an exigency must be... must exist."
1986.85-1772,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,287.701,303.846,"Well, I would have thought, perhaps, the only thing the Constitution, itself, would require is a public purpose appropriate to the territory for the Federal Government to retain land as against the State."
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,303.846,305.763,--No.
1986.85-1772,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,322.872,328.109,"Where do you find that in the Constitution, the public exigency requirement?"
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,328.109,331.561,"--It is not in the Constitution, itself."
1986.85-1772,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,363.515,371.871,Do you think there is any difference at all when the Federal Government wants to keep it for itself as opposed to conveying it to a third party?
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,371.871,373.907,"Yes, I do, Your Honor."
1986.85-1772,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,409.628,421.119,"So, in your view, there is no mechanism by which the Federal Government could retain land that, otherwise, would pass to the States under the equal footing doctrine."
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,421.119,427.089,"Not as we interpret this Court's decisions, there must be a conveyance."
1986.85-1772,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,433.426,441.365,"Have we ever had an occasion to address the situation before, if when the Federal Government wants to keep something for itself?"
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,441.365,444.967,--We think the Court has.
1986.85-1772,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,492.798,499.036,"But General Jensen, all three of those cases involved the question of whether a conveyance to a third party was valid."
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,507.272,516.98,"It certainly was not nearly as direct as it is here, Your Honor."
1986.85-1772,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,516.98,518.397,"Well, it's a different situation."
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,557.689,559.289,"We... we think not, Your Honor."
1986.85-1772,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,559.289,559.639,You think not?
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,559.639,560.572,That they could not.
1986.85-1772,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,560.572,562.574,But there's... you have no authority for that proposition?
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,562.574,563.041,No.
1986.85-1772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,569.83,572.699,"That's a real problem for D.C. statehood then, isn't it?"
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,594.926,595.176,--That's right.
1986.85-1772,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,595.176,597.859,Which... that's what the equal footing doctrine--
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,597.859,598.076,Right.
1986.85-1772,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,598.076,599.578,"--applies to, not to lands--"
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,599.578,599.911,That's right.
1986.85-1772,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,599.911,600.394,--In general.
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,600.394,602.58,We're not... we're not reaching other public lands.
1986.85-1772,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,608.666,621.474,"But the question is whether, say they have a naval base an the Anacostia River or something like that, could the United States reserve title to the Anacostia River, if it created a State for the D.C., assuming the river is within the boundary of the District."
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,622.243,622.709,--No.
1986.85-1772,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,623.625,623.959,It could not?
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,623.959,624.942,It could not do that.
1986.85-1772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,639.902,657.262,"Would reserving sovereignty, as opposed to just title over the bed of a navigable river be any different from reserving sovereignty over any other chunk of land as far as the equal footing doctrine is concerned in principle."
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,662.648,662.981,Well--
1986.85-1772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,662.981,665.267,--I don't understand what's magic about the bed of a river--
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,665.267,665.467,--Okay.
1986.85-1772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,666.469,668.119,"--as opposed to the Capitol, for example."
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,668.119,695.137,"--The Court in Montana stated that the reason, at least one reason, is that because the control of property underlying navigable waters is so strongly identified with sovereign power of government, then it will only be held that it will be conveyed for the exigency situation."
1986.85-1772,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,710.848,729.21,"But General Jensen, supposing we go back to the beginning and ask what, say Massachusetts joining the Union, and supposing one of the beds of the river had been conveyed by a monarch, an English monarch before when they set up the Colony, would he have had to do it for any special reason or maybe just gave it to a friend because he wanted to give him a little patronage?"
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,731.326,746.421,"The... as we understand the law there, those lands were held in trust for the public for public purposes: navigation, boating, fishing, and related type uses."
1986.85-1772,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,757.193,758.728,--The lands in the Colonies were?
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,758.728,759.062,That's right.
1986.85-1772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,793.616,801.222,But we have allowed it to be defeated in one instance?
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,801.222,802.005,Yes.
1986.85-1772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,802.788,804.424,And what makes that different?
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,804.424,833.443,"--In the Choctaw case, the Court concluded that there had, in fact, been a conveyance for the benefit of a third party, namely the Indian tribe, not just a reservation, but the tribe ended up with a title interest in the property, and, likewise, concluded that in that circumstance, there was a exigency that needed to be satisfied."
1986.85-1772,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,833.443,839.763,Now why does that have anything to do with the... with the rationale for the constitutional prohibition that you just described?
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,858.225,891.879,"The... the reason is, again as we see it, simply goes back to the constitutional nature of the doctrine: that the State is entitled to it as part of its sovereignty; that the opportunity to defeat that should be very narrow and very limited."
1986.85-1772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1003.849,1008.218,"Well, the... there... the... there was designation of Utah Lake, wasn't there?"
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,1008.218,1008.968,Yes.
1986.85-1772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1012.003,1014.669,"No, I understand, but there was a designation?"
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,1014.669,1015.038,Yes.
1986.85-1772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1020.59,1024.06,"Well, what does the Act say, and when did the Act say that it would be reserved?"
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,1028.529,1031.064,--The Act states that
1986.85-1772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1039.319,1039.685,When?
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,1039.685,1045.557,That's... I assume that when the designation is made that it is then reserved.
1986.85-1772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1045.557,1047.207,"Well, how do they make the designation?"
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,1048.092,1048.975,It doesn't say.
1986.85-1772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1048.975,1051.711,"Well, was there later congressional action?"
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,1051.711,1063.852,"The United States says the Congress later ratified it, but after the U.S.G.S. reserved it by the administrative act."
1986.85-1772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1067.971,1069.606,How do you know they did it?
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,1069.606,1073.125,"We don't think they legally did it, but factually--"
1986.85-1772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1073.125,1074.992,"Well, is there some record that they did it?"
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,1074.992,1076.659,"--Yes, there is."
1986.85-1772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1076.659,1077.361,Have you ever seen it?
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,1077.361,1079.694,"It's in the Joint Appendix, yes."
1986.85-1772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1080.396,1084.515,They just got it in their own files; is that it?
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,1084.515,1084.898,--No.
1986.85-1772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1098.358,1100.408,"Well, what about the claimed later--"
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,1100.408,1100.827,Okay.
1986.85-1772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1143.304,1146.006,--And don't you think that Congress knew which ones had been designated?
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,1146.006,1146.189,No.
1986.85-1772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1175.358,1181.06,"This is your alternative argument because under your first argument, it wouldn't make any difference if Congress had--"
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,1181.06,1181.262,--No.
1986.85-1772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1181.895,1185.047,--It had specifically purported to reserve it?
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,1185.047,1185.347,--That's right.
1986.85-1772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1195.736,1197.787,But you say there wasn't really a reservation anyway?
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,1197.787,1198.287,--That's right.
1986.85-1772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1201.323,1205.043,Doesn't make it clear enough?
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,1205.043,1217.851,--Doesn't make it clear enough; that we're entitled to more; that we ought to have... we ought to know when those sovereign entitlements are defeated; and that this three-step process the United States argues is not enough to do that.
1986.85-1772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1300.672,1312.48,"Well, did the Statehood Act indicate that the State wasn't going to get any title... any title to lands that had been reserved by the Federal Government?"
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,1312.48,1333.076,"There is some language in Utah's Enabling Act dealing with Federal reservations, Your Honor, that... there's nothing in there that addresses--"
1986.85-1772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1333.076,1333.843,"Well, what does it say?"
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,1333.843,1335.678,--I--
1986.85-1772,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1335.678,1337.328,"Well, that's all right."
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,1337.328,1338.578,--I apologize.
1986.85-1772,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1339.194,1347.767,"Well, Counsel, doesn't it say in the Utah Enabling Act that it excepts out other reservations of any character?"
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,1350.719,1352.921,"--That is essentially what it is, Your Honor."
1986.85-1772,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1352.921,1355.456,And the Government argues this is a reservation?
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,1355.456,1372.131,"That is... that is true, but again, I think that addressed the typical type reservation, the Indian reservation, the military reservation."
1986.85-1772,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1485.304,1488.339,"May I ask you another question, Mr. Jensen?"
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,1512.622,1514.756,"--No, not in our view, Your Honor."
1986.85-1772,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1514.756,1515.672,They could not have done that?
1986.85-1772,0,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,1515.672,1517.406,They could not have done that because of the trust.
1986.85-1772,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1519.708,1522.826,"Thank you, Mr. Jensen."
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1524.278,1533.401,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-1772,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1588.554,1598.743,You say that this was responding to... to the concern that the irrigation needs of the area would not be met.
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1611.216,1619.12,"Well, there was... the general concern was that there would... that there would be impediments to development of reservoir sites for reclamation."
1986.85-1772,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1620.203,1625.024,Because of the homestead laws that allowed people to acquire... to acquire land; right?
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1625.024,1626.607,"--Well, not... not necessarily, not necessarily."
1986.85-1772,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1669.934,1670.517,"Now, wait."
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1677.171,1677.687,"No, but--"
1986.85-1772,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1677.687,1679.437,So why do you care if people settle it?
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1679.437,1694.596,"--Well, we describe in our... in our brief in this case that even though the lake was to be lowered for its average or normal level, there would be flood periods during which the level of the lake would rise, not only to its average level, but would rise above that."
1986.85-1772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1727.085,1730.87,But the lowering of the level of the lake and raising were to be accomplished by dams?
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1730.87,1731.437,--Yes.
1986.85-1772,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1758.604,1761.389,Would the lake ever be completely empty?
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1761.389,1762.889,"No, the lake would never be--"
1986.85-1772,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1762.889,1765.091,So you wouldn't have had to reserve the whole thing for that purpose.
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1765.091,1765.924,"--Well, but it--"
1986.85-1772,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1765.924,1766.424,"--You'd just, at least,--"
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1766.424,1772.428,"--Well, at the time... at the time that the... at the time the Act was passed, Congress was acting against an urgent situation."
1986.85-1772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1806.966,1813.036,--But no particular reservoir site was withdrawn by the Act of Congress.
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1815.536,1825.177,"--Well, Congress could not practicably identify each potential reservoir site in the West, and, therefore, if relied on the Geological Survey to identify the sites for it."
1986.85-1772,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1825.177,1832.247,What about... what about settlers who occupied some later designated sites after the Statute was passed but before the designation?
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1832.247,1841.853,"Those entries were invalid, and that was the interpretation of the Act given by the Attorney General, given by the implementing instructions of the... of the General Land Office."
1986.85-1772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1866.171,1879.228,"Is it your position, Mr. Kneedler, that the Government doesn't need any particular reason to reserve land in the territory, that if it wants to reserve it, that's... that's its privilege?"
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1879.228,1881.846,--We have not gone to that extent.
1986.85-1772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1906.129,1918.619,"Well, supposing that when Minnesota was admitted to the Union, the United States decided that it probably had some good use for the bed of the Mississippi River as it flowed through Minnesota, and so it reserved that bed."
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1923.154,1927.891,"Well, it would... it would... I think it... there has to be a specific federal purpose for it."
1986.85-1772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1961.696,1962.112,Well--
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1962.112,1962.279,--as a State.
1986.85-1772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1962.279,1965.231,--Now Pollard's Lessee says a lot more than that.
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1985.109,1985.642,Yes.
1986.85-1772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2055.319,2057.371,--But it could be... it's done by condemnation.
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2057.371,2058.822,--It's done... it's done by condemnation.
1986.85-1772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2081.904,2090.342,"So the United States could then, if it felt it had a use for the land under the Mississippi River in Minnesota, reserve that at the time of statehood?"
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2090.342,2090.542,Yes.
1986.85-1772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2099.898,2104.183,"But if it wants to grow hydroponic vegetables in the Mississippi River, it can do that?"
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2104.183,2111.02,"Well, yes, assuming that what... assuming that that or anything else would be within the scope of Congress's... Congress's enumerated powers."
1986.85-1772,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2148.812,2154.798,"Mr. Kneedler, how do you distinguish an Indian reservation, reservation of lands to be used by Indians for federal purposes?"
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2154.798,2156.067,"Well, that is something of a hybrid."
1986.85-1772,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2161.971,2168.042,You reserve for the Indian uses just as you reserved in this case for reservoir uses--
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2168.042,2168.408,--That's right.
1986.85-1772,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2168.408,2174.895,"--and in one case, you would concede that that reservation wouldn't defeat the State's title since Montana holds that, I guess."
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2174.895,2175.062,"No, no."
1986.85-1772,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2183.816,2185.451,That there was no conveyance to the Indians.
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2189.036,2190.587,But there was never a reservation--
1986.85-1772,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2190.587,2191.537,"And nevertheless, the title was in the State."
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2193.273,2201.443,"--The way the Court described it in Montana the same way that it described it in Holt State Bank, that there was a reservation in a general sort of way--"
1986.85-1772,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2201.443,2202.026,--Right.
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2202.026,2205.895,--to allow the Indians to continue to occupy the land that they had always occupied.
1986.85-1772,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2231.295,2236.164,The key to your case is a specific identification of the bed of the lake as having been reserved?
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2236.164,2236.497,Yes.
1986.85-1772,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2249.721,2253.173,"Well, it's clear only after John Wesley Powell's designation; right?"
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2262.378,2267.516,"Well, as... as a suitable... as a suitable reservoir site, I may... I may well have."
1986.85-1772,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2276.038,2277.99,"Well, let's say I find it less than clear."
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2284.811,2286.111,That is--
1986.85-1772,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2286.111,2296.452,"Unless you're absolutely... unless there's been a court test, and you know that he hasn't gone beyond the... what are appropriate reservoir sites?"
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2296.452,2304.189,"--Well, the... this... this is a standard problem of delegation is, is John Wesley Powell's selection within the scope of the statutory--"
1986.85-1772,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2304.189,2304.557,"Well, that's right."
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2367.01,2369.296,--Do you mean more in the nature of specificity?
1986.85-1772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2369.296,2369.629,Yes.
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2369.629,2370.496,"Well, here, I think--"
1986.85-1772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2370.496,2373.181,"The Congress, itself, has to take a look at it and say,"
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2380.104,2380.27,--Well--
1986.85-1772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2380.27,2381.954,"It, otherwise, would go to the State."
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2381.954,2386.258,"--Well, assuming that that is necessary, I think that is met here by virtue of the subsequent actions."
1986.85-1772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2421.597,2428.001,"How many other sites were selected while that act was in effect, and in how many States?"
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2428.001,2431.87,--The Interior Department does not have complete figures on this.
1986.85-1772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2453.7,2455.485,And in how many States?
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2455.485,2456.902,I think it was five.
1986.85-1772,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2476.149,2481.97,What about those other designations that we don't know even about that are floating out there in Land Offices somewhere?
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2486.838,2491.991,--They were reserved if... whatever was designated--
1986.85-1772,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2491.991,2508.001,Suppose... suppose we have another case that comes up involving one of those other sites that you don't even know about yet that's out there in some Land Office; has that been designated specifically enough by Congress to... to overcome the usual application of the... the equal footing doctrine?
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2508.001,2522.094,"--Well, the primary source for what was designated, and there could have been others, but if we confine it to the category that... that the Geological Survey selected and formally reported to Congress, that is a matter of public record, not just in the Land Office."
1986.85-1772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2638.145,2644.116,"Well then, if there some sites that are unknown, it was selections after that Report was filed?"
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2644.116,2645.116,There might have been some.
1986.85-1772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2650.936,2651.753,Up until that date?
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2651.753,2652.62,Up until 1890.
1986.85-1772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2657.84,2658.824,When was the Act repealed?
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2658.824,2664.978,--The Act... the authorization for selection of arid lands was repealed in 1890.
1986.85-1772,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2722.711,2723.461,"Mr. Kneedler, may we ask you."
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2746.41,2756.932,"Well, that was one of the specific purposes underlying the 1888 Act, was to put the Federal Government in a position where it was going to have to condemn land in order to carry out the Reclamation Project."
1986.85-1772,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2765.454,2771.358,"Well, all that goes to that's why you needed the reservation and needed to be able... needed to be able to keep settlers off."
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2784.183,2790.07,"Well, in this case, it's important to distinguish the powers of the United States after statehood and prior to statehood."
1986.85-1772,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2790.07,2790.37,I understand.
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2790.37,2793.456,"But there's no doubt that after statehood, it could condemn the land if it had passed to the State."
1986.85-1772,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2796.658,2797.074,Correct.
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2797.074,2797.974,--at the time that this--
1986.85-1772,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2797.974,2806.614,"And what I'm asking is, supposing it did pass to the State, how would that defeat the program that motivated the reservation in the first place?"
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2806.614,2809.632,"--Well, Congress could acquire the land."
1986.85-1772,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2813.584,2815.084,"Well, but why is it different from an Indian reservation?"
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2840.901,2843.034,They might be able... they might be able to build a project.
1986.85-1772,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2848.338,2850.257,"Well, they wanted to prevent other people... well, I'm sorry."
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2850.257,2852.542,--It didn't know quite how it was going to develop these lands.
1986.85-1772,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2878.24,2891.0,"Maybe... maybe I'm very dense here, but I still don't understand why if they want to keep private development out of the lake, why can't they do that, notwithstanding the fact that the title to the bed of the lake might be in the State?"
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2892.45,2895.485,Private development... there could be two problems.
1986.85-1772,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2899.103,2911.245,"--But they don't... all they want to do is do is prevent private owners from developing the land, and their power over the navigable lake is sufficient to enable them to do that even though the State owns the bed of the lake."
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2911.245,2912.695,"Well, it may not have been so clear."
1986.85-1772,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2914.113,2915.047,"Well, it's clear now, isn't it?"
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2915.047,2926.354,--I think it is... I think it is clear now under the Marsh case that was cited in the... that we cite in our brief where the Tenth Circuit sustained the power of the Corps of Engineers to regulate dredge and fill operations.
1986.85-1772,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2940.347,2943.966,Just like the conveying away the bed of a river on an Indian reservation.
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2952.838,2953.272,--It may be.
1986.85-1772,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3017.395,3026.417,"Well, Mr. Kneedler, in most instances, wouldn't the Federal Government in any event retain its navigation servitude?"
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3026.417,3037.725,"It would retain its navigation servitude, but I... but that... it's not clear how far that would go with respect to the operation of a reclamation project."
1986.85-1772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3063.59,3071.112,"Your suggestion is that for the Government's navigational servitude to apply, the navigable water has to move from one State to another?"
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3071.112,3072.046,"--Well, it depends."
1986.85-1772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3217.922,3233.116,"Mr. Kneedler, I suppose... I suppose that normally when there's a reservation from the public domain, it really just is withdrawing it from settlement or development or withdraws it from the operation of the Homestead Act--"
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3233.116,3236.836,"--Well, there can be... there can be withdrawals; there can be reservations."
1986.85-1772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3245.589,3260.432,"--Well, how do we know... how do we know that the reservation that was... that Congress authorized here was meant to be a reservation as against the equal footing doctrine... as against State claims, to withdraw it from the operation of the equal footing doctrine--"
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3260.432,3261.432,Because--
1986.85-1772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3261.432,3265.217,--Rather than just what the normal meaning of reservation would be?
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3265.217,3273.204,"--As I was explaining to Justice Stevens, I think the purposes of the Act require that it be applied to the... it's a lot like Block versus North Dakota in this sense."
1986.85-1772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3279.608,3283.643,So State ownership of the lake bottom might be inconsistent with this development--
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3283.643,3283.843,Yes.
1986.85-1772,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3283.843,3285.428,--as a reclamation project?
1986.85-1772,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3285.428,3286.412,That's correct.
1986.85-1772,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3332.409,3334.159,"Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
1986.85-1772,2,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,3336.445,3339.747,"A few brief remarks, Your Honor."
1986.85-1772,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3390.912,3393.031,Are you saying the... it was already being reserved?
1986.85-1772,2,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,3393.031,3394.297,"Well, yes."
1986.85-1772,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3395.314,3397.983,And this reservation couldn't possibly have applied to Utah Lake?
1986.85-1772,2,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,3397.983,3398.516,--That's right.
1986.85-1772,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3398.516,3401.185,And so it's no reservation at all?
1986.85-1772,2,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,3401.185,3407.189,"Well, that's right as it purports to withdraw the bed, or reserve the bed to the Federal Government."
1986.85-1772,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3408.541,3410.457,I don't understand that.
1986.85-1772,2,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,3412.493,3412.725,Okay.
1986.85-1772,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3494.979,3503.752,"But then the United States says that after that, it was... it was taken out of the trust essentially by the... by the United States itself."
1986.85-1772,2,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,3503.752,3504.052,That's right.
1986.85-1772,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3505.668,3511.941,"Mr. Jensen, do you take the position that the State could convey good title to land within the boundary?"
1986.85-1772,2,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,3511.941,3516.643,--To a limited extent.
1986.85-1772,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3528.165,3531.134,Could you sell it to somebody who wanted to dig a mine on it specifically?
1986.85-1772,2,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,3531.134,3532.403,--I question that.
1986.85-1772,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3533.703,3545.126,"Well, in some States... some States have given to the landowners on each side of the... of the navigable river title to the riverbed that they got under the equal footing doctrine."
1986.85-1772,2,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,3545.126,3548.428,--And some of them are being sued over it.
1986.85-1772,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3554.316,3555.749,Or oil lease?
1986.85-1772,2,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,3555.749,3569.073,"--and if it doesn't impair the public trust, but we could not just turn around and sell the bed of Utah Lake willy-nilly just to, you know, refurbish the State coffers."
1986.85-1772,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3571.166,3573.146,Because of the federal reservation?
1986.85-1772,2,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,3573.146,3576.73,"No, because of the... that the State holds it in trust, not because of--"
1986.85-1772,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3576.73,3579.872,"Oh, I see, you're... because of your own trust obligation?"
1986.85-1772,2,21058,dallin_w_jensen,,3579.872,3583.074,"--Our own trust, and maybe we've made that a little confusing."
1986.85-1772,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3628.121,3629.223,"Thank you, Mr. Jensen."
