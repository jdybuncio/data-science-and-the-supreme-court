1988.87-1865,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.122,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 87-1865, Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation v. Ticktin."
1988.87-1865,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,13.224,16.61,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.87-1865,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,60.639,67.025,"Mr. Taranto, do I understand that a new statute has been introduced that would abolish FSLIC?"
1988.87-1865,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,67.025,68.91,"Yes, a new bill has been introduced."
1988.87-1865,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,85.07,89.808,"Were it to be enacted, though, that would end this case, would it not?"
1988.87-1865,0,40639,richard_g_taranto,,89.808,91.843,--It... it may well end this case.
1988.87-1865,1,31220,james_b_koch,,1464.934,1467.969,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.87-1865,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1602.822,1611.262,"Well, Mr. Koch, how do you explain the existence of Subsection A then where they say FSLIC shall be deemed to be an agency of the United States?"
1988.87-1865,1,31220,james_b_koch,,1615.982,1619.183,That... I would explain it as follows.
1988.87-1865,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1662.027,1667.598,Section A was added after the rest of 1730(k)(1) was in place?
1988.87-1865,1,31220,james_b_koch,,1667.598,1683.126,"Section A was added in 1966 to clarify that... that FSLIC was an agency, and that was the... under the Financial Institution Supervisory Act which amended both 1819 and drafted 1730(k)(1)."
1988.87-1865,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1683.126,1688.512,"Well, but once you provide that the FSLIC is an agency, why doesn't 1345 kick in?"
1988.87-1865,1,31220,james_b_koch,,1688.512,1691.982,"Thirteen forty-five begins with the phrase ""except as otherwise provided""."
1988.87-1865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1712.526,1714.811,"Well, that's not so."
1988.87-1865,1,31220,james_b_koch,,1724.251,1725.334,That's correct.
1988.87-1865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1725.334,1727.203,"--So, why do you say it would have no effect whatsoever?"
1988.87-1865,1,31220,james_b_koch,,1727.203,1737.76,"Well, on those suits brought against... where the FSLIC came in as a receiver and went after debtors, presumably if... if 1345 jurisdiction overrode that proviso--"
1988.87-1865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1737.76,1740.962,"It wouldn't have effect in those suits, but it would have effect in other suits, wouldn't it?"
1988.87-1865,1,31220,james_b_koch,,1740.962,1742.578,"--Yes, that's... I agree."
1988.87-1865,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1742.578,1747.116,"It would also... It, wouldn't require the receiver to go into Federal court."
1988.87-1865,1,31220,james_b_koch,,1751.484,1752.118,That's true.
1988.87-1865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1783.705,1788.776,"Mr. Koch, you said the purpose of adding A was to clarify that FSLIC was a Federal agency."
1988.87-1865,1,31220,james_b_koch,,1808.405,1808.923,But it--
1988.87-1865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1808.923,1810.423,Why was it clarified?
1988.87-1865,1,31220,james_b_koch,,1813.824,1827.751,--I believe it was clarified... and the Congressional Code bears this out... that... to make clear that the corporation is an agency of the United States because at that time in the Acron case there was a dispute in the Ninth Circuit whether or not it was an agency so they could have access to the Federal courts.
1988.87-1865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1827.751,1831.353,"Well, yes, but I mean disputes don't arise in the abstract, two people saying I am agency."
1988.87-1865,1,31220,james_b_koch,,1835.84,1836.207,Well--
1988.87-1865,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1836.207,1837.24,Unless something hinges upon it.
1988.87-1865,1,31220,james_b_koch,,1839.542,1840.542,--I agree.
1988.87-1865,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1840.542,1844.363,"And that's what hinged on it in the Ninth Circuit case, isn't it?"
1988.87-1865,1,31220,james_b_koch,,1845.68,1846.48,It was.
1988.87-1865,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1846.48,1850.617,"And so, Congress resolved that by saying there shall be jurisdiction in such a case."
1988.87-1865,1,31220,james_b_koch,,1850.617,1851.583,It did.
1988.87-1865,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1895.045,1906.786,"Well, you wouldn't... you don't... you don't say that the proviso keeps out of Federal court suits by... by the agency asserting a Federal law claim."
1988.87-1865,1,31220,james_b_koch,,1906.786,1916.392,"If there was a... a Federal law claim that predominated or was the cause of action in the suit, no, I would submit that that would be exactly what the proviso and this statute had in mind."
1988.87-1865,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1920.863,1928.934,You... you say... there is just no bona fide Federal claim in this case you say?
1988.87-1865,1,31220,james_b_koch,,1928.934,1930.552,I think that anytime that FSLIC comes--
1988.87-1865,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1930.552,1933.52,But that isn't the way I understood the United States.
1988.87-1865,1,31220,james_b_koch,,1933.52,1934.82,"--Well, I would... I would disagree."
1988.87-1865,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1957.853,1967.575,"Assuming that there's a bona fide Federal issue stated in a... in a suit like this and a bona fide state law claim made, you would say you would have to go to different courts."
1988.87-1865,1,31220,james_b_koch,,1967.575,1970.375,"No, I would... I would... what is the cause of action in this suit?"
1988.87-1865,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1975.079,1977.93,And take the state cause of action there too?
1988.87-1865,1,31220,james_b_koch,,1977.93,1979.28,"--No, I think not."
1988.87-1865,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1979.28,1984.017,"So, you would think... have to pursue the claims in separate courts."
1988.87-1865,1,31220,james_b_koch,,1984.017,1990.171,"Well, I think that specifically in this case the cause of action is a breach of fiduciary duty under state law."
1988.87-1865,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2145.356,2146.189,"Thank you, Mr. Koch."
1988.87-1865,2,40639,richard_g_taranto,,2148.122,2149.224,Nothing further.
1988.87-1865,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2149.224,2149.507,Very well.
