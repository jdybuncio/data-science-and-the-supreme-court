2007.07-210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.105,"We'll hear argument next in Case 07-210, Bridge versus Phoenix Bond & Indemnity."
2007.07-210,0,42474,theodore_m_becker,,7.838,15.54,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Both parts of the question presented in this case should be answered ""yes""."
2007.07-210,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,69.61,91.599,"So what about a case, say, you've got organized crime wants to get rid of... an organized crime enterprise wants to get rid of rivals, so it makes misrepresentations about those rivals to customers and suppliers, not to the... to the rival."
2007.07-210,0,42474,theodore_m_becker,,106.422,108.812,"Yes, that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.07-210,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,119.902,123.634,But no civil case in that... in that situation?
2007.07-210,0,42474,theodore_m_becker,,123.634,124.726,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.07-210,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,124.726,129.008,But that doesn't even comport with common-law civil cases.
2007.07-210,0,42474,theodore_m_becker,,163.679,177.361,"Justice Scalia, those cases as well as the Rice versus Manley New York case, the cheese buyer's case, similar situation, do exist, but they are really tortious interference with business expectancy cases."
2007.07-210,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,197.151,204.225,"Suppose in a tortious interference case, the two tort... there are two tort feasors, and they communicate with each other by mail."
2007.07-210,0,42474,theodore_m_becker,,206.585,210.27,It would be a violation of the mail fraud statutes.
2007.07-210,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,226.562,232.013,"In my... in my hypothetical, there was no... there was no reliance on anything said."
2007.07-210,0,42474,theodore_m_becker,,236.494,242.035,"--I think that in criminal mail fraud, reliance is not required, Justice Kennedy."
2007.07-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,298.669,314.489,"Well, isn't... isn't the difference that, in Holmes, it was the textual basis ""by reason of"" through which the... as we read it... the proximate cause standard was... was brought into the statute."
2007.07-210,0,42474,theodore_m_becker,,347.241,361.08,"Well, Justice Souter, of course, in Holmes the Court was looking at the ""injured by reason of"" language and looked to the Clayton Act and looked to the Sherman Act before it, where Congress used precisely the same language."
2007.07-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,385.413,395.91,Why hasn't it done so simply or sufficiently done so by referring to the... in effect... the criminal mail fraud violation?
2007.07-210,0,42474,theodore_m_becker,,395.91,411.403,"--Because in other cases where this Court has looked at the same type of situation, the Neder case, Field versus Mans, for example, where there is not a definition of a term such as fraud, the Court has looked to the common law to define that term."
2007.07-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,411.403,416.196,"Yes, but we didn't have... I don't think we had in those cases the phrase that occurs here."
2007.07-210,0,42474,theodore_m_becker,,429.724,457.569,"Except, Justice Souter, that the... the requirement that there need to be an indictable offense is not enough to make out a civil fraud because criminal law recognizes a... an uncompleted fraud, simply a scheme, where here, if you're talking about a completed fraud, for someone to be injured by reason of a fraud, it has to be completed and someone has had to rely on it."
2007.07-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,457.569,458.041,Okay.
2007.07-210,0,42474,theodore_m_becker,,471.472,474.253,I... we... we believe it does.
2007.07-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,481.765,482.998,You're going to have to help me do that.
2007.07-210,0,42474,theodore_m_becker,,482.998,483.403,--All right.
2007.07-210,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,571.634,572.227,"Well, why--"
2007.07-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,572.227,572.882,"No, but--"
2007.07-210,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,572.882,578.52,--Why isn't it... there is reliance on their allegations by the county.
2007.07-210,0,42474,theodore_m_becker,,595.703,604.074,"Because no representation has been made to the plaintiff, and the plaintiff hasn't relied on the misrepresentation that was made to the county."
2007.07-210,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,604.074,612.649,But without the mail fraud violation... let's assume... the tort would have been unsuccessful.
2007.07-210,0,42474,theodore_m_becker,,613.928,618.085,"Without the misrepresentation to the county, Justice Kennedy?"
2007.07-210,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,618.085,618.428,Yes.
2007.07-210,0,42474,theodore_m_becker,,630.985,634.343,"Well, I think this--"
2007.07-210,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,634.343,638.515,"I mean, refer to the mail... the civil RICO refers to whether it's a mail fraud violation."
2007.07-210,0,42474,theodore_m_becker,,641.763,644.418,"--We think it's necessary, Your Honor."
2007.07-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,678.871,684.446,"--But isn't the problem with your argument that if this isn't direct enough, there is no injury at all?"
2007.07-210,0,42474,theodore_m_becker,,713.187,718.045,"Well, Justice Souter, first, we disagree that the rotational allocation is well pled fact."
2007.07-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,764.963,784.235,"But how could the property owner be hurt if there is... if we are dealing in a situation here in... in which the penalty is zero percent, and everybody is bidding zero percent, then this is a situation in which the property owner isn't going to get hurt no matter who ends up with it."
2007.07-210,0,42474,theodore_m_becker,,784.235,786.907,"Justice Souter, zero percent is by no means guaranteed."
2007.07-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,792.386,793.607,"Yes, but that's the... that's the case here."
2007.07-210,0,42474,theodore_m_becker,,813.486,816.298,"--Including the bidders and the Plaintiffs, Your Honor."
2007.07-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,816.298,816.722,Yeah.
2007.07-210,0,42474,theodore_m_becker,,817.237,821.562,"Well, I think that they certainly could not prove injury as a matter of proof."
2007.07-210,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,834.808,847.52,"Yes, but that's a different point, the point that you made in your reply brief, that maybe there isn't this rotational system, and maybe they can't prove that they were... that they were injured; that they would have gotten a greater share."
2007.07-210,0,42474,theodore_m_becker,,861.594,863.216,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.07-210,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,863.216,875.336,So we have to assume what they say about the rotational system is right and... but... but you are hanging your hat on no misrepresentation was made to them.
2007.07-210,0,42474,theodore_m_becker,,875.336,876.869,"That's correct, Justice."
2007.07-210,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1092.376,1094.157,May I just go back to a statement you made?
2007.07-210,0,42474,theodore_m_becker,,1104.042,1107.884,"--Well, I didn't concede that my client would be indictable for mail fraud."
2007.07-210,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1171.657,1174.638,Is your client still bidding on... on these--
2007.07-210,0,42474,theodore_m_becker,,1174.638,1182.415,"Yes, Justice Souter, and also all of the... al of the plaintiffs... the Respondents are still bidding, which I think is an interesting fact."
2007.07-210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1193.692,1196.082,Are all the shell corporations still bidding?
2007.07-210,0,42474,theodore_m_becker,,1196.082,1210.296,"Mr. Justice... Mr. Chief Justice, if all of them aren't, it's simply because there may be new corporations that are, and they are formed not for the purpose of defrauding anybody, but for tax purposes."
2007.07-210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1216.496,1218.232,"Thank you, Mr. Becker."
2007.07-210,0,42474,theodore_m_becker,,1218.232,1219.823,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.07-210,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1219.823,1227.087,Mr. DeBruin.
2007.07-210,1,20595,david_w_de_bruin,,1227.087,1248.672,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: It is presumed true in this case that Petitioners submitted false affidavits, filled the auction room with related entities, and obtained thousands of liens that would have been awarded to Respondents and other bidders, causing them injury in fact."
2007.07-210,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1302.711,1326.155,"Is... is it your view that assume... assuming there is a State law cause of action for tortuous interference, that if that tortious interference was effected through the use of the mails by the co-tort features, that that automatically invokes the RICO statute?"
2007.07-210,1,20595,david_w_de_bruin,,1326.155,1330.152,"Your Honor, all of the elements of RICO would have to be established."
2007.07-210,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1332.605,1335.822,"That... that there are predicate acts, yes."
2007.07-210,1,20595,david_w_de_bruin,,1335.822,1340.555,"And they would have to form a pattern and all the other requirements that were significant would have to be met, but yes."
2007.07-210,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1378.711,1383.415,"But those... those weren't mailed, or at least that's not what you're relying on."
2007.07-210,1,20595,david_w_de_bruin,,1399.22,1401.096,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.07-210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1445.687,1456.508,"Counsel, what... would your position be different if the county were, in fact, injured; we didn't have the zero-percent situation but different percentages?"
2007.07-210,1,20595,david_w_de_bruin,,1459.459,1479.936,"Mr. Chief Justice, I believe the Court has already addressed that in Anza and has made clear that if in an appropriate case the government had been harmed and was in fact... could be expected to sue, as it was in Anza... in that case the claim was that the defendant had not paid its taxes to the State of New York."
2007.07-210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1487.965,1490.776,"Well, what does that do to your statutory argument?"
2007.07-210,1,20595,david_w_de_bruin,,1496.852,1504.381,"Well, we have to establish predicate acts of mail fraud, but we also have to establish proximate cause."
2007.07-210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1516.392,1520.623,"Well, what happens... what happens if some of the bids were more than zero, and some weren't?"
2007.07-210,1,20595,david_w_de_bruin,,1526.465,1535.411,"Well, the only time that the affidavits and the representations in this case have effect is if all the bids are zero."
2007.07-210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1556.998,1570.74,"Well, but I suppose since we are talking about a rotational rule, you could have... what are these, monthly or annually... one, possibly, cycle where it's all zero percent, and then others where it isn't, and then another where it is."
2007.07-210,1,20595,david_w_de_bruin,,1576.648,1579.02,Not the way the county administers these auctions.
2007.07-210,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1651.101,1656.974,Would you explain why your argument is consistent with Beck versus Prupis?
2007.07-210,1,20595,david_w_de_bruin,,1680.48,1683.744,"Justice Alito, Beck was a completely different case."
2007.07-210,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1717.041,1722.243,"But... well, the meaning of a RICO conspiracy in the criminal context is very well known."
2007.07-210,1,20595,david_w_de_bruin,,1733.334,1735.362,But the Court looked to--
2007.07-210,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1735.362,1743.797,Why is it appropriate there to look to the law of civil conspiracy and yet inappropriate here to look to the law of civil fraud?
2007.07-210,1,20595,david_w_de_bruin,,1743.797,1748.39,"--Well, it looked to conspiracy to make up the elements of the civil cause of action there."
2007.07-210,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1783.138,1785.668,Am I... am I reading these provisions wrong?
2007.07-210,1,20595,david_w_de_bruin,,1795.492,1798.022,1961 is the definitions.
2007.07-210,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1802.725,1803.708,That's the conspiracy provision.
2007.07-210,1,20595,david_w_de_bruin,,1803.708,1806.285,1962(d) is the conspiracy.
2007.07-210,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1811.956,1815.984,I'm looking on page 2 of the Petitioner's brief.
2007.07-210,1,20595,david_w_de_bruin,,1846.064,1850.439,"Your Honor, the citation appears at the bottom of the quote, the way it's set forth on page 2."
2007.07-210,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1850.439,1851.126,All right.
2007.07-210,1,20595,david_w_de_bruin,,1852.643,1856.344,"So if you look at the very first quotation, you'll see where it follows."
2007.07-210,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1856.344,1856.718,"Oh, I see, I see, I see."
2007.07-210,1,20595,david_w_de_bruin,,1857.576,1863.104,"So in this case, we allege both a violation of 1962(c) and (d)."
2007.07-210,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1873.15,1891.673,"No, I understand that, but when the pattern of racketeering activity consists of predicate acts of mail fraud, why isn't... why does not Beck point you to the word RICO statute?"
2007.07-210,1,20595,david_w_de_bruin,,1903.106,1914.227,"--I would say two things: First, what that argument would do would make essentially common-law fraud the predicate act under RICO, when instead it is indictable mail fraud, not common-law fraud."
2007.07-210,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1914.711,1916.084,But you can say the same in Beck.
2007.07-210,1,20595,david_w_de_bruin,,1926.285,1933.203,"--Well, the Court, again, in Beck, was looking to the common-law word ""conspiracy"" to apply it in different contexts."
2007.07-210,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1957.957,1963.72,"Mr. Becker says they were interference with a business relationship, not fraud."
2007.07-210,1,20595,david_w_de_bruin,,1963.72,1969.671,"--Well, under the law of torts as it has evolved, there are different labels that are applied."
2007.07-210,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2006.813,2028.242,"One concern, because RICO can be a very broad statute, is that if you are right, then any unsuccessful bidder could look through a rival's submission, find a false statement, and sue under RICO."
2007.07-210,1,20595,david_w_de_bruin,,2028.242,2033.037,"Your Honor, I believe that is not true for the reasons this Court set forth in Anza."
2007.07-210,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2069.974,2096.121,"Why... why is it... I really worry about adopting a rule which would produce the result that whenever anyone makes a false statement in an official form, someone who is deprived of a business opportunity, or at least can say so, can bring a RICO action."
2007.07-210,1,20595,david_w_de_bruin,,2096.121,2107.147,"Justice Scalia, I would say two things: First of all, I think it's critical to realize that Congress enacted RICO to protect competitors."
2007.07-210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2158.376,2164.716,I suppose that every other bidder in this situation is a viable plaintiff.
2007.07-210,1,20595,david_w_de_bruin,,2164.716,2169.139,"In this case, we don't submit that we are the only potential plaintiffs."
2007.07-210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2205.201,2211.37,"Well, I suppose in other cases where if we adopt the rule you argue for, that wouldn't be confined at all."
2007.07-210,1,20595,david_w_de_bruin,,2220.242,2236.872,"--Well, I think the Court... again, if you look to the Anza case, the Court has made clear that if a RICO defendant takes actions that simply enhance the defendant's own competitive position, which was the allegation in Anza, that that may not be enough to establish proximate cause."
2007.07-210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2253.68,2256.086,Regardless of how many competitors there are?
2007.07-210,1,20595,david_w_de_bruin,,2256.086,2257.849,"Well, yes."
2007.07-210,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2283.089,2295.304,Is it the law generally in the States that an unsuccessful bidder can sue the successful bidder if the successful bidder misstated qualification?
2007.07-210,1,20595,david_w_de_bruin,,2295.304,2313.482,"Justice Kennedy, the common-law rule actually was, I believe, in 27 of 40 States... this unfortunately came up after the briefing... that a disappointed bidder could bring an action at the common law if the allegation was one of fraud in the procurement."
2007.07-210,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2386.08,2387.344,"Thank you, Mr. DeBruin."
2007.07-210,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2395.418,2406.556,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: RICO provides a cause of action to plaintiffs who have suffered injuries by reason of, that is, proximately caused by, a RICO violation."
2007.07-210,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2447.099,2455.468,"What is the answer to Justice Kennedy's question with respect to Federal Government contracts, can disappointed bidders sue in that situation?"
2007.07-210,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2455.468,2460.062,--My understanding is that the case has established that they can.
2007.07-210,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2503.42,2506.372,But what if there are 50 disappointed bidders?
2007.07-210,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2506.372,2516.21,"--Well, it would be the burden of the plaintiff to establish that, but for the fraud, it would have gotten the contract."
2007.07-210,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2523.237,2523.737,Wait.
2007.07-210,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2523.737,2524.457,--is somewhat usual.
2007.07-210,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2524.457,2540.372,Why couldn't you show... why couldn't... that's like the situation where a company runs a... runs a lottery and in fact misrepresents what the odds are.
2007.07-210,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2571.22,2579.075,"No, the participants in the lottery in that case would have a cause of action because they have paid money to the person running the lottery."
2007.07-210,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2579.075,2580.607,That's all they can get?
2007.07-210,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2582.604,2593.693,I think... I think the... the common-law measure of damages would be... would be what they paid in that situation.
2007.07-210,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2684.813,2692.514,"But the RICO statute doesn't say you can recover if you're injured by reason of conspiracy, without any elaboration."
2007.07-210,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2707.15,2717.269,"Well, 1964(c) refers you, as you noted, to 1962, which simply says ""conspiracy""."
2007.07-210,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2754.314,2757.737,"Well, I don't think it's because there's no common-law equivalent."
2007.07-210,2,22857,eric_d_miller,,2795.174,2797.688,No.

2007.07-210,3,42474,theodore_m_becker,,3076.542,3083.179,"--Justice Souter, we respectfully disagree and refer the Court to Field versus Mans, where it was bankruptcy fraud."
2007.07-210,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3101.063,3106.669,"But there was no definition of bankruptcy fraud as a separate definition, was there?"
2007.07-210,3,42474,theodore_m_becker,,3108.732,3111.263,"Not from the statute we don't, Justice Souter."
