2010.10-5258,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.57,"We will hear argument next this morning in Case 10-5258, McNeill v. United States."
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,9.189,11.689,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-5258,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,61.122,82.202,"Counsel, I -- I have just one problem, which is under your theory, I understand it, if a State increases a penalty, makes what would have been a penalty for a misdemeanor now a felony, then that defendant is a career criminal, by your logic."
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,82.202,82.987,--Uh--
2010.10-5258,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,82.987,90.974,So the person who thought that at the time they committed the crime they were committing a low-level crime is now a felon; is that your theory of the case?
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,90.974,107.619,"--If -- if a State were to increase a penalty -- say from originally it was 5 years, increased it to 10 years, the defendant was convicted at a time when it was 5 years -- if the legislature increased the penalty, if the defendant possessed a firearm, yes, he would be facing--"
2010.10-5258,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,107.619,126.581,"What -- what -- what logic do you think there is in that, why Congress would want to punish someone now for -- for criminal activity that they thought was lesser, and the State thought was lesser, at an earlier time, less reprehensible?"
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,126.581,133.65,--Because the purpose of the Armed Career Criminal Act is not to enhance a sentence because of the prior conviction.
2010.10-5258,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,190.689,202.061,"Mr. Gordon, the State does regard it -- it does -- prescribe 10 years for this defendant because it's made a -- made the change not retroactive."
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,222.124,225.826,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, that's correct."
2010.10-5258,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,273.307,276.342,Suppose -- what would happen in this situation?
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,321.888,325.524,"There -- there are two possible answers, Justice Alito."
2010.10-5258,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,380.909,382.044,Mis--
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,382.044,382.961,Yes?
2010.10-5258,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,382.961,388.513,"--Mr. Gordon, is this -- is this essentially an academic question?"
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,430.358,439.798,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, it may be an academic exercise for Mr. McNeill or for the Mr. McNeills of the world."
2010.10-5258,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,507.108,519.583,"Mr. Gordon, there are other provisions in ACCA which seem to use the present tense in circumstances where it doesn't seem as though the statute truly means the present tense."
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,539.211,550.019,"Justice Kagan, I think you would, in this sense: For the violent felony provision, there is a generic offense."
2010.10-5258,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,581.037,590.81,Why is -- why is -- why is the present tense inadequate for the -- for the government's position in this case?
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,618.995,620.411,"--Early '90s, Your Honor."
2010.10-5258,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,621.561,629.017,--What is the maximum punishment for that offense which occurred at that time is the longer period.
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,657.37,660.27,That's correct for Mr. McNeill.
2010.10-5258,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,704.232,710.838,It's not just for the defendant; it's for anybody who committed it prior to the -- prior to the amendment of the statute.
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,710.838,713.121,That's correct.
2010.10-5258,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,713.121,716.825,"Anybody that committed it then, the -- the -- it is an offense"
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,733.351,738.322,It is prescribed only if you take the offense out of the category of a generic offense.
2010.10-5258,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,787.588,788.238,What if the State--
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,788.238,788.771,"--Yes, sir."
2010.10-5258,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,788.771,791.873,--What if the State change is to abolish the offense altogether?
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,800.729,803.264,"Your Honor, yes."
2010.10-5258,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,833.884,834.2,Excuse me.
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,834.736,835.186,--Yes?
2010.10-5258,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,835.186,835.469,--That's correct?
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,855.931,858.898,"Only for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act, yes."
2010.10-5258,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,899.641,905.045,"Well, but it strikes me that there's really no change in the State view of how serious it is."
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,926.209,929.844,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, arguably yes."
2010.10-5258,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,943.502,963.166,Are we looking at it because we want the States to determine the Federal sentence or are we looking at it because we evaluate the evil of the particular defendant on the basis of how -- how much of a crime he was willing to commit?
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,1022.354,1032.043,"Justice Scalia, if -- if that were indeed what Congress wanted, then it would have written the statute differently."
2010.10-5258,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1052.706,1055.908,"I agree, it does refer to the seriousness of the offense."
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,1070.851,1075.739,"Justice Scalia, respectfully, I -- I don't agree with that."
2010.10-5258,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1077.441,1079.074,"That's the issue, though, really."
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,1079.074,1081.893,"--That is an issue, yes, Justice Scalia."
2010.10-5258,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1113.697,1117.066,But you'll -- you'll put away for a long time somebody who really wasn't that bad a guy.
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,1137.645,1157.143,"In the case of a misdemeanor -- Justice Sotomayor asked earlier about misdemeanors and felonies -- there may be some additional constitutional issues in terms of whether if it's a misdemeanor conviction, even statutory reasons, if it's a misdemeanor conviction, whether it should count."
2010.10-5258,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1202.921,1207.206,I'm -- I'm not sure what you're urging now.
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,1249.319,1273.1,"What -- what I meant to say, Justice Ginsburg, is that if you are -- if you continue to be talking about a felony offense, if it goes from 5 years to 10 years, it went from a felony to another felony, in that circumstance I -- I -- I will concede our reading of the statute would work to the detriment of that defendant, that -- that's correct."
2010.10-5258,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1283.456,1288.694,"In -- in the hypothetical where the penalty is increased, would there be an ex post facto problem?"
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,1288.694,1293.764,"Your Honor, I don't believe there would be."
2010.10-5258,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1390.844,1392.494,"I'm sorry, how do you see that?"
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,1419.661,1420.911,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.10-5258,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1420.911,1422.111,You understood their brief differently?
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,1422.111,1424.029,"Your Honor, I read the brief differently?"
2010.10-5258,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1426.981,1429.017,I'm sure they'll tell you.
2010.10-5258,0,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,1429.483,1430.233,"Yes, I'm sure they will."
2010.10-5258,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1437.254,1438.239,"Thank you, Mr. Gordon."
2010.10-5258,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1445.609,1447.811,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.10-5258,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1561.854,1564.388,Could I -- just to clarify your point.
2010.10-5258,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1591.123,1593.908,"--Well, I think that this would be a highly extraordinary circumstance."
2010.10-5258,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1603.18,1604.046,"Well, that's my question."
2010.10-5258,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1618.106,1618.806,--The footnote--
2010.10-5258,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1618.806,1620.558,--if this person had committed the crime?
2010.10-5258,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1620.558,1627.462,--The footnote in part A of the government's brief is -- is not consistent with the court of appeals approach.
2010.10-5258,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1652.244,1670.658,"I'm just trying to clarify whether you mean that the -- the modification had to have occurred, meaning that he was convicted, he got 10 years, and somewhere for some State reason, that actual final judgment was amended to include 5."
2010.10-5258,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1670.658,1671.025,Yes.
2010.10-5258,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1671.025,1672.525,Are or are you talking about--
2010.10-5258,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1672.525,1673.625,Yes.
2010.10-5258,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1673.625,1678.91,--accepting his argument that if he could apply for a change now--
2010.10-5258,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1678.91,1685.147,It -- in -- we think that it has to be under the documents associated with his judgment of conviction.
2010.10-5258,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1709.714,1714.75,"--Is this the first time you're advancing the argument, the first part of your argument?"
2010.10-5258,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1714.75,1715.785,It--
2010.10-5258,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1715.785,1718.32,It doesn't appear as you did -- if you did it below; am I correct?
2010.10-5258,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1718.32,1720.137,--We -- we did not advance this below.
2010.10-5258,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1988.859,2008.007,What if the legislature decreases the penalty because it really has taken a different -- a new look at the nature of the offense and has come to the conclusion that this really is not nearly as serious as we -- as we previously thought?
2010.10-5258,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2015.661,2023.182,"Well, Congress has given us a very objective and simple yardstick to look to and that's just what the maximum term of imprisonment is."
2010.10-5258,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2067.295,2067.945,But what if--
2010.10-5258,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2067.945,2068.461,--wasn't intended--
2010.10-5258,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2068.461,2072.115,--What if they had repudiated their prior normative judgment?
2010.10-5258,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2089.209,2103.885,"--Well, it's possible that the State could -- could provide a mechanism by which he could have the documents associated with his prior judgment amended to reflect the fact that he -- he ought not to have been subjected to the -- to the greater term of imprisonment."
2010.10-5258,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2142.344,2148.782,I'm not sure it's so hard.
2010.10-5258,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2172.213,2177.933,"Well, I -- I think that we would obviously still prevail under an approach like that."
2010.10-5258,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2219.194,2230.984,Can you tell us whether changes in State sentences -- do the States routinely address retroactivity?
2010.10-5258,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2235.25,2243.023,Several States have specific saving statutes like the Federal Government does in 1 U.S.C. 109.
2010.10-5258,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2291.171,2292.071,"Thank you, Mr. Gannon."
2010.10-5258,2,41389,stephen_c_gordon,,2293.955,2297.324,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2010.10-5258,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2475.623,2476.808,"Thank you, counsel."
