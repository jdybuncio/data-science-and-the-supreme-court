2012.11-1327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.785,"We'll hear argument next in Case 11-1327, Evans v. Michigan."
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,6.504,9.022,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,27.917,35.054,Do we give credence to how the judge labels what the acquittal is?
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,35.054,35.689,--No.
2012.11-1327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,54.301,78.0,"But once -- once the judge determines, quite erroneously, that it has to be a dwelling -- midway during the trial, I'm the judge, I consider this has to be a dwelling, is there any way I can make that point, make that ruling, without invoking double jeopardy?"
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,78.0,81.952,"--Well, you could reserve that ruling to the end of the case."
2012.11-1327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,95.128,99.58,"But -- but if I persist in that view, there's nothing the Government can do?"
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,99.58,106.685,The Government can try -- we learned from Smith -- try to get you to reconsider that view before the defendant puts on his case.
2012.11-1327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,122.112,124.362,"Because I suppose the judge is the Government, too."
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,124.362,125.23,Exactly.
2012.11-1327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,126.814,133.568,"So whether the unfairness adheres in the prosecution or in the judge, the guy's been treated unfairly."
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,133.568,141.84,"--If a State chooses, Justice Scalia, to vest acquittal power in its judges, it must accept the double jeopardy consequences of that."
2012.11-1327,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,141.84,158.285,"Even when the defendant interjected this issue, and the defendant urged the judge to make this incorrect notion that you have to negate the higher crime in order to convict of the lesser crime."
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,166.322,174.211,"The judge came up with this, Your Honor, on defendant's motion, that's correct, but it was actually supported by the jury instructions that were in use."
2012.11-1327,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,185.768,188.887,But you're not arguing that that was the correct charge that--
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,188.887,189.37,--No.
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,191.672,192.556,But you don't--
2012.11-1327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,192.556,196.843,Counsel often encourage judges to do the wrong thing.
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,202.914,203.747,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2012.11-1327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,204.214,206.266,That's what the adversary system consists of.
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,206.266,206.749,--Yes.
2012.11-1327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,220.859,242.355,"What -- could a State provide a procedure where, if a judge makes a critical ruling mid-trial, that at the request of the opposing counsel, jury proceedings are suspended for 48 hours, and the aggrieved party can run to the court of appeals to get a mandate?"
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,242.355,247.176,"I don't think the State could do that, Justice Kennedy, because of Smalis."
2012.11-1327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,247.176,248.126,Because of?
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,248.126,248.693,Because of Smalis.
2012.11-1327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,265.754,273.576,"Well, in my hypothetical, the State said -- and this isn't a final determination; the ruling doesn't become final until you have 48 hours and go to the court of appeals."
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,273.576,281.064,"--Well, I think a State could make -- investing acquittal power in judges could put limitations on that acquittal power."
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,281.064,282.682,--How would they do that?
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,314.153,319.289,"Well, jeopardy attaches both ways, but a retry -- a reversal is possible in the -- in the latter."
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,319.289,319.974,In the latter.
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,334.215,335.151,"Well, the easy--"
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,335.151,349.141,"So give us an example of what, in a judge trial, a State could do to ensure that a legally wrong judgment is still reversible."
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,349.141,350.16,"--In a bench trial, Your Honor?"
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,350.16,350.876,In a bench trial.
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,352.06,366.686,"I think if -- if in a bench trial, if the judge had the power to acquit or convict and the judge acquits, I believe the Double Jeopardy Clause would preclude the State from coming up with a clever mechanism allowing -- for allowing appellate review."
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,369.721,373.756,"I thought there were in your briefs some examples -- in someone's brief, there were some examples--"
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,373.756,375.422,--In a jury trial with a judge--
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,375.422,376.689,"--No, forget about a jury trial."
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,377.758,378.774,--I don't know what--
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,378.774,382.945,You're not helping your argument by saying there's nothing a State could ever do.
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,382.945,387.564,"--Well, they could withdraw the power of judges to grant acquittals or convictions in the first place."
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,391.468,393.018,"Do you know something, Counselor?"
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,399.887,407.16,"--Well, with all respect, Your Honor, the Double Jeopardy Clause here transcends the State's--"
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,407.16,408.177,I don't disagree.
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,421.82,426.891,"--After Smith, it's clear that immediate reconsideration is a possibility."
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,471.253,472.72,--You keep saying “ mid-trial ”.
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,472.72,473.736,Yes.
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,473.736,478.423,What -- what is not mid-trial?
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,482.591,483.56,Yes.
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,484.127,484.86,What happens in those States?
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,484.86,494.599,"Well, in that case then there is no problem because if the judge makes a determination after the jury verdict, then the -- then that can be appealed under Wilson."
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,494.599,497.903,"I keep talking not about jury verdicts, but about bench trials."
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,500.203,506.157,"If -- but if the judge at the end of a trial renders a solemn, formal, final verdict,"
2012.11-1327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,527.922,543.016,"If, in the middle of a trial, a judge grants a mistrial and says -- I'm sorry, grants an acquittal, and says, I think that prompt prosecution is an element of the offense and there wasn't prompt prosecution here."
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,546.051,547.101,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-1327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,547.101,550.303,Even though the judge says he thinks that that's an element of the offense.
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,550.303,553.671,Because no part of my argument depends upon the judge's labeling.
2012.11-1327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,570.43,573.668,"Well, he saw a phantom element, and -- and that's what happened here, too, isn't it?"
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,573.668,580.238,"--Well, pretrial delay is not an element of the offense."
2012.11-1327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,583.524,588.428,"And this -- and the fact that this was not a dwelling wasn't an element of the offense, either."
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,588.428,590.711,But it is clearly related to the offense.
2012.11-1327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,646.764,648.28,"Well, there -- that's a problem."
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,661.607,662.257,Yes.
2012.11-1327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,683.77,699.113,"Well, to come back to the argument we just heard, so suppose the judge grants a mistrial for failure to prove an action within the statute of limitations, even though no statute of limitations defense was raised."
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,701.415,713.623,"Only -- I think my answer to that would depend on how you rule in the prior case, depending on whether the statute of limitations is -- is something the prosecution had to prove in order to establish guilt."
2012.11-1327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,713.623,713.99,All right.
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,720.377,743.659,"Well, if it -- if it's something that could result in an acquittal, if it is -- if the defendant raising the statute of limitations is something that could result in an acquittal -- because I come to Burks, where Burks says an affirmative insanity defense, the prosecution fails to disprove that, that is an acquittal -- when the appellate court concluded that there was failure to disprove the affirmative insanity defense."
2012.11-1327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,760.104,764.222,I'm not sure I understand the rationale for your answer to your own hypothetical.
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,782.553,783.019,--Yes.
2012.11-1327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,783.836,790.457,On what rationale -- so what's the general principle that allows the court of appeals to do this sometimes and not others?
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,790.457,802.848,"If the judge has made a ruling going to the defendant's guilt or innocence and finding that as in Martin, examining the government's evidence and finding that they have failed to prove the defendant's guilt, it's final."
2012.11-1327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,810.62,818.142,"Oh, I thought -- I thought it was the judge just subjectively does this, but he doesn't say any -- he just characterizes it as an acquittal?"
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,818.142,827.165,"--That's -- that's a case, actually, quite a bit like some of the cases and it demonstrates the problem of -- of the Michigan Supreme Court's line."
2012.11-1327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,874.979,881.3,"I see the problem, but I am still back to where Justice Kennedy was, and that is my own failure."
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,924.579,929.613,"--Fong Foo has not been explicitly overruled, but I think it has been limited by Scott."
2012.11-1327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,929.613,943.973,"--So Scott says that even in judge -- Scott says Fong Foo was wrong, that that -- because the reason that Charlie Wyzanski dismissed it is he has this idea of a -- the AUSA doing something improper at lunch."
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,954.015,959.919,"Well, Justice Breyer, Fong Foo actually listed two reasons why the trial judge granted the directed verdict."
2012.11-1327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,964.804,965.304,Yes.
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,965.304,969.607,But the second one was the total lack of credibility of the prosecution's witnesses.
2012.11-1327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,972.409,973.026,That's--
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,973.026,978.046,"--When the case came to this Court, the concurring Justice said,"
2012.11-1327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1001.496,1009.332,One -- one of the reasons we've said that underlies double jeopardy clause is to prevent overbearing conduct by the government.
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1018.707,1021.073,"Mr. Chief Justice, I would respectfully disagree."
2012.11-1327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1032.865,1037.169,"Well, this business about the judge being a representative of the State, I'm not sure how far that gets you."
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1052.111,1058.415,"--Well, I understand that view, Mr. Chief Justice, but it's contrary to a lot of this Court's cases."
2012.11-1327,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1076.127,1076.66,Suppose the question--
2012.11-1327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1076.66,1081.928,"No, I know that -- I'm just saying that that particular rationale for the Double Jeopardy Clause is not applicable in this case."
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1081.928,1087.934,"Well, I think it is, because a citizen has been brought into court, expects to go through one trial, and they are told,"
2012.11-1327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1094.088,1095.721,That's looking at it from the defendant's perspective.
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1105.044,1115.085,"--Your Honor, I come back to the language in Martin Linen, which talks about what the purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause is, is to protect defendants against continuing government oppression."
2012.11-1327,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1120.905,1126.392,--But isn't it -- isn't it hard to argue with a notion that your client has gotten a windfall here?
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1140.533,1147.139,"Well, Your Honor, without the error, the trial would have -- would have continued."
2012.11-1327,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1161.732,1162.582,"Yes, I think that's right."
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1179.61,1188.014,"Well, once you accept the equivalency of a judicial acquittal to a jury acquittal, you have to accept that both actors are capable of error."
2012.11-1327,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1227.175,1253.742,"--Could a system say, if you have double jeopardy looming in -- in -- in the case, then arguments like the one that the defendant made and the judge bought have to be made pretrial, and if they are not made pretrial, they are waived."
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1276.172,1298.271,"Justice Ginsburg, I don't think it would have been right for Mr. Evans to make this argument pretrial, because it was only with the prosecution's proof that it became clear that what the prosecution was proving was that the building burned was, in fact, a dwelling house and therefore, seemed to be excluded by the statutory language and especially the commentary to the jury instructions from the definition of the offense."
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1342.3,1343.966,"I'm sorry, I'm a little confused."
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1351.839,1353.456,"--Mr. Evans, no."
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1355.424,1356.091,Of?
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1356.091,1357.976,Burning other real property.
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1357.976,1361.595,And no specific statute was cited?
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1361.595,1362.062,Yes.
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1362.062,1362.963,Which one?
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1362.963,1365.748,The -- that -- that statute.
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1366.465,1369.783,"The dwelling statute, not the exception to the dwelling."
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1369.783,1371.735,--It's the exception to the dwelling statute.
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1377.889,1379.189,That's what he was charged with?
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1379.189,1379.772,Yes.
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1379.772,1383.391,So why did the court dismiss if he was charged with burning down a house?
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1387.859,1388.545,No.
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1388.545,1390.361,--charged with burning down a house.
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1390.361,1397.948,"No, he was charged with the crime in 750.7 -- 750.73, which reads in relevant part that"
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1414.226,1422.713,"My only quibble is, you have no doubt -- the defense attorney had no doubt that he burnt down a house."
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1425.95,1431.169,It was -- it was allegedly a vacant house.
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1434.288,1434.89,Got it.
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1434.89,1436.573,So they charged it.
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1481.185,1486.156,"It's a sentencing enhancement, is really what the argument is, the decision was."
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1486.156,1487.506,"--Well, there--"
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1487.506,1493.576,That every -- you can be charged with burning down a dwelling and you can only get the enhancement if they prove it's a house.
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1493.576,1495.594,--You can only get the greater offense.
2012.11-1327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1495.594,1496.111,Exactly.
2012.11-1327,0,21199,david_a_moran,,1496.111,1496.713,Yes.
2012.11-1327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1507.486,1508.521,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1327,1,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1517.96,1522.579,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1327,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1700.711,1709.483,"So if -- if the judge did this on her own, that would have been okay, and there would be double jeopardy attaching?"
2012.11-1327,1,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1709.483,1709.85,That's correct.
2012.11-1327,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1709.85,1717.471,So we have to decide in each case whether the defendant was the initiating source of the error?
2012.11-1327,1,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1717.471,1731.564,"In terms of the -- whether or not a judgment of acquittal was granted, yes, both the Federal rule and the Michigan rule provide that on the defendant's motion or on the court's own motion the court may grant a directed verdict."
2012.11-1327,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1731.564,1733.349,What if the defendant just agrees with the judge?
2012.11-1327,1,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1748.692,1749.942,I think that would be enough.
2012.11-1327,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1756.096,1758.764,"--Well, my goodness, disagreement would be malpractice, wouldn't it?"
2012.11-1327,1,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1758.764,1770.789,"--Well, it -- it depends on whether you really wish to get a verdict from this jury or whether you risk having a -- risk -- risk wanting to have a retrial before a different factfinder."
2012.11-1327,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1771.991,1773.574,"A bird in the hand, counsel."
2012.11-1327,1,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1774.342,1780.079,"--Sometimes that bird in the hand can come back and bite you, when you have a second trial."
2012.11-1327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1780.079,1791.102,"Mr. Baughman, what would happen if the defendant asked for improper instructions, really saying exactly something like this; you know, that the jury has to find this additional element that in fact it doesn't have to find?"
2012.11-1327,1,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1801.243,1802.943,That -- that's correct.
2012.11-1327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1812.468,1820.538,"You don't go that far, in other words, just because it doesn't happen to be this case, but do you concede that the logic of your position would extend to improperly instructed juries?"
2012.11-1327,1,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1820.538,1826.358,--It would to a certain extent but it is -- it is cut off by two facts.
2012.11-1327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1843.154,1845.939,"Well, we've historically said it in this context, too."
2012.11-1327,1,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1849.891,1857.663,"--Well, when I say historically I mean back to the time of the founding, in terms of when the Double Jeopardy Clause was promulgated and adopted into the Constitution."
2012.11-1327,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1890.135,1891.018,You cannot--
2012.11-1327,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1891.018,1896.805,"--Well, we didn't have it, at the time of the founding, any mechanism for a judge to do that."
2012.11-1327,1,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1931.545,1933.58,"Well, I think you are exactly right."
2012.11-1327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1972.705,1979.876,But the point I was making was that the same windfall is received by the defendant that gets an acquittal from an improperly instructed jury.
2012.11-1327,1,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,1979.876,1987.964,"--But -- that is true, except we -- we could speculate that's -- that's true, but we don't know why the jury came back the way it did."
2012.11-1327,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2003.224,2017.151,"Now -- now, I take it you -- you -- you agree that sometimes the prosecution -- I'm not saying anyone would -- but they -- the defendant's acquitted by the jury so -- because he doesn't find -- they don't find enough evidence and so the prosecutor thinks,"
2012.11-1327,1,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,2113.195,2115.997,"Well, let me say two things."
2012.11-1327,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2157.76,2159.31,"Now, you're beginning to make distinctions."
2012.11-1327,1,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,2159.31,2159.793,--Yes.
2012.11-1327,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2159.793,2164.997,"And once you make those distinctions, I go back to the question I asked, which was there is a distinction."
2012.11-1327,1,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,2193.599,2207.824,"Well, I think -- I think consistent with the cases, and also clear, is to apply Martin Linen Supply by the very terms that it uses, that is, the resolution that we're talking about the judge making is moored to something."
2012.11-1327,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2267.481,2276.17,"If the judge -- if the judge simply misinterprets one of the elements, but doesn't add a new element, you say that there would be double jeopardy there, right?"
2012.11-1327,1,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,2276.17,2277.37,Yes.
2012.11-1327,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2277.37,2280.789,Isn't that going to be a very difficult line to draw?
2012.11-1327,1,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,2280.789,2288.728,"It can be a very difficult line to draw, but all tests can sometimes involve difficult lines to draw."
2012.11-1327,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2312.009,2312.559,Let me give you an example.
2012.11-1327,1,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,2344.23,2358.038,"--I -- I would define -- I would draw the line at any time the court requires the prosecution to prove a fact that under the law passed by the legislature, the prosecution never has to prove in order to make out the case."
2012.11-1327,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2358.038,2360.157,"Well, that's every misinterpretation."
2012.11-1327,1,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,2379.903,2384.705,"Well, it does involve a -- a mischaracterization of what the elements were, but not of an element."
2012.11-1327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2399.198,2408.638,"But in several of our cases, what the court has done wrong is to make the prosecution prove additional facts in order to prove an element."
2012.11-1327,1,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,2424.099,2437.74,"Well, I would suggest that this is an opportunity for this Court to draw the line at does -- does the judge require -- has the judge required the prosecution to prove something the statute doesn't require to be proven, it's not one of the factual elements of the offense."
2012.11-1327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2451.5,2457.32,"Well, if I understand your test correctly, under your test, Rumsey, Smalis and Smith would all have come out differently."
2012.11-1327,1,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,2457.32,2458.636,"No, I don't think so."
2012.11-1327,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2481.686,2491.208,"So you're saying that your -- your approach doesn't solve the bench trial problem any more than your friend's approach, right?"
2012.11-1327,1,42452,timothy_a_baughman,,2491.208,2494.778,"--A verdict is a verdict, I agree with Mr. Moran."
2012.11-1327,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2616.975,2618.426,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1327,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2628.365,2630.567,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2012.11-1327,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2747.609,2748.242,Let's go through this.
2012.11-1327,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2793.34,2797.375,"--Well, I think that we -- we normally expect judges to give reasons for their decisions."
2012.11-1327,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2797.375,2797.692,Yes.
2012.11-1327,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2805.748,2811.052,"Well, in the State of Michigan, the rule does not permit the judge to reserve the ruling on this motion."
2012.11-1327,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2811.052,2812.135,"Well, I think there are a lot more places--"
2012.11-1327,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2812.135,2814.354,"So, and actually, in the vast majority of states--"
2012.11-1327,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2814.354,2815.054,--They do.
2012.11-1327,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2815.487,2816.054,--that's the rule.
2012.11-1327,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2819.74,2820.507,--And then this is a--
2012.11-1327,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2820.507,2822.109,--decision to be reserved after trial.
2012.11-1327,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2822.109,2823.325,--This has arisen a lot more than -- than I think.
2012.11-1327,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2824.575,2826.227,"And in fact, in the Federal context--"
2012.11-1327,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2826.227,2826.994,"And in that case, do they have to write it down?"
2012.11-1327,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2826.994,2843.106,"--Well, I -- I think that the rule in Michigan, and in the Federal Rule 29, does require the judge to make a determination of -- to satisfy that -- that there's an acquittal, which would mean that there is no -- no sufficient evidence to -- to support a guilty--"
2012.11-1327,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2843.106,2844.089,But many states have a different rule.
2012.11-1327,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2844.089,2845.206,--Many -- many states--
2012.11-1327,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2845.206,2848.308,And many states permit the judge to reserve it till after the jury verdict.
2012.11-1327,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2848.308,2852.629,--My -- my understanding is that most states do not permit that.
2012.11-1327,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2871.906,2873.042,"So then, in other words, when an acquittal--"
2012.11-1327,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2873.042,2873.958,Finish the sentence.
2012.11-1327,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2875.624,2890.051,"--Notwithstanding that, in approximately 70 percent of the cases in which there are Rule 29 verdicts, they are done midtrial, even in the Federal system, at least in the early 2000s is the only data collection that I'm aware of."
2012.11-1327,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2917.385,2922.272,--Do you have any -- your -- your idea of what the empirical situation is in the last 30 or 40 years?
2012.11-1327,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,2933.711,2946.32,"--I don't think that they -- they have mostly thought that, but the Federal Government certainly has maintained that that -- that that is appropriate, and we think that in the Maker decision in the Third Circuit in 1984 recognized this."
2012.11-1327,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3000.772,3007.009,"Mr. Gannon, if we -- if we adopt your rule, it -- it can't be for this case only."
2012.11-1327,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3032.826,3038.528,"--Well, I don't think it's difficult in the sense that most -- most of the cases that we are talking about don't involve this type of error."
2012.11-1327,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3078.438,3083.973,"Counsel, you gave us earlier the statistics of how many judges grant Rule 29 motions in trial."
2012.11-1327,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3094.281,3098.4,--The only data that I have seen about this is data that the Justice Department collected about ten years ago.
2012.11-1327,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3108.807,3110.623,Out of what number?
2012.11-1327,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3110.623,3117.396,"--which actually is a larger number than you -- than you might at first think, because that represents about 10 percent of the number of cases that were actually resolved by jury verdicts."
2012.11-1327,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3221.981,3223.583,"Is that important, “ at defendant's behest ”?"
2012.11-1327,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3223.583,3228.986,--We do think that that's important by analogy to the Court's mistrial cases in the Double Jeopardy Clause context.
2012.11-1327,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3228.986,3234.688,So you -- you're arguing that this should only -- only be -- this rule should only be applied when the defendant asks for it.
2012.11-1327,2,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,3234.688,3241.627,"Or if the defendant consents to it, as is the case in the mistrial cases in the double jeopardy context."
2012.11-1327,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3241.627,3242.41,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1327,3,21199,david_a_moran,,3244.412,3248.464,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.11-1327,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3346.545,3347.397,Have any states done that?
2012.11-1327,3,21199,david_a_moran,,3360.037,3362.323,"--I would be, too, Justice Kennedy."
2012.11-1327,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3439.656,3441.589,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1327,3,21199,david_a_moran,,3441.589,3441.956,"--thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.11-1327,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3441.956,3442.691,The case is submitted.
