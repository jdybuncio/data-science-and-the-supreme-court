1964.578,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,13.934,"Number 578 George Angelet, Petitioner, versus Edward M. Fay, Warden."
1964.578,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,15.19,19.596,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.578,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,54.171,64.887,"And may I just ask, if that could be your basis of your argument of the court, does this mean that you are not attacking the validity of the conviction, the initial conviction?"
1964.578,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,64.887,69.26,We have two phases of our case.
1964.578,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,76.161,82.38,"Well I suppose, you would prevail on the first one, this would still lead to conviction standing order?"
1964.578,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,82.38,90.608,I would suspect that the conviction would then be vacated and he would then be retried by order of the State Court.
1964.578,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,90.608,103.199,"I don't follow that, if you are not attacking the conviction, but only the illegality of the present detention then why would that not mean simply that he would be released from the present detention, but a conviction stands."
1964.578,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,103.199,121.084,"Historically, in all the cases that I have seen where writs of Habeas Corpus have been sustained, the practice has been to issue a conditional writ discharging the prisoner from custody unless he is retried within a reasonable time."
1964.578,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,121.084,135.41,"Yes but Mr. Polsky, I suggest that in all of those cases, if it's been on the ground that the -- the attack has been on the initial conviction, but your opening sentence was and you just said, you have got alternative arguments here."
1964.578,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,139.597,140.556,Yes sir.
1964.578,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,140.556,144.669,And then your second argument is on the illegality of the initial conviction.
1964.578,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,144.669,145.58,Yes sir.
1964.578,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,145.58,157.818,"But I don't understand if you prevail on the first argument, how that would result in vacating the conviction, why would it not result in nothing more than his release from the present detention?"
1964.578,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,157.818,167.862,"Because in order to release him from the present detention, you must destroy the order which is the basis of holding the man in custody."
1964.578,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,173.325,181.514,"Well, then I suggest then, we are only making one argument, not making two."
1964.578,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,181.514,188.301,"Is your point, I suppose that this is the equivalent as though this man were in jail without any trial at all."
1964.578,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,215.499,220.882,"No, I still stick to this sir."
1964.578,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,227.443,234.719,"Yes, but if you have to reach the trial order, you have to reach the conviction and the order resulting from it."
1964.578,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,240.666,274.154,"Yes, oh! at some there will, in order to retry the man, well though to be quite honest, in the several cases where -- that I have seen, where writs have been sustained by Federal Courts and a retrial order, a conditional retrial order has been made, there has never been any formal action taken in the State Court to vacate the initial conviction of, all that happened is, he was brought back in and they picked up where they left off and started all over again."
1964.578,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,555.897,558.799,How can a state be able to do that?
1964.578,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,558.799,563.17,"I say they can't Your Honor, but their position is that they have."
1964.578,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,713.117,720.558,(Inaudible)
1964.578,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,720.558,725.983,"No sir, I don't think so."
1964.578,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,739.552,783.646,(Inaudible)
1964.578,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,783.646,783.999,"Yes, sir."
1964.578,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,783.999,785.151,(Inaudible)
1964.578,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,785.151,786.666,"Yes, sir."
1964.578,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,829.559,831.649,(Inaudible)
1964.578,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,831.649,832.053,"Yes, sir."
1964.578,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,832.053,836.738,(Inaudible)
1964.578,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,836.738,837.277,"Yes, sir."
1964.578,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,860.827,861.623,Fitzgerald?
1964.578,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,861.623,867.947,"Fitzgerald, on page 94, he says I discussed the defendant many times with the detective."
1964.578,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,888.232,898.953,(Inaudible)
1964.578,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,898.953,900.202,I think so.
1964.578,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,903.065,905.517,(Inaudible)
1964.578,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,905.517,907.805,Oh!
1964.578,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,991.769,1000.934,(Inaudible)
1964.578,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,1000.934,1009.102,The New York Courts have held forgetting the first flush of cases where no one really knew what we were doing.
1964.578,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1083.309,1094.57,(Inaudible)
1964.578,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,1094.57,1114.461,"There has been talk about the impact of retrospectivity and the District Attorney has conjured up a parade of horrors of what will happen when the landslide, which he expects comes to the District Court."
1964.578,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1149.44,1151.131,In the whole State of New York?
1964.578,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,1151.131,1164.88,"No, there are no more -- actually in the brief I refereed to a dozen cases nationwide, where in my judgment an illegal search and seizure has been adjudicated to have taken place prior to Mapp."
1964.578,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1173.573,1177.508,(Inaudible)
1964.578,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,1177.508,1182.733,Just going through the reported cases that I was able to find at that time I did it.
1964.578,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,1186.797,1191.142,(Inaudible)
1964.578,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,1191.142,1196.599,I will suggest this though.
1964.578,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1349.566,1350.76,With directions to what?
1964.578,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,1350.76,1357.896,Sustain the writ unless the petitioner is retried within a reasonable time.
1964.578,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1357.896,1365.303,Mr. Thoron.
1964.578,1,26179,gray_thoron,,1365.303,1370.639,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.578,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1786.971,1795.293,"Well, then you suggested in some cases that the rule ought to be made retroactive."
1964.578,1,26179,gray_thoron,,1795.293,1797.898,That is correct.
1964.578,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1805.744,1817.685,"But what do you say in those cases that the law -- what about this your projection argument, do you say that the law was or wasn't changed or what do you say --"
1964.578,1,26179,gray_thoron,,1817.685,1825.231,I don't know how much help we're going to get out of the jurisprudential analysis and not that my --
1964.578,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1825.231,1829.327,"You cannot get any help about it, but what do you say about it?"
1964.578,1,26179,gray_thoron,,1829.327,1837.765,"Well, I suppose, I have to be classified with the legal realists that law does change and law should change and it will continue to change."
1964.578,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1837.765,1840.175,But in this case it didn't.
1964.578,1,26179,gray_thoron,,1840.175,1840.554,In this case --
1964.578,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1840.554,1845.383,As far as retroactive it didn't change because it never was that way.
1964.578,1,26179,gray_thoron,,1845.383,1849.523,I have a hard time following that argument.
1964.578,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1849.523,1856.686,"Do you ever think it is retroactive, if all of the law didn't change."
1964.578,1,26179,gray_thoron,,1856.686,1861.653,I'm not quite sure that I understand Your Honor's question on that point.
1964.578,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1878.152,1882.057,Take Gideon or Griffin.
1964.578,1,26179,gray_thoron,,1901.087,1922.89,"I would say that it was the law, that when Bates and Grady (ph) was -- had been oddly handed down by the rule that the law was according to the then conception as announced by this Court, that a counsel in that kind of case, a felony case was not required."
1964.578,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1945.679,1954.535,"Well I know you draw the distinction, but you just put aside the argument about what the law was -- I mean -- although that --"
1964.578,1,26179,gray_thoron,,1954.535,1964.231,"I didn't mean to put it aside, it was my understanding that the law on the Bates and Grady (ph) and many cases were affirmed on the basis of that law as I understand it."
1964.578,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2021.344,2024.878,Was it the Seizure being before the Mapp or after the Mapp?
1964.578,1,26179,gray_thoron,,2024.878,2027.684,This is a Pre-Mapp seizure.
1964.578,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2027.684,2030.16,"Pre-Mapp opinion I mean, Pre-Mapp seizure?"
1964.578,1,26179,gray_thoron,,2030.16,2033.824,"Pre-Mapp, 1951."
1964.578,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2251.253,2252.659,Mr. Juviler?
1964.578,3,34922,leon_b_polsky,,3229.237,3260.646,"Mr. Chief Justice, I am concerned by the argument that Mr. Juviler has made that our claim that Mapp would be applicable or that Mr. Angelet should be released under this decision would have an inhibiting factor, it would be an inhibiting factor on the growth and development of both the constitutional law generally and the law of search and seizure specifically."
1964.578,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3363.083,3369.629,"The same evidence that has been seized legally or illegally isn't it, and it's just reliable as it is or is unreliable."
1964.578,3,34922,leon_b_polsky,,3369.629,3383.155,"Particularly as in this case which is a possession case really the whole case is the proof that the material had been seized, that the defendant was possessed of it."
1964.578,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3439.741,3468.351,"Mr. Polsky I understand you are ordered by the Court below to prosecute this appeal for an indigent that is true, is it not, so this Court would like to thank you for having undertaken that, it's a splendid public service and we're always grateful to lawyers who do it and we're grateful to you Mr. Thoron and Mr. Juviler for the services that you rendered on behalf of your state."
