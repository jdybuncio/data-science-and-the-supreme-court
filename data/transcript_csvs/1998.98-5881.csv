1998.98-5881,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.638,"We'll hear argument next in No. 98-5881, Benjamin Lee Lilly v. Virginia."
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,64.203,66.905,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-5881,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,99.597,105.63,What if the... what if the statement of the accomplice also is a declaration against penal interest?
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,105.63,108.953,"Your Honor, I think the... the test for that is as follows."
1998.98-5881,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,139.183,151.681,"Well, you... you can say that about any number of well established hearsay exceptions, that perhaps it would have been better if... if there had been cross examination, but those have, nonetheless, been rooted in the hearsay exception."
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,164.1,165.432,"I... I agree with that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.98-5881,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,205.918,218.236,Can... can you give me an example of a case in which we have held that a declaration against penal interest which was also the confession of an accomplice... and that may be a fairly narrow class of cases... was inherently suspect?
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,218.236,218.687,--Lee.
1998.98-5881,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,218.687,223.46,Was there a declaration against penal interest there?
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,223.46,223.73,"Oh, no question."
1998.98-5881,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,246.787,248.536,Which several of us joined.
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,248.536,268.829,"The... the confession of Mr. Thomas in the Lee case was unambiguously against his penal interest, and despite that, it was held by the Court in Lee that the right of Lee to confront Thomas on the stand on cross examination was required by the Confrontation Clause."
1998.98-5881,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,268.829,279.735,"So... so, you think that our doctrine then is that the... if it's a confession of... of an accomplice, the... the declaration against penal interest is simply swallowed up."
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,279.735,281.248,"No, Your Honor, I don't."
1998.98-5881,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,373.379,377.31,"Well, it's made it plain so far is admissibility of evidence against the declarant."
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,388.676,414.916,"--Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, with all due respect, I think that in Williamson, which I agree is a... is a Federal rule 804(b)(3) case, that the... that the discussion in Williamson about the difference under the Federal rules, 804(b)(3), of a... of a... of a statement to another prisoner, as in Dutton v. Evans, as opposed to a statement in custody makes a great deal of difference."
1998.98-5881,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,509.177,517.924,"May I ask you, if you're at a break in your argument, have you read Justice Thomas' opinion in White against Illinois?"
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,517.924,518.264,Yes.
1998.98-5881,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,518.264,521.486,How would you apply the analysis in that opinion to this case?
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,521.486,563.824,"Well, you know, it's... it's at... the answer is that we would be happy if this Court decided to adopt the view of Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Scalia, in Wright because we believe that either under Lee and what I would call existing case law or under the suggestion by Justice Thomas in White and the concurrence that a hard and fast rule be used for the Confrontation Clause, we think that either way, the decision has to be reversed because as I understand the concurring opinion in White it would extend the right of confrontation to witnesses who testify and to testimonial material such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, and confessions, and there would not be an exception for reliable statements."
1998.98-5881,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,578.804,580.464,"But, of course, this is not an affidavit."
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,580.464,592.092,"--Well, it's... it's... but the... the extension that Justice Thomas used there was formalized testimonial material such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions."
1998.98-5881,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,595.584,597.087,It's or confessions that you relying on.
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,597.087,597.545,--Yes.
1998.98-5881,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,660.296,666.731,"But before you get to that, may... I'm a little confused about the declaration against penal interest."
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,727.48,736.645,"Justice Ginsburg, the... the reason why... and conceding is probably... is... is probably too... too strong a word."
1998.98-5881,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,746.543,749.104,To some degree is an understatement.
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,752.106,775.751,"--As a general rule, but this Court in Inadi indicated that... that Roberts did not intend to have its rule as a rule that applied in all circumstances, and that, at least in the words of the Court in Inadi, that... that there... there would be exception that courts in... that the Court in Roberts was not seeking to have a rule that applied in all circumstances."
1998.98-5881,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,782.617,786.08,"And in favor of admitting evidence, not in favor of excluding it."
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,786.08,789.392,"That's truly correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.98-5881,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,791.733,801.648,"So, I mean, that tends to show that you're going to... so far as being able to exclude things, you're not going to be able to exclude them if they're a recognized hearsay exception."
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,806.333,810.964,"--With all due respect, Mr. Chief Justice, it went way beyond a recognized hearsay exception."
1998.98-5881,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,931.393,937.537,Was... was this argued to the Supreme Court of Virginia in anything else other than firmly rooted hearsay exceptions?
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,940.119,949.695,The broader principle that was urged below in the... in the Supreme Court of Virginia was that these statements were not sufficiently reliable to be admitted under the Confrontation Clause.
1998.98-5881,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1015.459,1018.43,It's not a declaration against penal interest.
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,1018.43,1022.684,"--Well, you know, that's... and... and maybe... and maybe that's the reason to... to just overturn."
1998.98-5881,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1046.689,1055.754,Are you saying declarations that are inculpatory of accomplices are by definition not against penal interest?
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,1055.754,1057.817,"--Oh, no."
1998.98-5881,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1061.598,1063.989,Of accomplices.
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,1063.989,1068.273,"As... putting aside Mark Lilly's statement, Justice Kennedy?"
1998.98-5881,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1070.854,1073.607,Mark made the statement and it's inculpatory as to Benjamin.
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,1073.607,1074.097,--Yes.
1998.98-5881,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1074.097,1081.663,"So, are you saying that statements that are inculpatory of an accomplice are by definition not against penal interest?"
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,1081.663,1081.941,No.
1998.98-5881,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1085.224,1091.048,"Because I thought you would extend it out and say, well, this is always in order to get favorable consideration from the police."
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,1091.048,1092.45,--I think that you look at several--
1998.98-5881,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1092.45,1094.951,"And... and therefore, it's exculpatory as to the declarant."
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,1094.951,1135.547,"--Well, it's... it's... in answering the broad question, Justice Kennedy, as to whether ever a statement which incriminates... a statement by a declarant that incriminates the defendant could be a declaration against penal interest that fell within... that was such that cross examination would be of marginal utility, I could conceive of such a case based on the factors that I talked about before which would be does it inculpate the declarant more than the defendant, does it attempt to shift blame, was it spontaneous, and... and... and although I don't think this is so much a matter of corroboration as adoption, whether there is a confession by the defendant that matches in all significant respects the statement by the declarant."
1998.98-5881,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1192.895,1202.832,"You would say no portion of... I mean, suppose the whole statement contains a number of provisions that are inculpatory of... of the declarant."
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,1208.926,1225.008,"--I... I think at some point the whole... the whole confession has to go, but I think that... that, Justice Scalia, you're quite right that our view is that you look at the specific statements, as this Court suggested under rule 804(b)(3) you look at specific statements, and you take those specific statements and you test those specific statements."
1998.98-5881,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1244.44,1255.336,"And... and even statements that, for example, just describe the surrounding circumstances of the crime and that corroborate perhaps other witnesses... they couldn't come in simply because they are not--"
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,1255.336,1256.608,"Well, let me... let me take that--"
1998.98-5881,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1256.608,1258.397,--immediately inculpatory.
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,1258.397,1260.1,"--in two... in two pieces, Justice Scalia."
1998.98-5881,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1303.527,1306.78,Why wouldn't that be against penal interest if it should that he was there and that was one of the big issues in the case?
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,1306.78,1320.45,"It might be if that was the... if that was an issue in the case, but as... as... as I understood the hypothetical and as... and I was... as I was responding to Justice Scalia, just saying it was cold and the moon was out might not be against Mark Lilly's penal interest."
1998.98-5881,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1323.222,1329.997,But you would agree you couldn't judge it by whether there was other evidence that the moon was out and so forth.
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,1329.997,1349.909,"Well, Justice Stevens, I think that if you get to what I believe is a bedrock test, which is whether cross examination of the declarant would be of marginal utility, I think that one would have to concede, if the Court could take judicial notice that it was cold and if the Court could take judicial notice that there was a full moon, that perhaps cross examination would be of marginal utility."
1998.98-5881,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1392.367,1397.11,"You say it's an alternative test, the... the flat bar."
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,1399.523,1400.052,"--No, Your Honor."
1998.98-5881,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1520.212,1530.8,Does the amicus venture any opinion as to why there are a lot more declarations against penal interest in 1999 than there are... were in 1968?
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,1530.8,1540.876,"Well, I think... I think that... that what has happened... and this is... and this is... this is true I think even in... in the decisions of this Court looking at the issue of... in the context of rule 804(b)(3)."
1998.98-5881,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1579.331,1586.366,"So, the... the position is not that people are making more declarations, but that more of them are being admitted in court?"
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,1586.366,1586.857,--No.
1998.98-5881,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1590.518,1591.71,Which would authorize it or--
1998.98-5881,0,28687,ira_s_sacks,,1591.71,1605.788,"--that... that... that would admit as a hearsay exception a declaration against penal interest, but not that would admit a statement of a declarant which was in part inculpatory... self inculpatory but which also incriminated a defendant."
1998.98-5881,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1644.163,1646.084,"--Very well, Mr. Sacks."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1647.806,1653.35,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-5881,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1704.073,1712.459,Was the argument made... was the argument made to the Supreme Court of Virginia that the admission was... violated the Federal Confrontation Clause?
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1712.459,1713.881,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.98-5881,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1727.158,1739.526,"Well, but the... the point I think is that the State Supreme Court expressly addressed the Confrontation Clause question, and the issue is whether it dealt with it correctly under our law."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1742.748,1747.583,"--Justice O'Connor, I do not believe it's the same argument that was made below."
1998.98-5881,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1747.583,1748.875,He doesn't have to make the same argument.
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1762.813,1775.359,Our only point on this issue is that I think it's unfair to reverse a conviction and a judgment of the Virginia Supreme Court on bases that literally were not argued or addressed by the court.
1998.98-5881,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1789.561,1792.423,"--Well, that's sort of unfair to your Supreme Court, but, you know--"
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1792.423,1792.951,--I... I--
1998.98-5881,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1792.951,1794.614,--that they didn't have the advantage of these arguments.
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1796.985,1799.847,"--I understand, Justice Scalia, and... and I will definitely move on."
1998.98-5881,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1803.189,1810.912,"Before you get to that, I would like to be clear on why this declarant was unavailable."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1846.596,1849.938,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, I have two answers to that."
1998.98-5881,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1899.122,1901.654,"Well, so, why wouldn't he have been in any different situation than Barker?"
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1903.496,1908.82,Barker made a deal with the Commonwealth in return for his truthful testimony.
1998.98-5881,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1976.585,1978.596,Your answer is that it was Mark Lilly's--
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1978.596,1980.569,--It was his decision.
1998.98-5881,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1981.107,1982.069,--and not the State's.
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,1982.069,1984.92,--It was not within the control of... of the Commonwealth of Virginia.
1998.98-5881,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2007.495,2008.676,It doesn't have to be a subcategory.
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2033.182,2034.123,"Well, and I think another way--"
1998.98-5881,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2034.123,2037.934,"If you want to call that a subcategory, then I guess that's okay, but do you... do you--"
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2037.934,2041.347,"--I don't disagree with the statement of the question, Justice Scalia."
1998.98-5881,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2066.496,2072.018,"--And to decide whether it fulfills the requirements, you don't just proceed with a general definition, you know, admission against interest."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2079.842,2083.835,"Well, that's correct, but also I think we have to know what we're talking about here."
1998.98-5881,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2108.921,2121.359,"Well, a statement is... the statements of... of a party can always come in, and the ones that are introduced are usually adverse because they're introduced by the person who is opposing the party."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2126.174,2128.666,"--It is a very narrow exception, Mr. Chief Justice."
1998.98-5881,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2177.376,2177.747,May I--
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2177.747,2178.498,I don't think there's any question but--
1998.98-5881,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2178.498,2187.915,"--May I ask on the second part, the otherwise reliable and so forth, do you think you can rely on evidence extraneous to the statement itself to determine reliability?"
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2187.915,2197.342,"--I think that there's nothing to prevent a court from doing that, Justice Stevens, but I don't think that... that in this case, for instance, that that's what was done."
1998.98-5881,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2198.841,2200.303,"Well, didn't... the Virginia Supreme Court did that, didn't it?"
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2200.303,2210.389,--I don't believe they do if you look at how... how this particular hearsay exception works and what the Virginia... Virginia Supreme Court has always required.
1998.98-5881,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2260.613,2261.394,Ms. Baldwin--
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2261.394,2262.115,--whether it's widely accepted--
1998.98-5881,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2262.115,2280.867,"--Ms. Baldwin, I understand what you said in the abstract, but I keep thinking of the... the statement here that was resisted was the statement that was highly inculpatory for Benjamin and made things look better."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2299.79,2311.337,"--I don't believe that any statement that Mark Lilly made in these confessions were in any way exculpatory of Mark Lilly, and that includes everything he said about his brother."
1998.98-5881,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2311.838,2313.649,"Well, isn't there something comparative?"
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2319.863,2339.925,"--The only issue in this case... and I think this is a significant factor for this case, and I think it completely distinguishes it from Lee v. Illinois and any of the other cases that have found... that have found this type of evidence inadmissible in those particular cases... and that is that the only issue in this case... the only issue... was who pulled the trigger."
1998.98-5881,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2342.267,2357.276,"But at the time the statement was given, it was quite evident I think that Mark might have been charged with being the trigger or being directly complicit in pulling the trigger or in doing the killing."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2362.592,2364.752,"Justice Kennedy, I disagree."
1998.98-5881,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2369.355,2373.488,"We can talk about the burden of proof later, but I mean, it's pretty common sense that you've got--"
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2373.488,2373.739,"No, I don't--"
1998.98-5881,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2373.739,2374.907,--a murder and three people.
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2379.622,2385.796,"--But by the time Mark Lilly was interviewed, Gary Barker had already confessed, had already interviewed."
1998.98-5881,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2392.469,2394.352,You're the one... you're the one that's introducing the statement.
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2397.114,2414.606,"--Maybe, Justice Kennedy, I didn't understand your question, but... but I think it's significant here that Mark Lilly was never suspected never suspected... of being the triggerman and he was told that by the police officer who was... who was interviewing him."
1998.98-5881,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2422.119,2426.283,When was... when was Mark charged or indicted?
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2426.283,2429.825,"--They were... I'm not sure of the exact date, but they were all charged--"
1998.98-5881,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2429.825,2442.133,"Are you saying that at no... at no point after the time that this third person, Barker, made his statement, that at no point did the State consider charging Mark with a capital offense?"
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2442.133,2443.183,--That's correct.
1998.98-5881,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2443.183,2445.035,And that's... was there a finding to that effect?
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2445.035,2446.625,"No, Your Honor."
1998.98-5881,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2454.77,2455.491,"Well, one statement was recanted."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2461.555,2462.997,"--Yes, from... from the record of... of--"
1998.98-5881,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2462.997,2463.375,--often--
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2463.375,2465.088,--of the confession.
1998.98-5881,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2465.088,2468.51,"--Sure, I mean, but officers never tell them things that are false?"
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2468.51,2471.773,"Well, but I don't... I don't think in... for... for the--"
1998.98-5881,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2471.773,2473.223,"You know, they say, you know, you're home free."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2475.904,2485.191,"--But, Justice Scalia, for the point that we're arguing, it wouldn't matter whether the police were lying or not because the point we're trying to look at now is what was Mark Lilly thinking when he made these statements."
1998.98-5881,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2485.191,2490.074,"Oh, and... and witnesses always believe what the police tell them when he says, you know, you're home free."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2496.028,2498.668,Mark Lilly's statements were a declaration against penal interest.
1998.98-5881,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2498.668,2513.06,"Well, I think it's very difficult to make out the case that when he says that his... his brother who... Ben was the triggerman, that that's a declaration against Mark Lilly's penal interest."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2513.06,2518.133,"It's what caused Mark Lilly to be indicted, tried, and convicted of first degree murder."
1998.98-5881,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2538.925,2548.022,"Now, how did the statement that his brother Ben pulled... was the triggerman... how did that incriminate Mark?"
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2548.022,2555.436,It made him an accomplice to first degree murder which in Virginia he is punished as a principal in the first degree except for capital murder.
1998.98-5881,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2560.151,2565.944,"Well, how... how did that statement by itself... Ben Lilly pulled... was the triggerman."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2568.846,2569.816,It established the murder.
1998.98-5881,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2581.653,2584.577,"But he had said other things that said, here I was."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2602.517,2605.209,--But... but Mark Lilly... and I have to go back to this.
1998.98-5881,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2614.835,2623.68,--Do the prosecuting attorneys in the State of Virginia... are they always bound by what the police tell the suspects when they charge?
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2623.68,2624.842,"No, they're not."
1998.98-5881,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2624.842,2625.533,"Of course, not."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2625.533,2630.145,"But here we're talking about the reliability of Mark Lilly's statements, and that's all we're talking about."
1998.98-5881,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2630.145,2642.824,"Ms. Baldwin, in... in deciding whether something is inculpatory or not, don't you have to take into account what information the police already have and what information the declarant knows the police already have?"
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2666.6,2672.414,"I think that's what the Miranda rights, though, told Mark Lilly, is anything you say is going to be used against you."
1998.98-5881,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2673.313,2673.984,That's fine.
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2676.415,2677.256,--Well--
1998.98-5881,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2677.256,2680.789,"I mean, it's not significantly inculpatory."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2687.793,2689.685,--I have to disagree.
1998.98-5881,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2696.398,2696.568,All right.
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2697.289,2698.731,"So, they were self inculpatory."
1998.98-5881,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2698.731,2707.997,"--Assuming that, you're still left with the point that everything he said also formed a pretty good predicate, if it was accepted, for avoiding the possibility of the death penalty."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2732.482,2739.568,I'm not sure the test is does... is the statement that the... the individual is giving to his advantage as to whether it's reliable or not.
1998.98-5881,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2760.551,2761.092,And let's assume--
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2761.092,2761.991,And he tells us that.
1998.98-5881,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2761.991,2779.413,"--Let's assume that it is, and let's assume also that it has a separate function, that it has a different character, and that different character is making certain that it will be his brother and not himself who is charged and convicted of, if anyone is convicted, of... of... or sentenced to death."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2779.413,2780.134,"But, Justice--"
1998.98-5881,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2780.134,2789.048,"And... and your answer to that, as I understand it, is, well, the police had indicated to him in advance that they did not understand him to be the triggerman."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2809.692,2819.48,"--I think that the cases have never held that if it is... if it is something that isn't in his best interest to say, that that somehow makes it unreliable."
1998.98-5881,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2906.585,2920.396,"Well, but I think when you... when you state those tests, you're getting away from the declaration against penal interest, and saying that may be this is a residual hearsay exception, that there are indicia of reliability."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2923.499,2928.874,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think that... that that's the way it came in."
1998.98-5881,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2935.586,2942.231,But I... I think it's very difficult just to see the statement in the abstract.
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2950.767,2954.409,"Well, otherwise Mark Lilly would not be guilty today."
1998.98-5881,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2966.908,2969.881,Why... why wasn't Barker's testimony good enough to put Mark away?
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2969.881,2972.552,"--Well, it certainly was, but--"
1998.98-5881,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2972.552,2973.152,"Well, then you--"
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2973.152,2974.482,--And that was additional evidence.
1998.98-5881,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2974.482,2978.256,"--Well, you know, but... but you say that Mark would not be in prison but for these statements."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2979.407,2980.056,"Well, if--"
1998.98-5881,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2980.056,2980.888,They had plenty of evidence.
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,2983.337,2997.757,"--I can tell you this, that if Mark Lilly had not pled guilty, if he had had a trial with a jury, this statement would have come in and the prosecutor would have argued that this statement showed that Mark Lilly committed first degree murder... was responsible for first degree murder."
1998.98-5881,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2997.757,3003.571,"You're saying the only reason he's in jail today is because of the statement he made to the officers, and that's just not correct, unless I... unless I misinterpreted--"
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3003.571,3004.332,I misspoke then.
1998.98-5881,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3028.047,3031.579,--Let's conceded that it's both inculpatory and exculpatory.
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3035.012,3038.455,"Well, I think that there are other indicia of reliability."
1998.98-5881,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3042.987,3045.551,But that was not the basis on which it came in.
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3046.099,3047.441,I think it is.
1998.98-5881,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3048.292,3050.823,Then I misunderstood your... your answer to the Chief Justice.
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3057.937,3059.4,"--Yes, it does."
1998.98-5881,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3059.4,3059.78,Okay.
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3064.511,3064.911,Correct.
1998.98-5881,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3081.214,3102.877,"But in any case, it would not be open to us if... if we think that... that it was not properly admitted insofar as... as a... an... a firmly established exception, it would not be open to us here to hold in your favor on grounds of... of... its carrying sufficient indicia of... of reliability."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3106.659,3109.762,"If... if... no, Your Honor."
1998.98-5881,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3110.793,3113.544,"I mean, we in the first place are not going to litigate that issue."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3113.544,3114.024,No.
1998.98-5881,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3125.062,3133.348,"Yes, but wasn't the reliability established by virtue of the statements being within the firmly established exception?"
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3133.348,3133.618,"Oh, no."
1998.98-5881,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3143.175,3151.118,"They said regardless of the penal interest exception, this is reliable, independently reliable regardless of the penal interest exception."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3152.03,3153.65,--No.
1998.98-5881,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3163.587,3164.218,That's what I thought.
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3164.218,3168.17,"And then in addition to that, there was also corroborating evidence to show its reliability."
1998.98-5881,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3175.796,3184.452,"May I ask on that question, in your view, to decide whether an exception is firmly rooted, is it sufficient that it's firmly rooted in Virginia?"
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3184.452,3187.323,We're not taking that... we're not taking--
1998.98-5881,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3187.323,3187.731,You don't take that position.
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3187.731,3187.972,--No.
1998.98-5881,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3187.972,3188.562,All right.
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3190.155,3190.713,Yes.
1998.98-5881,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3190.713,3212.288,"And if you've surveyed the States and you find that a... a given State, a hypothetical State, that says, yes, we have a... a declaration against penal interest exception to the hearsay rule, however that does not encompass declarations when they are by an accomplice against a third party, which side of the line would we count that State, as supporting a firmly rooted or as not supporting a firmly rooted?"
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3212.288,3215.541,I suppose the Court would have to put that in the not firmly rooted.
1998.98-5881,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3225.318,3226.937,"Well, I'd like to keep it categorical for the purpose of my question."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3226.937,3227.258,Correct.
1998.98-5881,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3227.258,3234.862,"And if you had a category in a given State the totally excluded accomplice statements even though they were self incriminating, you would say that should not count."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3234.862,3240.238,"I would think that would not count, but there's a minority of States that have said that in those terms--"
1998.98-5881,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3240.238,3241.387,I understand.
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3241.387,3242.399,--to my knowledge of any States--
1998.98-5881,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3242.399,3246.062,But there's a debate between the two of you on the extent to which there are those States--
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3246.062,3246.322,--I understand.
1998.98-5881,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3246.322,3249.952,"--So, that's a question we really have to research the State laws at some depth."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3249.952,3254.177,I think there are very few States that have said that in such categorical terms.
1998.98-5881,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3260.83,3268.054,I'm staying away from the reliability inquiry and looking at the cases that they tied to subcategorize in their reply brief.
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3268.054,3268.775,--Correct.
1998.98-5881,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3377.658,3383.411,"Ms. Baldwin, the Constitution does says something about the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him."
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3407.439,3408.898,"--Mr. Chief Justice, I see my light."
1998.98-5881,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3409.799,3410.11,Yes.
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3410.11,3412.941,"That is not our position, Justice Ginsburg."
1998.98-5881,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3413.593,3415.182,I think you've answered the question.
1998.98-5881,1,33779,katherine_p_baldwin,,3415.182,3415.512,--Thank you.
1998.98-5881,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3415.823,3418.695,"Mr. Sacks, you have 3 minutes remaining."
1998.98-5881,2,28687,ira_s_sacks,,3418.695,3420.925,"Mr. Chief Justice, we waive our rebuttal."
1998.98-5881,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3420.925,3423.96,The case is submitted.
