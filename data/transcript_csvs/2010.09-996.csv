2010.09-996,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.987,"We will hear, argument next this morning in Case 09-996, Walker v. Martin."
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,7.77,10.939,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,43.927,78.666,"What about the charge that, yes, we can agree with you that in general 5 years seems like a long time, but we have a brief from the Habeas Corpus Resource Center that says that in the 5 to 6-year delay category, 62 percent are dismissed on the merits, and that you can't tell; sometimes they do have merit, sometimes they do it as time-barred, and there is no rationale to when they do one or the other."
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,78.666,80.618,"Three brief responses, Your Honor."
2010.09-996,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,107.369,109.471,What was the third?
2010.09-996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,109.471,110.087,Would they have to?
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,125.097,134.452,California's policy is to take a first look at a habeas petition and determine whether it has a prima facie case or whether procedural bars are apparent.
2010.09-996,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,150.645,163.02,So basically you are taking the position or you are conceding that the California courts are not consistent in their application of the timeliness rule?
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,163.02,163.555,No.
2010.09-996,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,163.555,166.257,Your brief doesn't even try to defend that position.
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,171.476,172.41,"No, Your Honor."
2010.09-996,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,202.347,221.808,"Well -- I might be speaking for her, but I thought that the Habeas Corpus Resource Center brief showed that the court, the California court, did reach some cases where an explanation had not been proffered."
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,235.401,244.257,"The California Supreme Court, if the case is patently meritless -- and perhaps the procedural question of timeliness is more complex."
2010.09-996,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,244.257,247.209,How could it be complex when there is no justification offered?
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,247.209,250.244,The question of how long it was.
2010.09-996,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,250.244,268.288,"Well, they pointed to a certain number of cases that were 5 years or above in delay where no justification was offered, and in some they reached the merits and in others they applied a procedural bar."
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,270.055,275.526,"Well, the State court has discretion to determine on procedural grounds or on the merits--"
2010.09-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,275.526,281.946,Is there some Federal rule that says you have to apply a procedural ground before you decide the merits?
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,281.946,282.715,--There is not.
2010.09-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,282.715,286.084,So it's up to California which of the two it wants to use?
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,286.084,286.85,That's correct.
2010.09-996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,286.85,293.337,"--And in California, if it just says ""denied"" then the presumption is that it is denied on the merits, is that it?"
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,293.337,295.204,"That's correct, the lack of a prima facie case."
2010.09-996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,295.204,304.126,So if it's going to be denied on time bar grounds there has to be something to indicate that it's for that reason.
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,305.812,306.795,That's correct.
2010.09-996,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,310.631,318.885,So how do we know that the California court just thinks that the Federal question is too hard and it doesn't want to reach it?
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,332.093,338.263,First is this Court has never taken the position when measuring adequacy of assuming that the rule is inadequate.
2010.09-996,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,353.291,361.545,"Is it arbitrary and capricious for a court to take the ground of least resistance, to decide the cases on the easiest issue that's presented?"
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,362.747,363.93,I posit that it's not.
2010.09-996,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,445.468,449.253,"The phrase is ""substantial delay""."
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,470.0,472.201,"Yes, Your Honor, to both."
2010.09-996,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,507.125,512.01,When does the State think that Mr. Martin's claim became untimely?
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,512.01,519.996,Certainly he hasn't given any reason why he didn't present his additional claims at the time of his earlier habeas corpus challenges.
2010.09-996,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,534.589,535.456,So you think it--
2010.09-996,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,535.456,537.075,It's supposed to be filed within 60 days.
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,561.406,563.525,"Yes, it does weigh against."
2010.09-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,572.064,572.614,Yes.
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,587.308,588.158,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,588.158,591.276,So time -- time has nothing to do with that.
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,594.312,599.346,California has articulated that successive petitions are a type of delayed petition.
2010.09-996,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,620.795,631.835,"--But if we can take out the second and successive aspect of this and just focus on the timeliness, when does the State think that this -- that these claims became untimely?"
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,631.835,635.905,"It's a rule of reasonableness and diligence that's circumstantially based, and--"
2010.09-996,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,635.905,642.375,"Well, you have the circumstances here, so under those circumstances when did the claims become untimely?"
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,642.375,650.814,"--Under the Robbins case, it explains that you have a 5-month span from discovery of the claims to presentation of the claims would be reasonable."
2010.09-996,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,650.814,652.798,But claims here--
2010.09-996,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,652.798,654.35,The 5 months would be reasonable.
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,668.86,670.895,There isn't -- there isn't a defined timeline.
2010.09-996,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,689.106,695.01,"Well, I'm trying to get to even around, not -- not exact."
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,703.949,714.572,"The position of the State is that Robbins has indicated that 5 months is reasonable, 18 months is definitely too long, and that there is a discretion-based determination in the middle."
2010.09-996,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,714.572,731.433,"What if it's filed within 6 months and it's rejected as untimely, and the Petitioner wants to try to demonstrate that this represents a grave departure from the way these are normally handled by the California Supreme Court?"
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,735.068,743.158,He would point to the published authority and argue that his case was outside of the parameters of what the State had done in the past.
2010.09-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,772.427,774.629,"Do you think 5 years is too long, though?"
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,774.629,775.362,Yes.
2010.09-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,775.362,775.845,Yes.
2010.09-996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,775.845,793.441,"This was taken over by California from capital cases, but in the capital case context they have a 90-day presumption of timeliness."
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,806.6,809.1,"Respectfully, I must disagree."
2010.09-996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,819.574,829.947,"Was there a reason for then saying, well, in the capital context, we are going to make it clear that 90 days -- 90 days is timely."
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,832.482,834.851,To the other litigant rule?
2010.09-996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,834.851,835.634,Yes.
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,835.634,849.843,"They, I think, felt that the rule was adequate the way it was, that a circumstantially-based rule, a reasonableness-based rule, was sufficient to guide the conduct of litigants to tell them what they needed to do to present their case."
2010.09-996,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,849.843,851.879,"Well, why would it be different in the capital context?"
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,854.247,866.222,"Capital cases are significantly more complex, the punishments are -- are more significant, and so additional scrutiny might be warranted in those contexts."
2010.09-996,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,866.222,871.543,--I'm a little bit confused by your response to Justice Scalia.
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,956.213,958.564,I didn't follow the hypothetical.
2010.09-996,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,961.616,963.468,Getting time-barred.
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,964.901,965.684,And some of the individuals were getting relief?
2010.09-996,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,965.684,966.586,--Exactly.
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,966.586,969.286,Is there yet a third set of people who are getting--
2010.09-996,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,969.286,969.722,No.
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,995.838,997.59,"--That sounds inconsistent to me, Your Honor."
2010.09-996,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,998.056,998.556,It does.
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,998.556,1000.222,--But such a thing would not occur in California.
2010.09-996,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1000.222,1000.839,I'm sorry.
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,1001.322,1002.738,Such a thing would not occur in California.
2010.09-996,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1002.738,1004.607,"Well, that's the issue."
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,1004.607,1005.09,A meritorious--
2010.09-996,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1005.09,1011.428,Which is: What rule do you want us to impose and how does that rule capture that case?
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,1011.428,1017.748,--There is a specific exception for timeliness in California to preclude fundamental miscarriages of justice.
2010.09-996,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1019.45,1022.068,You are not answering my question.
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,1022.068,1022.951,--I misunderstood it.
2010.09-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1022.951,1024.251,Wait.
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,1065.495,1066.93,"I absolutely agree, Your Honor."
2010.09-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1073.0,1075.786,I don't see why the State has to be consistent in it.
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,1091.046,1093.498,"Just as occurred in this case, I absolutely agree, Your Honor."
2010.09-996,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1093.498,1104.686,But it doesn't answer why inconsistent application among similarly situated individuals should not provide an avenue of relief.
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,1104.686,1106.238,This Court has never reversed--
2010.09-996,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1106.238,1107.405,5 years is different.
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,1113.392,1120.712,"--First of all, this Court has only looked at the treatment of this individual, not disparate treatment of prior individuals."
2010.09-996,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1122.146,1123.364,"Oh, I don't disagree with you."
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,1149.648,1150.798,"--Yes, exactly."
2010.09-996,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1152.433,1154.885,"I don't understand your answer, then."
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,1197.546,1202.216,"--Well, I'm not sure."
2010.09-996,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1204.902,1207.318,"No, I know and I'm not suggesting that it would."
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,1207.318,1207.854,All right.
2010.09-996,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1207.854,1210.889,"But if it were to happen, would that be adequate?"
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,1210.889,1213.706,It doesn't sound like it would be adequate under this Court's prior tests.
2010.09-996,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1213.706,1218.393,So fair notice is not the only requirement.
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,1218.393,1239.123,"This Court has also required legitimate State interest, and this Court has used the legitimate State interests context, like for example in Smith v. Texas, where this Court has declared a particular kind of violation was a constitutional violation and the court exercised its discretion not to reach the violation, this Court found that the State had no legitimate State interest in such a ruling."
2010.09-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1241.408,1261.905,But -- but the cases that you are using in which we insisted upon adequacy in the sense of equal treatment of equal people are cases in which the effect of the State decision was to exclude the matter from Federal -- from Federal supervision.
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,1264.691,1265.574,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2010.09-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1265.574,1267.142,This is something quite different.
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,1285.604,1286.854,"Yes, Your Honor, exactly."
2010.09-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1286.854,1298.328,So I don't know why you -- you concede that -- that we take an adequacy rule that is used for one purpose and should apply it to a totally different situation.
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,1298.328,1301.964,It was the meritorious nature of the claims.
2010.09-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1308.85,1322.277,"But none of this is -- is a device as is used in the cases that -- that you are referring to that go into adequacy, a device to exclude the Federal courts from the case."
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,1324.245,1325.029,That's correct.
2010.09-996,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1325.029,1342.357,"I guess if the situation were such that a lawyer who is representing a client and has to figure out, has there been too much delay or not, suppose he looked into the situation thoroughly and he said, gee, I just have no idea, because half the cases come out one way and half of them come out the other way."
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,1351.129,1355.831,"Well, in California there is no such evidence, but I suppose that the lawyer could--"
2010.09-996,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1355.831,1356.533,All right.
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,1358.2,1358.75,--That's correct.
2010.09-996,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1358.75,1360.235,That's what I suspected from reading this.
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,1364.27,1364.92,Certainly.
2010.09-996,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1364.92,1365.806,Yes?
2010.09-996,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1365.806,1368.841,"That's not a question of adequacy, is it?"
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,1370.274,1371.058,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2010.09-996,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1371.058,1374.762,"Adequacy of notice, because no notice might be an inadequate notice."
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,1374.762,1375.328,That's correct.
2010.09-996,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1375.328,1378.114,And if it's absolutely divided 50/50 you have no notice.
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,1385.534,1399.027,"Within an area of discretion, like for example the finding of whether a piece of evidence was hearsay, if the court down the hall finds the evidence should be excluded and the court in the next room says it should be admissible, that is not necessarily--"
2010.09-996,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1399.027,1402.995,"I agree with you, we are in hypothetical, never-never land so far."
2010.09-996,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1409.049,1422.493,"And for it to be real -- just so I understand -- for it to be real, you have to have a defense counsel, a client comes to him with a non-frivolous Federal habeas claim, and the defense counsel says, I can't tell whether we are going to be barred by this time rule or not."
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,1431.295,1434.18,--California's rule is perfectly suited to such a scenario.
2010.09-996,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1445.888,1459.082,"What happens if a -- a person in this position is trying to investigate multiple claims at once, and some of them are ready to be put before the court and others are not?"
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,1473.322,1491.453,"The Gallego case specifically speaks to that exact circumstance and provides that if you have a good faith basis in investigating further triggering facts, you may withhold the claims that you have already -- or prepared, to prevent piecemeal presentation; and that is a perfectly acceptable explanation in California."
2010.09-996,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1491.453,1507.213,"Why is it, Mr. Marshall, that the -- the California courts have not been a little bit more transparent about what the presumptive time limits are?"
2010.09-996,0,43114,todd_marshall,,1520.103,1532.946,"Well, other than the Robbins decision, which speaks of 5 months as being reasonable, the court has tried to maintain a discretion-based, circumstantially-driven analysis in which they take different litigants into consideration."
2010.09-996,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1548.456,1549.322,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,1563.295,1565.497,"Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please the Court:"
2010.09-996,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1595.517,1602.67,"Well, but what did you present below, or what has Habeas Corpus Resource Center presented?"
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,1634.642,1638.009,Sanders was a 5-year case that is cited in my brief.
2010.09-996,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1638.876,1639.326,No.
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,1643.997,1647.115,"--I will speak to justification in just a moment, if I may."
2010.09-996,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1647.115,1647.782,Uh-huh.
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,1647.782,1650.817,Jones was an eight year case.
2010.09-996,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1711.725,1720.497,"These cases that you cite, before you go any further, are cases in which the California Supreme Court came out with an opinion saying that six years was okay?"
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,1725.651,1737.023,"They are -- well, in the Sanders case and in the Jones case, there were I believe they were decisions, in -- they were decisions."
2010.09-996,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1744.029,1749.767,"What do you mean they were decisions, written opinions or just went to the merits and decided the merits?"
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,1752.219,1766.626,"--They did say something about the delay question in at least two of the cases, well, at least in one of the cases, the Mitchell case, which was a two year delay, they said two years was unreasonable, but I didn't cite those and I cannot speak to--"
2010.09-996,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1766.626,1775.834,"The other side says, unless there is an opinion, the reason they may have gone to the merits is -- was just a lot easier."
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,1775.834,1779.619,"--To that extent, it's my recollection they went to the merits."
2010.09-996,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1803.531,1804.983,That's a puzzle to me.
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,1839.472,1851.862,"Well, in -- in any given year recently -- in recent history at least, there are about 800 truly silent denials, no explanation."
2010.09-996,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1873.295,1876.497,But that's -- they -- what's your point?
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,1879.032,1885.769,"That they have got to count in the adequacy, in the consistency application they have got to count against the Petitioner."
2010.09-996,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1885.769,1886.452,Why?
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,1886.452,1888.971,Because the Petitioner is the one who has the resources--
2010.09-996,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1888.971,1892.173,Then you can make any claim against him.
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,1902.981,1904.064,--No.
2010.09-996,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1904.897,1905.433,Yes.
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,1930.631,1937.035,--Not all -- not all habeas petitions in California are filed in lower courts.
2010.09-996,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1937.035,1937.987,"No, of course not."
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,1956.699,1957.616,That's the rule.
2010.09-996,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1957.616,1958.082,All right.
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,1963.036,1964.02,It is being applied.
2010.09-996,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1964.02,1968.189,In all courts below the California Supreme Court?
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,1968.189,1970.541,"In all courts below, I do not know."
2010.09-996,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1970.541,1971.641,So you do not know.
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,1994.407,1995.457,That would be a correct thing.
2010.09-996,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1995.457,1996.141,--All right.
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2015.82,2034.199,"The -- the lower appellate courts, there are six -- there are six district courts, there are six appellate districts, I guess, within the State of California."
2010.09-996,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2058.481,2065.92,But there is something called sampling techniques and sampling techniques are designed to limit the burden.
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2081.697,2084.315,Amicus did it with respect to the--
2010.09-996,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2084.315,2085.5,The wrong court.
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2105.395,2107.347,--That's an excellent point the Court makes.
2010.09-996,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2122.007,2122.84,That's true.
2010.09-996,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2122.84,2131.195,But everybody in this room can tell him that he is obligated to file the petition as promptly as the circumstances allow.
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2151.276,2158.18,That -- it is not a scenario that is likely to happen.
2010.09-996,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2167.569,2171.003,"You are not challenging that as the State rule, are you?"
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2171.003,2173.705,--That's the State rule that they proffer.
2010.09-996,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2190.698,2192.167,"Mr. Bigelow, is that right?"
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2203.475,2206.177,Five years is not untimely if--
2010.09-996,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2206.177,2213.93,"If there is a very good reason, but five years without an explanation is -- why is that a hard question?"
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2213.93,2229.34,"--Even with an explanation, five years is not beyond the pale of cases that have been previously decided and with respect to similarly situated litigants."
2010.09-996,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2244.552,2248.687,"And they didn't look at possible justifications at all, correct?"
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2248.687,2255.574,"There was no justification with respect to Mr. Martin's petition, that's correct."
2010.09-996,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2255.574,2256.526,"No, no."
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2257.576,2258.143,I'm sorry.
2010.09-996,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2258.143,2263.764,This -- the analysis that the amicus undertook simply looked at the chronological time.
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2275.654,2277.154,I would disagree.
2010.09-996,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2289.645,2295.783,How did they look -- did they look for explanations for delay when you had the one-sentence denial?
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2295.783,2303.239,"--I think the short answer to that is yes, but they also looked at silent denials as well."
2010.09-996,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2325.151,2329.353,How much range are you willing to give the State?
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2344.113,2347.231,It wouldn't be a problem.
2010.09-996,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2353.801,2354.401,It says
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2362.407,2368.228,"--Oh, if they went back with decisional law, decided the range?"
2010.09-996,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2368.228,2375.548,"You do the same sort of research you have done here, and you find out that -- that there is a three-month range."
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2384.571,2397.83,I would be in a lot more tenuous position arguing this case if there was some guidance to litigants with respect to what does constitute a reasonable time period within which to file.
2010.09-996,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2398.397,2412.507,"And suppose -- suppose California has a rule that said you have to file within one year of the finality of the conviction, absent good cause for the delay."
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2421.279,2426.415,"--If that were the rule, the petition would have been filed timely."
2010.09-996,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2434.936,2451.446,"But if there is a requirement of prompt -- as promptly as circumstances permit, wouldn't a person know that 5 years is not as prompt as circumstances permitted?"
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2451.446,2458.552,"There has -- my answer is no, because in California there are no guidelines."
2010.09-996,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2474.927,2477.863,Why was this petition not filed for 5 years?
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2477.863,2478.513,I'm sorry?
2010.09-996,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2478.513,2481.731,Why -- why was this petition not filed for 5 years?
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2481.731,2490.837,The record is -- does not speak to that point specifically.
2010.09-996,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2490.837,2508.735,But didn't this come about because it was returned -- this was not -- I'm thinking about -- he didn't -- he didn't make any claim that he was diligent.
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2508.735,2509.318,I'm sorry?
2010.09-996,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2509.318,2515.554,He didn't make any claim that he was diligent in filing it 5 years late.
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2515.554,2523.292,There were no claims made excusing the -- excusing the filing at that time period.
2010.09-996,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2523.292,2535.302,"Let's assume that California had just adopted this rule, this rule that habeas petitions have to be filed as promptly as circumstances permit."
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2555.697,2558.215,If this were a--
2010.09-996,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2558.215,2567.004,Do you really need case law to tell you that 5 years is not as promptly as circumstances permit when you -- when you have no justification?
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2567.004,2570.373,"--Decisional law is what our system is all about, Your Honor."
2010.09-996,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2570.373,2572.575,"Oh, so you can't have a first case?"
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2572.575,2583.616,"No, I think you can -- I think you can have a first case so long as -- so long as the standard itself is not so vague--"
2010.09-996,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2583.616,2584.283,"Oh, okay."
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2584.283,2592.472,--that reasonable -- that reasonable men -- so long as reasonable men are able to understand the standard.
2010.09-996,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2592.472,2595.857,You think reasonable men differ about 5 years?
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2595.857,2598.208,Well--
2010.09-996,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2598.208,2604.445,"Mr. Bigelow, isn't this similar to the rule that governed Federal habeas review prior to AEDPA?"
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2608.147,2615.151,"--If I recall, the standard was prejudicial delay, if I recall correctly."
2010.09-996,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2725.557,2732.961,"Now, I understand that you would have a much stronger case if you were dealing with a judge-made rule about timeliness."
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2752.856,2753.756,Judge-made.
2010.09-996,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2753.756,2756.641,"Judge-made, but it's been around for a long time."
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2759.593,2766.08,So a rule in a footnote in a capital case.
2010.09-996,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2766.08,2766.813,Let me get back.
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2779.44,2780.44,No.
2010.09-996,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2780.44,2781.006,No.
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2783.208,2784.775,Yes.
2010.09-996,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2784.775,2785.494,Okay.
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2785.494,2788.029,Just not the parameters of the rule.
2010.09-996,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2803.621,2813.744,"Isn't your argument that the California timeliness rule was never an adequate rule, never can proceed, never can bar consideration of a Federal claim?"
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2813.744,2827.587,The -- had the -- never.
2010.09-996,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2844.698,2849.417,What if Mr. Walker had waited 20 years; would it still be inadequate as to him?
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2849.417,2854.721,--In -- that's not -- that's not this case.
2010.09-996,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2865.529,2877.77,"Well, why can't you take the brackets of -- what was it, 5 months is reasonable time; 18 months is not a reasonable time."
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2883.573,2890.91,"--Certainly one -- one could do that, but that hasn't been established as the brackets, and it is, after all, California's rule."
2010.09-996,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2900.952,2905.17,I thought there was a decision that 18 months was too long.
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2905.17,2907.272,Not a decision that said that.
2010.09-996,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2913.426,2915.712,There was a decision that said 18 months is too long.
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,2915.712,2919.247,"There was a decision that said a 16-month period, but that was pre-Clark."
2010.09-996,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3040.59,3045.125,How many of these petitions are filed each year in the California Supreme Court?
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,3045.125,3049.845,"--Approximately 2,500, give or take."
2010.09-996,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3049.845,3050.578,Approximately what?
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,3050.578,3057.349,"Approximately 2,500, based on a LexisNexis kind of search."
2010.09-996,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3057.349,3083.233,"With that many petitions, is there any possibility that a multifactor test such as the one that California is applying could be applied with any degree of regularity, unless there is some sort of secret internal guidelines that are being applied by the California Supreme Court in deciding this?"
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,3083.233,3084.352,That's the problem.
2010.09-996,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3121.108,3135.034,"It's like having rules; when you have rules and say 60 days or 90 days, you find impossible cases that you should have heard because it was the 91st day or it was the 92nd day, and then you give the people equitable discretion to depart from it, and pretty soon you get litigation over that."
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,3136.884,3141.188,Discretion to depart from a rule that has been violated is one thing.
2010.09-996,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3150.711,3165.571,"So is the solution for California to say, if you delay more than a year from when you should have known you are barred, except we will excuse it for any number of reasons?"
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,3165.571,3165.987,Certainly.
2010.09-996,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3165.987,3171.224,That would be a regularly and consistently applied rule in your mind?
2010.09-996,1,35514,michael_r_bigelow,,3172.158,3184.015,"Well, it wouldn't necessarily be consistently applied until we are down the road and we learn how consistently it has, in fact, been applied, but certainly it would be an appropriate rule."
