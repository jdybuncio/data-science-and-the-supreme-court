1998.98-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.236,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 98-97, Eloise Anderson v. Brenda Roe and Anna Doe."
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,10.758,15.812,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-97,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,43.422,64.444,"Well, when... when you... when you have a... an alleged invasion of the right to travel, the right to move to another State freely and enjoy the benefits there as a new resident, we have applied something other than rational basis scrutiny to test that invasion."
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,68.418,69.769,--I think what--
1998.98-97,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,69.769,70.59,--stricter test.
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,70.59,73.963,--I am not asking you to abandon the stricter test.
1998.98-97,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,83.92,92.415,"Well, certainly we have some authority from this Court that durational residence requirements do affect the right to travel."
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,92.415,105.174,"--Except that our durational residency requirement, because it affects only a benefit level decision... it does not affect eligibility... is not therefore a penalty."
1998.98-97,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,109.929,125.848,"Well, I... I think you'd be hard pressed to tell a family that is forced to live on welfare that instead of getting California's, let's say, $600 a month, it has to live on $300 a month for a year, that that's not a penalty."
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,129.761,145.843,"--Because our statute is carefully crafted to avoid the considerations that you're talking about, Your Honor, our statute is carefully crafted to be a temporary level, a temporary level of 1 year, and the family is eligible for all of California's welfare benefits."
1998.98-97,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,153.746,167.156,"Well, just on that standard of... of review point, if we were to find... and I know you... you disagree with this, but if we... if we thought that the right of travel were implicated here, were affected here, would the standard then be strict scrutiny?"
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,167.156,183.586,"Yes, it would be if... if the... if our statute touched on the right to travel more than just incidentally and remotely, and at best our statute impacts upon that right remotely and incidentally."
1998.98-97,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,197.986,219.389,"But, Mr. Garelis, I thought that was the whole point of this line of cases, that the newcomer, unless there's a reason to suspect that they're going to take the benefit and run... that the newcomer should be treated like the long-term residents, that that is the genius of the United States, that people can pick their States and States can't pick their people."
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,219.389,224.863,"--California is not picking its people, and people are fully able--"
1998.98-97,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,224.863,230.386,It's making a distinction between longer-term residents and the person who is a newcomer.
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,258.096,271.344,"--But the cases that discuss this do it in terms of cases like Shapiro and Memorial Hospital where there's an absolute denial of benefits, and we do not have an absolute denial of benefits."
1998.98-97,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,273.107,284.495,"Well, I suppose you could think of the Maricopa County as not a denial of benefits because they were given emergency care, so it wasn't they couldn't get any benefits."
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,284.495,289.977,"--But there was a complete denial of non-emergency care, and we don't have that in our case."
1998.98-97,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,298.432,303.567,But I'm puzzled why you say that that... that that is not... does not impact the right of travel.
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,310.042,310.413,No.
1998.98-97,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,310.413,311.524,That's not the objective of the statute.
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,311.875,312.115,No.
1998.98-97,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,325.332,325.513,All right.
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,327.683,332.058,"There is an impact on the right of travel, but it's not sufficient."
1998.98-97,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,334.672,338.011,"Well, it's... it's the second of the two purposes you offered to explain the statute."
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,341.634,343.297,I'm sorry.
1998.98-97,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,344.115,346.659,"Well, you said that there were two objectives of the statute."
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,360.381,365.014,"No, it isn't because, as I stated, we're making a very careful distinction here."
1998.98-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,392.061,396.533,You're saying that the elimination of an incentive is not necessarily a deterrent.
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,396.533,397.184,--That's correct.
1998.98-97,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,397.184,399.587,I don't understand that.
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,443.408,450.704,"Well, in... under Shapiro, the people affected by those statutes were not eligible for benefits."
1998.98-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,452.507,453.117,"No, I understand that."
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,476.834,482.29,It's constitutional because our statute should be judged under the rational basis standard.
1998.98-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,507.825,509.986,"So, you... you acknowledge it's a matter of degree."
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,509.986,519.352,--And I believe this Court has acknowledged that in the footnote in Shapiro which states that not all waiting periods are penalties because our statute--
1998.98-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,519.352,530.8,"They said that... well, I mean, they could have said that not all waiting periods are penalties simply because some of them may be made to assure that the... a person coming into the State genuinely wishes to become a resident."
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,534.192,538.836,"--I don't... I don't believe in... in terms of the footnote in Shapiro, that it makes that qualification."
1998.98-97,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,567.277,569.46,Is it a part... does the same principle apply at the other end?
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,594.395,595.276,"--Well, I don't believe so."
1998.98-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,602.742,605.413,"Well, but your tax standards are generally rational basis."
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,617.892,624.386,"--Well, whenever people move from one State to another, there are differences... changes in all forms."
1998.98-97,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,632.804,636.234,"So, I just want to know where... how far this principle goes."
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,663.282,677.633,"There's something very different and distinct about what California is doing because California has carefully limited what it's doing to merely the benefit level, and States have the prerogative and do have different benefit levels--"
1998.98-97,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,677.633,684.326,"Well, I can understand that in terms of, say, workers' compensation or unemployment compensation."
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,695.314,704.92,"--I think what you have to look at, the analysis that would have to be done is you look and see whether or not there has been a detriment to the person who has moved."
1998.98-97,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,713.128,718.791,"I'm giving you the concrete example of unemployment compensation, workers' compensation."
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,718.791,718.991,--Okay.
1998.98-97,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,718.991,724.034,You get less... you got less in your original State.
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,730.187,733.87,"Since it's... since it's a benefit, since... I would say the answer is it would be the same."
1998.98-97,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,737.323,739.005,How about a car registration?
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,762.812,771.598,"If it's an easily quantifiable amount and you can tell that the person is receiving no detriment upon moving, if it's--"
1998.98-97,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,771.598,772.647,It's a hundred dollars.
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,778.661,783.975,--I would tend to say that it would probably be judged under the rational basis scrutiny.
1998.98-97,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,783.975,786.526,"Could California then say, for 1 year you pay a hundred dollars?"
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,786.526,792.31,If it's temporary and if there is no detriment to the person when they cross the border--
1998.98-97,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,792.31,792.56,"Well, tell me."
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,793.041,795.692,"--I... I don't see that detriment, no."
1998.98-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,795.692,798.136,You say it's... it's judged under the... under the same test.
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,801.398,801.568,No.
1998.98-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,801.836,802.347,--the way this one does.
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,802.347,802.898,--I believe--
1998.98-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,802.898,808.333,"People generally don't move to get a lower license fee, and it is thought that people do move to get higher welfare benefits."
1998.98-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,808.333,810.706,"Yes, but they move to get lower tax rates all the time."
1998.98-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,810.706,814.798,"Well, and that... that one may well come out the other way."
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,814.798,820.37,--What we are merely suggesting is that rational basis would be the correct scrutiny.
1998.98-97,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,822.483,822.803,Mr. Garelis--
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,845.378,851.112,"--Well, I believe the Sosna case leads you towards that direction."
1998.98-97,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,882.944,895.474,"Mr. Garelis, I thought when we discussed those two cases before, you recognized... perhaps you didn't... that there is in both a genuine suspicion the person has come into the State to get a benefit and then go."
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,914.044,933.118,"--I recognize that, but on the other hand, the question was has it been determined that a... by this Court that a waiting period that does not impact... that waiting periods don't necessarily impact the fundamental right to travel absolutely."
1998.98-97,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,947.778,948.248,--If I--
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,961.795,985.491,The congressional authorization is important because it shows that the concerns underlying the right to travel are met and have been considered by this program because the right to travel... the point of this... of... of this Court's concerns and all of our concerns about the right to travel is whether it breaks up our country.
1998.98-97,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,994.086,995.488,How are they minimized?
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1000.09,1003.233,Congress is not saying go ahead and vulcanize.
1998.98-97,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1019.074,1019.224,Right.
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1033.983,1045.231,"It's a legitimate purpose because, number one, Congress has shown that the concerns underlying the right to travel are greatly minimized in this case and it... and it also--"
1998.98-97,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1045.231,1049.095,"Well, but that... that has nothing to do with whether Congress says so or not."
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1075.257,1082.62,"--Well, I... I think the point really here is that nobody is being denied welfare benefits."
1998.98-97,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1082.62,1085.094,"--Well, they're being denied whatever the differential is."
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1096.173,1102.728,They're being denied those benefits and those benefits simply are not substantial enough to trigger strict scrutiny.
1998.98-97,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1102.728,1105.202,You're saying they're de minimis?
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1105.202,1105.863,"Basically, yes."
1998.98-97,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1105.863,1106.083,All right.
1998.98-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1106.564,1110.207,--How can you say that if there's a differential in the cost of living between two States.
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1116.101,1117.914,Because the--
1998.98-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1117.914,1120.415,"If it was adequate in Mississippi, it's got to be adequate in California?"
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1121.604,1128.219,--There's no guarantee that the amount of cash aid is adequate in either the State that someone is coming from or the State--
1998.98-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1128.219,1144.24,"Well, but the State legislature in California has made a judgment that $600 is the adequate minimum for ever... whatever class of beneficiary you have, which is... and anything less than that, I would assume, the... even though it may be adequate in another State is not adequate in California."
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1146.401,1149.322,--I would beg to differ with Your Honor on one point.
1998.98-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1164.575,1165.987,Determined to--
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1165.987,1168.439,--budgetary constraints of the State of California.
1998.98-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1168.439,1170.339,--They may just have decided that's all we want to spend on it.
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1170.339,1172.719,I believe that's exactly what it is.
1998.98-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1181.404,1185.197,"Well, but if your objective is to save money, which you say, why don't they just cut them in half for everybody?"
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1190.27,1190.811,Sure.
1998.98-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1190.811,1192.594,--You mentioned the fiscal justification for it.
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1201.008,1207.055,"No, I don't believe... I'm... I'm not aware of what the record states the whole impact on the budget."
1998.98-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1219.621,1220.683,Without knowing what it is?
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1220.683,1222.182,--Excuse me?
1998.98-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1222.182,1225.595,Do they... do they know what the cost saving is for the program as a whole.
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1226.386,1226.766,Yes.
1998.98-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1227.598,1229.758,And can you tell us what it is?
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1229.758,1230.86,As--
1998.98-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1230.86,1232.09,As a percentage of the total budget.
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1232.09,1233.823,--I'm not aware of the percentage--
1998.98-97,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1233.823,1235.853,Of the total welfare budget I mean.
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1235.853,1238.064,--I... I... I'm not aware of those figures.
1998.98-97,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1238.064,1239.375,"Mr. Garelis, do you--"
1998.98-97,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1239.375,1240.167,--What's the absolute figure?
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1246.882,1284.589,"As stated at page appendix 37 of our petition, paragraph 6, for the '97-'98 fiscal year, the California Department of Social Services projected, because we haven't been able to implement the statute... projected that the implementation of the statute would reduce total AFDC, now TANF, expenditures by $22.8 million, and of that total reduction, California general fund expenditures would be reduced by $10.9 million."
1998.98-97,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1284.589,1291.412,"Well, you can't just use... you can't save money just by, I mean, randomly selecting people to pay less, can you?"
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1300.959,1312.467,"Well, if... if that does not impact the fundamental right and does not impact a suspect class, then that program would be adjudicated under a rational basis--"
1998.98-97,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1312.467,1313.147,How about 5 years?
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1324.086,1327.268,"--I think my answer would be different for a variety of reasons, Your Honor."
1998.98-97,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1327.268,1328.408,A different standard of review?
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1328.408,1331.21,"I think very probably so, Your Honor."
1998.98-97,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1343.297,1346.009,"So, if you say 5 years, the answer would be different than 1 year."
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1346.009,1361.891,"--Anytime you increase the... the disability under which the person is impacted, obviously you're getting closer and closer to something in Shapiro and Memorial Hospital, which is an absolute denial."
1998.98-97,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1383.605,1388.798,"So, even under the rational basis test, if it were, say, 2 years, that would be no good, but the 1 year is all right."
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1388.798,1399.286,"At every point where you increase the time period, the temporary time period, I think you're getting closer and closer to a permanent."

1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1420.56,1422.533,Why did the State pick 1 year?
1998.98-97,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1422.533,1423.221,Yes.
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1423.221,1423.351,1 year--
1998.98-97,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1423.351,1426.193,What's the justification for 1 as opposed to another number?
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1426.193,1432.238,--1 year would appear to be an amount that... that does not sufficiently implicate the right to travel.
1998.98-97,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1433.69,1435.66,"In other words, it was as much as they thought they could get away with."
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1436.832,1441.396,--I think they thought it was the amount that was... would be constitutionally appropriate.
1998.98-97,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1441.396,1449.513,"Look, what I'm trying to get at... let me just... suppose you cut 30 percent from everybody whose name began with Q. All right?"
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1454.086,1458.8,"That would not appear to be rational, and I'm not going to argue that it is rational."
1998.98-97,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1461.772,1463.504,"Thank you, Mr. Garelis."
1998.98-97,0,42715,theodore_garelis,,1463.504,1463.774,Thank you.
1998.98-97,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1463.774,1465.565,"General Waxman, we'll hear from you."
1998.98-97,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1465.565,1474.691,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-97,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1488.622,1496.686,I just don't understand how if it impacts on the right to travel... I don't see how the Federal Government can do it any more than... than a State.
1998.98-97,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1496.686,1497.457,"--Well, Justice--"
1998.98-97,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1497.457,1499.087,And I'd like you to explain that to us.
1998.98-97,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1499.087,1501.799,--I... I would like to explain it and I hope to explain it.
1998.98-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1525.725,1530.139,Are you saying Congress can authorize burdens on the right to move from State to State?
1998.98-97,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1530.139,1534.8,--Congress cannot eliminate the... the right of--
1998.98-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1534.8,1536.062,If you could tell me the answer to that question.
1998.98-97,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1536.062,1541.195,--Congress can regulate interstate movement and to some extent it can define the--
1998.98-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1541.195,1546.401,But can it just... can it pass something specifically intended to discourage movement from one State to another?
1998.98-97,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1546.401,1565.472,"--I don't know whether it could do it purely for that purpose, but just as Congress but not the States can regulate and burden interstate commerce, Congress can also define to some extent the incidence of... the incident of national citizenship that constitutes the interest in migration."
1998.98-97,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1565.472,1565.603,Why?
1998.98-97,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1565.603,1565.733,And I suggest--
1998.98-97,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1565.733,1566.054,Why?
1998.98-97,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1579.264,1612.847,"--Well, I think, Justice Souter, it's important when one talks about the right to travel, which is an enormously inarticulate phrasing of essentially an interest that encompasses both a prohibition or a restraint against direct impediments to move from one State to another and a prohibition against the States treating some of their residents less well than others because of recent migration, in effect, putting a penalty on people for recent migration."
1998.98-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1639.807,1643.537,"No, but you're supposed to be answering a question about where Congress gets the power to do all this."
1998.98-97,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1643.537,1651.895,"--Well, Congress... for example, in Shapiro, the Court said a State may not act to fence out poor people or may not act to fence out--"
1998.98-97,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1651.895,1652.866,Does that imply that Congress can fence people out?
1998.98-97,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1652.866,1655.048,--The Congress is not fencing anybody out.
1998.98-97,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1673.934,1681.128,"No, but the argument here is that California is treating its own citizens based upon... in a... in a differential fashion."
1998.98-97,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1690.274,1693.626,I don't think it does per se.
1998.98-97,2,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2075.452,2079.125,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.98-97,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2105.552,2118.799,"They're free to travel, and I assume travel includes I have just as much a right to go to another State temporarily and enjoy the protections of that State temporarily as I do to go and migrate there."
1998.98-97,2,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2118.799,2119.851,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1998.98-97,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2119.851,2128.306,"And yet, when I go to another State, am I entitled... and I'm there just temporarily, am I entitled to send my children to the State schools?"
1998.98-97,2,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2128.306,2131.401,"Well, that would be an Article IV question, Your Honor, but that... that's not the--"
1998.98-97,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2131.401,2133.52,Why isn't the right to travel affected?
1998.98-97,2,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2143.88,2145.633,--Your Honor is referring to a nonresident.
1998.98-97,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2146.314,2150.745,"A nonresident, but exercising... exercising his constitutional right to travel."
1998.98-97,2,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2150.745,2171.101,"The answer, Justice Scalia, was most recently stated in this Court's opinion in Bray at page 277, and that is, we are at a point in the jurisprudence that the right of free interstate migration includes not only protection against the erection of actual barriers, but it means that interstate travelers are treated no differently than intrastate travelers."
1998.98-97,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2172.19,2173.592,I... I don't understand.
1998.98-97,2,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2174.832,2176.274,--The... the problem with--
1998.98-97,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2176.274,2182.688,"It seems to me my right to travel is certainly being affected, but it seems to me not significantly."
1998.98-97,2,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2188.191,2190.132,"--I don't... don't agree with that, Your Honor."
1998.98-97,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2190.132,2190.402,All right.
1998.98-97,2,36552,mark_d_rosenbaum,,2192.235,2209.516,"Because the second part of the equation with respect to the liberty producing values that we're talking about is that once an individual chooses to move to a State for whatever reason she chooses, establishes bona fide residence, the Constitution creates a relationship between the citizen and the State."
