1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,48.408,50.392,It has not yet been superseded.
1971.70-4,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,70.716,80.51,"But as of July next year, 1972, the new legislation would washout this problem, is that correct?"
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,80.51,84.765,It does remove the distinction between (Voice Overlap)
1971.70-4,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,84.765,86.293,The plain discrimination.
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,86.293,86.46,Yes.
1971.70-4,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,86.46,87.398,The alleged discrimination.
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,90.003,90.183,Right.
1971.70-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,90.183,94.018,You have no contention that technical rules of the state (Inaudible)
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,94.018,95.364,No.
1971.70-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,115.199,119.491,And this lady (Inaudible) statute in any way.
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,119.491,120.852,"No, she is out --"
1971.70-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,120.852,122.139,(Inaudible)
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,122.139,126.664,"That is right, unless she can get relief here."
1971.70-4,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,126.664,131.192,Mr. Derr I take it that the new act was not prompted by this litigation?
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,131.192,134.646,I do not think it is at all.
1971.70-4,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,134.646,134.883,Would you give us --
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,134.883,136.168,I just thought --
1971.70-4,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,136.168,140.418,Would you give us some enlightenment as to the significance of this particular probate?
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,146.579,150.829,"We do not know for sure, Your Honor."
1971.70-4,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,158.212,160.984,So that this is essentially a test (Inaudible)?
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,160.984,166.066,"Basically, except that it is also a matter of principle on behalf of Mrs. Reed."
1971.70-4,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,166.066,172.646,"Well, someone paid for it?"
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,172.646,173.882,If they --
1971.70-4,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,173.882,176.781,Are the Reeds incidentally separated or not?
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,176.781,187.489,"The Reeds although, it does not appear in the record Your Honor, the Reeds have been divorced since 1958."
1971.70-4,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,235.984,245.115,We had a case some years back involving in both cases a bartender in Michigan?
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,245.115,248.887,"If the Court please, that was the Goesaert case that you are talking about sir."
1971.70-4,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,248.887,251.798,I forgot the name of it.
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,251.798,258.004,"That case was decided, Your Honor on a premise that we feel is no longer tenable."
1971.70-4,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,338.112,348.752,But there a mis-connection could -- the Idaho Court have appointed Mr. and Mrs. Reed as joint administrators?
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,348.752,357.942,There is a serious question on my mind because of the mandatory provisions and our Supreme Court in the case we are appealing from is that that provision is mandatory.
1971.70-4,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,357.942,364.574,"Well, what is the practical aspect in the day to day routine of the Idaho Probate Courts, do they do this?"
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,364.574,374.238,I have known them personally and in fact this has been so except by ascent and never in this type of equal relationship.
1971.70-4,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,394.957,401.694,So that at a Court in your view then may not appoint both even though it is inclined to do so and even though both agree?
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,401.694,412.43,"I would think that the interpretation that was given to this case is the interpretation that might be given by other Courts and that no, they would not appoint both."
1971.70-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,412.43,425.018,In your view does this statute take up whenever -- to a man and woman apply and they are just equally entitled in terms of the class they are in?M
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,425.018,425.755,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,425.755,426.832,Is that where it picks up?
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,426.832,427.627,That is where it picks up.
1971.70-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,427.627,451.207,"Because it does equally entitle then you might say that before the statute makes the choice there would have to be a hearing as to what the respective qualifications are for these two people and it would only be when they are found to be absolutely equally qualified to act that the statute would make the choice, but I gather that is not the way it was?"
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,451.207,452.524,It is not the way I read it.
1971.70-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,463.793,466.041,But people like (Voice Overlap)
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,466.041,469.427,Degree of affinity to the receiver.
1971.70-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,469.427,482.198,"But -- excuse me, let us assume now that two people applying there in the same category like as you suggest but then one of them claims that the other one is say, mentally defective."
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,482.198,484.494,There would have to be a hearing on that subject.
1971.70-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,484.494,492.189,"Well, let us assume there are two people in that category and one of them says I am better qualified than the other."
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,492.189,498.43,"That is the determination of Judge as well, except for this mandatory statute."
1971.70-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,503.54,506.35,"Well, I know but what about the mentally defective case then?"
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,506.35,508.737,Let the Court decided on the basis of the merits.
1971.70-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,508.737,509.928,Exactly.
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,525.309,531.354,"I do not think that their assertion would be sufficient, it has to be proved."
1971.70-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,531.354,534.518,"Well, what if the person happens to be a man?"
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,543.587,549.581,They do have to determine these factors.
1971.70-4,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,549.581,558.223,"Well, then you are conceding that there is a determination of comparative attitude within the scope of the statute."
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,558.223,559.984,"No, Your Honor there is not."
1971.70-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,559.984,563.617,Except when somebody alleges the other fellow as disqualified?
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,563.617,564.1,If they allege that --
1971.70-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,564.1,566.839,Pointing out that there was (Voice Overlap) or something.
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,566.839,570.485,They would probably have to have a hearing and prove.
1971.70-4,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,570.485,577.946,Are you saying that a drunken husband has the absolute right over a able competent wife.
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,577.946,581.897,Unless the wife is able to come in and convince the Court that he is --
1971.70-4,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,581.897,583.791,"Well, does she got the right to do it?"
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,587.179,589.439,We have to read our statutes in --
1971.70-4,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,589.439,590.397,That was my question?
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,590.397,592.002,-- to get her right.
1971.70-4,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,592.002,612.488,"But if there might be other statute that qualify anybody, man or woman, if he is a deaf, dumb and blind or if he is a 7 years old or if he is a multiple amputee or so on, but -- this -- we are dealing with this statute and we must take it as it is interpreted by the Supreme Court of the State and the State has interpreted the statute very clearly, has it not?"
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,612.488,613.009,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,613.009,622.138,"But was that not -- I gather that there has not been any claim that of this lady or this gentleman, suffers any disability -- (Inaudible)"
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,622.138,624.065,The record shows no â€“ what?
1971.70-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,624.586,625.72,No such claims were made?
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,625.72,626.615,No such claims --
1971.70-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,626.615,641.032,"All that has happened here is that -- equally entitled I gather is that they are in the degree of consanguinity whatever it is which had made them equally entitled and the statute then operates to compel the appointment of the male, is that it?"
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,641.032,645.058,That is exactly what we are here for.
1971.70-4,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,648.212,650.608,But I wish to get your position entirely clear.
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,659.998,685.702,"The statute is mandatory, but I am not closing the door to someone being able to have a hearing but let me run down the only other disqualification in our statute, non-residence, minors, persons convicted of infamous crime and persons incompetent by reason of drunkenness, and providence or one of understanding her integrity, those are defined."
1971.70-4,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,685.702,688.493,One of understanding.
1971.70-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,688.493,691.931,"If I think that has to be claimed, it has to be claimed?"
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,691.931,693.712,It has to be claimed.
1971.70-4,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,693.712,695.571,And it is not to be in this case?
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,695.571,696.428,True.
1971.70-4,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,696.428,699.618,But did you make an attempt to claim on behalf of your client?
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,699.618,710.65,"No, we did not because we felt that our client was better, my client was better qualified to administer the estate for many reasons."
1971.70-4,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,715.107,719.442,But you made no attempt to display her qualifications otherwise?
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,719.442,721.369,We had no opportunity to.
1971.70-4,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,745.808,746.109,When you say you did not get --
1971.70-4,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,746.109,748.139,Did you make an offer of proof?
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,748.139,752.512,"No, Your Honor."
1971.70-4,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,752.512,760.031,"Well could not -- I do not think I have got this clear yet, some confusion on the aspect."
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,775.608,783.778,The statute and its mandatory preference was imposed and as a matter of fact I do not think there would be a hearing at all with this.
1971.70-4,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,783.778,787.7,"(Inaudible) was a hearing, before the Probate Court?"
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,787.7,792.97,That it was perfunctory and decision was based strictly on the statute.
1971.70-4,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,792.97,796.876,The hearing just established that your client was a woman and that the defendant was man?
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,796.876,798.566,This is correct.
1971.70-4,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,798.566,810.458,"And as the Supreme Court of the State says that you follow the areas where a choice must be made under the legislature by enacting the statute made the determination, that is the way your Supreme Court has construed your statute?"
1971.70-4,0,15807,allen_r_derr,,810.458,813.046,Yes sir.
1971.70-4,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,813.046,819.304,So we should take this as though the parties had conceded that both parties are equally qualified?
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,1901.827,1908.389,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-4,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2015.974,2018.308,The decedent was an adopted child?
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2018.308,2018.884,what was that?
1971.70-4,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2018.884,2020.628,Was the decedent an adopted child (Voice Overlap) --
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2020.628,2022.423,That was an adopted child.
1971.70-4,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2023.115,2030.332,"-- Mr. Stout and the litigants in this case are divorced, are they?"
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2030.332,2030.772,They are what?
1971.70-4,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2030.772,2032.507,"They are divorced, are they?"
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2032.507,2036.04,They were divorced in 1958.
1971.70-4,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2036.04,2039.648,How old was the decedent at the time of his death?
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2039.648,2040.675,How old was the child?
1971.70-4,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2040.675,2041.16,Yes.
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2041.983,2043.103,Sixteen years old.
1971.70-4,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2043.103,2043.848,Sixteen years old.
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2043.848,2049.666,Yes.
1971.70-4,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2049.666,2053.28,And in whose custody was the -- so the child was a minor and in whose custody --
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2053.28,2056.734,The woman filed a divorce suit against her husband.

1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2185.747,2187.973,What was that sir?

1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2211.246,2219.85,I do not believe it would Your Honor because we are talking about a matter of procedure that is always -- that is only incidental to the distribution of property.
1971.70-4,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2241.57,2247.465,But I believe that the (Inaudible)
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2247.465,2248.422,What was that?
1971.70-4,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2248.422,2256.344,"The Equal protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is in the Constitution and it binds Idaho, is that right?"
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2256.344,2257.967,"That is true, Your Honor."
1971.70-4,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2257.967,2275.605,Does not that provision in the State of Idaho (Inaudible)
1971.70-4,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2275.605,2278.448,"While you are thinking on that, then let us take the more interesting question."
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2292.132,2296.254,I think that is the same law -- I think the same rule would be applicable.
1971.70-4,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2297.283,2300.412,You simply say that is not an equal protection problem?
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2300.412,2300.825,"No, I do not."
1971.70-4,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2300.825,2302.035,It is a State question?
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2302.035,2310.098,I do not feel that would make a protection problem.
1971.70-4,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2419.985,2426.323,Mr. Stout I asked Mr. Derr whether this new statute was the result of this litigation.
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2430.589,2431.324,What?
1971.70-4,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2431.324,2435.324,Whether this litigation had prompted the adoption of a new code in Idaho?
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2435.324,2435.559,No.
1971.70-4,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2438.223,2441.22,It is a uniform code?
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2441.22,2442.163,Yes.
1971.70-4,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2459.215,2464.996,While I have you interrupted are you counsel for Mr. Reed as administrator?
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2464.996,2472.499,"I am counsel for him, yes, and I represented him in Probate Court and at the time of the hearing, original hearing in this case."
1971.70-4,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2472.499,2477.995,Do you have a requirement in your present code that an inventory be filed by a certain date?
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2477.995,2478.689,Yes.
1971.70-4,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2478.689,2479.839,And has it been filed?
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2479.839,2488.632,It has not because I thought that the appeals suspended the procedure in appropriate court and I was not authorized to file one.
1971.70-4,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2488.632,2490.44,Is that true in your practice?
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2490.44,2494.088,That is what I understand it to be.
1971.70-4,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2494.088,2496.303,So an appeal just dumps everything?
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2496.303,2496.898,Yes.
1971.70-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2502.549,2510.464,So the creditors get to file claims or anything?
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2510.464,2511.963,I am not sure about that.
1971.70-4,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2533.297,2548.553,"If this had been a large estate, substantial investments, could you have had a special representative appointed in the interim to deal with problems pending the resolution of the appeal?"
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2548.553,2559.563,"Those under the Idaho statutes are only appointed where the -- where there is some reason for it like property that is liable to depreciate, or some purpose."
1971.70-4,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2774.362,2778.443,"And your position is that men are just more equal, right?"
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2778.443,2779.295,What?
1971.70-4,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2779.295,2785.296,Your position is that men just happened to be more equal?
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2785.296,2786.656,Excuse me --
1971.70-4,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2786.656,2792.945,"Well, you said that if they are equally qualified, the men get the job as administrator?"
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2792.945,2793.885,Yes.
1971.70-4,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2794.219,2847.481,Does that not make the men more equal?
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,2847.481,2867.997,As the Court -- the Court inquired about the basis on which the Supreme Court decision was made and I will quote from some of the provisions there.
1971.70-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3167.28,3173.22,"Well, Mr. Stout, I take it from the passages you read in your Court opinion --"
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,3173.22,3174.097,Yes.
1971.70-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3174.097,3185.204,-- that you would agree that under the Idaho law since the purpose of the statute is to avoid hearings about relative qualification.
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,3185.204,3186.614,"In some absences, yes."
1971.70-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3188.064,3203.313,"That it would not do a woman any good to petition for a hearing on the grounds that, I have just had a lot of experience in business and I am just better qualified than the man who has had no experience in business."
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,3205.812,3211.318,"I think that is correct, in the absence of some disqualification on the part of the man."
1971.70-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3211.318,3213.57,Statutory disposal?
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,3213.57,3217.968,We urge that this statute has been in effect for over 125 years.
1971.70-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3275.497,3291.41,"But under the old statute which is now been superseded, the man would receive the appointment even if the woman were better qualified to have it?"
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,3291.41,3293.364,I think there is a presumption there that --
1971.70-4,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3293.364,3298.807,Because she would not ever have the chance to show she was better qualified?
1971.70-4,1,20041,charles_s_stout,,3298.807,3301.313,"No, I think that is correct, yes."
1971.70-4,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3421.936,3423.168,Thank Mr. Stout.
1971.70-4,2,15807,allen_r_derr,,3425.879,3429.36,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1971.70-4,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3473.05,3482.162,"And of course by now the estate is long since been consumed by the cost of litigation, although I suppose that is not relevant?"
1971.70-4,2,15807,allen_r_derr,,3482.162,3487.457,"We -- my client has not seen any of it, Your Honor."
1971.70-4,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3550.415,3572.661,"Mr. Derr, I seem to remember a case of this Court involving the constitutional claim of women, young women to attend a State, Military Academy or ROTC or something, it rings a faint bell and I cannot find that case in the brief anywhere."
1971.70-4,2,15807,allen_r_derr,,3573.763,3586.477,"I am not familiar with the case that the women wanting to attend a Military School, but I am familiar with the case, a recent case that allowed a State to maintain one womenâ€™s school."
