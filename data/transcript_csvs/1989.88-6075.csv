1989.88-6075,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.687,"We'll hear argument next in No. 88-6075, Darryl James v. Illinois."
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,72.779,73.29,Thank you.
1989.88-6075,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,110.846,120.772,He was arrested in his mother's beauty salon while he was having his hair dyed and reshaped?
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,120.772,124.334,"Well, the testimony of the police officer was that he was discovered under a hair dryer."
1989.88-6075,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,159.958,161.73,"Mr. Carlson, could you slow down a little bit?"
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,164.073,165.172,"--Yes, sir."
1989.88-6075,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,346.322,356.459,"Do you think... Mr. Carlson, do you think the trial court's oral instruction was or was not the equivalent of an instruction to use it only for determining credibility?"
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,356.459,359.33,--It definitely was not limiting.
1989.88-6075,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,359.33,366.457,"So, it was... the... the trial court allowed it, in its instruction, to be used for, in effect, rebuttal, to be considered substantively?"
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,366.457,367.415,Definitely.
1989.88-6075,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,390.816,398.96,Do... do you agree that if he had made it clear that it could be used only for so-called impeachment--
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,398.96,400.672,"--No, our position is--"
1989.88-6075,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,400.672,401.313,--it would have been all right?
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,401.313,406.368,"--that it would be impossible, that even the instruction tendered by defense counsel could not have done the job."
1989.88-6075,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,413.622,417.115,"So, there isn't any instruction that you can think of that would have cured this?"
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,417.115,422.688,--That... that would not... that would have solved the problem of it being used for its assertive value.
1989.88-6075,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,422.688,430.475,"Well, but at... at least you would have a different question here, if that instruction had been than, in your view, you have now?"
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,430.475,432.715,"Well, no."
1989.88-6075,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,482.228,494.927,"You say that an instruction saying that the Defendant's statements were introduced only to impeach the defense witness' testimony would... would have, what, made no sense?"
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,494.927,498.069,"--Well, I think if you just said impeach, I'm not sure the jury would understand that."
1989.88-6075,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,498.61,500.382,"Well, say to discredit."
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,500.382,505.317,"--To discredit or to... as it bears on the credibility of the witness, is the general one in Illinois."
1989.88-6075,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,536.677,547.886,"But of course, those aren't constitutional principles themselves, you know, the law of evidence and the circumstances under which you can impeach a witness and what... what they generally don't have any constitutional basis."
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,547.886,559.376,"Certainly, but the problem is, what does have constitutional magnitude is whether unlawfully seized evidence is being used to prove a Defendant's guilt... as substantive evidence of guilt."
1989.88-6075,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,569.683,575.699,"Well, I guess the Illinois Supreme Court did conclude that that was error."
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,575.699,578.829,"No, they did... did not, Justice O'Connor."
1989.88-6075,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,578.829,579.651,And thought it was harmless?
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,579.651,583.684,"No, but that was the alternative argument that we had made."
1989.88-6075,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,597.563,600.605,"But if it was error, it was harmless?"
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,600.605,600.965,No.
1989.88-6075,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,623.234,638.485,"Well, but the Illinois Supreme Court apparently thought that there would have been error, and real error, if... unless there was an instruction that the evidence could be used only for impeachment purposes."
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,638.485,655.676,"Yes, but I think that's, again, it's our position and I think the position of the dissenting position in the Illinois Supreme Court was that the majority overlooked the fact that there... this is not like the case you had in Havens or Walder or Harris... or Harris."
1989.88-6075,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,662.33,664.664,"Well, why is it any different than Havens?"
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,666.664,667.465,That's correct.
1989.88-6075,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,667.465,681.596,Where the Defendant has assisted his accomplice by cutting up his T-shirt to make an extra pocket in the... in the drug courier and then he puts the torn-up T-shirt in his own luggage.
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,697.778,702.512,It isn't as clear cut in the case of physical evidence as it is in the case of unlawfully obtained statements.
1989.88-6075,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,702.512,702.682,Right.
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,708.127,709.759,But it's not assertive.
1989.88-6075,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,715.503,721.597,"No, but it's accompanied... it's accompanied by an assertion of the police officer that the T-shirt was found in the luggage."
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,721.597,730.432,"--Right, but that... that was not a direct proof of the fact that he was involved in the cocaine... it was a bit of evidence, and yes, it could be used substantively--"
1989.88-6075,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,730.432,732.963,What you're telling us that you can't distinguish the two.
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,735.146,737.577,"--Well, this Court did, but I... I think--"
1989.88-6075,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,737.577,739.749,"So, you're saying Havens is wrong?"
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,739.749,753.329,"--No, I'm saying that Havens was predicated on the assumption that the instruction in that case could effectively tell the jury not to use it as evidence of guilt."
1989.88-6075,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,759.105,770.052,"Well, none of our cases, though, have ever said that there has to be an element of self-contradiction in order to have evidence that undermines credibility of a witness."
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,785.95,789.083,"No, that's true, there... there have been--"
1989.88-6075,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,789.083,801.652,"So let's suppose that that's a perfectly legitimate way of undermining the credibility of a witness, to introduce rebuttal evidence of this kind."
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,801.652,802.282,"--Well, I think--"
1989.88-6075,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,802.282,812.981,Then the question becomes whether it must be accompanied by an instruction so that it's... it's limited in its use to that purpose.
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,821.565,851.646,"--Well, the court in this case thought that the instruction given by the trial court... the oral instruction, in conjunction, if... and they didn't even acknowledge that it may have been erroneous... in conjunction with the standard Illinois instruction on impeachment by self-contradiction was adequate, and that... if... if... they said if it wasn't, it was harmless."
1989.88-6075,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,887.111,907.454,"Mr. Carlson, I suppose it's evident to you that beginning with the Walder case in 1947, the Harris case in 1971, the Havens case sometime in early '80s, the Court has gradually expanded the use that has been permitted of this sort of statement."
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,921.723,933.842,"Well, our position is that the danger, or what's wrong with that is the... is the deterrent function of the exclusionary rule, that it would add significant incentive to the police to make a lot more arrests."
1989.88-6075,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,933.842,939.338,Do... do... do... do you think fewer Miranda warnings would be given if... if... if that rule came from this Court?
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,939.338,942.15,"Well, this was a Fourth Amendment case."
1989.88-6075,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,942.15,953.689,"Well, few... fewer... fewer... less attention... less attention paid to the law regarding searches and seizures?"
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,953.689,970.382,"Well, I... I... I think that based on... as this Court always has, it's based its... its determinations on applying the exclusionary rule and its assumptions on police conduct, and here we're dealing with the core... the center of the officer's attention is, his zone of primary interest, the criminal trial."
1989.88-6075,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,987.041,992.805,But why... why would it be inadequate deterrence to say that it extends only to the government's case in chief?
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,992.805,1006.716,"Well, our... our position is, that... that's what we... that as the law now stands, the vast majority of authority is that you can only use tainted statements to impeach the Defendant's own testimony."
1989.88-6075,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1025.707,1032.672,"Yes, but they can't... they can't anticipate that they would... they can't manufacture the opportunity to use it."
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,1046.301,1049.452,"--That... that's correct, the Illinois Supreme Court--"
1989.88-6075,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1049.452,1060.161,"So, that the officer... the prosecution isn't permitted to... to bring this statement out that would justify introducing this illegally seized evidence on cross-examination."
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,1060.161,1061.13,"--That's true, but--"
1989.88-6075,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1061.13,1067.503,It's the defense that is offering this statement that is contradicted by illegally seized evidence.
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,1067.503,1079.281,"--I think, again, if the police are seeking an admission and they've got a broad admission, it would be virtually impossible for the Defendant to put on any kind of a defense without being inconsistent."
1989.88-6075,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1103.498,1111.324,"But if... if the goal of a criminal trial is to try to find the truth, certainly this would enhance that goal."
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,1111.324,1116.319,--There's no question about it that any time you apply the exclusionary rule you are not furthering the goal of truth.
1989.88-6075,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1119.641,1120.452,Some other value.
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,1120.452,1122.385,"--Well, the Fourth Amendment interests here."
1989.88-6075,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1122.385,1141.257,"Well, usually, I wouldn't... I wouldn't suppose the officers really know when they see something like... like this that it's... they don't know how critical it might be to their case."
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,1152.577,1154.206,"That's true, but I think in the case of--"
1989.88-6075,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1154.206,1155.458,So they're taking a terrific risk.
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,1155.458,1156.6,"--Well, not in the case of statements."
1989.88-6075,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1163.414,1167.277,"Well, I know, but we're talking about evidence here... illegally seized evidence."
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,1167.277,1170.881,"Well, I'm talking about legally obtained statements."
1989.88-6075,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1271.261,1274.984,"No, it wouldn't, because you're not using it just for impeachment any longer."
1989.88-6075,0,35576,martin_s_carlson,,1274.984,1279.127,"That's right, you're using it for rebuttal for proof of... of facts in the case."
1989.88-6075,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1298.609,1300.211,"Thank you, Mr. Carlson."
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,1301.561,1311.759,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-6075,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1407.143,1412.847,"Mr. Madsen, does that really make any difference if... if the defendant puts in a defense?"
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,1428.568,1434.713,Virtually... virtually any evidence could come in that would rebut--
1989.88-6075,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1434.713,1442.159,"So that your bright line would just really give effect to the exclusionary rule, only in those cases in which no... the defendant didn't put on a defense."
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,1442.159,1451.625,"--As long... Your Honor, it would be as long as... as long as we stayed with... with conflict only and not required the contradiction requirement of the Illinois Supreme Court, which is another consideration."
1989.88-6075,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1451.625,1453.558,If you had to make your case without that evidence--
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,1453.558,1457.569,You would have to... you would have to know... you would have to know--
1989.88-6075,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1457.569,1460.02,"--You'd have to have a prima facie case without that evidence, right."
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,1477.883,1479.044,--Without the protection of the rule.
1989.88-6075,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1479.044,1487.62,"Those fruits, you might have independently... might independently come... come by, if you hadn't committed the illegality."
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,1490.34,1493.352,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, perhaps I didn't understand your question."
1989.88-6075,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1493.352,1497.456,I guess it wasn't a question; it was a statement.
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,1520.353,1542.358,"Your Honors, I don't... it... it is a bright line and it's a line that the state could live with, but I don't think, when it comes to deterrent ends, and we're trying to... we're drawing the line... in exclusionary terms and drawing the line for deterrent ends and what it means to the police officer, if we're trying to deter police officers, it makes no... there's no sense to draw the line there."
1989.88-6075,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1552.176,1561.312,"So, you wouldn't see the necessity for the limitations that the Supreme Court of Illinois put on the use of this evidence... two of them?"
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,1561.981,1563.774,"Your Honor, I see... I see... I do not see the necessity for them."
1989.88-6075,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1566.475,1579.823,You would let... you would let the... let the inconsistent evidence come out on cross-examination of the witness and then use the illegal... illegal evidence in rebuttal?
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,1579.823,1580.534,--I would.
1989.88-6075,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1605.705,1618.771,What... what was behind the supreme court's statement that you couldn't use in rebuttal any of the Defendant's prior statements that amounted to a confession?
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,1618.771,1619.882,--Your Honor--
1989.88-6075,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1619.882,1620.984,What... what's--
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,1620.984,1637.977,"--I don't know what's behind that and I don't think that that's a requirement that... that's... that in any way would... in fact, that would be perhaps the biggest assault to the truth-finding process, to not let the... not let the... to put on the evidence to conflict with, ""I did it""."
1989.88-6075,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1637.977,1648.143,"--Well, that would almost rule out most of the statements that are taken in violation of Miranda, I suppose."
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,1648.143,1650.975,It would.
1989.88-6075,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1663.162,1679.895,"I... I must say, what... what you say about the negligible effect on deterrence is a... is a lot truer with respect to Fourth Amendment violations than with respect to... confessions unlawfully obtained."
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,1717.91,1722.164,It is harder to... to extend it into a Miranda situation.
1989.88-6075,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1764.082,1765.413,--That's certainly not true in this case.
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,1771.118,1772.729,But this evidence--
1989.88-6075,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1772.729,1777.353,"Yes, and this evidence, he had nothing to lose by asking him everything he could think of, did he?"
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,1777.353,1780.463,--At the time he asked the questions.
1989.88-6075,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1780.463,1790.941,"At the time of the particular violation we're talking about here, there's every incentive, it seems to me, that if he can get the defendant in a place where he'll talk, to try and talk to him as much as he could."
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,1790.941,1801.469,"I think not, Your Honor, because at the take time he asked the question here, he didn't even have enough evidence for probable cause, let alone to take the trial to begin to assert guilt."
1989.88-6075,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1801.469,1801.98,I see.

1989.88-6075,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1900.801,1903.854,"No, but isn't it... you have people who run the police department."
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,1932.694,1947.915,"See, Your Honor, I think for the bulk, though... and as the Court recognized in Harris, for the bulk of police work, a policeman's job building a case is to gather evidence, and it's to gather admissible evidence, and to say--"
1989.88-6075,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1947.915,1966.808,"Yes, but what you're saying is this which has formerly been considered generally inadmissible except for the very narrow exception of impeachment, now will always be admissible if a defendant puts in a case, and that's a pretty broad category of situations and I think it's broad enough so that I would think police departments around the country would modify their procedures."
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,1966.808,1967.209,--You're speaking--
1989.88-6075,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1967.209,1968.871,"I certainly would, if I was running the police department."
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,1968.871,1972.945,--You're speaking of extending past the situation here to Miranda.
1989.88-6075,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1972.945,1973.524,Extending it... no.
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,1977.938,1978.288,Yes.
1989.88-6075,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1978.288,1988.486,The police have gotten an illegal oral statement and I don't know why the police officer shouldn't do that as standard operating practice if they know they can use it to rebut any defense a defendant was going to put on.
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,1988.486,1996.873,"Well, they don't... they... they would be able to use it to rebut whatever... what was... was inconsistent with it."
1989.88-6075,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1996.873,2001.778,"Well, anything that tends to prove innocence, that would be rebutted by this... by the statement."

1989.88-6075,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2026.844,2030.136,"But if he doesn't do the questioning, he wouldn't have it anyway."
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2032.297,2063.668,"--He wouldn't have it... he wouldn't have it anyway, but the defendant also... or, if he did eventually have it the defendant wouldn't be able to put on, under the shield of the exclusionary rule, that evidence, and that's what... that's what the offset here is, and we can't say that where... where... to the extent the policemen want to reach that little beyond what they need for their case in chief, or... there's no incentive."
1989.88-6075,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2103.566,2109.39,"--Well, I can't help but interrupt with this one thought about what the state can live with."
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2122.93,2133.185,"--I guess they sought... well, Your Honor, remember, too, a lot of the dissent, there is this impeachment question and what exactly the nature of this evidence is."
1989.88-6075,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2170.111,2175.433,"It's a little difficult for me to view it that way, counsel."
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2179.907,2181.607,"I understand that, Your Honor--"
1989.88-6075,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2181.607,2185.651,--introduced to undermine the credibility of the witness.
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2185.651,2204.493,"--And through the state's briefs in the courts below, the state at... at one point interchanged impeachment and rebuttal, but clearly, in the state's reply brief... and the Illinois Supreme Court made clear... that they were trying to get the Court to accept the theory of rebuttal evidence in this case."
1989.88-6075,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2216.03,2218.444,"Well, let's suppose we don't think it is."
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2218.444,2226.679,"--I think, as a matter of... of what the Illinois Supreme Court's done with state law, I don't know how you can call it something else."
1989.88-6075,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2246.991,2257.538,"There's a great body of evidentiary law that says, you know, if you call a witness to contradict another witness, that that is not impeachment."
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2287.768,2290.32,"Your Honor, I... I agree."
1989.88-6075,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2344.735,2350.348,Have you found any other case in any other state that says this is impeachment?
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2350.348,2351.039,We've not.
1989.88-6075,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2351.039,2353.59,This is all by itself?
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2353.59,2354.722,It is.
1989.88-6075,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2356.793,2364.339,Isn't the question whether it's impeachment within the meaning of the exception or the exclusionary rule really a federal question rather than--
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2364.339,2366.32,"I think, Your Honor, that's the point."
1989.88-6075,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2409.449,2413.811,"--If you take out impeachment, what other reason would you have to put it in?"
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2413.811,2416.145,--Rebuttal.
1989.88-6075,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2416.145,2417.845,Rebuttal?
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2417.845,2418.566,Rebuttal.
1989.88-6075,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2418.566,2420.546,And that's automatic.
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2430.404,2432.537,To the extent that it's proper for rebuttal.
1989.88-6075,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2432.537,2442.234,--Is that statement just as damaging to the defendant whether it's on direct testimony or rebuttal testimony?
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2442.234,2459.177,"It's just... it's just as damaging either way, and it's just as damaging whether it comes from the mouth of the defendant or from the mouth of one of his witnesses, and I submit either on cross or direct, but certainly on direct."
1989.88-6075,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2459.177,2468.04,So that any defendant who takes the stand or puts on a defense loses Miranda?
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2468.04,2498.932,"Not... he... he loses... not... Your Honor... he loses it... he does not lose it any... you've already made that determination, Your Honors, in Walder and Harris."
1989.88-6075,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2521.027,2521.698,I did?
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2522.109,2524.961,"No, I'm afraid you were in dissent, Your Honor."
1989.88-6075,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2528.223,2533.398,Doesn't rebuttal itself have some limitations in most states?
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2545.406,2546.344,"That's true, Your Honor."
1989.88-6075,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2571.533,2589.515,"But at least when you're dealing with a confession, that is always going to relate to whatever the defendant puts on, because whatever he puts on, it... it will go to establish the point that he did not commit the crime, and if you have a confession that will always be able to come in, as far as relevance is concerned, isn't that right?"
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2599.232,2608.619,"It will, but if the confession were properly admitted... it were legally taken, there... the confession would be there."
1989.88-6075,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2610.592,2632.575,"No, I understand; it... it... it doesn't blow your case away, but just in response to the Chief Justice's question... in Fourth Amendment violations I can understand how very often you wouldn't be able to get something in unless he had specifically said that the... the T-shirt wasn't in the luggage and you show it was in the luggage, or something like that."
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2644.794,2649.469,"--Your Honor, could I ask... if you're talking in terms of ""I did it""--"
1989.88-6075,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2649.469,2650.987,Yes.
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2650.987,2656.423,--Then that's different also from a statement like the one in this case... I had brown hair.
1989.88-6075,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2656.423,2656.731,Okay.
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2659.034,2696.139,"And that would be... while that is the one thing that would make it difficult for him to put on evidence against, that also is the highest price we pay for the exclusionary rule, because that's ""I did it"", and then allowing the evidence to put in... the defendant to put in evidence that thwarts the truth-seeking process that ""I did it"" and that's the highest price... price we pay, and... and it's too high on the speculation that police are not going to take the time to do it right to get... to get the statement that's admissible in the first place."
1989.88-6075,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2696.139,2704.755,"We don't have a confession in this case, anyway."
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2704.755,2705.626,"No, we don't, Your Honor."
1989.88-6075,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2706.728,2713.943,But you do have a statement... a very relevant statement that the prosecution wants to use to prove its case.
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2722.121,2729.636,It is incriminating that he dyed his hair the day after the incident and it's certainly important to the case.
1989.88-6075,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2729.636,2734.139,"Well, presumably the state isn't going to be interested in any statements that aren't incriminating."
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2734.79,2736.092,"Well that's... thank you, Your Honor."
1989.88-6075,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2740.432,2747.007,"Well, in fact here there was the additional statement that he went to the beauty parlor in order to change his hair color."
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2748.419,2754.373,"--I'm not sure that it was necessary to do it, but it added nothing to the statement."
1989.88-6075,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2758.787,2761.058,"Well, it showed a guilty mind."
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2761.058,2766.894,"--But he had had his hair changed there, that he went there to get his hair changed."
1989.88-6075,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2768.155,2769.828,It showed it was voluntary.
1989.88-6075,1,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2773.161,2774.963,At least... at least that.
1989.88-6075,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2825.567,2827.927,"Thank you, Mr. Madsen."
1989.88-6075,2,35576,martin_s_carlson,,2830.311,2850.133,"I don't know if I misunderstood Justice Scalia's comments on... on... he saw the danger more in terms of Miranda than in terms of the Fourth Amendment, but I want to emphasize that this is really a derivative Miranda."
1989.88-6075,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2881.206,2888.991,"Well, of course, they could have... the police I suppose could have found out what color his hair had been."
1989.88-6075,3,43110,terence_m_madsen,,2888.991,2897.066,"Well, as a matter of fact, that may have aided their probable cause argument, but that's the point."
1989.88-6075,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2972.994,2975.245,"I have two very quick questions, if I may."
1989.88-6075,4,35576,martin_s_carlson,,2977.067,2978.227,That's correct.
1989.88-6075,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2978.227,2987.483,"The other question I had is how... is this a typical period of time from trial in 1983 to now, on direct review?"
1989.88-6075,4,35576,martin_s_carlson,,2989.096,2992.158,"Well, I think the... the trial itself was not that--"
1989.88-6075,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2992.158,2995.62,You know it was pending in the court of... the appellate court for about three years?
1989.88-6075,4,35576,martin_s_carlson,,2995.62,3004.014,"--It was delayed in the appellate court... it took the appellate court, I believe over a year, or a year and a half, to decide the case after oral argument and for them to explain it."
1989.88-6075,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3004.014,3006.636,Are things that... I'm just wondering if things are that bad.
1989.88-6075,4,35576,martin_s_carlson,,3010.319,3010.449,They're not that bad.
1989.88-6075,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3011.321,3014.033,"Thank you, Mr. Carlson."
