1973.72-1195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,33.397,We'll hear arguments next in 72-1195 American Pipe and Construction against Utah.
1973.72-1195,0,32257,jesse_r_omalley,,40.177,48.524,"Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, may it please the Court."
1973.72-1195,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,326.31,334.254,"Mr. O'Malley, is there anything peculiar to the Section 5 (b) of the Clayton Act about the Ninth Circuit?s reasoning here?"
1973.72-1195,0,32257,jesse_r_omalley,,337.843,355.02,"Yes, indeed and that is of course as we have planned out, Mr. Justice Rehnquist in connection with our petition for certiorari, this has the effect as we see it of affecting in every Federal statute of limitations."
1973.72-1195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,531.605,533.303,It's not if it is a good concept.
1973.72-1195,0,32257,jesse_r_omalley,,533.303,572.769,"But in the case of a -- Mr. Justice White, of a proper class action, we would submit that it is the legislative intent in enacting 5 (b) of the Clayton Act that each member of the class respond affirmatively to the order of the Court inviting the members of that class to state their claims and that they do so within the period of the statute of limitations."
1973.72-1195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,574.714,592.863,"Well, that would be impossible for the members of the class as this case, Utah didn't file until 11 days before the year expired at the time the corporate get a ground ruling on the class, the one-year period wouldn't expire to all unnamed members."
1973.72-1195,0,32257,jesse_r_omalley,,592.863,596.291,"Well, of course, you have to, that is --"
1973.72-1195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,596.291,605.285,"Unless you are going to say, as I was asking, whether pending the Court's ruling the limitation period is tolled."
1973.72-1195,0,32257,jesse_r_omalley,,605.285,625.228,"No, to say that pending the Court's action pursuant to Rule 23, the action is tolled, is to say that Rule 23 in some manner abridges or modifies Section 5 (b) of the Clayton Act."
1973.72-1195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,625.228,633.352,So you did say then that in this case unnamed members of the class could not participate in the action at all.
1973.72-1195,0,32257,jesse_r_omalley,,633.352,638.49,"I am saying that they cannot do so, unless they affirmatively --"
1973.72-1195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,638.49,642.128,Within those unknown names?
1973.72-1195,0,32257,jesse_r_omalley,,642.128,694.065,"Yes, and I would point out however that was in the -- this action had -- this is not the bare bones, this is not one case, it's a series of cases and practically there were pursuant at least in seven prior class actions and invitations to join, but forgetting that factual background, the fact is that they did not move to intervene at any time within the statutory period and I would took some myth, that unless it is held that Rule 23, somehow abridges or somehow modifies, Section 5 (b) of Clayton Act, there is no power in the Court to permit intervention after the period of the running of the statute of limitations."
1973.72-1195,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,694.065,734.502,"Mr. O'Malley, isn't possible to defend Judge Pence's decision in the District Court consistently with the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit, saying in effect that the statute was tolled during the pendency of the action, but in the times following Judge Pence's ruling on the class action, the 11 days afterwards that the plaintiffs were then under an obligation to file actions of their own and it is decision, denying intervention might be justified on grounds applicable to intervention, without saying that they were cut-off, had they chosen to file their actions, rather than to intervene in Utah's action?"
1973.72-1195,0,32257,jesse_r_omalley,,734.502,738.962,"I would think the answer to your question is in the affirmist, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1973.72-1195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,833.058,840.811,"Well, Judge Pence did the say that it is of second reason intervention just isn't permissible in this case."
1973.72-1195,0,32257,jesse_r_omalley,,840.811,841.544,Yes.
1973.72-1195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,841.544,844.303,"Now, what happened to that ground of the Court of Appeals?"
1973.72-1195,0,32257,jesse_r_omalley,,844.303,846.623,"Well, it was argued --"
1973.72-1195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,846.623,847.859,They just didn't raise it?
1973.72-1195,0,32257,jesse_r_omalley,,847.859,854.154,In terms of the briefs before the Court of Appeals.
1973.72-1195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,870.297,873.952,"Even if they weren't barred by the statute of limitations, they have been allowed to intervene."
1973.72-1195,0,32257,jesse_r_omalley,,873.952,874.608,That is correct.
1973.72-1195,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,874.608,875.824,--which Judge Pence did singed up.
1973.72-1195,0,32257,jesse_r_omalley,,875.824,905.036,"Yes and the -- surprisingly to say that except for the dissenting opinion by the Ninth Circuit, the dissenting opinion stated in so many words that was the judgment of the Court that the Trial Court has considered this and as a matter of discretion and exercising that discretion, that discretion should be upheld by the Court of Appeals."
1973.72-1195,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,905.036,914.252,"We'll resume there after lunch, very well Mr. O'Malley. [Lunch Recess]"
1973.72-1195,0,32257,jesse_r_omalley,,916.492,918.073,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1195,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1676.307,1680.08,"Mr. O'Malley, we had some discussions, I notice your time is running out."
1973.72-1195,0,32257,jesse_r_omalley,,1680.08,1680.613,Yes.
1973.72-1195,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1680.613,1692.074,"Whether the Court of Appeals have also reversed on the other ground namely that as a matter of exercise of discretion, a permissive intervention."
1973.72-1195,0,32257,jesse_r_omalley,,1716.29,1720.745,"Well, I did not really feel so, if the Court please."
1973.72-1195,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1736.404,1741.278,"Well, the reason I wondered is that comes about halfway through the opinion."
1973.72-1195,0,32257,jesse_r_omalley,,1759.326,1778.877,"In all account, I was somewhat uncertain myself, but I thought that the best view of the Court's opinion of the principal opinion by the Ninth Circuit was that it was really wasn't reaching the issue, as to whether there had been a use of discretion."
1973.72-1195,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1782.825,1788.897,"(Voice Overlap) the Ninth Circuit had to reach that to reverse it, did it not?"
1973.72-1195,0,32257,jesse_r_omalley,,1788.897,1801.885,"I would think it's mandatory under Rule of 24, except for the somewhat ambiguous language that you have cited, Mr. Justice Brennan, I don't know of any place it?s discussed except in the dissenting opinion."
1973.72-1195,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1801.885,1807.065,"So, let me think that this way, do you think that both issues are before us for decision?"
1973.72-1195,0,32257,jesse_r_omalley,,1807.065,1808.107,"Yes, I do Your Honor."
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,1868.913,1875.136,Mr. Chief Justice --
1973.72-1195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1875.136,1875.938,Mr. Miller.
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,1875.938,1877.914,-- and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1982.283,1985.81,And what did Judge Pence decide on the issue of class action?
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,1985.81,1990.535,He decided that we could not maintain the class action.
1973.72-1195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1996.188,1999.595,"And, what did the Ninth Circuit do about that?"
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,1999.595,2007.05,"Well, the Ninth Circuit didn't do anything about the class action, because Judge Pence wouldn?t certify for appeal and his counsel already pointed out that he is going to appeal."
1973.72-1195,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2026.446,2028.925,"Did Judge Pence certify an appeal, Mr. Miller?"
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,2028.925,2029.912,On the class action?
1973.72-1195,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2029.912,2030.146,Yes.
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,2030.146,2031.148,"Yes, he did."
1973.72-1195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2037.041,2043.542,What were your options or the options of the other potential members of the class at that time?
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,2043.542,2045.308,Upon denial the class action?
1973.72-1195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2045.308,2048.994,And denial of the certification for appeal?
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,2048.994,2056.684,"Well, that wasn't denied, until later on, that was argued at the same time as the motions to intervene, Your Honor."
1973.72-1195,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2121.888,2132.096,"Did you give any thought on behalf of the client you have represent to filing separate original actions within the 11 days, rather than just moving to intervene in the State of Utah?s action?"
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,2132.096,2142.643,"Yes, Your Honor we did and we decided that there's this great deal of talking, there is talk running through these successive opinions, concerning the relationship back."
1973.72-1195,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2233.579,2256.071,"Did Judge Pence indicate that even if the class action whether accepted even if the case could go forward as a class action that nevertheless in order to prevent the running of the statute of limitations, unnamed members would have to come in and identify themselves?"
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,2256.071,2264.134,"Yes sir, he did that in his opinion on the motions to intervene in dictum, because that wasn?t really the case that he indicated in his mind --"
1973.72-1195,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2264.134,2268.193,"So it would be for the statute of limitations purposes, it really was something irrelevant?"
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,2268.193,2269.297,"Right, whether --"
1973.72-1195,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2269.297,2274.134,Whether the statute of limitations was run as to whether it would go forward to class action.
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,2274.134,2274.691,"Yes, sir."
1973.72-1195,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2274.691,2278.254,People individually that have to come in within the year?
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,2278.254,2281.07,That's the way I read Judge Pence's opinion.
1973.72-1195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2302.543,2311.785,What's the effect on the potential members of the class of this dictum of Judge Pence on that subject?
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,2311.785,2314.529,"Well, I think if his dictum is correct then --"
1973.72-1195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2314.529,2321.319,"Well not if it's correct, that it is dictum, what impact does that have if any?"
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,2326.068,2328.136,I'm not so sure I understand your question sir.
1973.72-1195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2328.136,2330.378,"Well, did they do anything do after that?"
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,2330.378,2331.669,After filing the motion?
1973.72-1195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2333.211,2334.128,Yes.
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,2334.128,2340.344,Well we appealed the denial of those application to the Ninth Circuit.
1973.72-1195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2341.549,2345.161,But not the class action aspect?
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,2345.161,2349.25,"No, not that the class action aspect has not been appealed."
1973.72-1195,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2389.34,2390.22,Mr. Miller?
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,2390.22,2390.726,Yes sir?
1973.72-1195,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2390.726,2406.253,"Before you move on, does the record show whether or not, as a matter of fact any of these 60 justices, governmental agencies that try to intervene had relied on the pendency of the class action suit?"
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,2406.253,2407.731,"Yes, well I feel that it does."
1973.72-1195,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2548.273,2555.182,Do you think that's the input of that one sentence relative to you Mr. Miller?
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,2555.182,2560.087,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe that's the input. (Voice Overlap)"
1973.72-1195,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2590.6,2601.449,"You're not -- I suppose in this case you're not urging that the class you wanted define, included people, whose claims are already barred?"
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,2601.449,2604.214,"No, no, their claims were not barred."
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,2604.214,2620.753,"You wanted as a -- to include in the class only those unnamed people who at that time, at the moment of filing the suit had a lawsuit have been filed by those people individually, would have been timely?"
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,2620.753,2624.116,Right that's exactly the case before the Court.
1973.72-1195,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2863.154,2871.472,"In other words, in Utah, does the Attorney General represent your separate independent local entities?"
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,2871.472,2873.663,"No, he does not do so specifically."
1973.72-1195,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2880.385,2886.413,"Well, if separate suits have been instituted here, would he have represented them?"
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,2886.413,2890.893,"Well, as it turns out he did, for at least with the 60 with the Court."
1973.72-1195,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2890.893,2892.846,(Voice Overlap) intervene that he represented?
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,2892.846,2900.501,That he has no statutory authority to automatically represent Salt Lake City or the river basin in Water Conservancy District.
1973.72-1195,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3021.235,3033.048,"Mr. Miller, is it well settled that an order denying a motion intervene is appealable from the District Court to the Court of Appeals?"
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,3033.048,3035.252,"A permissive intervention, Your Honor?"
1973.72-1195,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3035.252,3037.677,Yes.
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,3037.677,3048.129,"No, I think the law there is that the words that are used by the Appellate Court is that if an abuse and discretion was shown, then it is appealable, we?ll hear it on the merits."
1973.72-1195,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3048.129,3053.06,"Well, is that under 1291, is it consider final decision of the District Court, under 28 U.S.C. 1291?"
1973.72-1195,1,25696,gerard_r_miller,,3053.06,3057.493,"Yes, yes. Oh! I think that's settled."
1973.72-1195,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3059.412,3060.227,"Thank you, Mr. Miller."
