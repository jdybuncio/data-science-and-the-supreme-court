2015.15-7,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,12.545,"We'll hear argument next in Case 15-7, Universal Health Services v. The United States and Massachusetts ex rel. Escobar and Correa. Mr. Englert."
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,12.545,26.43,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This entire case turns on four words of the statute: ""False or fraudulent claim."" ""False"" and ""fraudulent"" have been unchanged since 1863 in this statute."
2015.15-7,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,101.325,112.635,"It can't mean misleading, then? So ""false"" can only mean false? It can't mean deceptive, misleading?"
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,112.635,120.115,"It cannot, Justice Ginsburg. Because the body of law that covers deceptive and misleading statements is not falsity."
2015.15-7,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,127.89,130.735,Suppose you have a private contract.
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,169.985,176.375,"Two responses, if I may, Justice Breyer. First, the whole problem here is the tortification of contract."
2015.15-7,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,180.87,181.14,"No, no."
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,182.295,191.515,"Section 551(2)(e) of the Restatement deals with that exact situation, facts basic to the transaction."
2015.15-7,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,222.92,223.715,"Well, fine."
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,282.54,284.41,I'm glad Your Honor brought that up.
2015.15-7,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,284.41,284.83,All right.
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,284.83,290.77,"The SEC has a habit of construing fraud under 10(b)(5), and this Court has a habit of reining the SEC in."
2015.15-7,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,314.72,315.04,"Well, fine."
2015.15-7,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,320.79,324.055,"-- who was a great teacher, and he taught the common law."
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,352.06,364.28,"Well, the thousands of pages of regulations and the implicit reference in the contract are not what the common law means by fraud. They are, sadly, what the lower courts have meant by fraud under the False Claims Act."
2015.15-7,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,364.28,366.12,"Mr. Englert, I guess I don't understand that."
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,420.36,421.35,"No, Your Honor."
2015.15-7,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,434.43,454.065,"What -- what about Restatements -- oh, I think it's 529, which -- which says a statement is fraudulent if the maker knows or believes that it's misleading because of his failure to add an additional statement to make it true?"
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,454.065,456.245,"That's the same principle, Justice Kennedy."
2015.15-7,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,456.245,463.47,And I don't see why that isn't completely applicable to what the hypothetical that Justice Kagan just gave.
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,463.47,464.12,There's -- there's --
2015.15-7,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,464.12,471.22,There is a failure to make an additional or qualifying matter in order to make that statement not false.
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,473.9,481.01,"Justice Kennedy, if I understood Justice Kagan's hypothetical question correctly, it is not fraud within the meaning of 551(2)(b)"
2015.15-7,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,503.98,504.54,All right.
2015.15-7,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,504.54,505.1,I see that.
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,563.23,566.62,Because this is not a contract case.
2015.15-7,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,567.93,568.23,"No, no."
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,627.2,639.74,"Justice Breyer, it would not satisfy most of those concerns for several reasons. First and foremost, the False Claims Act has its own definition of materiality, which is greatly watered down from the common law."
2015.15-7,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,686.56,687.685,I'm sorry.
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,719.715,722.175,Because it's a contract breach.
2015.15-7,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,727.88,737.015,So providing a gun that doesn't shoot to the Army is simply a contract breach?
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,737.015,738.6,"I don't know, Justice Sotomayor."
2015.15-7,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,740.66,746.165,What -- what more facts do you need? Government contracted for guns.
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,755.27,765.55,"The additional facts I need are what was stated in the claim, what was stated in the regs, what were the reasonable understandings of the contracting parties."
2015.15-7,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,767.17,782.33,"Do you think that anybody, except yourself, would ever think that it wasn't a fraud to provide guns that don't shoot if that's what the -- the government contracted for? Whether --"
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,782.33,782.61,Yes.
2015.15-7,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,782.61,783.24,-- they made it --
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,783.24,787.775,"Yes, depending on additional facts, Justice Sotomayor, as stated in Section 551 of the Restatement."
2015.15-7,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,806.78,808.54,If we don't --
2015.15-7,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,808.54,809.37,So I understood --
2015.15-7,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,809.37,826.49,"Your earlier argument -- your earlier argument was your point that materiality has its own definition under the Federal contracting statutes, and it's so broad that we can't use it, so we'll just forget about materiality? Is that -- do I understand --"
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,826.49,826.945,"No, no."
2015.15-7,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,827.27,828.875,It's my misunderstanding.
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,828.875,834.02,"The False Claims Act was amended a few years ago, about 20 -- about 30 years ago --"
2015.15-7,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,834.02,834.175,Right.
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,834.4,836.23,-- to redefine materiality.
2015.15-7,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,853.36,855.23,That's what I have a hard time understanding.
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,865.115,866.35,Justice --
2015.15-7,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,866.35,869.19,"Otherwise, it seems to me, fraud doesn't make much sense."
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,869.19,871.614,"Justice Kennedy, I agree with you."
2015.15-7,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,889.065,897.7,"So what I understood you to be saying, Mr. Englert, was that all of these common examples, examples that really led to the False Claims Act, are not fraud."
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,898.25,900.12,"Oh, Justice Kagan, that's not what I'm saying."
2015.15-7,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,900.12,901.8,"Well, let me just give you a few of them."
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,901.8,901.89,Sure.
2015.15-7,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,901.89,914.585,Justice Sotomayor said the government contracts to buy guns; the guns don't shoot. The government contracts to buy boots -- this was all within the context of the Civil War -- the boots fell apart after 12 hours.
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,955.37,957.29,"Two things, Justice Kagan, in response."
2015.15-7,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,965.825,967.31,"Well, if those are fraudulent claims --"
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,967.31,967.68,But if I may --
2015.15-7,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,967.68,977.625,"-- I -- I would think that this is the exact same, is that the contract was for a doctor's medical care, and a doctor's medical care was not provided."
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,979.27,987.72,"May I explain my key disagreement with that analysis? In your question, Justice Kagan, you embedded the proposition that there are implicit representations in the claims."
2015.15-7,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1026.79,1057.76,"If I understand what you're saying, you're saying that in representing that you have satisfied the terms of the contract, you are -- or -- or -- let me say that -- I'll start it over. In demanding payment for having satisfied the contract, you are not representing that you are -- that you have satisfied the contract; that's your point? In demanding payment for satisfaction of the contract, you are not making a representation that you have satisfied the contract?"
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1057.76,1059.97,Not that broadly.
2015.15-7,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1063.95,1065.56,I'm not into every jot and tittle.
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1076.895,1077.3,That -- that --
2015.15-7,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1077.3,1079.305,-- and a doctor's care is a doctor's care.
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1079.305,1085.33,"That is what the Restatement refers to as essentiality, which is a much, much, much higher standard than materiality."
2015.15-7,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1165.64,1172.96,How do you want us to write this? The -- you're in an area where billions of dollars are at issue.
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1219.99,1220.78,If it's --
2015.15-7,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1220.78,1221.49,So what am I --
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1221.49,1222.03,If it's in the taking --
2015.15-7,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1222.03,1230.71,"From your point of view, this word is ""essential,"" whatever that may mean, which I will look up, how does it work? What's -- what's the correct standard in your --"
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1230.71,1233.775,"Well, here's how it writes. ""False"" means false."
2015.15-7,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1234.94,1236.16,Everybody agrees with that.
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1236.16,1236.37,Okay.
2015.15-7,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1262.83,1297.46,"Please, because I have read -- you have lots of good arguments, and I'm not -- I'm asking for advice from you, from your point of view, what the sentence in the opinion should say that describes the circumstances under which the person who submits a form saying, I want a thousand dollars, I just supplied the guns or the medical care, when that person -- and, by the way, there are regs say they have to fire, and the regs say it has to be a real doctor. When has that person committed fraud or -- that's what I want."
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1299.405,1310.025,"""See Restatement (Second) of Torts, Section 551(2)(b) and (e), and Comments j and k, and Illustrations 3 through 8."" That's the sentence."
2015.15-7,0,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,1310.025,1320.755,"(2)(e) -- (b) and (e), Comments j and k, Illustrations 3 through 8. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time."
2015.15-7,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1320.755,1330.095,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Frederick."
2015.15-7,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1330.095,1347.41,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a claimant asserts a right to government funds without disclosing that it has knowingly violated the government's material payment conditions, that claim is both false and fraudulent regardless of whether it contains --"
2015.15-7,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1347.41,1347.89,Mr. Frederick --
2015.15-7,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1347.89,1349.78,-- express false statements.
2015.15-7,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1349.78,1352.475,-- this confuses me to no end.
2015.15-7,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1388.88,1397.94,"I think the original sin here, if I can express it that way, Justice Sotomayor, was by the district court which was so focused on what were conditions of participation."
2015.15-7,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1417.18,1419.05,But there's a regulation right on point.
2015.15-7,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1419.05,1420.34,"I understand, Justice Sotomayor."
2015.15-7,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1486.56,1499.14,So is your -- is your position that every material breach of a contract gives rise to a False Claims Act -- a claim under the False Claims Act as false and fraudulent?
2015.15-7,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1499.14,1499.935,No.
2015.15-7,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1533.32,1552.795,"So -- so if -- I know you've got another one, and I want to keep that in mind, but if it's a situation where the alleged material breach is of Massachusetts Regulation 185(Z)(3), (4), (8), (10), or whatever, you -- the claimant would have to show knowledge of that regulation?"
2015.15-7,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1552.795,1559.12,"Knowledge that -- that when it was breaching it, it was going to be material to the government."
2015.15-7,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1561.93,1562.705,"So, I guess, I mean that --"
2015.15-7,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1562.705,1563.25,So --
2015.15-7,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1563.25,1571.77,"That causes concern, of course, because there are thousands of pages of regulations under Medicaid or Medicare programs."
2015.15-7,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1593.03,1605.3,"The court test, Mr. Chief Justice, is whether the State could reject the claim for reimbursement, whether it had a basis in rejecting it because it was a material claim."
2015.15-7,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1605.63,1606.54,But I thought you said --
2015.15-7,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1606.54,1607.995,-- material violation.
2015.15-7,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1610.19,1610.52,Yes.
2015.15-7,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1610.52,1615.75,-- and the government had a basis for rejecting the claim in saying your services do not cover reimbursement --
2015.15-7,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1615.75,1616.455,I understand that.
2015.15-7,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1616.455,1625.31,-- it becomes a fraudulent or false claim if the claimant omits telling the government that there was something material --
2015.15-7,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1625.31,1629.345,"Well, but I thought your point was the first thing is that the claimant has to know about it."
2015.15-7,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1629.345,1630.04,That's correct.
2015.15-7,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1630.04,1634.28,It has to know about the particular requirement in the regulation.
2015.15-7,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1634.28,1635.11,That's correct.
2015.15-7,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1643.36,1650.8,But it has to know not only about the particular provision but that it was material and the government wouldn't pay without it.
2015.15-7,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1650.8,1651.56,That's correct.
2015.15-7,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1667.32,1680.515,"But here, looking -- looking at what you just said, you said the three conditions are where it's not written on the form, and the -- the submitter has to know about it, second, he -- it has to have been material."
2015.15-7,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1680.515,1681.095,Correct.
2015.15-7,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1681.095,1684.65,"And, third, he has to omit telling the government about it."
2015.15-7,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1684.65,1684.95,That's right.
2015.15-7,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1684.95,1685.2,Okay.
2015.15-7,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1716.94,1723.69,"Well, I think that the difference is that I think there's an easier Restatement provision that is more directly on point."
2015.15-7,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1746.43,1750.22,But it's got to be -- he has to know about the specific provision in the regulation.
2015.15-7,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1750.22,1751.21,That's correct.
2015.15-7,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1783.69,1783.92,Okay.
2015.15-7,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1799.28,1800.52,That's correct.
2015.15-7,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1899.97,1909.03,"I suspect most cases are a little more complicated than that, and that's where the difficulty comes in when you have hundreds, thousands of pages of regulations."
2015.15-7,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1946.95,1957.645,"Well, let me -- let me go with the core of what I think the concern is in your statement, and in the position by the amici on the other side, and it's that we don't have enough notice."
2015.15-7,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1996.36,1999.08,"Well, but it will, because it changes the reality."
2015.15-7,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2008.88,2012.47,"These are not bid-ask situations, by and large, Mr. Chief Justice."
2015.15-7,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2055.55,2065.78,"So what has it done? What has the government done when they certify things? Do they say things like, I hereby certify that I complied with all material regulations? What do they say?"
2015.15-7,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2065.78,2069.39,"Well, there's some provisions that have certification requirements."
2015.15-7,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2073.135,2073.91,"No, I agree with you."
2015.15-7,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2073.91,2075.3,-- because of grant programs.
2015.15-7,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2234.615,2245.08,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Stewart."
2015.15-7,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2245.08,2276.12,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The statute refers to false or fraudulent claims, and I think there are two different but complementary analytic routes that the Court could take to conclude that, if the facts alleged in Respondent's complaint are true, false or fraudulent claims were submitted. One way to look at this is to focus on the fact that in Medicaid, as in other government entitlement programs, a person who submits a claim is not simply asking for money; he is representing that he has a legal entitlement to be paid."
2015.15-7,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2494.66,2501.35,"How do you tell -- Mr. Stewart, because at least under Mr. Frederick's view you have to have knowledge that the government wouldn't pay."
2015.15-7,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2530.575,2553.22,"Well, I think if we got a bill for particular services and the services had been essentially performed as they were expected to be, the government's policy objectives were adequately advanced but some technical requirement had not been complied with, that if it's a nonmaterial term, then by definition, it wouldn't excuse the government's duty to perform."
2015.15-7,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2553.22,2553.39,Okay.
2015.15-7,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2583.24,2603.49,"We would certainly agree that in government contracting it's sometimes the case that the government's trying to serve ancillary policy objectives such as buy America, et cetera. And so if under the terms of the agreement and the -- the law of contracts, the government would be legally entitled to withhold payment or a portion of the payment in that circumstance, then that would be a false claim."
2015.15-7,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2603.49,2604.56,Not -- if that would be --
2015.15-7,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2604.56,2604.74,If --
2015.15-7,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2604.74,2605.52,-- a false claim --
2015.15-7,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2605.52,2605.67,It --
2015.15-7,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2605.67,2611.38,"-- and then they could bring -- and a relator can sue for that, then I don't understand the difference between material and immaterial."
2015.15-7,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2611.38,2630.145,"Well, if it -- if it was the case -- I mean, it may be that you -- that your more expansive conception of material terms is correct, and that there would be some circumstances that I hadn't envisioned in which the government could lawfully withhold payment, even though the violation seemed fairly tangential to the claim."
2015.15-7,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2633.285,2634.4,What are examples of --
2015.15-7,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2634.4,2634.77,I'm sorry.
2015.15-7,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2636.29,2644.78,"All it means is that there would be more expansive False Claims Act liability, but not because we would be punishing people who didn't cheat the government."
2015.15-7,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2657.45,2657.59,Well --
2015.15-7,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2657.59,2659.83,"-- knows that he is in breach, he should be made --"
2015.15-7,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2659.83,2670.965,"The wholly or in part, now -- now, I just copied out of the Horn book the basic difference between a material breach and a partial or nonmaterial breach of contract."
2015.15-7,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2735.42,2747.385,"Well, I mean, first, there is a distinction between situations in which one contracting party could sue for damages, and situations in which one contracting party could refuse to perform --"
2015.15-7,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2747.385,2747.6,Yes.
2015.15-7,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2747.6,2755.63,"-- its own obligations under the contract, including payment. But I think the second thing is that the scienter requirement really is crucial here."
2015.15-7,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2771.7,2773.925,"Withhold payment, but not repudiate the contract."
2015.15-7,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2773.925,2788.19,"Withhold payment on the particular claim, because there would certainly be plenty of situations in which, if somebody billed for services that were not reimbursable under the terms of the particular program, there --"
2015.15-7,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2788.19,2793.41,"In other words, if they don't -- if they put the wrong billing code down, and, you know, you shouldn't have to pay them."
2015.15-7,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2820.345,2834.1,"Then I would say material in the sense of allowing the government to decline to comply with its corresponding obligation to pay for that particular shipment or those particular services, because we certainly, as you say --"
2015.15-7,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2834.1,2837.235,"Well, but that doesn't answer the question."
2015.15-7,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2845.315,2846.2,Exactly.
2015.15-7,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2846.2,2851.91,"So if it's a mistake, you could withhold payment, but you can't sue under the False Claims Act, correct?"
2015.15-7,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2851.91,2852.41,Exactly.
2015.15-7,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2861.58,2862.83,Mr. Stewart -- I'm sorry.
2015.15-7,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2862.83,2863.535,Go ahead.
2015.15-7,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2863.535,2869.765,"Could you just -- what are immaterial terms for the government? I mean, give me some examples."
2015.15-7,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2871.63,2881.88,"I mean, I don't know if there are any terms that are wholly immaterial, because if there were, presumably they wouldn't be in the -- the agreement or the -- the regulations."
2015.15-7,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2948.15,2960.905,"When you started and you said that there are two ways in which this could be argued, do you have a preference as to which one of those two ways makes most sense, or are there cases where they diverge, and we should be aware of that?"
2015.15-7,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2960.905,2977.805,"I think this -- probably the one that would be most helpful to the government is the first one: That if you assert a claim of legal entitlement to be paid and you know that you are not legally entitled to be paid or are reckless as to that fact, the claim is -- the claim is false and it's knowingly false."
2015.15-7,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3083.27,3088.35,"And, Mr. Stewart, both United States and Massachusetts did not intervene in this case; is that right?"
2015.15-7,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3088.35,3088.97,That's correct.
2015.15-7,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3088.97,3089.78,Why is that?
2015.15-7,2,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3089.78,3096.34,"We don't -- I don't know the answer, and we don't typically give public explanations of why we don't intervene."
2015.15-7,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3151.37,3154.92,"Thank you, counsel. Eight minutes, Mr. Englert."
2015.15-7,3,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,3154.92,3157.305,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2015.15-7,3,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,3157.305,3164.89,"The False Claims Act uses words drawn from the common law of torts, not words drawn from the common law of contracts."
2015.15-7,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3369.915,3389.475,"How does it differ, what you just said, from this thing in the Restatement where you say it would be fraud, facts basic to the transaction or matters known, that he knows to prevent his statement from being misleading? The statement is, implicitly, I did the work."
2015.15-7,3,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,3429.955,3430.58,No.
2015.15-7,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3430.58,3430.82,Why?
2015.15-7,3,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,3430.82,3434.13,"Because the common law has worked through these problems, Justice Breyer."
2015.15-7,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3496.94,3498.29,Let's not forget something.
2015.15-7,3,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,3528.205,3529.025,Okay.
2015.15-7,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3540.28,3566.9,"I have a very hard time accepting that if you provide -- if you claim money for a service that you don't render, not a qualified individual, unsupervised by a qualified individual, which is a requirement specifically in the regulations, I'm having a hard time understanding how you have not committed a fraud --"
2015.15-7,3,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,3566.9,3568.46,"Your Honor, all the --"
2015.15-7,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3568.46,3570.23,-- if you knew what you were doing.
2015.15-7,3,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,3570.23,3572.86,All that was submitted was a request for payment.
2015.15-7,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3586.39,3587.7,I don't think that it's every --
2015.15-7,3,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,3587.7,3588.52,-- under scienter.
2015.15-7,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3588.52,3589.7,-- provision.
2015.15-7,3,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,3589.7,3590.39,"Well, Your Honor, it's --"
2015.15-7,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3590.39,3592.555,But I think it's a very basic provision --
2015.15-7,3,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,3592.555,3593.5,"Your Honor, with respect --"
2015.15-7,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3593.5,3597.45,"-- when you say, I performed this service, that you performed a service in accordance with the contract."
2015.15-7,3,39136,roy_t_englert_jr,,3597.45,3616.29,"And in seven complaints to administrative agencies, in the -- in the operative complaint in this case, amended many times, why is not the regulation the First Circuit relied on even cited? Why is the regulation Mr. Frederick says he would have used if he had been litigating this case in the district court even cited? It proves my point, Your Honor, that this is a morass."
2015.15-7,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3624.24,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
