1982.81-680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.824,The case is submitted; we will hear arguments next in Maclean against huddleston and the consolidated case.
1982.81-680,0,33191,james_l_truitt,,72.69,75.986,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,150.112,153.298,"Is that a term of art, ""go-go period"" or--"
1982.81-680,0,33191,james_l_truitt,,153.298,156.703,"I think it has gotten to be, Your Honor."
1982.81-680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,175.024,176.774,--Can we find it in West's Law or someplace like that?
1982.81-680,0,33191,james_l_truitt,,176.774,179.1,"--You may, Your Honor."
1982.81-680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,188.315,190.954,You haven't told me what it is yet.
1982.81-680,0,33191,james_l_truitt,,190.954,192.875,I beg your pardon?
1982.81-680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,192.875,195.0,You haven't told me what it is yet.
1982.81-680,0,33191,james_l_truitt,,196.484,207.434,The '60s and early '70s during which the appetite for speculative securities seemed to be very high.
1982.81-680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,215.931,215.994,--All right.
1982.81-680,0,33191,james_l_truitt,,217.322,224.632,The operations of Texas International Speedway were not successful.
1982.81-680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,422.614,424.067,"What does ""expertised"" mean?"
1982.81-680,0,33191,james_l_truitt,,427.159,438.763,"Expertised, a piece of expertised material is material which is included in a registration statement on the basis of the authority of an expert."
1982.81-680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,490.852,499.801,"What is the theory on which they do that, on which the plaintiffs seek to assess liability against the accountants for something like that which was done--"
1982.81-680,0,33191,james_l_truitt,,499.801,528.04,"Well, the plaintiffs allege both that the accountants were acting as principal and that they were acting as aiders and abettors; that is to say that, even though they were not responsible for those estimates, they are charged with knowledge of the incorrectness of those estimates and that that knowledge serves to satisfy the Scienter requirement of 10(b)5 and section 17."
1982.81-680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,528.04,532.288,--Where does the concept of aiders and abettors in civil litigation come from?
1982.81-680,0,33191,james_l_truitt,,532.288,543.158,It seems to me that it has been borrowed from the criminal law without a great deal of analysis.
1982.81-680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,565.994,571.257,"Do any of the relevant securities acts passed by Congress use the term ""aiders and abettors""?"
1982.81-680,0,33191,james_l_truitt,,571.257,572.521,"No, Your Honor, they do not."
1982.81-680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,572.521,575.332,How about Committee Reports?
1982.81-680,0,33191,james_l_truitt,,575.332,580.285,"There, not in connection with the '33 or '34 acts."
1982.81-680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,897.156,901.185,How can a federal judge demand that a suit be settled before trial?
1982.81-680,0,33191,james_l_truitt,,901.185,910.885,"By calling counsel into his chambers and saying, gentlemen, this is a lawsuit which I think should be settled; I believe very strongly it should be settled."
1982.81-680,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,916.665,922.615,"Well, what is the implied sanction which the judge has to back up what you describe as a ""demand""?"
1982.81-680,0,33191,james_l_truitt,,922.615,932.001,"Well, in this case, Your Honor, Herman & MacLean refused to settle, and it suffered five consequences of refusing to settle."
1982.81-680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,937.11,937.844,"Well, it might have anyway."
1982.81-680,0,33191,james_l_truitt,,937.844,939.592,"--It might have anyway, Your Honor."
1982.81-680,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,940.655,942.232,Very likely would have.
1982.81-680,0,33191,james_l_truitt,,942.232,950.792,"--It might have, Your Honor, but if you will let me go on through the other list of things that happened, I think there is a pattern--"
1982.81-680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,950.792,965.91,"Before you leave that, isn't one partial response to that question that some district judges will drop hints here and there as to what they might do if a party doesn't show some activity towards settlement?"
1982.81-680,0,33191,james_l_truitt,,965.91,970.064,"--Yes, Your Honor, that can be done, and I am sure it has been done."
1982.81-680,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1493.868,1503.925,"Mr. Truitt, may I ask, under your view, what remedy you think a defrauded purchaser of registered securities would have?"
1982.81-680,0,33191,james_l_truitt,,1516.233,1524.637,--A purchaser who alleges to have been defrauded in connection with the purchase of registered securities--
1982.81-680,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1524.637,1524.855,Yes.
1982.81-680,0,33191,james_l_truitt,,1524.855,1526.167,--may sue under section 11.
1982.81-680,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1676.405,1677.029,Very well.
1982.81-680,1,39618,robert_h_jaffe,,1683.776,1688.695,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-680,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1947.107,1963.068,"Counsel, do you think that the Court of Appeals held that the clear and convincing standard applied to proof of knowledge or Scienter only or to proof of all the elements of the 10(b)--"
1982.81-680,1,39618,robert_h_jaffe,,1963.068,1965.693,"Justice O'Connor, that's a good question because I don't know the answer."
1982.81-680,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2009.395,2018.109,"--Well, isn't the common law standard of clear and convincing evidence in an action for civil fraud across the board as to all the elements with respect to which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof?"
1982.81-680,1,39618,robert_h_jaffe,,2018.109,2019.733,"Well, Your Honor, I think it differs from state to state."
1982.81-680,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2025.45,2034.243,"Oh, but in those states where there is a clear and convincing standard, isn't it all elements, just as I presume in New Jersey it's all elements--"
1982.81-680,1,39618,robert_h_jaffe,,2034.243,2036.602,"I think it would be all elements, Your Honor."
1982.81-680,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2092.939,2102.029,"--But, Mr. Jaffe, this is a question that might just as well be put to your opponent as to you and perhaps is not proper in light of some of our Court's decisions."
1982.81-680,1,39618,robert_h_jaffe,,2110.103,2112.384,"Well, I think they would."
1982.81-680,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2154.992,2157.74,Do you think your feeling is certainly understandable in view of their verdict?
1982.81-680,1,39618,robert_h_jaffe,,2159.411,2171.938,"Some of them, Your Honor, they found were not culpable under the Scienter standard, although so had an action... we had an action; we don't anymore... under the Texas Securities Act, which follows the section 11 as the negligence standard."
1982.81-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2473.411,2486.046,"Well, is the question with respect to those defendants who are subject to liability under section 11, is the question whether Congress intended their liability under that section to be exclusive?"
1982.81-680,1,39618,robert_h_jaffe,,2487.53,2489.591,I think that's the question which is being put.
1982.81-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2505.586,2511.363,So you are saying that's just a reason for saying Congress didn't intend their liability to be exclusive under that section?
1982.81-680,1,39618,robert_h_jaffe,,2511.363,2513.222,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2519.907,2521.047,"Well, why provide for it at all?"
1982.81-680,1,39618,robert_h_jaffe,,2521.047,2522.641,"--What's that, Your Honor?"
1982.81-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2522.641,2525.61,Why have section 11 at all?
1982.81-680,1,39618,robert_h_jaffe,,2525.61,2531.56,Because it's a very strict liability section for negligence.
1982.81-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2541.916,2542.65,He is stuck?
1982.81-680,1,39618,robert_h_jaffe,,2542.65,2543.554,--He is stuck.
1982.81-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2543.554,2546.413,Not so under another section?
1982.81-680,1,39618,robert_h_jaffe,,2546.413,2550.973,"No, Your Honor, not under... there's no other section providing for negligence standard."
1982.81-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2552.863,2553.457,Yes.
1982.81-680,1,39618,robert_h_jaffe,,2553.457,2560.033,Before you can catch in that catch-all section of the 1934 Act--
1982.81-680,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2560.033,2560.751,He has got to be more than negligent?
1982.81-680,1,39618,robert_h_jaffe,,2560.751,2562.439,"--A lot more than negligent, Your Honor."
1982.81-680,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2806.856,2816.695,Mr. Gonson.
1982.81-680,2,37945,paul_gonson,,2816.695,2821.46,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-680,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3439.572,3441.789,"What time is it now, Mr. Gonson?"
1982.81-680,2,37945,paul_gonson,,3441.789,3442.523,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1982.81-680,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3442.523,3445.007,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Truitt?"
1982.81-680,3,33191,james_l_truitt,,3445.007,3447.226,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-680,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3447.226,3449.756,You have three minutes.
1982.81-680,3,33191,james_l_truitt,,3661.701,3449.756,Thank you.
1982.81-680,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3662.435,3663.294,"Thank you, gentlemen."
