1972.71-862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.015,"We'll hear arguments in 71-862, United Air Lines against Mahin."
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,18.15,22.832,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-862,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,99.23,103.551,Is it brought from Indiana to the Chicago airports by truck?
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,103.551,105.767,Mainly by pipeline for Jet fuel.
1972.71-862,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,121.486,125.88,"How long did you say, it remained at the airport before it was loaded aboard --"
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,125.88,130.053,"A minimum of two, a maximum of 12 days, the average is two to six-and-a-half."
1972.71-862,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,130.053,132.541,And this is to clean the impurities and substance?
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,132.541,135.972,Approximately two days are required to settle the fuel and filter it.
1972.71-862,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,142.682,147.859,Meaning that there maybe quantity is more than aircraft probably need?
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,147.859,148.049,Yes.
1972.71-862,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,160.301,166.194,"And the quantity loaded on a particular aircraft differs, does it depending on how much --."
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,166.194,167.96,A great amount.
1972.71-862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,273.962,275.894,"Well, within (Inaudible)"
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,275.894,281.665,"Westbound, it's about, it varies from 130-216 miles Your Honor."
1972.71-862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,281.665,284.814,Depending I suppose if they are going due West or Southwest.
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,284.814,287.272,Well these are all due West on United’s pattern.
1972.71-862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,294.823,301.001,The situation might be different I think for Grande for someone is flying South out of Chicago to New Orleans.
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,301.001,309.435,"Although not in the record, that's our understanding and also airlines have served St. Louis and the Southwest covering a great deal of mileage (Inaudible)"
1972.71-862,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,309.435,317.87,"But surely the issue here, doesn't depend on whether a particular airline crosses few more miles of Illinois than United does?"
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,317.87,327.115,"We submit that in part, it does, based on the very premise of the Use Tax Act and in particular the Illinois statute that I will attempt to develop."
1972.71-862,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,327.115,329.797,"So, this would be a decision for United only?"
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,329.797,336.77,"No, I believe it will apply, Your Honor to other airlines, but conceivably on a factual basis."
1972.71-862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,336.77,349.198,"Well, I take it, what you are saying is that if they use all the gasoline up or whatever fuel this is and make another stop in Illinois, you might have quite a different case?"
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,349.198,356.603,"In that case, the Illinois has asserted tax and the airlines are paying the tax already when that occurs."
1972.71-862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,364.684,367.607,It's only amount loaded not the amount consumed.
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,367.607,370.315,It is identical in that particular situation.
1972.71-862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,370.315,374.82,"Well, I suppose normally they hope it's quite closed."
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,374.82,379.525,"And again, Mr. Chief Justice, it varies according to the destinations and the --."
1972.71-862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,379.525,383.477,They don't want to carry excess fuel but they certainly want to carry enough.
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,383.477,391.003,"Well, under the FAA Regulations, they are required to carry what you might and I might think is a great deal of excess."
1972.71-862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,391.67,393.212,This is just meet weather problems --
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,393.212,399.921,"This is to make any contingency that can be conceived of, even when there is weather problems for example."
1972.71-862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,410.979,416.82,And I take it your argue that this is necessary incident to the Interstate Commerce Act?
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,416.82,423.856,"This is compelled by common sense, as well as, the FAA and the CAB."
1972.71-862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,630.892,637.287,Is there any evidence that the fuel is ever used for any other purpose than for these planes?
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,637.287,640.354,Not on this fuel before in this litigation.
1972.71-862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,645.128,648.623,"Well, then."
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,662.555,666.574,I will not answer that then.
1972.71-862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,772.115,773.594,They were construing the state law.
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,773.594,781.105,"They were construing the state law, which I am taking time, Your Honor to do because it's the foundation of our argument."
1972.71-862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,879.774,881.245,What's the title of that case again?
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,881.245,887.212,"That is Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert, volume 347."
1972.71-862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,887.212,904.215,"Mr. Berens, what if the Supreme Court of Illinois had said, instead of, as you say at least by implication of the taxable event was the loading, that the taxable event was the storage in an immobile storage container for whatever period of time, would your case be any different?"
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,904.215,911.618,We don't believe the Illinois Supreme Court could have said that in light of the statutory provisions they were construing which exempted the story.
1972.71-862,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,933.581,937.123,"Now you have mentioned Edelman, you are going to distinguish that case somewhere?"
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,937.123,937.863,I hope to.
1972.71-862,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,937.863,940.219,Alright.
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,940.219,957.013,"In Michigan-Wisconsin, the Court cited, Joseph v. Carter & Weekes which some years earlier had invalidated a New York City gross receipts tax on the income of a Stevedoring Company loading ships in New York Harbor and unloading."
1972.71-862,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1069.119,1076.969,Yet the Edelman had an exemption for gasoline exported or sold for exportation from the state?
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1076.969,1090.17,"It certainly did, Your Honor, and looking at the briefs and the record in the library here, there was no evidence that counsel for either side eluded to that to this Court."
1972.71-862,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1090.17,1095.997,"Well, do I imply from that, that's meaningless in the Edelman statute then?"
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1095.997,1107.186,"I don't know if it's meaningless, Your Honor, but I do submit that it had not been pressed to this Court as a provision that was relevant in the statute."
1972.71-862,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1129.275,1135.35,We don't relate it to the temporary storage exemption in your Illinois structure.
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1140.193,1144.495,"Unfortunately, we are confronted with that exemption in the Edelman situation."
1972.71-862,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1359.887,1371.166,"Well now there let me interrupt, when you said only to facilitate United interstate operations, you are inserting in the word “interstate” from the quotation of the Illinois court, are you not?"
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1371.166,1372.498,"Yes, and I that was --"
1972.71-862,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1372.498,1373.965,On what authority are you doing that?
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1373.965,1376.138,It was inadvertent.
1972.71-862,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1376.138,1382.868,"You have done it more than once, I think in your brief."
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1393.013,1402.485,"The quote of the court was, on its operations from the Chicago airports, the word interstate was not in there."
1972.71-862,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1415.929,1422.673,"You also store this fuel in relation to your intrastate flights, do you not?"
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1422.673,1422.978,I am sorry.
1972.71-862,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1423.917,1430.145,I said you also store this fuel and pay tax in relation to your intrastate flights?
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1430.145,1431.945,"Yes, we always have."
1972.71-862,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1436.024,1443.385,"I realize that, but your insertion of the word interstate in the quotation, I think, is confusing in view of that fact."
1972.71-862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1449.913,1475.288,"Do you say you want to get away from formalism in insight, a very authoritative precedence to that effect and yet if you concede that Illinois could have reached the same result had it just picked the right incident to tax, i.e. the storage itself, your own position has a certain formalism to it, doesn't it?"
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1475.288,1495.98,"Well, I think the formalism supported by considerable line of authority in this Court such as the Spector case, the Dilworth versus McCloud and many others which set the means by which the state and Freeman v. Hewitt imposes its taxes decisive."
1972.71-862,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1495.98,1505.779,"You really cannot reconcile all of the cases from this Court on the subject, can you?"
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1505.779,1507.657,I don't think we can reconcile all of them.
1972.71-862,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1510.581,1517.747,"Let us see, I think, what have we got in this, 80 or more decisions?"
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1517.747,1520.267,I understood it was 300 but –
1972.71-862,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1520.267,1526.38,"Alright, then 300, you reconcile even 80, I think you have done quite a job."
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1526.38,1530.25,"Well, unfortunately, I do not think I have to reconcile that many."
1972.71-862,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1530.25,1533.881,Well getting back to Mr. Justice Blackmun’s question to you.
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1551.989,1557.498,We would distinguish Evansville on the basis that --
1972.71-862,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1557.498,1562.907,"No, no, my question was, do you not think that the approach of the Illinois Supreme Court was taking?"
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1562.907,1564.225,I do not think so.
1972.71-862,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1564.225,1572.415,"Well, I gather the storage, I take it whether it is used an intra or interstate flights, it is all stored in the same tanks, isn't it?"
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1572.415,1573.557,Yes.
1972.71-862,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1573.557,1583.12,And you say for 12 days and I expect in that period there is considerable quantity withdrawn and loaded to board intrastate.
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1583.12,1586.869,"Well, I have to make one clarification Mr. Justice Brennan."
1972.71-862,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1599.08,1608.757,"Well, that might be so, but nevertheless, I think you have already agreed, have you not, that what is burned between Chicago and Moline is taxable?"
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1608.757,1612.854,"We pay the tax on it, but we have done it as a volunteer for many years."
1972.71-862,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1615.779,1621.202,But you do not think the Illinois Supreme Court was -- of course Evansville was decided after this case was decided.
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1621.202,1625.858,With the lower court cases in Evansville was also after that.
1972.71-862,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1639.039,1642.23,"Well, that was true in Evansville too."
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1644.062,1649.109,But the airport is operating apparently at a deficit as I read the opinion and this --
1972.71-862,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1649.109,1659.495,"That is why we had the companion New Hampshire case, I have forgotten the name of it where they had all kinds of additional fees besides the departure and airport tax?"
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1659.495,1690.972,"As I read those cases or at least your opinion of those cases not the lower courts, they still were not fully compensatory, that additional funds were needed and this contributed to them, and in fact as I recall your opinion, you pointed out that as long as the amounts for the head taxes do not exceed by gross margin, the deficit that would be treated as a service that the state was providing was being paid by these head taxes."
1972.71-862,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1735.599,1738.04,They are waiting on the result here.
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1739.241,1765.646,"If the stream of Commerce cases preclude the property taxes on goods moving in Commerce which are assessed only once a year, it seems even more essential that they can be construed liberally as this Court has indicated on several occasions including Richfield Oil to preclude a tax on the flow everyday of the year which would be the situation here."
1972.71-862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1788.747,1796.498,But are you suggesting that we construe the statute that way or save it by saying it can exceed the “Burn off” rate?
1972.71-862,0,35476,mark_h_berens,,1796.498,1803.435,"I do not think Mr. Chief Justice, you have to construe the statute that way."
1972.71-862,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1833.494,1836.532,Mr. O’Rourke.
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,1836.532,1840.341,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-862,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2286.17,2290.489,"Mr. O’Rourke, suppose the United plane has two tanks."
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,2290.489,2292.165,Yes sir.
1972.71-862,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2292.165,2313.53,"One is the fuel that is leftover, when they land and other the fuel they pick up and when they land, they turn on the tank of the fuel that is leftover, and they turn on the other tank when they cross Lake Michigan. What happens?"
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,2313.53,2322.254,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I would like to make it clear that none of the gas that is brought into the State of Illinois in this respect is ever taxed."
1972.71-862,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2339.126,2345.61,"Well, suppose they put on second tank a sign which says, “Storage Tank”?"
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,2345.61,2351.723,"Well, I do not think that the court or anyone else in the state particularly would be subjected to the provisions --"
1972.71-862,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2351.723,2358.34,It wouldn't be taxed if it were put on the plane in the cargo department or something --?
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,2358.34,2359.255,"No sir, it would not."
1972.71-862,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2374.684,2382.21,"I was just thinking in the good old days when we first put liquor on the plane, they used to have things on there that locked it up until after they got --"
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,2382.21,2383.217,"Take off, yes sir."
1972.71-862,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2383.217,2383.649,Right?
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,2383.649,2384.159,I recall it.
1972.71-862,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2384.159,2388.111,"Well, suppose, they put like that on this tank, then what would you do?"
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,2388.111,2399.574,"If it was still connected to the instrumentality for consumption, it would be an evasion of the retailer’s occupational tax of the State of Illinois, would not qualify for the exemption."
1972.71-862,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2399.574,2416.986,"And that means Mr. O’Rourke as I understand it, your answers to Mr. Justice Marshall mean that you are not -- your argument is not depends at all on the premise that any of this fuel is actually burned within the boundaries of Illinois?"
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,2416.986,2425.781,"No sir, we do not. In fact that they exercise dominants or ownership over that particular fuel in the state of Illinois subjection to that tax."
1972.71-862,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2425.781,2428.033,That is when they put it into the tax.
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,2428.033,2435.543,"That is one of the events that we claim, shows ownership of that particular fuel."
1972.71-862,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2656.48,2663.14,"I, you tell me if I am wrong that the taxable incident in the Edelman case was the storage of the gasoline, is that right?"
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,2663.14,2666.153,A withdrawal from storage.
1972.71-862,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2680.105,2683.747,"Is it your position that Edelman controls this case, your case?"
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,2683.747,2692.726,"I would say so, both Edelman and the Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Railroad."
1972.71-862,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2880.661,2886.457,"Whether it is stocked or not, are you suggesting it could charge a “Burn off” tax for just to fly over --"
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,2886.457,2892.537,That is how far the theory I believe could be carried Mr. Chief Justice.
1972.71-862,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2892.537,2895.622,"Any case gone that far, do you know?"
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,2895.622,2896.337,"No, it has not."
1972.71-862,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2953.114,2964.89,"But you say that putting an inland tank committing any-- it does commit it to the use in that airplane, but that is not a commitment to carry interstate commerce?"
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,2964.89,2967.345,That's before interstate commerce has begun.
1972.71-862,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2977.583,2978.049,"Well, tell me again --"
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,2978.049,2982.942,"These are exercises of ownership according to the use, a definition of the statute."
1972.71-862,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2982.942,2988.543,You said that this was -- that some event was before interstate commerce had begun in the loading event?
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,2988.543,2989.672,Yes sir.
1972.71-862,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2989.672,2994.68,But the aircraft is -- according to interstate commerce then is --
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,2994.68,3006.368,"But, according to the Edston case, the loading of the airplane or the withdrawal of it from the tanks and the loading of the airplane was done before interstate commerce began."
1972.71-862,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3006.368,3009.579,"Mr. O’Rourke, why don't you tax the storage tank?"
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,3009.579,3028.047,"We could do that very well, Mr. Justice Marshall, but we do not do that because of the temporary storage provisions, of the possibility that this gas maybe taken out of the state and into another state and therefore, impose a multi tax burden upon the user of gas."
1972.71-862,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3032.803,3037.759,There is no question if this gas is always used in United plane?
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,3037.759,3060.256,"No, it could possibly be taken in the – I know of no evidence that was presented but the argument was used both in the lower court, the trial court and the Supreme Court that the gas could be taken out of the storage tanks in O’Hare and transported to Wisconsin for example, therefore, there would not be a tax imposed upon it."
1972.71-862,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3060.256,3060.811,So it's just --
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,3060.811,3062.628,We want to consider that a temporary storage.
1972.71-862,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3062.628,3066.231,"It's just upon as caution, you knew you could do it, but you want to be sure?"
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,3066.231,3067.93,Yes sir.
1972.71-862,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3067.93,3079.226,"I take it your reference to the impropriety of the ""Burn off"" theory concedes the unconstitutionality of a tax collected in earlier years under the old system?"
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,3079.226,3083.374,Yes sir.
1972.71-862,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3128.182,3146.201,"Mr. O’Rourke, your opposing counsel cites Justice Rutledge's opinion in Nippert case in their brief where as I understand it he said that it isn't enough to just say I am thinking of the state as they picking out a local incident that occurs or it still could be a burden under interstate commerce."
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,3151.75,3168.047,"Well, our statute does point out that any exercise of ownership would permit us to impose the tax upon that property, provided it does not qualify for an exemption, provided that there has not been tax paid on the property to avoid the multiple tax situation."
1972.71-862,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3168.047,3172.661,You think that would be constitutional however applied?
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,3172.661,3180.168,I believe that there could be situations where it could be unconstitutional.
1972.71-862,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3284.461,3291.944,"If Shell’s facilities were in Chicago Heights instead of Ham, you wouldn't have this problem because you simply directly tax the sale?"
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,3291.944,3295.722,We would directly tax under the Retail Occupation Tax Act.
1972.71-862,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3295.722,3300.713,"The Retail Occupation Tax as you call it is what is generally known as the Sales Tax, is it not?"
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,3300.713,3301.434,In other states.
1972.71-862,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3303.444,3305.184,For a various reasons.
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,3305.184,3306.991,I would say yes.
1972.71-862,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3306.991,3310.025,"But it is, what's in other states known as the Sales Tax."
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,3311.93,3324.693,4% and if it occurs in Municipality and for example other airlines coming into Chicago actually pay a 5% tax because they are responsible for the Municipal Retailer’s Occupational Tax as well.
1972.71-862,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3324.693,3326.103,It's along second one --
1972.71-862,1,40116,robert_j_orourke,,3326.103,3333.245,"Mr. Berens, yes sir, Mr. Berens pointed out that the Use Tax act came into effect in 1955."
1972.71-862,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3390.866,3392.665,Thank you Mr. O’Rourke.
