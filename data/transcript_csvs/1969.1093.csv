1969.1093,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,23.284,"We'll hear arguments in Number 1093, United States against the Phillipsburg National Bank and Trust Company."
1969.1093,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,30.899,34.431,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.1093,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,246.82,250.894,"There have been a quite a number of them in the Courts of Appeals, however, have there not?"
1969.1093,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,250.894,253.577,"In -- in the District Courts, Mr. Chief Justice."
1969.1093,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,253.577,256.321,"Well then, they have gone to the Courts of Appeals."
1969.1093,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,256.321,257.661,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
1969.1093,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,282.622,287.167,(Inaudible)
1969.1093,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,287.167,288.06,Not to appeal.
1969.1093,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,319.265,322.771,The situation is comparable with this Mr. Friedman.
1969.1093,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,322.771,326.833,I don't believe there have been any in which have actually gone into trial.
1969.1093,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,722.206,729.91,Does the record show how much business did the banks outside of the Phillipsburg-Easton area get from the Phillipsburg-Easton?
1969.1093,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,729.91,739.934,"It showed -- there are various statistics in the record as to particular banks, the testimony generally as in most instances, they get a very small part of their business."
1969.1093,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,751.773,754.695,"Well, are we as far away as Allentown and Bethlehem?"
1969.1093,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,754.695,756.591,"A few of those, not many."
1969.1093,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,781.45,784.121,Their area or from their immediate local --
1969.1093,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,784.121,786.387,From their immediate location.
1969.1093,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,786.387,788.381,"The area is the Lehigh Valley, I suppose."
1969.1093,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,788.381,796.86,"They tend to -- the banks in this area tend to pretty much stick to their own little preserve four, five-mile radius or something like that."
1969.1093,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,811.737,814.396,"Trust departments, how about their trust departments?"
1969.1093,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,814.396,823.018,"The trust departments, the two merging banks have with all kind or rather inadequate trust departments."
1969.1093,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,823.018,824.246,They already have trust departments.
1969.1093,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,824.246,824.963,That is correct.
1969.1093,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,836.745,838.46,From Allentown or Bethlehem.
1969.1093,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,838.46,856.042,"There in Allen -- well, there's another bank, I think one of the banks that is outside of Easton, not in Allentown and Bethlehem that does trust business and has a branch in Easton and then of course the banks in Allentown and Bethlehem which are much larger than any of these banks have extensive trust business."
1969.1093,1,38267,philip_l_roache_jr,,3712.386,3715.846,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1969.1093,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3903.393,3905.515,Jackson of what state?
1969.1093,1,38267,philip_l_roache_jr,,3905.515,3912.805,"Of Mississippi, so one of the banks was quite large."
1969.1093,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4025.14,4026.567,What did the Comptroller decide?
1969.1093,1,38267,philip_l_roache_jr,,4028.521,4030.108,That's correct.
1969.1093,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4108.344,4110.743,What do you say about the stores closing?
1969.1093,1,38267,philip_l_roache_jr,,4110.743,4115.783,There are no -- there is no downtown area as we understand a downtown area.
1969.1093,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4144.265,4145.886,"By area, you mean downtown Phillipsburg?"
1969.1093,1,38267,philip_l_roache_jr,,4145.886,4146.776,Downtown area.
1969.1093,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4146.776,4147.113,What about --
1969.1093,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4147.113,4149.412,"Downtown Phillipsburg, right?"
1969.1093,1,38267,philip_l_roache_jr,,4149.412,4150.398,Sir?
1969.1093,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4150.398,4153.631,How about Easton?
1969.1093,1,38267,philip_l_roache_jr,,4153.631,4158.194,"Easton, the population of Easton has decreased in the last few years."
1969.1093,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4201.053,4203.421,Do you have shopping centers in the suburbs?
1969.1093,1,38267,philip_l_roache_jr,,4203.421,4205.072,They have a shopping center in Phillipsburg.
1969.1093,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4226.343,4228.597,You said a bank moved out of Phillipsburg.
1969.1093,1,38267,philip_l_roache_jr,,4228.597,4229.161,It didn't move out.
1969.1093,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4243.241,4245.294,"That's happening in a great, many places, doesn't it?"
1969.1093,1,38267,philip_l_roache_jr,,4245.294,4246.28,That's correct.
1969.1093,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4247.694,4254.323,Are you suggesting then that the downtown area of Easton is in effect the downtown area for both?
1969.1093,1,38267,philip_l_roache_jr,,4254.323,4254.914,That's correct.
1969.1093,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4254.914,4255.717,To the extent that you have one.
1969.1093,1,38267,philip_l_roache_jr,,4255.717,4257.737,There's no doubt about it.
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,6015.859,6017.025,Mr. Chief Justice --
1969.1093,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6017.025,6017.596,Governor Meyner.
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,6017.596,6023.245,-- may it please the Court.
1969.1093,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6280.928,6288.156,"But Governor, you have to start with a proposition as competition between the two banks will be eliminated."
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,6288.156,6288.67,Most of the --
1969.1093,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6288.67,6290.993,Well I know but you do start with that.
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,6291.913,6302.403,"Well, I think the customer that we're talking about -- the customer that Mr. Friedman has also listed is about, he will have five choices instead of two and one --"
1969.1093,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6302.403,6322.337,"Well, I understand -- I understand but you do start with the proposition that the competition between the two banks is going to be eliminated but your point is that competition will be served in other ways and in ways that will overbalance any loss of competition."
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,6323.413,6350.492,"And the -- and the customer will not be heard because the charges are essentially the same for checking accounts and more and more since there is a better return on time deposits, most of the money is going under the time deposit area and you take William Jones, William F. Jones of the Easton Bank."
1969.1093,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6354.212,6356.231,"Well, yes but how is it procompetitive?"
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,6364.267,6381.739,"We had at least ten witnesses who appear, appliance dealers, automobile dealers, manufacturers, industry people who pointed out that their needs were well in excess of $200,000.00."
1969.1093,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6490.898,6494.59,But now how is competition going to be served?
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,6503.299,6516.035,"Yes as was -- as was pointed out in Nashville and Philadelphia, two banks will be better able to compete with other banks in any of these areas."
1969.1093,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,6761.463,6766.799,What about the finance company which Judge Shaw places much emphasis on?
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,6766.799,6780.864,"Walmer Trupke (ph), one of the most outstanding experts who teaches at N.Y.U. Law School has been associated with the finance company points out the tremendous competition that they have."
1969.1093,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6994.732,6998.267,Has your bank ever lost any money during any year?
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,6998.267,7007.91,"No, I might say that that these two banks or three banks in Philipsburg survived the depression without closing more than the normal time."
1969.1093,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7013.837,7021.304,I understand that but I was wondering if they have ever lost any money to you or are they still making money every year?
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,7021.304,7059.129,"Well, I'm sure we lost some during the depression years, 1933, -- 1932, 1933, 1934 and we had to right off things but we didn't pay dividends for a long while, that's true but in recent years, it's hardly -- there's hardly a bank in the country that's really lost any money and the moment you lose too much, it looks -- you have FDIC looking over your shoulder, a receivership takes place and the depositors are paid off and we have strict supervision but we do have two banks that are designed primarily to take care of local people."
1969.1093,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7134.528,7137.439,Have you ever thought about selling any stock?
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,7137.439,7137.551,Oh!
1969.1093,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7141.738,7142.584,What was that?
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,7142.584,7144.854,We're undercapitalized.
1969.1093,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7164.117,7164.829,At mergers.
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,7177.738,7179.205,No we're not.
1969.1093,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7202.319,7208.522,You propose to help it by merging and reduce the number of banks instead of increasing them.
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,7208.522,7210.703,We are not closing any office.
1969.1093,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7262.219,7263.651,Who made that loan?
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,7263.651,7269.756,That was by the U.S. Savings Bank out of Newark and this is the stuff we should be taking care off.
1969.1093,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7269.756,7272.24,They would have lost that business if you have done this.
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,7272.24,7273.286,Pardon?
1969.1093,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7273.286,7276.221,They would have lost that business if you have done this.
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,7276.221,7283.868,"That's right and we would have been able to service the loan, a good deal better then they would from Newark."
1969.1093,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7283.868,7294.847,"Governor, when someone asks you for a loan that's beyond your lending limit, do you normally attempt to get the participants?"
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,7294.847,7295.702,"Oh yes, indeed."
1969.1093,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7305.957,7315.159,"Well, how often that do you have to turn customers away because you can't get a participation certificate --"
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,7315.159,7336.025,"Yes, Justice White, we have and we have testimony in here that some people who started business and automobile dealer, Mr. Whitman and another person who is in the chemical business couldn't stay with us because they couldn't wait for the time it took for us to process the papers and to get a participating loan."
1969.1093,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7336.025,7346.295,"Well, what could -- these two banks who want to merge, what could they do by merger in the way of a loan they couldn't do by participating each other's loans?"
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,7346.295,7352.67,"Well, they could keep the loan because we have loads of evidence."
1969.1093,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7353.615,7367.086,"Let's say somebody wants $250,000.00 loan today and asked one of these two banks to make the loan, could that bank go to the other one and if the other bank agreed, couldn't you make the loan?"
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,7367.086,7371.18,"Yes, we could but the testimony is such."
1969.1093,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7371.18,7372.777,You just don't operate that way.
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,7372.777,7374.641,"Well, there's loads of --"
1969.1093,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7374.641,7376.016,Because you're competing.
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,7376.016,7378.174,"No, not because we are competing."
1969.1093,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7407.741,7409.605,No I understand -- I understand that.
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,7415.798,7423.233,"Yes, we correspond with two New York banks, Marine Midland and I think it has Manufacturer Hanover and --"
1969.1093,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7423.233,7426.251,And whenever you have involved (Voice Overlap)
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,7426.251,7427.65,-- and National Newark and Essex.
1969.1093,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7427.65,7433.815,"If you want to originate the big loan, the only thing is you end up on the tail end and they really manage it, don't they?"
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,7433.815,7437.421,"Well, and the follow Banking Code Justice White."
1969.1093,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7449.363,7454.082,Their primary concern with the customers in their community not in your community?
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,7454.082,7456.89,"And -- and with the larger customers, Your Honor."
1969.1093,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7456.89,7467.387,"Governor, if you merge these two banks, you can give $100,000.00 but once they merge you can a make a loan of $200,000.00."
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,7467.387,7478.916,"Not only $200,000.00 Justice Marshall but maybe $300,000.00 or $400,000.00 because we must recapitalize and we've been delaying it as a result of this merger litigation."
1969.1093,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7478.916,7483.128,"So you can make a loan of $400,000.00?"
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,7483.128,7485.014,That is correct Justice.
1969.1093,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7485.014,7498.299,"Then you'll come in five years later and say since you can make a loan of $600,000.00 you should be merged with one of the big banks you're now talking about, wouldn't that be logical?"
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,7498.299,7503.457,"This is -- Justice Marshall, this is what we are hoping to avoid."
1969.1093,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7504.059,7507.045,But isn't the argument just as logical?
1969.1093,2,39970,robert_b_meyner,,7507.727,7522.24,"But what you're already -- we have justice at this moment saying if someone wants a loan of $250,000.00 go on over to Easton or go on to Newark."
1969.1093,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7568.623,7570.038,Thank you Governor Meyner.
1969.1093,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7572.083,7574.121,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.1093,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7617.003,7619.752,Or they can get bought by bigger bank outside?
1969.1093,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7619.752,7625.462,"Well, if they get bought by a bigger bank, Mr. Justice, you're not eliminating competition between them even --"
1969.1093,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7625.462,7627.989,And the department would prefer that.
1969.1093,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7627.989,7631.634,I think the department would Mr. Justice if it's just a small bank.
1969.1093,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7631.634,7639.799,"They rather have a Philadelphia and the big Philadelphia Bank owning one of these banks or both of these banks with that manner, right?"
1969.1093,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7639.799,7657.203,"Well, I don't know Mr. Justice but it seems to me, they are very different situation because even if a New York -- it have to be a New York banks that sits in New Jersey but if the two -- but if the New York bank purchased one of these banks, you still have three competing banks in the area."
1969.1093,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7668.975,7673.157,But you'll have five -- you'll have five in this community?
1969.1093,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7673.157,7678.376,You reduce the number in this community by this merger from seven to six.
1969.1093,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7678.376,7680.071,Seven to six.
1969.1093,3,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,7680.071,7692.003,"And in the Phillipsburg area you reduce it from three to two and that is it seems to us is a very different situation in continuing the number of banks at seven but allowing one of the banks to be operated, owned by a bank --"
