1993.92-8841,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.876,"We'll hear argument now in No. 92-8841, Kitrich Powell v. Nevada."
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,10.598,11.8,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1993.92-8841,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,11.8,13.842,Is that an accurate pronunciation of the name?
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,13.842,15.303,"Yes, very accurate, Your Honor, thank you."
1993.92-8841,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,94.486,103.982,"Mr. Pescetta, do I understand correctly that if the Nevada Supreme Court had not on its own brought up McLaughlin, it would not be in this case."
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,111.458,120.474,"I submit that we possibly could have raised it in the context of an ineffective assistance claim, imposed conviction, though that's not entirely clear."
1993.92-8841,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,120.474,122.624,But it wasn't in this case until the Nevada Supreme Court put it there.
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,122.624,123.826,"Exactly, Your Honor, I agree."
1993.92-8841,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,140.27,156.231,"Wouldn't it be possible for the Nevada Supreme Court to say on remand, sorry, we certainly made a mistake; had we realized that McLaughlin had to be retroactive, we never would have brought it up, and so now we're deleting it?"
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,156.231,171.31,"That would be a terribly result-oriented result in the case, Your Honor, but I submit that until the Nevada Supreme Court decides to do that, that question is premature at this point."
1993.92-8841,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,221.665,233.263,"Well, Mr. Pescetta, unless McLaughlin carries with it an exclusionary rule, what difference is it going to make in the judgment below, a conviction?"
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,233.263,260.291,"Your Honor, it's our position that the existence or nonexistence of a Federal exclusionary remedy for a McLaughlin violation is unnecessary to the disposition of this case because Nevada has its own State law remedy, essentially a State law McNabb-Mallory rule, which on remand, once it is... once it is required to properly apply McLaughlin to this case, will kick in."
1993.92-8841,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,262.632,270.589,And you say that under Nevada State law alone the statement would have to be excluded from evidence?
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,270.589,278.494,"--We submit that it would have to be excluded under Federal and State law, because we submit on the merits that there should be a Federal exclusionary remedy."
1993.92-8841,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,312.877,328.147,"Mr. Pescetta, I'm sure that is one of our options, and I guess in my mind whether it's an option we should take or not depends on the probability that Nevada will decide the exclusionary issue in a way which is, number one, dispositive of the case and, B, strictly on State law grounds."
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,352.464,357.259,"I believe so, Your Honor, and I believe that the terms of the Nevada Supreme Court's opinion--"
1993.92-8841,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,357.259,363.634,"But you've just told me in answer to the first question that the Nevada Supreme Court might, you said, wriggle out of it."
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,404.064,409.858,"--But, Your Honor, I don't think this Court should pretermit that analysis by the Nevada Supreme Court."
1993.92-8841,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,418.723,427.711,"Justice Souter asked you what could the Nevada Supreme Court do on remand and would you represent that, indeed, they would exclude this evidence."
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,440.249,459.581,"Your Honor, what I was suggesting in answer to Justice O'Connor's question was that since there is a State law remedy available for the Federal law violation, that this Court need not proceed to delineate the scope of the Federal exclusionary remedy."
1993.92-8841,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,493.305,497.218,"Well, the question, as you said in the beginning, Mr. Pescetta, is narrow."
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,519.083,521.227,"I'm not saying that you can't, Your Honor."
1993.92-8841,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,545.465,547.296,"Well, maybe we think we need the full hour."
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,565.651,568.822,I don't believe there is such a rule.
1993.92-8841,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,568.822,587.386,"In other words what I'm getting at is what is the probability that if we rule as narrowly as you submit we should do, that in fact we will simply... that we will have done anything more than perhaps engage in a summary reversal which will turn out to be of no significance?"
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,587.386,588.735,"I disagree, Your Honor."
1993.92-8841,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,626.812,641.04,But would it be unfair to say that this is a defense that you forfeited and therefore we're going to make it clear that all we were trying to do was to tell the troops in Nevada from now on you've got to adhere to the 45... 48-hour standard?
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,645.095,663.106,"--I disagree Your Honor, first because under this Court's consistent jurisprudence, most recently Ylst v. Nunnemaker, a Federal law claim can be forfeited all the way through a State system, and if it is revived by being considered on the merits by the highest court of the State, it's revived."
1993.92-8841,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,685.792,688.747,"Just before you get to that, just one last inquiry on this."
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,755.424,771.666,"Without being overly disingenuous about it, Your Honor, I would say that ever since Ashwander this Court has not decided Federal constitutional questions just in case."
1993.92-8841,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,813.623,831.604,"Although it's not in the question presented, do you think that it's also necessary, even under your minimum suggested approach, that we reach the question of whether the Nevada Supreme Court was correct in saying that a right to seasonable arraignment is waived when you waive your Miranda rights?"
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,831.604,833.187,I submit that--
1993.92-8841,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,833.187,834.466,Or was that a matter of State law?
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,834.466,839.691,"--I submit, Your Honor, that that is correctly not within the question presented."
1993.92-8841,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,848.67,849.1,Cannot reach.
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,862.121,863.113,"--I agree, Your Honor."
1993.92-8841,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,864.882,868.655,But do you... is it clear to you that it's a question of State law--
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,868.655,870.418,--I believe with respect--
1993.92-8841,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,870.418,871.577,--As the Nevada court treated it?
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,871.577,877.892,"--I submit with respect to the arraignment and first appearance statutory issue, that that is a question of State law."
1993.92-8841,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,908.833,914.67,And we'll just footnote the fact that I don't understand how a State law waiver controls the existence of a Federal right.
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,914.67,916.579,"My point exactly, Your Honor."
1993.92-8841,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,952.574,971.866,"But just to make sure I understand it correctly, everything that they said about waiver because of the Miranda warnings, that all tied into the arraignment State ground and they were not dealing with any Federal right anymore because they thought incorrectly that McLaughlin wasn't retroactive."
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,971.866,972.406,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1993.92-8841,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,993.101,1005.44,"So this is an opinion that starts with State law arraignment, shifts to Federal probable cause, says Federal probable cause is not retroactive, goes back to arraignment and continues down the line with State law?"
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1005.44,1006.49,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1993.92-8841,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1073.728,1075.681,"Well, I don't read it as saying that it holds our practice unconstitutional."
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1087.377,1088.409,I agree.
1993.92-8841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1116.628,1120.412,"Yes, but in the... in their footnote they don't just talk about inadmissability of the statement."
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1140.847,1143.08,--I don't think it is as a matter of State law.
1993.92-8841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1143.351,1145.985,You're not representing that that's the State law remedy that would be applied?
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1145.985,1146.746,"--No, Your Honor."
1993.92-8841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1146.746,1156.273,Just... what is the case that holds that there's an exclusionary rule that's applied as a matter of State law when there's a violation of Federal law as to the period of detention?
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1156.273,1162.868,"We cited the Huebner v.... Huebner v. State, Morgan v. Sheriff, Berman v. Sheriff."
1993.92-8841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1169.652,1170.152,And what is the proposition for which you cite them?
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1170.152,1174.765,That there is a State McNabb-Mallory rule that results in the--
1993.92-8841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1174.765,1176.337,For when there's a violation of the State detention rule.
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1176.337,1183.624,"--Well, that inadmissability of a statement arises from an illegal prolongation of detention."
1993.92-8841,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1183.624,1187.368,But illegal because of the State requirement of prompt arraignment.
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1187.368,1194.734,"They have not... they have not distinguished between constitutional violation, State law violations in those cases."
1993.92-8841,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1196.515,1208.782,"We... of course this Court has followed a McNabb-Mallory type of rule, and yet surely it's an open question here whether an exclusionary rule accompanies the violation of the McLaughlin rule."
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1221.781,1241.465,"I submit that the terms of those previous decisions do indicate that a delay, which is concededly... concededly does not invoke a Federal exclusionary rule under McNabb-Mallory because McNabb-Mallory is not a Federal constitutional rule, nonetheless results in inadmissability."
1993.92-8841,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1284.734,1292.349,"Now, is it clear that the statement was elicited before the hearing was held, because the statement and the hearing were both November 7?"
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1292.349,1294.921,--The Nevada Supreme Court implicitly found it did.
1993.92-8841,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1296.992,1300.494,And that... explicitly found that the statement was prior to the hearing.
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1300.494,1302.535,"Implicitly, they made a finding--"
1993.92-8841,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1302.535,1303.066,Implicitly.
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1303.066,1304.736,"--Implicitly, yes."
1993.92-8841,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1304.736,1307.69,On the basis of what the Wisconsin Supreme Court made that finding?
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1311.382,1315.836,The Nevada Supreme Court's opinion says there are... there is prejudice from the admissability--
1993.92-8841,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1315.836,1317.468,"On the basis of nothing in the record, you tell us."
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1317.468,1325.906,--On the basis of the fact that these statements... the statement was elicited the same day as the... as the probable cause determination.
1993.92-8841,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1342.199,1346.292,Did the Nevada Supreme Court say anything more than that they both happened on the same day?
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1346.292,1347.624,No.
1993.92-8841,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1347.624,1352.167,Well how can you say they made an implicit finding that one happened before the other?
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1352.167,1360.505,"Because they refer to the eliciting of the statements as being prejudicial in their discussion of the Huebner rule, which is key to--"
1993.92-8841,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1360.505,1365.55,"Well, but surely that is the most implicit of implicit findings, if that's all there is to it."
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1365.881,1367.904,"--A finding is a finding, Your Honor."
1993.92-8841,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1368.615,1372.929,I agree that a finding is a finding; I just don't agree with you that this is a finding.
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1372.929,1379.724,"--Well, I submit that this is entitled under Sumner v. Madda and previous cases to the same respect that any State court finding is."
1993.92-8841,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1417.223,1434.935,"Is one of the things that the Nevada Supreme Court could find is that the November 7 statement was essentially duplicative, so whatever error existed was harmless because the same... statements to the same effect had been made on November 3, which was well within the 48 hours?"
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1434.935,1438.097,"--I submit, Your Honor, that's, at most, a mixed question."
1993.92-8841,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1448.713,1451.015,"I'm sorry, I didn't follow the bottom line from that."
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1463.343,1468.727,"--It can say it but that, I submit, is not a factual finding to which this Court must defer."
1993.92-8841,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1468.727,1471.171,But they haven't--
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1471.171,1474.532,Harmlessness is a Federal constitutional issue.
1993.92-8841,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1474.532,1475.543,"--But suppose they did that, would that be the end of the case?"
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1477.594,1481.498,"Well, first of all, we don't concede that they're identical."
1993.92-8841,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1501.392,1510.639,"Well, but let's assume that the Nevada Supreme Court said, well, we're going to send it back to the trial court for a consideration of harmlessness or a consideration of the somewhat broader issue of attenuation."
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1514.261,1517.063,"In fact they should do that, Your Honor, I submit."
1993.92-8841,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1517.063,1517.213,Yeah.
1993.92-8841,0,36447,michael_pescetta,,1517.213,1525.731,"And under rule 250... under Nevada Supreme Court Rule 250(IV)(H), we would ask for them to do that unless they simply reverse."
1993.92-8841,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1569.891,1571.261,"Very well, Mr. Pescetta."
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,1572.854,1576.597,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-8841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1601.354,1602.383,Was this in Clark County?
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,1602.383,1605.385,"--This is in Clark County, Nevada, yes, it is."
1993.92-8841,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1780.427,1781.849,In this case... excuse me.
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,1787.525,1788.675,There was.
1993.92-8841,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1788.675,1791.386,"When, on November 7 or before?"
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,1791.386,1792.057,It was... on November the 7th.
1993.92-8841,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1792.057,1795.349,But that was beyond the time allowed in McLaughlin.
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,1795.349,1797.31,It was beyond the time in McLaughlin.
1993.92-8841,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1798.522,1806.876,"So whether or not the probable cause and the arraignment proceeding are combined, there was a violation of McLaughlin, assuming McLaughlin is retroactive, which I think it is."
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,1806.876,1809.998,"--Yes, it is retroactive, I have no quarrel with that proposition."
1993.92-8841,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1809.998,1810.168,All right.
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,1816.963,1826.53,"There was... using the retroactivity analysis, there was a McLaughlin violation, yes."
1993.92-8841,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1826.53,1829.733,"And McLaughlin is retroactive, is it not?"
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,1829.733,1829.933,It is.
1993.92-8841,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1829.933,1832.885,"And the Nevada Supreme Court was wrong on that point, was it not?"
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,1832.885,1839.47,"If... yes, they were wrong on saying that McLaughlin was not retroactive."
1993.92-8841,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1861.675,1876.067,"Is it plausible to read the Nevada Supreme Court's opinion as saying that if there were a McLaughlin violation, this statement would have to be excluded under the State's Huebner rule?"
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,1876.067,1880.89,"It is not... we are not able to do that, I believe, Your Honor."
1993.92-8841,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1880.89,1881.751,"Wait, wait."
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,1882.452,1885.094,We are not able to make such a conclusion.
1993.92-8841,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1888.276,1902.567,"Doesn't the Nevada Supreme Court's opinion indicate that they even thought that if there had been... if the McLaughlin decision is retroactive, as everyone agrees it is, they would have to just release this defendant?"
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,1904.049,1911.755,"--Well, the footnote does seem to indicate that, and that clearly is not the law in the State of Nevada and they have so said."
1993.92-8841,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1911.755,1916.148,"--Well, what then was the purpose of Nevada's discussing McLaughlin at all?"
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,1916.148,1918.241,I wish I knew the answer to that question.
1993.92-8841,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1921.275,1923.887,"Well, in a death case I think we should know, don't you?"
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,1923.887,1924.608,--I agree.
1993.92-8841,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1924.608,1940.49,"But when this curious opinion came down, you didn't ask to have it clarified, because it goes from first appearance, as you call it, and then it shifts to this McLaughlin probable cause, and then goes back to first appearance?"
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,1948.273,1950.203,That--
1993.92-8841,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1950.203,1962.151,But you didn't... when this curious thing came out about McLaughlin and you didn't know how it got in there... it certainly wasn't asked for by either of the parties... you didn't ask the court to alter or amend its decision?
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,1962.151,1973.129,"--We... my knowledge of the appellate procedure that took place was that upon receiving the opinion, a motion for rehearing was asked for."
1993.92-8841,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2005.031,2015.287,"Couldn't, then, on remand... if we were to say, Nevada Supreme Court, McLaughlin's retroactive, couldn't they then say, thank you for that information about Federal law."
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2030.238,2032.13,They could take that position.
1993.92-8841,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2068.723,2076.047,"Well, even if we're with you... even if we're with you so far, was not, in this case, there a combined arraignment and probable cause hearing on November 7?"
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2076.047,2076.527,There was not.
1993.92-8841,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2083.572,2084.475,"Oh, a simply McLaughlin hearing."
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2084.475,2085.895,It is simply McLaughlin.
1993.92-8841,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2092.029,2092.248,"All right, all right."
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2092.248,2097.242,So clearly in this case two separate proceedings were had.
1993.92-8841,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2101.616,2102.537,I have to confess I'm a little puzzled.
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2107.712,2108.073,--It is not.
1993.92-8841,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2108.073,2111.676,"But the Supreme Court of Nevada, on page 6, says:"
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2124.945,2128.748,One reading of the opinion might be very similar to what you're suggesting.
1993.92-8841,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2128.748,2130.579,That's exactly what that sentence... you'll agree that sentence says that?
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2130.579,2131.05,That sentence says that.
1993.92-8841,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2131.05,2132.602,Now what says something else in the opinion?
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2132.602,2140.727,"Well, the court might have been, at that particular moment, deciding to--"
1993.92-8841,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2140.727,2141.368,That's not my question.
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2141.368,2141.829,--I'm sorry.
1993.92-8841,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2141.829,2144.079,What is there in the opinion that says something else?
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2144.079,2145.611,Something other--
1993.92-8841,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2145.611,2153.906,"I know... you told us there are two separate proceedings, but does the court say that... elsewhere in its opinion that the probable cause determination is not made in the first appearance here?"
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2153.906,2158.25,"--No, not to my recollection, and that is what I think befuddles some of us."
1993.92-8841,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2180.285,2180.436,I understand that.
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2190.524,2191.876,"Yes, I am arguing that."
1993.92-8841,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2192.517,2195.519,And what is there in writing that tells us that is so?
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2195.519,2208.398,"--My answer to Justice Kennedy a few moments ago, that the probable cause hearing in this case was held on November the 7th, and on November the 13th the first appearance was held."
1993.92-8841,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2212.549,2219.905,"Yes, but that doesn't show that it is correct to have... not to make the probable cause determination in the first appearance hearing."
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2219.905,2221.886,"--No, it could be correct."
1993.92-8841,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2224.74,2228.621,"Well, and obviously the Nevada Supreme Court says that's what you're supposed to do in Nevada, according to this opinion."
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2228.621,2231.803,"Well, and if they're saying that, and we don't know that that's what they're saying--"
1993.92-8841,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2231.803,2234.535,"Well, you just agreed with me that that's what that sentence says."
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2234.535,2237.189,"--Well, I don't know if that's what that sentence means."
1993.92-8841,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2237.718,2242.382,"Oh, that's what it says, but we have some kind of secret meaning behind what the words are."
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2252.729,2254.522,"Yes, they are still separate proceedings."
1993.92-8841,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2295.952,2304.818,"Well, has the Nevada Supreme Court made it clear that the Huebner line of cases would not apply to a violation of the time limits for a probable cause hearing?"
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2304.818,2328.464,"--Well, in respect... with respect to my opposing counsel's statement, I would tell the Court that the Nevada Supreme Court in those line... in that line of cases has stated what the rule is in almost all of the United States, and that is that the McNabb-Mallory line of cases do not have to apply to the States."
1993.92-8841,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2331.877,2346.376,"My question was has Nevada said, as a definitive matter, that its State McNabb-Mallory rule does not apply to a probable cause hearing when the probable cause hearing is beyond the legal... legally set time?"
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2346.376,2347.327,It has not.
1993.92-8841,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2347.327,2347.938,Thank you.
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2347.938,2363.89,"And I say that, if I might just follow up on it, because in Nevada there are a dearth of cases, if there are any at all, which discuss the problem that faces us here, that discusses any sort of a probable cause difficulty."
1993.92-8841,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2388.189,2394.062,"May I ask about your first... your first appearance hearing, is that always an arraignment where the defendant pleads not guilty or guilty?"
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2394.062,2398.024,"Unless it is continued for that purpose, it is."
1993.92-8841,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2398.024,2399.065,In this case it was an arraignment.
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2399.065,2404.979,"I can't tell you whether or not there was a continuation, but the... but when they finally had the first appearance--"
1993.92-8841,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2404.979,2406.191,But the November 13th hearing was an arraignment.
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2406.191,2408.592,"--It was an arraignment, to the best of my understanding."
1993.92-8841,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2408.592,2417.468,"So is it not conceivable that the probable cause determination could take place at the earlier date, with the defendant present or not present, yet still have the arraignment at a later date?"
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2417.468,2419.691,That is the procedure in Nevada.
1993.92-8841,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2419.691,2420.082,Yeah.
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2429.355,2435.289,Our first appearances cannot take place ex parte.
1993.92-8841,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2439.273,2439.543,I understand.
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2441.535,2447.63,"I believe eventually, given continuances, they are always the arraignment."
1993.92-8841,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2448.83,2450.793,"Well, let me ask you this."
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2464.794,2465.775,--No.
1993.92-8841,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2465.775,2466.614,That could not happen.
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2466.614,2467.536,It does not happen.
1993.92-8841,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2479.493,2492.571,"It seems to me that what the Nevada Supreme Court has said in its opinion, that's what must happen in the future, that he must... the defendant must be present at the probable cause determination in less than 48 hours, even though he doesn't have to be arraigned at that time."
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2492.571,2496.214,--That could be a possible reading of the Nevada case.
1993.92-8841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2508.162,2516.817,There's certainly nothing in our McLaughlin case that suggests a defendant would have to be personally present at the probable cause determination.
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2516.817,2518.058,Not that I ever read.
1993.92-8841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2518.058,2519.729,Just following... we just followed Gerstein.
1993.92-8841,1,21591,dan_m_seaton,,2519.729,2521.291,That's correct.
1993.92-8841,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2735.949,2737.278,"Thank you, Mr. Seaton."
1993.92-8841,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2739.839,2750.618,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.92-8841,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2816.983,2823.747,"Well, why would it give a State remedy for a statute which it found was inapplicable because of its misunderstanding of retroactivity?"
1993.92-8841,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2823.747,2829.761,"--It did not... there are two different issues, Justice Souter."
1993.92-8841,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2890.763,2910.518,"Mr. Estrada, I don't follow that line of reasoning, because I thought the Nevada Supreme Court was saying there was a violation of a Federal constitutional right, but it's not retroactive, and are we glad it isn't retroactive because if it were we would have to release this man from incarceration totally, not simply exclude the statement."
1993.92-8841,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2910.518,2919.294,"What they said was it is not retroactive as a matter of Federal law, Justice Ginsburg, which if... which is a statement--"
1993.92-8841,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2919.294,2926.989,"So why should it be retroactive as a matter of State law, but they... wouldn't they think that the State law, at least in that respect, would be the same as the Federal?"
1993.92-8841,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2926.989,2929.47,"--Yes, but they wouldn't have to."
1993.92-8841,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2950.183,2954.497,"But, Mr. Estrada, correct me if you have a different interpretation."
1993.92-8841,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,2969.38,2976.883,--The court did find by hypothesis a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
1993.92-8841,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3001.091,3011.487,"Well, I suppose that the concern that I have, at least, is that the State court ought to be the one to make this explicit determination in the first instance."
1993.92-8841,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3011.487,3012.388,--Well--
1993.92-8841,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3012.388,3023.023,It's not clear to me that that's exactly... that the Nevada court would have denied relief had it assumed a Federal violation under McLaughlin.
1993.92-8841,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3023.023,3035.693,"--Well, I... we don't read the... what the court said as indicating that the court felt compelled to deny a State remedy based on Federal law."
1993.92-8841,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3048.733,3055.978,"Mr. Estrada, excuse me for interrupting, but I... maybe I'm not following you, but you're saying that the court said there was a violation of the Fourth Amendment."
1993.92-8841,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3058.339,3059.1,--Yes.
1993.92-8841,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3059.1,3066.534,But they say it is important to note that the 48-hour requirement mandated in McLaughlin does not apply to the case at hand.
1993.92-8841,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3073.539,3080.054,"Well, I think what they were saying, and as we read it, Justice Stevens, is to say that--"
1993.92-8841,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3080.054,3083.497,How can they find a violation of a rule that doesn't even apply to the case at hand?
1993.92-8841,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3083.497,3084.048,--Well--
1993.92-8841,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3084.048,3087.29,"They say that in... I mean, I'm not... you know, I'm not interpolating."
1993.92-8841,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3094.866,3113.037,"--Well, I was taking not our statement of what they did, but their statement as to why this Court has jurisdiction, which is that the highest State court chose to notice a plain error and to waive a bar."
1993.92-8841,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3122.514,3126.218,"But that Federal rule that they misapplied is not McLaughlin, it's Griffith."
1993.92-8841,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3133.932,3134.944,"--Yes, of course."
1993.92-8841,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3134.944,3136.076,--We have jurisdiction.
1993.92-8841,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3137.308,3142.152,And we do agree that the Griffith rule was misapplied.
1993.92-8841,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3142.152,3143.825,And that... you do agree that was a Federal rule.
1993.92-8841,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3143.825,3144.306,Yes.
1993.92-8841,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3145.203,3148.786,"And based on that violation of a Federal rule, this Court had jurisdiction."
1993.92-8841,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3148.786,3154.21,--I think that there's certainly much to be said for that view.
1993.92-8841,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3154.21,3156.143,"And nothing to be said against that, is there?"
1993.92-8841,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3156.143,3160.615,"Well, the State has made an argument to--"
1993.92-8841,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3160.615,3161.566,I understand they've made arguments.
1993.92-8841,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3161.566,3161.737,--The opposite effect.
1993.92-8841,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3161.737,3163.75,"But you don't subscribe to those arguments, do you?"
1993.92-8841,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3163.75,3170.894,"We have not subscribed one way or the other to any view, and we're happy to go forward on the view that the Court does have jurisdiction."
1993.92-8841,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3191.419,3196.952,"Well, there's just so much help one can get from this opinion, Mr. Estrada, and it's not very much."
1993.92-8841,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3196.952,3201.064,"I would not disagree with you on that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.92-8841,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3245.513,3254.389,"But all that assumes that Hawaii... that Nevada will not apply its Huebner rule to a McLaughlin violation, and we don't know that for sure."
1993.92-8841,2,35754,miguel_a_estrada,,3270.35,3278.795,"Well, that's... I mean obviously reasonable minds can disagree about how what the court did may be read."
1993.92-8841,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3301.211,3319.783,"But wouldn't it be... wouldn't it have been appropriate for the... to... instead of asking the Court to decide what is a fairly weighty question, what are the consequences of a McLaughlin violation, to say this is a very poor case in which to make any such decision; there are two paragraphs thrown into an opinion that's all about State law."
