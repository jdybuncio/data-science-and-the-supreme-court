2019.18-1165,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.84,"We'll hear argument next in Case 18-1165, the Retirement Plans Committee of IBM versus Jander. Mr. Clement."
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,8.84,26.64,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Dudenhoeffer, this Court articulated a pleading standard that recognized that disclosure of negative inside information by insider fiduciaries could harm the plan and plan participants by immediately reducing the value of the fund."
2019.18-1165,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,137.68,137.68,Well --
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,137.68,144.32,-- Respondents' allegation is also fundamentally inconsistent with the premise of the third consideration in Dudenhoeffer.
2019.18-1165,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,170.32,187.2,"So, in your second argument, is it your point that there are always going to be different classes of beneficiaries, some of whom would be harmed, some of whom would be helped by earlier disclosure, and, therefore, the duty of prudence cannot be violated in those circumstances?"
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,187.2,188.8,I think that's absolutely part of it.
2019.18-1165,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,190.48,197.8,"What -- what -- what more, because that seems to come out of your -- the second argument as close to a bright line."
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,208.0,223.36,"I -- I think it ends up being pretty close to a bright line, which is -- I mean, the reason you can have an exception for the situation where it's a newly created ESOP is because, in that situation, you don't have to trade off the interests of net buyers and net sellers, short-term holders, long-term holders."
2019.18-1165,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,223.36,234.32,Can you imagine a circumstance where you have different classes of beneficiaries where there would still be a -- a claim that could be made that earlier disclosures should have been made in a stock price drop case?
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,234.32,236.76,I have a -- I have trouble coming up with one of those.
2019.18-1165,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,297.16,303.68,"Not necessarily. There's a -- there's time for investigation, proper investigation."
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,346.92,349.12,"Well, I -- I hope not, which is to say I --"
2019.18-1165,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,349.12,349.72,"Well, why not?"
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,349.72,358.16,"Because I think, in a situation like this, a fiduciary that's facing these competing obligations among different members of the plan and is also confronted with a 2000 --"
2019.18-1165,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,358.16,370.28,"Well, you can't -- you can't really be saying that it's a fiduciary duty to help sellers promote fraudulent conduct by avoiding losses for people."
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,382.96,383.84,So --
2019.18-1165,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,383.84,389.56,"Because they're going to avoid the fraud, the effects of a fraud."
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,393.52,393.72,So --
2019.18-1165,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,393.72,401.8,It seems to me you have to look at what holders are experiencing and what potential buyers are experiencing.
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,405.84,408.36,"So, Justice Sotomayor, I think there's two points there."
2019.18-1165,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,427.52,429.36,"No, there, they're wearing their corporate hat."
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,458.76,470.04,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, it would require an extension of Pegram to say that there's no obligation to use the inside information gained in a corporate capacity in a fiduciary capacity."
2019.18-1165,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,490.44,492.64,But that's different from disclosure.
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,492.64,493.64,You're right.
2019.18-1165,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,493.64,497.6,And it's much different from what you're obligated to do.
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,509.72,510.36,Exactly.
2019.18-1165,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,645.76,648.48,"Mr. Clement, if we could just back up for a minute."
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,716.56,717.72,"I'll try to, Justice Gorsuch."
2019.18-1165,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,728.08,728.2,Well --
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,728.2,729.36,-- you're a corporate insider.
2019.18-1165,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,729.36,730.88,"-- you know, these things leak."
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,761.08,764.04,"So, you know, I don't want to quibble too much on the premise."
2019.18-1165,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,778.28,779.76,I'm not shaking my head.
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,781.64,785.0,"Well, okay, but the cost savings do directly benefit the plan participants --"
2019.18-1165,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,785.0,785.04,Ehh.
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,785.04,788.4,"-- if the costs of running -- I mean, if you go out and get Vanguard, you know, the company --"
2019.18-1165,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,788.4,788.76,It costs something.
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,788.76,789.8,-- is not going to pay for that.
2019.18-1165,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,790.84,791.04,Yeah.
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,791.04,802.8,"But here's -- here's the real thing you gain, which is you incentivize companies to have the pension plans in the first place and you incentivize them to have pension plans. You've got to take a step back, and this is what the Court did in Pegram, and --"
2019.18-1165,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,802.8,803.72,"Yeah, no --"
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,803.72,812.4,"-- which is, you know, this is an unusual regime, right, because there's a lot of responsibilities that come with having an ERISA plan, and no company is forced to have an ERISA plan."
2019.18-1165,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,812.4,812.84,Right.
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,812.84,824.16,"So, in part, to incentivize companies to have them, they said, we're going to deviate from the common law rule, where you couldn't have an insider serve as a fiduciary, and we're going to deliberately deviate from the common law rule, and we're going to set this up."
2019.18-1165,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,865.0,865.64,Right.
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,865.64,870.36,-- the easiest thing for IBM to do is to say let's get rid of the ESOP.
2019.18-1165,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,870.36,870.68,ESOP.
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,870.68,873.68,We're not going to -- we're not -- and that's clearly contrary to Congress's intent.
2019.18-1165,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,880.2,894.72,"So that I have the road map clear, if we were to agree with you on your second argument, which the one we discussed earlier, we don't get into the Pegram issue or some of the issues raised by Justice Gorsuch and some of Justice Sotomayor's questions, right?"
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,894.72,896.12,I -- I -- I think that's right.
2019.18-1165,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,909.44,912.08,That's not what you asked for cert on.
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,945.04,969.92,"What's missing is any kind of detail about the nature of this plan, the precise circumstances, they either just set up the plan or it was, you know, a new growth company, so they would have known that 98 percent of the people were -- were net buyers. I mean, may -- may -- maybe you could imagine that, but -- but, honestly, this is where I was getting with this, is I think, you know, the courts have had five years of experience or whatever it is with the Dudenhoeffer considerations."
2019.18-1165,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1078.44,1078.76,I -- I --
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1078.76,1079.92,-- to the market as a whole.
2019.18-1165,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1079.92,1115.04,"Your argument now and the government and most of the briefs here seem, as Justice Sotomayor pointed out, to be addressing a different issue than what we granted cert on. And the -- they seem to be dealing with what I called the second part of the three considerations, and that is how the relation between securities laws and ERISA law ought to be when the last sentence there was absolutely deliberate; namely, we didn't have the views of the government. All right."
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1177.8,1184.44,"So, Justice Breyer, I think that it is -- I mean, we're happy to win this case under the third factor or the second factor."
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1189.28,1192.2,"But, in all events, I don't think we should lose under the third factor."
2019.18-1165,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1192.2,1193.12,Because?
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1193.12,1196.6,"If you look at the allegations here, most of them could be made in every single --"
2019.18-1165,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1196.6,1197.28,Not this one.
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1197.28,1198.28,-- one of these cases which --
2019.18-1165,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1198.28,1201.8,"During the class period, the plan was a net buyer of stock."
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1201.8,1204.92,"They walked away from that because it turns out, although they alleged it, it was wrong."
2019.18-1165,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1205.48,1207.6,"Well, that's for the answer."
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1207.6,1208.24,"No, no, no."
2019.18-1165,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1208.24,1209.16,The answer says --
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1209.16,1209.52,"No, no."
2019.18-1165,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1209.84,1211.68,"-- the complaint alleges such and such, it's wrong."
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1215.56,1216.64,With all due respect --
2019.18-1165,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1216.64,1216.64,Yeah.
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1216.64,1220.48,-- what happened here is they made that allegation based on publicly available documents.
2019.18-1165,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1228.12,1228.76,On that basis?
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1228.76,1234.92,"-- on a mistaken fact. And so he said, it's publicly available to me. It is -- I'm going to take judicial notice of it."
2019.18-1165,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1246.32,1258.6,"You say alleged if they'd alleged that the -- the trustee didn't know that they would be a net seller, would that then be sufficient?"
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1258.6,1260.6,I don't think so because I think particularly --
2019.18-1165,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1260.6,1260.84,Right.
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1260.84,1269.92,"-- the fiduciary of a long-established plan could say, I don't know it for a fact, but I think we're very likely to be a net seller. If I could avert you to another one of their specific allegations --"
2019.18-1165,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1269.92,1272.2,Do you want to just give a reference?
2019.18-1165,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1272.2,1278.92,"Yeah, it's at page 29. This is their so-called inevitability allegations, which are case-specific."
2019.18-1165,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1296.16,1305.88,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Ellis."
2019.18-1165,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1305.88,1318.36,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In Dudenhoeffer, this Court recognized that an ESOP fiduciary would sometimes have an ERISA-based obligation to take action based on inside information."
2019.18-1165,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1353.92,1354.28,Why?
2019.18-1165,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1354.28,1355.6,-- do not require --
2019.18-1165,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1355.6,1356.04,Why?
2019.18-1165,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1356.04,1356.76,-- of that fiduciary.
2019.18-1165,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1356.76,1357.4,I'm sorry.
2019.18-1165,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1357.4,1358.88,"I think for two reasons, Your Honor."
2019.18-1165,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1381.52,1412.76,"May I ask you a question about this -- this theory of yours I saw nowhere aired below? And then you come in with a brief and you seem not to focus on the more harm than good standard, but you say that an insider has a duty to disclose nonpublic information under the Securities Act, so we're going to use the Securities Act."
2019.18-1165,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1418.72,1457.12,"So we -- when the court came -- or the case came to our office, we looked at this case afresh and we decided what can we add, what can we -- how can we be useful to the Court? We think we can be useful to the Court by discussing the objectives of the securities laws, but I -- importantly, as I just noted, I think our -- all of our analysis is just as relevant to the third prong, to the more harm than good standard as well, because I think a prudent fiduciary in this position that's -- that faces the confines of the securities laws, where they can't do what it is that everybody would agree is the best thing for the participants, right, they should trade on the inside information or they should disclose it selectively to those participants -- they can't do that."
2019.18-1165,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1481.84,1482.04,Do you think it's --
2019.18-1165,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1482.04,1494.44,"As I've always understood the securities law, it only controls disclosure to the extent that something you say is misleading, is fraudulent."
2019.18-1165,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1532.76,1534.56,"So a couple points, Your Honor."
2019.18-1165,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1558.92,1559.48,But not every --
2019.18-1165,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1559.48,1560.52,-- regardless of what you said before.
2019.18-1165,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1581.04,1617.32,"Do you think that it is workable, practical, to require an insider fiduciary to determine whether the disclosure of information -- inside information to the public at a particular point in time will do more harm than good? Does -- is that inherently a workable standard, or -- or is it your argument that it is not and that's why you reached the position that you reached? It seems to me, in that situation, the fiduciary has to make a very complicated calculation."
2019.18-1165,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1633.6,1683.68,"So I think it is workable in the sense that if you -- a prudent fiduciary in that position would not be ignorant, would not close its eyes to the entire body of law that's intended to balance those interests. I agree that it's not a workable solution to have an ad hoc balancing, and I don't think it would be -- as I said, I think it would be inconsistent with the securities laws to impose this sort of ad hoc disclosure regime on every company, public company, that's got an ESOP, with insider fiduciaries, but not on the rest of the market. But I think what a prudent fiduciary would do, it's our position, is that they would look to that body of law and they would reasonably conclude or at least they could reasonably conclude -- which I take to be, everyone agrees, is the standard here -- that -- that making a disclosure that the company has decided is not in the best interests of the shareholders and the federal securities laws, the expert -- and the expert commission has decided is not necessary and appropriate for the --"
2019.18-1165,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1683.68,1684.08,That's --
2019.18-1165,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1684.08,1687.48,That does sound --
2019.18-1165,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1687.48,1708.64,"Well, where we are, it seemed to me, is you're trying to argue both, but are there things in the securities laws that mean that the fiduciary should not disclose information that will drive the price of the share down, such as -- that's what you're saying. Okay."
2019.18-1165,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1802.2,1805.0,I think because a prudent fiduciary can't narrow.
2019.18-1165,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1851.36,1852.84,Mr. -- please.
2019.18-1165,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1858.28,1860.4,So I don't think that's -- I don't think that's right.
2019.18-1165,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1894.48,1917.0,"But those factors were in service of a particular test that said, you know, we want to ask whether a reasonable fiduciary would look at this and say that there's a course of action that would or wouldn't do more harm than good. I mean, that is what I think Justice Alito called a balancing test, and that's what Dudenhoeffer said we should do. Now there are reasons against balancing tests, but that's what it says."
2019.18-1165,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1917.0,1931.08,"Sure, but before you get to that factor, the Court said, you should also consider whether a ERISA-based obligation to disclose in that scenario would be inconsistent with the objectives of the -- of the securities laws. We think in almost every case it would be, and so you don't have to get to that third factor."
2019.18-1165,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1946.64,1951.24,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bonderoff."
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,1951.24,1967.56,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Dudenhoeffer said that ESOP fiduciaries owed the same duty of prudence as every other ERISA fiduciary, except they don't need to diversify the fund's assets."
2019.18-1165,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2081.88,2109.56,"On that particular point, if you take paragraph 106 out of your amended complaint, then it seems to me what they're saying is all you've left is you just have an allegation that, well, it always causes more harm -- it always -- it never causes more harm than good to sell -- to reveal quickly. And they say that couldn't be enough. All you did was take the sentence from Dudenhoeffer and just write it in slightly different words."
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,2122.32,2126.88,"Well, actually, 106 is not the only place where we talk about those interests."
2019.18-1165,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2170.64,2193.88,"But isn't the problem, as the Fifth and Sixth Circuit said in similar circumstances, that you have different classes of beneficiaries, some of whom would be harmed, some of whom would be benefitted? And when that's the circumstance, it's a little hard to hold the fiduciary liable for violating the duty of prudence, given the different interests of the different classes of beneficiaries? What's wrong with that -- that conclusion?"
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,2193.88,2196.6,"Well, there are a couple things that I would take issue with."
2019.18-1165,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2231.08,2232.6,Can I -- can I interrupt you there? I'm sorry.
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,2251.56,2254.4,"Well, it depends on the way the plan is operated."
2019.18-1165,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2265.88,2278.16,"Oh, I understand that the plaintiff might not know at the time he's pleading his case, but the ERISA fiduciary would know, I would think, whether the fund is a net buyer or a net seller."
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,2281.32,2282.32,Perhaps.
2019.18-1165,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2283.52,2283.76,Okay.
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,2283.76,2284.4,Some do --
2019.18-1165,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2284.4,2284.64,Some don't.
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,2284.64,2285.0,-- some don't.
2019.18-1165,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2285.0,2285.32,Okay.
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,2290.52,2291.64,"Not necessarily, because --"
2019.18-1165,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2291.64,2300.84,"Because there's more -- even more uncertainty about how the different classes of beneficiaries would be affected, if you really don't know the precise circumstance."
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,2302.6,2313.0,"Well, even if you know that it's been a net buyer for the past year, you don't know -- and I think even the Fifth Circuit pointed this out in Martone, where it was alleged to be a net buyer."
2019.18-1165,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2319.8,2320.44,But what --
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,2320.44,2320.8,But what you can --
2019.18-1165,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2320.8,2325.24,-- what do you think a reasonable fiduciary is supposed to do if the fiduciary doesn't know?
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,2325.24,2332.0,"Well, the one thing you do know for sure is that if you make a disclosure, the stock price will drop."
2019.18-1165,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2369.96,2383.48,"So is your view that in pretty much every case, maybe there are some exceptions, but that in pretty much every case, the role of the fiduciary is to operate consistently with the holders, neither the buyers nor the sellers but just the holders?"
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,2383.48,2404.6,"Well, when you're thinking about the long term, what's best long term for the investment, you're going to think about the holders more than the buyers and sellers. There could be specific factual circumstances where you have an unusual company in an unusual situation where, in fact, most of people are buyers or most of them are sellers. But, in the vast majority of cases, yes, you should put the holders up front --"
2019.18-1165,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2404.6,2408.2,"I mean, you've said a number of times the long-term value of the investment."
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,2411.92,2432.52,"Well, for one thing, it's the thing you can actually make a reasonable assessment about in real time, at the time, based on what you, as a fiduciary, know. It doesn't require you to figure out whether you've been a buyer or seller over the past however many years or months and then try to make a prediction about whether you will continue to be a buyer or seller."
2019.18-1165,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2442.6,2467.72,"Well, if that's the case and -- and we're supposed to -- the fiduciary is supposed to consider the long-term best interests of some abstract, non-identified person, why wouldn't the securities law be a really good place to start and maybe finish in assessing what those long-term overall health of the corporate interests might be?"
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,2467.72,2470.08,I would respond to that in two ways.
2019.18-1165,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2472.68,2489.84,"I mean, isn't that what the securities law are all about? It's -- it's -- it's ensuring the markets function on a net basis with as much transparency and efficiency as we can muster, subject to reasonable -- imposing reasonable costs and reasonable duties on people?"
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,2489.84,2501.96,"I don't disagree with that description of the securities laws, but the securities laws have different interests than ERISA does, and that's going to create a problem when you're talking about both --"
2019.18-1165,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2501.96,2530.12,"But I -- I -- I accept that if -- if we're talking about some specified ESOP member, but you told us to ignore that, you told us to ignore whether we're talking about a buyer or a seller or -- just abstract it to the general interests of the -- of the plan as a whole. And once we do that, I would have thought the securities law would have been a really good proxy for the duties we'd expect a fiduciary to abide."
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,2530.12,2536.64,"I think in -- as a practical matter, much of the time it is but not all of the time."
2019.18-1165,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2545.08,2547.2,"Well, where do the two diverge?"
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,2547.2,2560.48,"Well, I could envision at least two situations where they might diverge, and the reason they do is because the two statutes have different concerns and they protect different interests. So the securities laws care about motive."
2019.18-1165,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2571.36,2571.6,"Well, I think --"
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,2571.6,2572.16,Not when it comes --
2019.18-1165,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2572.16,2578.6,-- Mr. Clement would just say that you're not really pointing to a divergence in what the securities laws and ERISA are meant to prevent.
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,2586.04,2600.8,"No, it -- it will actually play out as a real difference because let's say you adopt the government's rule. We'll be back here in five years trying to figure out what that means. It seems like a nice, bright-line, clear rule."
2019.18-1165,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2674.4,2681.52,What was the second way? Didn't you say that there were two ways it would diverge? One is the scienter standard? Maybe I'm wrong.
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,2681.52,2681.96,Oh.
2019.18-1165,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2687.0,2732.64,"Well, if that's the point, I guess I'm -- the -- the response that might -- I expect we're going to hear in -- in rebuttal shortly enough, might -- might as well just get your thoughts on it -- on it now, is, well, may -- may -- maybe we ought to apply the same rule we apply to all private litigants. And maybe that's scienter, and you say, well, ERISA doesn't care about that, and maybe Mr. Clement says, well, it does in this context. Because, if we're concerned about the net interests of the fund and they are completely aligned with the net interests of the company, as you've suggested, then -- then that is the standard that best protects them that we've developed over time and, through the securities laws, to protect investors, consistent with, you know, reasonable -- imposing reasonable duties on people. I expect something like that."
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,2738.6,2739.28,Absolutely.
2019.18-1165,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2843.0,2888.52,"I mean, the fiduciary -- the fiduciary who is simply managing a fund is not necessarily doing things on a very regular basis that affect the market price of -- of stocks, but an insider fiduciary here would be, wouldn't it? And an insider fiduciary would receive daily or very regularly all sorts of information that has if -- that might, if disclosed, have an effect on the price of the stocks. So wouldn't it -- is this going to result in the constant injection into the mix of information about stocks all kinds of information that wouldn't otherwise come out?"
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,2888.52,2890.56,I don't think it will. I'm --
2019.18-1165,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2890.56,2894.48,"It applies to positive as well as negative information, right, doesn't it?"
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,2894.48,2896.4,I wouldn't think it would.
2019.18-1165,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2903.36,2903.52,Yeah.
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,2903.52,2993.8,"The Moench presumption comes out in 1995, and then, over the course of the next 19 years, it's adopted by various circuits, although not all of them. All that time, there are people bringing claims against insider fiduciaries for failing to make the kind of disclosures we're talking about. Yet, as far as I can see, there was no difference in the number of insiders who became -- who continued to be appointed as fiduciaries, and there was no diminution in the number of ESOPs that companies decided to have. In fact, if you take that rule that an insider fiduciary, the rule, the Pegram -- although I think it's really a misreading of Pegram -- but the Pegram rule that Mr. Clement is talking about, imagine a situation like the Enron case. The reason there wasn't a viable prudence ERISA claim against the Enron fiduciaries is that they were also insiders who knew that the company was a house of cards, and so they should have acted on that information to protect plan participants. Under Petitioners' rule, the Enron fiduciaries have no ERISA obligation to act on their information about a company like Enron. It doesn't make sense and there's no basis for it. A question, I think it was Justice Breyer, raised earlier as to why it's useful to have insiders as fiduciaries, it's actually because they know the inside information and are, therefore, in a better position to act to protect plan participants. That makes them -- that's an advantage."
2019.18-1165,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3095.52,3099.88,"So I guess I'm not sure why it's so rare, I mean, the things you just identified."
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,3119.16,3119.88,I think so.
2019.18-1165,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3149.68,3176.44,"I don't want to sort of pour cold water on this issue, but it sounds to me listening as if it's exactly the kind of issue about the relationship between the securities laws' objectives and the allegation that the ERISA trustee should or needn't disclose, in a different -- you know, that's the issue."
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,3208.68,3213.88,Disclosure here would not have been inconsistent with the securities laws.
2019.18-1165,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3218.04,3218.72,"Well, that's your --"
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,3218.72,3219.64,-- it's not required by them.
2019.18-1165,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3219.64,3220.56,-- first position is it isn't.
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,3230.36,3230.6,It -- it --
2019.18-1165,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3230.6,3233.04,-- I'm not asking you -- it's not hostile or friendly.
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,3234.68,3271.52,"I -- and -- but it's a -- it's a tricky proposition because you have to send -- I think you would have to send it back to the Second Circuit, but you'll have to tell them what kind of pleading needs to be done to answer this question. What statute are we pleading under? What interests matter? Because, if you are just analyzing this as an ERISA claim but you are saying you can only make disclosures that are required by the securities laws, it becomes a very difficult question as to whether the disclosure here is required by them or not. On one hand, there wasn't an actionable 10b-5 claim."
2019.18-1165,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3271.52,3297.24,"On -- on the question we granted cert on, which is the third Dudenhoeffer factor, there's a circuit split, and we granted cert to resolve that circuit split, and, basically, is earlier disclosure required in a situation when there are different classes of beneficiaries or is that a situation where a prudent fiduciary should not be held liable? Isn't that the question presented?"
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,3297.24,3297.84,"Well, I think that --"
2019.18-1165,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3297.84,3299.64,And it's a yes-or-no answer to that question --
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,3299.64,3299.88,That is --
2019.18-1165,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3299.88,3301.0,-- presented based --
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,3301.0,3302.52,"-- yes, yes."
2019.18-1165,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3302.52,3303.24,All right.
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,3303.24,3310.56,"And in that question presented, I think the Second Circuit did exactly what you would want courts to be doing in analyzing these issues."
2019.18-1165,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3334.68,3381.48,"So wouldn't -- looking at Mr. Clement and looking just at the third prong, you suggested that whether you're a buyer or seller can't be judged, that you really should be looking at the hold -- hold class, but none of that is pled. You pled you were a buyer and the district court said -- that the period showed more buying than selling -- and the district court said, no, it shows more selling than buying. So wouldn't a more particularized pleading basically put forth that theory, need to put forth that theory, and need to air it so that a district court judge could determine whether the pleadings are accurate?"
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,3381.48,3383.52,"I think we did put forth that theory, actually."
2019.18-1165,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3393.28,3400.52,You said that. But we still don't know whether the buyer and holder class was greater than the seller class. Where do I --
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,3400.52,3400.76,"Well, it's --"
2019.18-1165,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3400.76,3401.32,-- see that in here?
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,3401.32,3412.88,"I -- I will say, I mean, it -- it is a pretty -- it is a reasonable inference for virtually any stock plan, but particularly one of a company of this size, to say that the holders vastly outnumber the buyers."
2019.18-1165,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3412.88,3439.28,"So -- so is it fair to say, when you talk about meat on the bones, I find one little piece of specific meat, and that is the word ""inevitable."" And if I want to be fair to you, which I do, I'd say ""inevitable within a reasonably short time."" And so we have one or four -- three things."
2019.18-1165,2,63181,samuel_bonderoff,,3458.32,3458.96,Yes.
2019.18-1165,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3458.96,3459.56,Okay.
