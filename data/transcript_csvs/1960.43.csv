1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,16.58,18.128,"Mr. Chief Justice, associate Justices."
1960.43,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,18.128,22.542,-- proceed with your argument.
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,22.542,41.718,"Certiorari has been granted in this case to the Circuit Court of Arlington County and is a state court and the appeal, but we do not have the appeal as a matter of right in Virginia and we had to apply it for an appeal, which was denied and certiorari was granted by this Court."
1960.43,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,584.473,596.831,"May I ask you that the (Inaudible) that the (Inaudible) certificate is more or less, the thing itself than they still (Inaudible)?"
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,596.831,606.729,"I -- I would say, they're both the same thing as the Court -- as this Court said in the Norwich case which I referred to on page 12 of my brief."
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,735.238,735.866,Pearson?
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,735.866,740.635,"Pearson case, yes, sir and thank you, Justice Clark."
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1027.231,1044.661,"Mr. Doherty, when you say it's physical, what about a -- a note of an individual, if I hold them in a safe deposit box, notes of JP Morgan, whether it's --"
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1044.661,1045.81,"It would be very good, I'd say."
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1045.81,1048.027,What would you say to that?
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1050.301,1051.558,It's -- it's physical.
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1051.558,1054.55,The technicality of loan in the past.
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1054.55,1059.7,It's physical only in this respect.
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1067.236,1069.014,But so is a Federal Reserve note.
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1069.014,1070.146,No it doesn't say that.
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1070.654,1081.057,"Everybody, if passes for currency because everybody thinks (Inaudible) -- that you can get hard coins for this unique thing."
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1081.057,1083.289,"Well, that's true, now that's what -- that --"
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1083.289,1094.854,"What -- what I want to know is, if a note of -- of Morgan is a -- is -- shows in action, why didn't the Federal Reserve know that shows in action?"
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1094.854,1095.256,Well to the only --
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1095.256,1096.589,One lawyer to another â€“
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1096.589,1109.936,"Because the contention of the petitioner is this, that a note of any kind, where I promise to pay you $10,000 at such and such a time and for some reason or other, you lose that note."
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1133.581,1136.521,What is the highest denominations of a Federal Reserve note?
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1136.521,1137.846,"I think it is $10,000, if not --"
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1137.846,1138.515,That is what I thought.
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1152.942,1154.608,"If Your Honor please, if there was any way to --"
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1154.608,1156.466,The way the postal order?
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1157.032,1160.384,"A postal order is an entirely different thing, a postal order you mean, the --"
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1160.384,1163.544,"That the past is current, that's the only difference, isn't it?"
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1163.544,1169.105,"Well yes, but you -- when you get that order on the Western Union or the postal telegraph, what you do in that case --"
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1169.105,1172.692,"Well, I'm talking about at the Uncle Sam, not the Western Union."
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1175.307,1176.072,Postal money order?
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1176.072,1176.685,Postal money order.
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1176.685,1181.945,"Oh yes, you can always go back to Uncle Sam and get that and show that it was lost and give them the number and everything else, you have one part --"
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1181.945,1183.825,"Silver note, how about a silver note?"
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1183.825,1184.823,A silver note?
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1185.155,1187.156,Or it be always a gold note?
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1187.156,1187.556,Well --
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1187.556,1189.086,That would be different?
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1189.086,1192.635,"Well, that the only thing I can say about that is what this Court has said about it."
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1201.236,1205.6,Do you -- do we (Inaudible) a note for Morgan's and just get dollars to it?
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1205.6,1206.797,That's all you get for it.
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1248.439,1263.953,"Will it -- I -- I asked you whether it -- I carelessly lose a $5000 or $10,000 Federal Reserve note, it isn't gone if I can make the appropriate proof to the Secretary of Treasury, I'll get another one instead."
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1263.953,1271.867,"The only thing I can say to you, Justice Frankfurter, is this, that if that it could be done, there'd be such a line out there in front of that Treasury, day in and day out that --"
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1271.867,1273.747,"People just sold $10,000 note to --"
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1273.747,1274.678,"Well, that they wouldn't show him."
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1282.553,1283.52,(Inaudible)
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1283.52,1283.664,Secretary --
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1283.664,1289.003,"I -- I thought I would be in no worse financial condition (Inaudible) the last, he loses in gambling, could it to get it back from the Secretary of Treasury."
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1289.003,1290.688,"Well -- well, he could say --"
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1290.688,1291.646,That is profitable.
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1291.646,1299.6,"He could prove that, but the other thing is something that -- that goes to show that thing is just -- that itself and nothing else."
1960.43,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1299.823,1300.642,Mr. Doherty.
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1300.642,1301.209,"Yes, Your Honor."
1960.43,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1301.209,1308.827,Hasn't common acceptance understanding in the treatment by the people got something to do with his question?
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1308.827,1309.92,Well I -- I would think so.
1960.43,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1326.899,1332.057,"If it's a note and nothing's more, it's a different kind of a note than any other isn't it?"
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1332.057,1334.118,"Definitely, there's no question about that."
1960.43,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1334.849,1337.229,"But people regard it as the thing, don't we?"
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1337.229,1338.281,That -- that's right.
1960.43,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1338.281,1339.524,Not evidence of it.
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1339.524,1340.561,Not evidence of it.
1960.43,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1342.962,1344.537,"This folding money, it's generally called, folding money."
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1344.537,1345.036,Folding money.
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1349.551,1354.607,(Inaudible)
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1354.607,1355.455,"No, Your Honor."
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1356.158,1359.519,"Is there a statute on that subject, Mr. Doherty?"
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1359.519,1371.714,"No, but the only thing that have a regulation, I believe, at the Treasury where if you bring a note that's been partially destroyed in some way or other and there's enough of it there that they can figure out that it couldn't spend the other part of it, they'll give you a new note for that."
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1387.264,1392.416,Is that the (Inaudible) to protect them from some except difficulties of proof?
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1392.416,1392.676,Well --
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1392.676,1395.721,"But you think, the nature of the thing is --"
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1395.721,1395.906,The nature --
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1395.906,1400.204,"What currencies -- I mean, will you use this as legal tender and all the rest of it?"
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1400.204,1401.635,It's just the same.
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1418.214,1430.054,"Where the real -- the real nub of this case, if you agree was wether, we should assimilate reserve notes of -- to paintings and furnishing a brief case or --"
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1430.054,1430.713,"Yes, sir."
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1430.713,1433.159,More like -- more like he chose in that -- to that (Inaudible)
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1433.159,1434.541,"Yes, that's the whole question --"
1960.43,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1434.541,1446.541,"Well, isn't it -- isn't there (Inaudible) closer (Inaudible) as I gather, there'll be no question if this -- if these were coins, if this fellow for some eccentric reason had this 2 -- 300 in that -- 50,000, whatever it was --"
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1446.541,1448.124,In pennies --
1960.43,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1448.124,1455.701,"In pennies or quarters or half dollars or silver dollars, I gather that the -- that the Commonwealth of Virginia wouldn't question it."
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1455.701,1457.021,"No, that's true."
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1472.266,1490.305,"Of course, the quick doctrine as Mr. Justice Holmes, pointed out in Union Transit Company, was -- that the (Inaudible) wasn't -- I'm not suggesting we shouldn't -- that I don't accept it wholeheartedly, All I'm saying is that was a real deviation for what the (Inaudible) was supposed to do."
1960.43,0,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1490.305,1491.078,But that's true and I would --
1960.43,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1491.078,1496.377,(Inaudible) to be the relation of the domiciliary state to be a state of executor.
1960.43,1,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,1496.377,1517.159,"But they said it was such expansion of different things -- in the last say, 50, 75, 100 years that -- where people move into one jurisdiction and they have their place of business and they kept certain things and they perhaps as today have a plane and I'll be in New York, one minute and down to Florida and some other place, very shortly thereafter."
1960.43,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1527.231,1534.522,"Suppose you lose this case, when you collect back in the district?"
1960.43,2,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1534.522,1539.674,"I would hope that we couldn't gone to the police but I, I don't know."
1960.43,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1563.338,1584.625,"I should think there might be a difference between -- on Justice Harlan's assumption, there might be a difference in the ruling of this Court as to the nature -- as to the legal nature of the reserve note, when this action was made, would that (Inaudible) with the United States by something that this is part of the United States."
1960.43,2,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1590.497,1591.377,Well I don't know the --
1960.43,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1591.377,1592.914,(Inaudible)
1960.43,2,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1592.914,1596.298,"That, if Your Honor please, I think it's something for this Court to decide."
1960.43,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1596.93,1600.311,You prefer to have it -- do you prefer to have travel a different route?
1960.43,2,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1600.311,1614.066,"Yes I prefer to see that we did the proper thing and that we -- the Blodgett case, which is the law so far up to this particular time, should be retained as the law of the land that people rely on these various things, time and time --"
1960.43,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1614.066,1617.09,Without an eccentric situation isn't it?
1960.43,2,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1617.09,1617.89,"No, I -- I don't go --"
1960.43,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1617.89,1621.826,"I mean, I don't mean a legal question, but the fact --"
1960.43,2,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1621.826,1622.211,Well it's a --
1960.43,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1622.211,1625.541,Even you -- you don't have one -- whatever it was.
1960.43,2,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1625.541,1631.425,"Oh, I -- a lot of people do it just like this manner in Pearson case, he had $450,000."
1960.43,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1635.205,1637.64,(Inaudible)
1960.43,2,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1637.64,1639.257,"Well, there are a lot of them who has done it."
1960.43,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1649.616,1652.857,Which tax was a lot --
1960.43,2,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1652.857,1655.61,They were both about the same.
1960.43,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1672.701,1681.308,On your argument as I -- did Virginia tax money which was in a deposit box on the --
1960.43,2,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1681.308,1681.978,If it were in fact --
1960.43,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1681.978,1684.442,It becomes due in another state?
1960.43,2,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1684.442,1690.683,I would think so from the -- there is something -- put in the -- in the Commonwealth's brief.
1960.43,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1690.683,1692.812,"I believe they did it, I'm not sure."
1960.43,2,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1692.812,1708.432,"There's something in there in which they referred to a -- a statute or -- of Virginia which says that money, no matter where it is, is intangible or money that is -- may I read that --"
1960.43,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1708.432,1713.063,"Then they draw the business distinction between bank deposits, did they --"
1960.43,2,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1713.063,1714.323,"Well no, they don't."
1960.43,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1750.801,1757.529,That is rather simply on an ordinary deposit in a bank in another state or whether it's in a safe deposit box?
1960.43,2,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1757.529,1761.36,That -- that's the assumption I gather from the Commonwealth's brief in this case.
1960.43,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1797.398,1811.296,"They can't tax on your argument that they cannot tax the situs from Virginia on the tax date, on the basis of how much property he owns from (Inaudible) in the State of Virginia."
1960.43,2,18803,cornelius_h_doherty,,1811.296,1814.245,"That's right, if Your Honor please."
1960.43,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1817.34,1819.215,Mr. McIlwaine.
1960.43,3,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,1819.215,1822.563,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1960.43,3,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2023.428,2027.284,"Had this been silver dollars, would you have claim the right to taxing?"
1960.43,3,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,2027.284,2028.629,"No, Your Honor, we would not."
1960.43,3,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2028.629,2036.241,"What distinction do you draw between a piece of paper, a certificate, solely certificate to silver dollar?"
1960.43,3,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,2036.241,2044.455,"The silver certificate has no intrinsic value, but it's merely representative or evidence of value."
1960.43,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2076.596,2077.411,How much value?
1960.43,3,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2077.411,2081.422,"But put a silver dollar in the markets of the world, (Inaudible)"
1960.43,3,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,2081.422,2081.974,I beg your pardon.
