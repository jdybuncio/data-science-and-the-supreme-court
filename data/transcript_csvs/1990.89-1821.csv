1990.89-1821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.935,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 89-1821, Charles Z. Stevens, III versus the Department of the Treasury."
1990.89-1821,0,16995,alison_steiner,,9.106,13.324,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,106.254,111.221,"Ms. Steiner, did your client or you urge this point in the court of appeals relying on 633(d)?"
1990.89-1821,0,16995,alison_steiner,,111.221,114.657,It was not argued in the body of the brief.
1990.89-1821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,121.061,123.45,What was the question presented that subsumed it?
1990.89-1821,0,16995,alison_steiner,,123.45,153.126,The question presented stated that if an aggrieved party fails to file an administrative age discrimination complaint in the time frame of the general administrative provision of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission... the Commission... does such failure deprive a Federal district court of jurisdiction to hear a civil action filed under the Age Discrimination and Employment Act where a charge has been timely filed there under.
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,849.471,860.404,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.89-1821,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,902.012,908.963,"Ms. Wax, the court of appeals did in fact consider and rule on that point though, did it not?"
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,908.963,911.931,"Your Honor, we don't think it did."
1990.89-1821,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,980.185,985.994,"How about the first question presented in the petition, the construction of 1633(a)(d)?"
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,985.994,1002.113,"Your Honor, our theory of the case is that it doesn't really matter what the court says if in fact their comments or their statements are not encompassed by the question as framed by the petitioner."
1990.89-1821,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1022.291,1041.83,"But it... it seems to me in other cases... now maybe I'm wrong... we have treated as available for our consideration issues that were decided by a court of appeals, even though they may not have been proper... even though the court of appeals could properly have said to the appellant or the appellee, you have not properly preserved this."
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1046.156,1049.126,"Your Honor, that may be the case."
1990.89-1821,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1100.057,1101.775,Let me just interrupt and stick with your hypothetical for a second.
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1122.751,1124.501,Your Honor--
1990.89-1821,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1124.501,1127.531,I... it seems to me your example proves the opposite of what you're contending.
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1127.531,1139.667,"--Well, as we understand... I mean, if in fact that's the case, it... it allows a respondent or a court to load into a lawsuit all sorts of issues that might be quite extraneous."
1990.89-1821,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1139.667,1143.695,"Well, the court of appeals and the Government in your example that loaded an issue in--"
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1164.828,1170.123,"Well, Your Honor, it's true that we did make a statement about exhaustion in our court of appeals brief."
1990.89-1821,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1174.7,1176.918,"And if they didn't rely on that ground, why did they affirm?"
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1176.918,1190.241,"Your Honor, we... we submit that it may be that the reading... what 15(d) requires was decided by the court of appeals, but in no way was exhaustion decided by the court of appeals."
1990.89-1821,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1200.098,1204.906,"Well, what difference would it make... if you don't require exhaustion, what difference would it make if you couldn't get administrative relief?"
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1204.906,1206.516,--Well--
1990.89-1821,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1206.516,1211.139,It seems to me that's integrally related to the exhaustion argument.
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1211.139,1215.434,"--It's related, but the exhaustion question is farther down the line."
1990.89-1821,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1223.291,1224.867,"Well, they review judgments."
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1246.562,1247.296,Exactly.
1990.89-1821,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1250.856,1252.856,"Well, then... and certainly that issue is open here, isn't it?"
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1252.856,1255.512,"--Well, if this Court--"
1990.89-1821,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1255.512,1257.948,"Well, they... the court of appeals decided it."
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1257.948,1259.869,--They appeared to decide--
1990.89-1821,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1259.869,1262.447,And they... and the petitioner complains about that here.
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1270.053,1271.49,"--Well, we went on--"
1990.89-1821,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1271.49,1272.287,I mean in your response.
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1272.287,1277.425,"--We went on to address the issue, Your Honor, because we felt that this Court wanted us to do so."
1990.89-1821,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1299.244,1300.353,"Well, what if... what if we agree with you on that?"
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1308.835,1311.146,"We... we certainly concede that it's not, Your Honor."
1990.89-1821,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1311.146,1312.567,I mean at the time of filing this suit.
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1312.567,1321.157,"Well, the petitioner asked this Court to review this case, because there was a circuit split on the exhaustion and election issue."
1990.89-1821,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1321.157,1322.157,"Well, just stick to my question."
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1322.157,1322.829,Yes.
1990.89-1821,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1322.829,1324.421,What about the issue of the time?
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1329.544,1330.919,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1821,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1330.919,1335.042,"All right, if it was wrong, and say we agree with you on the exhaustion thing, that it isn't here."
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1341.289,1345.007,That would certainly be an appropriate course of action.
1990.89-1821,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1361.593,1361.796,"Well, I know."
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1368.201,1369.888,"We do, Your Honor."
1990.89-1821,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1369.888,1381.555,"You're entitled to argue certainly or make the point that perhaps the writ should be dismissed as improvidently granted, but I wouldn't spend a great deal of time on it I think after the Court has granted certiorari."
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1381.555,1383.413,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1821,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1388.474,1393.051,"Well, you're going to tell us the same thing that the other side told us, right?"
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1393.051,1394.799,--Yes.
1990.89-1821,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1394.799,1395.846,That's very nice.
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1421.101,1424.225,"Your Honor, we couldn't agree more."
1990.89-1821,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1425.146,1426.255,"Well, that isn't right."
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1428.255,1430.551,--We represent the Department of the Treasury.
1990.89-1821,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1430.551,1431.707,Which is the employer.
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1431.707,1432.768,Which is the employer.
1990.89-1821,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1432.768,1434.925,We you do... we do have an employer before us.
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1434.925,1436.299,"Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1821,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1436.299,1444.372,"I thought you represented the United States, which includes not just the Treasury but also the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission whose interest in this matter is quite different from that of Treasury."
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1444.372,1446.028,"Correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1821,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1469.535,1473.113,"And you didn't agree in the lower court either on the exhaustion issue, did you?"
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1473.113,1475.003,"We took a different position, Your Honor."
1990.89-1821,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1475.003,1475.346,That's right.
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1475.346,1478.797,But we have reconsidered our position.
1990.89-1821,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1517.579,1526.294,"May I ask why, if it's such plain error, why the Solicitor General didn't suggest that we grant, vacate, and remand for... to correct the obvious error?"
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1528.247,1528.544,"We did, Your Honor."
1990.89-1821,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1554.642,1564.872,"Well, of course, the Solicitor General isn't bound to recommend a grant, vacate, and remand every time a lower court makes an error in favor of the Government."
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1571.729,1577.274,We... we... our first line recommendation in our position was to deny.
1990.89-1821,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1602.624,1607.09,--How can you say affirming would be proper if it's plain that the court of appeals committed error?
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1607.09,1608.559,--Well--
1990.89-1821,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1608.559,1609.558,But you concede.
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1619.163,1629.955,"--Well, respectfully, Your Honor, that rests on our view of this case as presenting the issue only of the timeliness of the administrative filing."
1990.89-1821,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1643.763,1645.09,"Well, why wasn't it injected by your reply brief in the court of appeals?"
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1648.01,1649.573,Your Honor--
1990.89-1821,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1649.573,1651.478,They do quote correctly from your brief in the court--
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1651.478,1651.9,"--They do, Your Honor."
1990.89-1821,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1651.9,1653.04,"--Okay, I see--"
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1653.04,1662.755,Only on our theory that a respondent cannot really enlarge the issue that's argued by a plaintiff.
1990.89-1821,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1725.01,1729.259,--Now... you're now addressing the first question or the... or the second question on the merit?
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1729.259,1734.398,"We are addressing the second question, the exhaustion and election question."
1990.89-1821,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1737.163,1737.569,Yes.
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1737.569,1739.473,--the court is in error on the first.
1990.89-1821,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1739.473,1745.581,"But in your... your first position on the second question, if I'm right is that we should not reach it?"
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1745.581,1747.689,"Correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1821,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1747.689,1752.031,"And now... but now you're saying if we do reach it, this is the correct result to reach?"
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1752.031,1753.733,"Correct, Your Honor."
1990.89-1821,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1760.403,1763.744,"Well, there are really three questions here, right?"
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1763.744,1764.338,"Yes, correct."
1990.89-1821,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1764.338,1769.946,On all of which you are arguing the other side's point of view of the case on the merits.
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1770.712,1772.085,Probably right.
1990.89-1821,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1801.135,1802.979,You could have divided up the argument with the other side.
1990.89-1821,1,17272,amy_l_wax,,1807.087,1808.055,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1990.89-1821,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1914.871,1917.495,"Thank you, Ms. Wax."
1990.89-1821,2,16995,alison_steiner,,1920.603,1923.804,"Your Honor, unless there are further questions from the Court--"
1990.89-1821,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1923.804,1926.554,"Thank you, Ms. Steiner."
1990.89-1821,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1926.554,1929.07,The case is submitted.
