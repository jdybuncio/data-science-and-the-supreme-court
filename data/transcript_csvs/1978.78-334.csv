1978.78-334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,21.082,"We'll hear arguments in Fare against Michael C., beginning at 1 O'clock."
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,23.742,30.523,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1978.78-334,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,368.512,379.269,"Well, you don't suggest, do you, Mr. Hart, that if there had been no Miranda warning, a finding of voluntariness would save the case under Miranda?"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,379.269,391.072,"Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, respectfully, while that issue need not be reached in this case, we would suggest that the Miranda warnings are not necessarily applicable to juvenile proceedings."
1978.78-334,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,402.629,405.259,What if this were an adult proceeding?
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,405.259,412.844,"In an adult proceeding, the Miranda rule is presently the law of the land and the Miranda admonitions would, of course, apply."
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,414.006,417.338,"He wasn't in the juvenile court when he made this question in his answers, right?"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,417.338,418.029,"Yes, he was."
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,418.029,418.078,This one --
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,418.078,418.51,This was in --
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,418.51,420.211,-- with the police?
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,420.211,424.151,"When he made the questions and answered the police, he was arrested as a juvenile suspect."
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,424.846,428.548,"Well, was it the same police that arrested other suspects?"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,428.548,429.509,"Yes, it was, Your Honor."
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,429.509,432.077,"So, what's the difference about Miranda applying?"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,434.465,437.277,The difference is this.
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,437.277,437.303,(Voice Overlap)
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,437.303,445.235,"Juvenile proceedings, while adversary in nature, are interested in some different societal goals in the adult criminal --"
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,445.235,448.027,Including a statement -- confession out of him?
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,448.027,448.72,Certainly not.
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,448.72,449.143,Right.
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,450.776,451.69,Because the Fifth Amendment prohibits coercion.
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,451.69,453.658,"He was different, the juvenile would --"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,453.658,454.384,Correct.
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,454.384,457.188,"The Fifth Amendment does apply to juveniles, right?"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,457.188,460.196,"The Fifth Amendment does apply to juveniles, as this Court said so in, In re Gault."
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,460.196,460.941,I thought so.
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,460.941,462.818,We would concede the Fifth Amendment applies to juveniles.
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,462.818,464.188,That's what I thought.
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,464.188,470.504,"However, we take the following position by analogy to McKeiver versus Pennsylvania."
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,491.361,491.436,And you --
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,491.436,492.175,As such --
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,492.175,495.127,Is that a state matter?
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,495.127,496.449,"Well, that was -- that --"
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,496.449,497.087,Is that a state matter?
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,497.087,501.807,"Juvenile proceedings in California, and I believe in most states, are instituted in -- on behalf of the minor."
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,501.807,502.162,"Yes, but I mean --"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,502.162,502.979,This Court --
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,502.979,518.355,"The question as to what type of procedure is used for a juvenile is, first of all, a state matter, and this is -- the State Supreme Court passed on that, doesn't it preclude us --"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,518.355,518.511,Not necessarily.
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,518.511,519.799,-- in that one point?
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,519.799,520.241,Yes.
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,520.241,522.234,On that one point?
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,522.234,523.616,Not necessarily Your Honor.
1978.78-334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,622.28,633.921,"Do you say the strict Miranda rule as you put it should not be applied to juveniles because they are not exposed to a criminal punishment, is that your --"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,633.921,636.557,What we say is that we shouldn't have artificial barriers to the truth seeking process.
1978.78-334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,636.557,638.216,"Well, I was putting the question in another way."
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,638.216,639.172,Okay.
1978.78-334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,639.172,639.988,And you mean?
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,639.988,651.697,"Our position is that while they are in a sense subject to custody, there are other societal values at stake that do not necessarily exist in the adult system."
1978.78-334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,678.71,685.119,"Is it not correct that what you're arguing is that even if he'd asked for a lawyer, the Miranda should not have applied?"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,685.119,685.775,Well --
1978.78-334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,685.775,686.823,That it's still the same technical obstacle.
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,686.823,690.721,"Certainly, if he conditioned his willingness to talk on the presence of a lawyer."
1978.78-334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,690.721,696.175,"It was -- instead of -- everything is exactly the same in the transcript, except he says, “I want a lawyer” instead of, “I want a probation officer.”"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,699.443,700.898,I submit that --
1978.78-334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,700.898,701.246,That's your submission.
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,701.246,703.953,A strict Miranda exclusionary rule should not apply.
1978.78-334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,703.953,704.279,In other words --
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,704.279,713.967,"If he would -- if he says, “Can I have my lawyer present?”"
1978.78-334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,726.245,729.755,"Oh, well, supposing he said, “I want my lawyer present now.”"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,736.328,737.637,We submit that's permissible.
1978.78-334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,737.637,738.33,That would be permissible?
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,738.33,739.577,That's permissible.
1978.78-334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,739.577,739.619,But would it --
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,739.619,740.097,We --
1978.78-334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,740.097,744.17,-- would it be with an adult under --
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,744.17,744.715,Each --
1978.78-334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,744.715,744.8,Okay --
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,744.8,745.472,-- our position is that --
1978.78-334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,745.472,745.713,Is that the Miranda case?
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,745.713,746.685,-- it should be.
1978.78-334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,746.685,749.284,"Well, maybe it should be, but except in the Miranda case, would it be?"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,749.284,755.291,"Alright, except in the Miranda case, I think it that would still be a permissible type of questioning."
1978.78-334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,763.743,771.69,"Doesn't the Miranda say if he asks of a lawyer, interrogation must cease until he gets a lawyer?"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,771.69,774.71,"There is language to that effect, but it isn't necessary to the disposition granted."
1978.78-334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,774.71,779.197,"Well, there's a lot of language that's not necessary to the decision in the Miranda cases."
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,779.197,781.199,We would submit -- we would offer the following example.
1978.78-334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,816.352,819.79,Is that a new word in law enforcement jargon?
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,822.477,823.474,Excuse the colloquial.
1978.78-334,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,828.928,833.009,"Well, you certainly did save a lot of wind by saying Mirandized."
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,833.009,835.687,Thank you Your Honor.
1978.78-334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,843.386,844.861,"Well, that's not the Miranda test though."
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,844.861,857.306,"That's true, that's true and to that extent the Miranda test is a departure from the lauadble goals of the Fifth Amendment and the goals that I think this Court was attempting to pursue in the Miranda opinion."
1978.78-334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,857.306,859.844,But it is a step and it has been taken.
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,859.844,876.032,"That's true and certainly the decision in this course -- in this case doesn't turn on whether or not there was a technical Miranda defect because, as far as the admonitions required in the Miranda opinion, those were complied with in this case."
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,878.92,887.51,"Do I understand you to say that there is a case in California where a lawyer told the guy, under Miranda ruling, “Don't talk?”"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,887.51,887.999,No.
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,888.066,890.141,"Then he told him, “Go ahead and talk,” didn't he?"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,890.141,891.312,"No, he didn't say one thing or another."
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,891.312,892.941,"He didn't tell him not to talk, did he?"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,892.941,893.67,Right.
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,893.67,901.042,"So, what happens to all that I -- was been made to read and don't let them talk to the lawyers, but the lawyer automatically tell him to shut up?"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,904.524,905.716,"Well, I think the pre --"
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,905.716,906.975,"I guess it's gone, isn't it?"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,906.975,910.912,The presence of a lawyer during an interrogation is not necessarily so that the lawyer would --
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,910.912,913.078,"When, he said one case that says so --"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,913.078,918.138,But there may be occasions when it will be to the suspect's advantage to talk particularly if he had a good alibi and the lawyer --
1978.78-334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,918.138,920.232,Wasn't that said along before Miranda?
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,920.232,920.357,Certainly.
1978.78-334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,920.357,931.777,"I believe Mr. Justice Jackson said any lawyer worth this all who's going to tell the client not to talk until he, the lawyer, knows in private what he's going to say."
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,931.777,936.745,"Well, we submit Your Honor that there might be indications where a lawyer would not make that statement to his client."
1978.78-334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,936.745,939.461,Perhaps after he'd had the private conversation.
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,939.461,946.355,"But along those lines Your Honor, returning to this case, certainly a probation officer is not going to be in the same position."
1978.78-334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,960.294,972.307,"You could hardly expect this respondent here to know about that obligation of the probation officer, would you?"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,972.307,978.467,"Well, number one, Your Honor, the record indicates that respondent was aware of the fact that his probation officer was a peace officer."
1978.78-334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1060.05,1071.602,"Yes, but the clergyman would surely be bound by confidence with respect to anything imparted to him, whereas the probation officer would be in a contrary position, would he not?"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1075.406,1089.054,"Exactly, which -- by statute in California, the probation officer investigates -- alleges a -- allegations against minors, brings the -- sources those investigations to the District Attorney or to the local prosecuting authority."
1978.78-334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1099.765,1121.129,"Would you hazard a guess or you don't have to if you don't want to, as to what the Supreme Court of California might have done if the probation officer had indeed come in response to a call and privately advised the respondent to tell everything and then it came to the California Supreme Court in that posture."
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1121.129,1123.44,"Okay, two responses to that without making a guess."
1978.78-334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1123.44,1129.035,Would it not be the State of California advising the man to surrender his rights?
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1129.035,1130.432,"It would be, certainly."
1978.78-334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1131.02,1134.999,"Do you think -- when you say “certainly,” do you mean that's probably what the Supreme Court of California would decide?"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1134.999,1136.698,"Well, I'm not sure what they would decide."
1978.78-334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1137.427,1139.545,That's a dangerous guess anyway.
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1139.545,1143.771,"Okay, let me inform the court of the premise for my guess."
1978.78-334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1202.461,1207.907,"Another aspect of it, he was suspicious that the person the police might bring in might not in fact be a lawyer."
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1207.907,1207.92,That's true.
1978.78-334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1207.92,1216.623,If the probation officer had assured him that this third party was in fact a lawyer perhaps he wouldn't have had that concern because presumably he trusted his probation officer.
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1216.623,1227.37,"Well, that's a possibility except, I think the fact that he was re-admonished after he made that suspicion and told that he didn't have to talk at all, that was his right."
1978.78-334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1227.37,1229.612,Why do you suppose he asked for a probation officer?
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1231.325,1235.169,"Personally, Your Honor, I think it was just an informational question."
1978.78-334,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1235.27,1239.904,"You know, I followed his statement, I don't think I could trust whoever you'd bring in, that I -- did -- isn't it fair to infer that he thought he could trust --"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1239.904,1248.834,"Well, there's some indication in the record Your Honor that he had been told by the probation officer to contact the probation officer whenever he had law enforcement contact."
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1261.974,1265.639,Perhaps he really trusted the probation officer.
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1265.639,1274.61,I think there's some indications he trusted the probation officer and I think that the trust would've been misplaced if he felt that -- if he wanted the probation officer to act as counsel.
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1274.61,1280.244,"Well, he might have wanted to -- the police -- the probation officer to tell him whether he was a counsel."
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1280.244,1280.788,True.
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1280.788,1282.009,Or whether this guy was a phony.
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1282.009,1283.097,True.
1978.78-334,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1326.323,1332.906,"In form -- the question was, as you say, just a request for information, “Can I have my probation officer here?”"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1332.906,1336.416,"Yes, and he was told he couldn't."
1978.78-334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1336.416,1340.608,"And that -- formally at least, was not a request, it was just a --"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1340.608,1341.366,That's correct.
1978.78-334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1341.366,1344.937,"To have the probation officer there was just a request for information, “can I?”"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1344.937,1346.84,"That's correct, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1978.78-334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1346.84,1355.52,"But you don't quarrel with the Supreme Court's equating that with a request for the probation officer, do you?"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1355.52,1357.348,"Well, if it was a request --"
1978.78-334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1357.348,1359.062,“May I” or “I would like to have my probation officer here.”
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1359.062,1362.676,He certainly didn't condition his willingness to talk on the presence of a probation officer.
1978.78-334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1362.676,1367.927,"But you don't quarrel with their equating that with, “I request that my probation officer be here.”"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1367.927,1369.27,"Well, we do quarrel with it."
1978.78-334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1371.346,1373.191,Do you here too?
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1373.191,1374.54,"And we do here, too."
1978.78-334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1376.047,1380.84,"So, you think there should perhaps be one rule if he just says, “Can I have my probation officer here?”"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1384.127,1384.548,Not unless --
1978.78-334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1384.548,1387.783,Then why do you quarrel with it?
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1387.783,1388.414,"Well, we quarrel with it because --"
1978.78-334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1388.414,1389.881,If you think there are two different cases?
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1389.881,1390.121,If he said --
1978.78-334,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1390.121,1390.636,"I mean, if you think he's not speaking --"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1390.636,1396.587,"If he says, “Can I have my probation officer here and I'm conditioning my acceptance to speak on the presence of the probation officer.”"
1978.78-334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1400.184,1411.745,Do you think this fellow in this posture would be inclined to have all these nuisances that a lawyer or a law student might put in?
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1411.745,1416.959,"Perhaps not, nor would an adult criminal offender necessarily have all of the nuisances, but --"
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1416.959,1424.967,"Mr. Attorney General, in order he says, “Can I have my probation officer here?”"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1446.589,1448.357,"Then, in that case, Mr. Justice Marshall --"
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1448.357,1450.565,Doesn't he say right in the next sentence?
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1450.565,1452.777,"That's correct, and we submit that --"
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1452.777,1453.611,That's what he was talking about.
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1453.611,1457.681,His further waiver in agreement to talk is all the more voluntary because he fully understood.
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1457.681,1462.705,"(Voice Overlap) “We will get you your probation officer."""
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1462.705,1463.469,Our position is at most --
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1463.469,1466.694,"Didn't he say that, they would get it?"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1466.694,1468.35,He was told that he could not have the probation office there.

1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1486.46,1490.991,"(Voice Overlap) to show over and over again, which constantly is --"

1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1491.047,1493.338,"-- doing what Miranda said, “don't do.”"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1493.338,1497.257,"At most, that was an ambiguous statement which police sought to clarify."
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1505.198,1511.073,"Question, “Will you talk to us without an attorney present?”"
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1516.29,1517.116,The question is not ambiguous.
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1517.116,1519.166,"That's right, because they had led him up to it."
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1523.812,1525.715,And they told him he didn't have to talk right then at all.
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1525.715,1528.293,And after they told him they would get the probation officer.
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1528.293,1529.269,Right.
1978.78-334,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1529.269,1529.33,After.
1978.78-334,0,36043,mark_alan_hart,,1529.33,1545.459,"And -- I submit the minor fully understood and the trial court found that he fully understood that he didn't have to talk to them then if he didn't want to without the presence of the probation officer, and he agreed to talk to them at that time and the trial court found that that was a complete waiver."
1978.78-334,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1582.074,1590.001,Very well.
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1611.258,1614.887,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1696.179,1699.136,"Well, what difference does it make whether they used the term or not, counsel?"
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1699.136,1703.768,"Well, the difference is that, beyond not using the term, petitioner never focuses on --"
1978.78-334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1703.768,1704.936,We all know he's a minor.
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1706.244,1713.317,"Well, the problem is that petitioner fails to argue the application of the Miranda rules to juveniles."
1978.78-334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1751.348,1754.904,"What if he'd ask, “Can I have my teddy bear?”"
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1754.904,1757.864,"Well, I guess it depends on whether it's a live teddy bear, but I think that the answer --"
1978.78-334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1757.864,1759.828,"Well, why -- why should it?"
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1761.201,1761.432,Okay.
1978.78-334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1761.432,1765.253,Let's say this is a nine-year-old juvenile.
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1765.253,1775.65,The answer is that a request for a teddy bear would be one of the totality of circumstances that -- where the court should take into account in ascertaining whether or not that youngster was really voluntarily waiving his rights or not.
1978.78-334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1775.65,1784.42,"Do you think a request in other words is the equivalent of saying, “I refuse to answer relying upon my right under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment.”"
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1784.42,1785.801,"Well, not for the teddy bear request."
1978.78-334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1789.841,1808.808,"The court -- the California Supreme Court has held that a request by a juvenile to have his probation officer or more accurately in this case, a request of whether he could have his probation officer here was the equivalent of saying, “I refuse to answer your questions based upon my rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.”"
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1808.808,1811.74,"That's correct, and that --"
1978.78-334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1811.74,1812.664,Per se?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1812.664,1813.295,"Yes, that is --"
1978.78-334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1813.295,1814.887,Not just one of the circumstances --
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1814.887,1815.357,That's right.
1978.78-334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1815.357,1815.861,-- in the totality?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1815.861,1820.537,"And the reason for that decision, the California Supreme Court is very careful to note and distinguish."
1978.78-334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1825.345,1828.553,"And dentists, I suppose and doctors and --"
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1828.553,1829.279,Yes.
1978.78-334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1831.335,1833.12,Older brothers and sisters?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1833.12,1834.861,Older brothers and sisters.
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1839.71,1843.068,Who was he to ask for a prosecutor?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1843.068,1850.044,"Well, if he got this prosecutor, he'd be in trouble, but I think that if he'd ask for a prosecutor, he would not be invoking what Miranda talks about and affirm the --"
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1850.044,1854.249,What's the difference between a prosecutor and a probation officer?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1854.249,1857.441,"A big difference, the world of difference, and I'd like to take issue with the statement at hand --"
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1857.441,1860.242,They're both paid by the same people.
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1860.242,1861.202,It's not true.
1978.78-334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1861.876,1864.839,"Of course, you're paid by the same people too, aren't you?"
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1864.839,1866.477,"Yes, we all are paid by the same people."
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1866.477,1866.912,What?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1866.973,1868.199,I suppose everybody here is paid by the same people.
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1868.199,1868.758,Where do you get --
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1868.758,1869.863,That is the people.
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1869.863,1878.657,The one point that I'm interested in right now is why is a probation officer singled out as the only person?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1890.246,1891.707,"Well, professor of law would be an attorney."
1978.78-334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1893.326,1893.534,You mean (Voice Overlap) --
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1893.534,1894.041,There is something --
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1894.041,1899.105,There are some professors of law that are members of the Bar of this Court.
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1899.105,1909.093,"Well, the California Supreme Court answered that question by very carefully delineating what it was about the probation officer that made a request for that person a natural Miranda invocation."
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1909.093,1910.868,"That was only Judge Mosk's opinion, wasn't it?"
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1910.868,1915.158,"No, no, I'm talking about the majority opinion at pages 476 and 477."
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1916.208,1917.462,"Well, give me your idea of it."
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1917.462,1921.063,I'd be glad to and it can happen -- the match up with the California Supreme Court's idea.
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1947.118,1948.986,It takes the place of the parents?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1948.986,1957.118,"Yes, it's that distinctive feature of the probation officer in California in this case that made the California Supreme Court draw that line."
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1957.118,1961.49,So that -- this case wouldn't be present in any place than California?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1961.49,1963.015,"Well, I agree with that."
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1963.476,1963.511,Do you agree with that?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1963.511,1965.637,-- it's only (Voice Overlap) three years ago in California of the statutes there.
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1965.637,1967.59,"Look, do you agree with that or not?"
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1967.59,1969.453,It cannot be more than precedent in California.
1978.78-334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1971.974,1972.579,Did this --
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1972.579,1975.699,Because the statute as to the role of the probation office has changed since this case.
1978.78-334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1975.699,1979.301,Did your client have -- was he an orphan?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1979.301,1980.251,I don't believe so.
1978.78-334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1980.617,1981.648,He did have a mother.
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1981.648,1981.694,I think there were parents.
1978.78-334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1981.694,1983.108,Did he have a mother and a father?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1983.108,1984.251,Yes.
1978.78-334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1984.251,1987.41,Then why was there any occasion of a in loco parentis?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1987.41,1987.817,Well --
1978.78-334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1987.817,1989.643,If there were true parents?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,1989.643,1994.775,When the court -- the juvenile court takes control over a minor in California and I can't speak for the rest of the country.
1978.78-334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2011.621,2011.829,I see.
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2011.829,2014.727,"Sometimes, that means -- sometimes that removal from the home."
1978.78-334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2014.727,2014.837,I see.
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2014.837,2015.818,Sometimes it doesn't.
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2015.818,2015.903,"Well, did --"
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2015.903,2016.789,But that probation officer is in charge.
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2016.789,2020.418,Didn't it in this case it said -- all such papers in this record?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2020.418,2021.925,It is clear that the minor was on probation.
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2021.925,2024.906,Are there such papers in this record?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2024.906,2032.088,Your Honor it is clear that the minor was on probation and 726 through 731 of the Code requires that you can't be put on probation unless that finding were made.
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2034.087,2034.661,It has to?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2034.661,2035.485,It has to be true.
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2038.057,2046.404,You say this -- in California he'd be all that but we have great difficulty -- I have great difficulty in assuming that.
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2046.404,2053.34,"Well, again it -- the code sections that I've referred to clearly delineate the required findings that a court must make in order to place a minor on probation."
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2053.34,2056.331,"Well, when was this -- when was this done in his case?"
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2056.331,2057.804,"Well, I don't think the record is clear as to that."
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2057.951,2061.485,"Well, (Voice Overlap) what am I suppose to understand?"
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2062.746,2063.873,"Your Honor, it's not in the record."
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2063.873,2066.663,"You don't know where, when, where or why."
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2066.663,2067.471,"Your Honor, it's not in the record."
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2067.471,2068.565,Is that right?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2068.565,2070.263,"Yes, it is."
1978.78-334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2137.866,2146.73,Do you suggest that this record does not show that he was advised of his rights by an officer of California?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2146.73,2152.798,The record does show an advisement by police officers in California of a number of Michael's rights.
1978.78-334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2153.276,2159.3,"Well, aren't they the -- you say a number, do you exclude from that the critical advice that we're here talking about?"
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2159.3,2163.738,"There's no question that a complete Miranda advisement was given in this case, I'm not arguing that."
1978.78-334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2171.383,2174.061,"So, you're going to apply that generally or just to this juvenile?"
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2174.061,2182.411,"Well, if there's no question that this Court has said over and over again that it must be a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of the suspect, not of the police."
1978.78-334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2185.961,2190.426,"(Voice Overlap) much use on your theory, there isn't much use in giving the warning."
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2192.157,2193.586,"No, it's not redirect."
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2224.404,2229.011,"Well, what do you do with, “Okay, will you talk to us without an attorney?”"
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2231.924,2235.874,"Well, eventually -- well, Michael says a lot of things in this record."
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2248.117,2251.095,"And, at the end, he says, “Yes.”"
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2251.095,2252.562,"Well, I don't think that's the end."
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2279.168,2289.236,"Well, do you take the position that the state could've done one of two things till they give him a probation officer or a lawyer?"
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2289.236,2289.648,"Well, the police --"
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2289.648,2292.646,Or did he had to get a probation officer or nothing?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2292.646,2295.052,"Well, I think that they could've given him a lawyer."
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2295.518,2295.729,Would that been alright?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2295.729,2296.497,-- we'd -- might be mistaken.
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2302.53,2304.905,"So, the lawyer wouldn't have been satisfactory?"
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2304.905,2306.743,"Well, if the lawyer talked with the minor, and the minor then is --"
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2306.743,2308.982,"Well, what are you going to do with Miranda now?"
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2311.061,2311.701,Yes.
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2311.701,2316.611,"Now, you're going to substitute probation officer for the lawyer and rewrite Miranda."
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2316.611,2317.6,"No, I don't want to rewrite Miranda."
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2317.6,2321.513,Please don't.
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2321.513,2324.244,I vote not to rewrite Miranda.
1978.78-334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2368.407,2373.947,"Also, the state would be free to put him in the gas chamber and kill him too on conviction --"
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2373.947,2374.204,That's right.
1978.78-334,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2374.204,2375.553,-- if he was an adult.
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2375.553,2376.236,That's right.
1978.78-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2381.563,2392.738,"Doesn't Miranda say that the police must advice him of his right to an attorney, not that he -- they can question him only if he raises it on his own motion, so to speak?"
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2392.738,2393.722,Yes.
1978.78-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2393.722,2397.096,"So, it isn't a question of the juvenile having to think up a right to an attorney."
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2398.29,2403.542,"Yes, but the reality -- it's not a question of the minor understanding that he has a right to an attorney."
1978.78-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2408.07,2408.323,"Well, Michael --"
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2408.323,2409.326,Who's going to get the attorney?
1978.78-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2409.326,2411.339,"Michael wasn't a 10-year-old, was he?"
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2411.339,2418.547,"He was a 16-year-old who's on probation and afraid the police were going to trick him and they sure did, didn't they?"
1978.78-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2418.547,2419.348,I don't think they did.
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2419.348,2420.725,"Well, they told him he was going to be better off."
1978.78-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2441.876,2445.312,"Well, how does a 22-year-old necessarily know how to get an attorney?"
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2445.312,2447.272,"Well, we draw a line somewhere, I admit."
1978.78-334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2563.154,2583.404,"What would you say counsel if the probation officer had come, had a private conversation with the young man for a half hour or an hour then came in and said, “I've advised my client or my -- whatever they call him, patient or my charge to tell you the whole story."
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2589.184,2591.416,"Well, let me point out that this Court doesn't have to reach that issue but I would like to answer it."
1978.78-334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2591.416,2592.271,"Well, no."
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2594.304,2595.404,I'd be glad to answer it.
1978.78-334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2614.543,2622.297,Do you think a lawyer who advises his client to tell the truth and throw himself on the mercy of the court is acting like a prosecutor in every case?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2622.297,2623.303,No.
1978.78-334,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2648.21,2656.023,"Mr. Menaster, a moment ago I thought you said that the California's Supreme Court's decision turned on the facts of this case."
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2692.065,2693.042,"Oh, I don't agree."
1978.78-334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2724.571,2734.916,You have emphasized that under this California statute the probation officer must act in loco parentis in every situation.
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2766.826,2767.343,"Well, the critical --"
1978.78-334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2767.343,2768.678,Is suppressible?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2768.678,2771.082,The critical question is exactly what role the parents played.
1978.78-334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2772.158,2774.333,"Well, they played the role that I've just described."
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2774.333,2783.365,"There's a case in California involving an attorney who talks to a suspect because the police asked him to and the police say, “Listen, if you get this suspect over here to make a statement, we'll let your client out.”"
1978.78-334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2785.783,2786.691,That's another case.
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2786.745,2787.343,"No, but the point is --"
1978.78-334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2787.343,2789.358,Would you care to address my question?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2789.358,2793.108,The point is that the role the attorney -- the parents play is the critical question.
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2810.622,2821.793,"Mr. Menaster, suppose the -- a very simple case, hypothetical and I hope, suppose the probation officer dropped dead."
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2825.993,2826.914,Right.
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2826.914,2828.198,He couldn't question him.
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2828.198,2829.305,Right.
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2829.305,2832.704,Where in the world can you get support for that?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2832.704,2835.048,"Well, it's just a hypothetical."
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2854.102,2856.868,"So, you can't -- nothing he says can be used against him."
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2856.868,2858.531,That's right.
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2858.531,2859.849,Forever?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2859.849,2861.629,"Well, perhaps in the next crime."
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2862.787,2866.498,"Oh, no, the probation officer is still dead."
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2866.498,2867.812,"Well, he's going to get another one eventually, I suppose."
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2867.812,2871.79,"Yes, but I mean, he could go out there and commit three more crimes."
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2874.352,2875.312,That would -- that same rule would be true.
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2875.312,2879.79,Until the probation officer was reincarnated.
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2879.79,2883.37,"The same rule would be true of course, if the defendant said, “I want Mr. Bailey as my attorney.”"
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2893.113,2896.374,Are you saying the probation officer (Inaudible) the moment he's dead.
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2896.374,2896.954,I don't.
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2896.954,2898.253,They are two different animals.
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2898.253,2900.064,California Supreme Court has held --
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2900.064,2903.176,"The California's -- well, is the probation officer member of the bar?"
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2903.176,2903.754,No.
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2905.881,2907.848,"Well, there's a difference between members of the bar and lawyers."
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2907.848,2908.306,Right.
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2908.306,2909.035,Do you recognize that difference?
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2909.035,2909.933,Yes.
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2909.933,2911.008,Alright.
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2912.4,2913.626,I assume not.
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2913.626,2915.09,Right.
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2915.09,2915.947,But of course that's not the point.
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2915.947,2916.646,But he has --
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2916.646,2920.24,Neither is the parent and the California Supreme Court has said that if a you -- if a youngster --
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2920.24,2923.542,I'm not interested in any question from you.
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2927.614,2928.04,I wasn't asking a question.
1978.78-334,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2928.04,2930.107,Because I don't get paid to answer your question.
1978.78-334,1,16579,albert_j_menaster,,2930.107,2932.29,"Well, I hope I get paid to answer them."
1978.78-334,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3353.658,3361.384,"Do you have anything further, counsel?"
1978.78-334,2,36043,mark_alan_hart,,3361.384,3378.846,The problem with the magic words approach adopted by the California Supreme Court that a request for a probation officer is per se a Fifth Amendment invocation is that it does not necessarily bear any relationship to the Fifth Amendment.
1978.78-334,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3539.691,3540.393,Thank you gentlemen.
