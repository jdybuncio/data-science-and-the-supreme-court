2014.13-433,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.92,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 13-433, Integrity Staffing Solutions v. Busk."
2014.13-433,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,7.87,10.789,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-433,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,43.86,46.812,Mr. Clement -- excuse me -- can I give you a hypo?
2014.13-433,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,91.341,105.933,"Well, I think one difference is not -- I'm not crystal clear that that time would not be non-compensable because I think that's sort of the winding down period, which is, I think, with -- at least potentially within the ambit of preliminary and postliminary activities."
2014.13-433,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,105.933,106.935,"Do you know, by the way?"
2014.13-433,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,120.693,124.731,"Well, it's a problem with hypotheticals because I don't know that that particular case has arisen."
2014.13-433,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,146.16,150.962,Couldn't you say that closing down the cash register is part of the job?
2014.13-433,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,150.962,152.562,You could.
2014.13-433,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,152.562,158.732,But getting yourself inspected as you leave -- as you leave the place of business is not part of the job.
2014.13-433,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,161.501,164.953,"You could definitely say that, Justice Scalia, and I meant to get that as the reason--"
2014.13-433,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,164.953,167.069,You could not only say it; it seems to me true.
2014.13-433,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,167.069,180.646,"--Well, all the better, then, to say it, which is that this then becomes an easier case than that because it is part of the egress process, which is really the process of getting from your--"
2014.13-433,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,180.646,189.152,But part of Justice Kagan's hypothetical was that the 20 minutes or the 30 minutes is just for antitheft purposes.
2014.13-433,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,208.996,211.932,--I don't think it's the same.
2014.13-433,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,233.597,236.815,That would seem to make it depend on a compete fortuity.
2014.13-433,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,258.913,267.685,"Well, there are some not particularly sensible results under the Portal-to-Portal Act because things do turn on where activities take place vis-a-vis walking time."
2014.13-433,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,288.098,323.921,"Mr. Clement, is it -- is it irrelevant that we're told here that because there are not enough security checkers and because all the shifts get out at the same time, what could be a five-minute process turns out to be 25 minutes, 25 minutes of the workers' time, and 20 of those allegedly would not occur if the employer had -- provided sufficient staffing."
2014.13-433,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,323.921,329.509,"Justice Ginsburg, ultimately, we don't think that allegation is relevant here."
2014.13-433,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,403.456,405.222,But that's true -- I'm sorry.
2014.13-433,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,416.53,418.466,"Could I stop you there, though?"
2014.13-433,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,425.802,428.587,"--Yeah, but could we start -- could we start with that question?"
2014.13-433,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,428.587,429.204,Sure.
2014.13-433,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,429.204,430.523,What's a principal activity?
2014.13-433,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,453.803,455.355,"No, Justice Sotomayor."
2014.13-433,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,513.009,516.144,"Well, let's -- let's take Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical."
2014.13-433,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,541.276,550.984,"It might be for the benefit of the employer in that set of circumstances, Justice Kennedy, but that doesn't make it not postliminary activity and not compensable."
2014.13-433,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,564.208,568.428,"He could move his plant, for example, to be closer to the city where the employees live, right?"
2014.13-433,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,577.801,579.534,"--That's exactly right, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-433,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,591.026,596.263,Is it -- is it always irrelevant to the analysis that it's for or not for the benefit of the employer?
2014.13-433,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,596.263,600.734,It is irrelevant for the Portal-to-Portal Act analysis.
2014.13-433,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,626.532,626.999,All right.
2014.13-433,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,641.459,643.243,--I don't think you have a case--
2014.13-433,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,643.243,651.847,"So -- and -- but donning generally isn't, so I'm not sure quite how you can take out that element from this analysis."
2014.13-433,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,651.847,663.138,"--Justice Sotomayor, I don't think there's a case of this Court that says just because the employer requires something that would otherwise be superfluous that it therefore becomes integral and indispensable."
2014.13-433,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,664.906,666.106,I agree with you.
2014.13-433,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,684.118,700.18,--But -- but take something where a particular employer has an idiosyncratic view and actually wants their employers -- employees to have a certain color smock or a certain piece of equipment that's not actually particularly integral and indispensable to anything.
2014.13-433,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,728.097,729.413,Indispensable.
2014.13-433,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,734.751,740.571,"Well, the word comes from this Court's decision in Steiner and it would -- it comes from the Labor Department's--"
2014.13-433,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,740.571,747.993,"The Labor Department says -- they're here saying it's the correct test, which I think is -- well, perhaps more important, is there a close and direct relationship?"
2014.13-433,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,750.926,754.878,--That's their gloss on what integral and indispensable means.
2014.13-433,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,754.878,755.411,"Oh, I see."
2014.13-433,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,755.411,757.163,And what I -- what I would say--
2014.13-433,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,757.163,759.432,"Well, I mean, it can't literally mean indispensable, can it?"
2014.13-433,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,767.853,772.571,"--Well, I -- with all due respect, Justice Breyer, I do think the test should be indispensable."
2014.13-433,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,774.257,781.761,"--If I can think of a way at the end of the day that the employer could have done it by saving a little more time or something like that, then it's postliminary."
2014.13-433,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,781.761,789.1,"--Well, if it's otherwise postliminary, it doesn't come outside of that exception and become a principal activity."
2014.13-433,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,805.526,806.978,"Actually, Amazon, I don't think you can."
2014.13-433,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,849.4,852.202,"Well, I guess I would beg to differ, Justice Kagan."
2014.13-433,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,877.42,890.994,"I suppose that it is also necessary to Amazon's business that it know how many hours each of its workers has worked, so it knows how much to pay them and doesn't pay them more, right?"
2014.13-433,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,901.202,903.637,"I hope there's no doubt about that, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-433,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,978.018,978.768,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-433,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,989.657,991.659,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-433,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1019.843,1026.499,You said in your brief that there are some security searches that would be compensable.
2014.13-433,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1032.586,1036.721,"Well, I think you're referring to footnote 18 of our brief, Justice Ginsburg."
2014.13-433,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1036.721,1037.088,Yes.
2014.13-433,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1037.088,1045.394,And there we talk about the fact that the employer can't just require lots of other things to be done at the end of the day and call those things postliminary.
2014.13-433,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1064.172,1070.694,"You can't think of an example, then, where a security check, an exit security check, would be compensable?"
2014.13-433,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1070.694,1084.352,"--Well, I think it would probably have to be a type of search that is so dramatically different, more intrusive, more time-consuming, the search itself, not just the time waiting in line, that it's fundamentally transformed the nature of the activity."
2014.13-433,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1213.671,1219.058,"But is the idea, then, Mr. Gannon, just -- you know, it's basically a door test?"
2014.13-433,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1225.476,1235.167,"I think that it has -- to be more precise about it, I think that canonically most of the activities are going to be associated with the process of getting in and out."
2014.13-433,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1276.428,1282.814,Can we write this case without discussing whether or not this is for the benefit of the employer?
2014.13-433,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1284.581,1295.722,"--Well, I think that it's always going to be for the benefit of the employer if it comes up in the context of the Portal-to-Portal Act, because we wouldn't be concerned about whether the exception--"
2014.13-433,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1295.722,1300.609,So you're saying that is really not at all helpful or necessary for the analysis?
2014.13-433,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1300.609,1306.697,"--I don't think it is, because that's the antecedent question about whether it would have been compensable under the FLSA."
2014.13-433,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1317.905,1321.206,So you can -- so we assume that it's for the benefit of the employer.
2014.13-433,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1321.206,1321.722,Yes.
2014.13-433,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1356.196,1364.3,"Can I give you a different hypo, which is similar to some of the ones that have been floating around in a brief, but it's actually based on real life circumstances."
2014.13-433,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1387.732,1391.117,"--Well, setting aside the question of whether the law clerks were covered by the FLSA to begin with--"
2014.13-433,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1391.117,1392.069,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
2014.13-433,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1392.069,1399.89,"--I take the point that that would be compensable, and I think there we're talking about a kind of activity that isn't preliminary or postliminary."
2014.13-433,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1403.093,1405.962,The one question I have for your side is this.
2014.13-433,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1410.93,1413.132,"--So do we, Justice Breyer."
2014.13-433,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1413.132,1414.232,"Yes, I understand that."
2014.13-433,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1439.017,1443.919,"I think, as the facts are alleged here, we know enough to know that these activities are not--"
2014.13-433,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1443.919,1444.503,No matter what?
2014.13-433,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1474.205,1481.374,"--Putting books back on the shelf, closing out the cash register, taking the cash car to the supervisor, all of those things we think are compensable."
2014.13-433,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1482.043,1484.276,Then what's different about this?
2014.13-433,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1488.53,1496.634,"--Because those are still the activities that the employee is paying you to perform, and so that is the job that you are doing."
2014.13-433,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1498.403,1505.909,"I guess I just don't understand that, Mr. Gannon, because, as Justice Kennedy said, the point of my hypo was that it's not part of the job."
2014.13-433,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1507.742,1515.615,"--But it's part of the job because it's things that have to be done in order to -- I mean, the employer has set up the procedure in order to manage the cash."
2014.13-433,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1518.949,1525.553,"The cash could be taken somewhere much more quickly and much more easily if the employer were not worried about the employee pocketing some of it, you know."
2014.13-433,1,19038,curtis_e_gannon,,1531.974,1533.909,--I don't think the purpose is enough to distinguish.
2014.13-433,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1599.785,1600.87,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,1606.707,1609.309,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-433,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1643.714,1653.255,"Just -- before you get to that, to understand the structure of your argument, if we were to disagree with you on the question of whether it's a principal activity that means you would lose this case?"
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,1657.307,1661.176,--The Ninth Circuit has taken the position it's integral and indispensable.
2014.13-433,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1666.613,1667.846,Have you abandoned that argument?
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,1667.846,1671.65,"--No, I think we've basically put the argument in a different place."
2014.13-433,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1671.65,1676.286,Where in your brief do I find your argument on integral and indispensable?
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,1676.286,1680.405,We adopt the same test as the Ninth Circuit.
2014.13-433,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1685.976,1697.199,So a principal activity is something that's integral and indispensable and then a postliminary activity could be compensable if it's also integral and indispensable?
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,1697.199,1699.232,--No.
2014.13-433,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1713.559,1718.112,Cutting grapefruit for the judge would be a separate principal activity.
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,1718.112,1719.745,"--It would, because the judge told to you do it."
2014.13-433,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1719.745,1724.116,"Yes, but this is -- no one's principal activity is going through security screening."
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,1733.038,1738.19,"But no one hired the clerks of this Court to wear morning jackets, yet it is a requirement of the job."
2014.13-433,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1752.7,1757.154,I think you hire them to wear proper attire.
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,1761.371,1766.775,--Then you hire warehousemen not to steal merchandise.
2014.13-433,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1766.775,1771.496,"--No, that's not part of their job as a warehouseman."
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,1797.145,1804.9,"Well, it depends on the view you take of their job, if you look at the tasks they are performing or do you look at their overall function."
2014.13-433,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1822.846,1825.898,"Well then, I guess I don't understand what “ principal ” means."
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,1850.696,1857.769,The term “ principal ” doesn't mean that it's overwhelmingly important.
2014.13-433,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1861.321,1865.023,Then I don't know why don't you say “ activities ” rather than “ principal activities ”?
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,1865.023,1868.308,--The statute uses the word “ principal activity ”.
2014.13-433,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1868.308,1872.379,"I know you say it because you want to fit under the statute, but I'm saying I don't understand."
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,1879.783,1883.067,We are saying that anything that is required -- a person is hired to do what they are told to do.
2014.13-433,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1894.375,1896.06,The workers are told: You've got to check out.
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,1898.077,1898.346,That's right.
2014.13-433,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1898.346,1900.629,And under your theory that would be a principal activity.
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,1900.629,1901.212,No.
2014.13-433,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1935.285,1944.825,"Just as the employer does not hire somebody to check in, that's not the job."
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,1959.068,1960.67,If the employer--
2014.13-433,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1960.67,1967.49,And it's not indispensable to the taking care of the material in the warehouse.
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,1978.298,1980.531,--It's indispensable to keeping your job.
2014.13-433,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1981.933,1984.035,"Well, that's true, but so is punching in and punching out."
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,1984.035,1989.939,"--And there is this carveout for checking in and checking out, which we acknowledge."
2014.13-433,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2000.645,2011.185,The other way to look at this is that the reason why checking in and checking out is not compensable is because it does have to do with this going in and going out.
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,2030.681,2044.423,"--But I can't have an assembly line where you start at one end and at the end of the assembly line, you're done for the day and say everything along the way since it leads to your exit is going to be a part of the egress process."
2014.13-433,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2044.423,2052.512,"What you have here which you could address in this is -- he's quite right, Mr. Clement."
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,2102.029,2104.262,It's not reasoned.
2014.13-433,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2105.831,2112.235,"--Well, that's true, but it's never seen in ad law in this area that -- okay, you can cite Skidmore et cetera."
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,2113.218,2114.353,--They don't even rely on it.
2014.13-433,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2117.889,2119.089,--But they are telling us now.
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,2119.089,2121.174,"--They are telling us now, but I think it's bundled."
2014.13-433,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2146.039,2149.593,"Well, the answer to the first question, which was yes or no, there isn't anything else you want to put in the record."
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,2153.228,2157.097,I would put in the record just what I just told Justice Kagan.
2014.13-433,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2196.255,2206.528,And how do you explain that you're not compensated for the time you are on the line waiting to don your protective gear?
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,2218.252,2221.12,--Because it's a way in versus a way out.
2014.13-433,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2265.483,2268.418,All of this is subject to collective bargaining.
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,2284.963,2285.73,Well--
2014.13-433,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2285.73,2287.065,This comes out because it's after the fact.
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,2292.383,2295.587,"--Liquidated damages are discretionary, it's--"
2014.13-433,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2295.587,2307.226,"--But going forward, they can always say, oh, we're not going -- the court says we're not going to get compensated for this time so we're going to insist on a higher amount of the hourly wage for the 8 hours that we do get compensated for."
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,2307.226,2307.712,--Well--
2014.13-433,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2307.712,2309.912,Are these employees unionized?
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,2309.912,2311.28,--These are non-union employees.
2014.13-433,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2312.28,2315.066,"Well, a lot of the employees covered by this are union employees, right?"
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,2315.066,2334.229,"Actually, the -- the Petitioner makes a big deal about this avalanche of things happening, but so far out of the 7,000 or so FLSA work -- lawsuits that are filed every -- every year, there are only five or six defendants who have ever been hit with this in the last ten years."
2014.13-433,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2381.11,2389.13,What if the employer says I have to take a particular employer-owned trolley to get to the place where I work?
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,2389.13,2392.666,It's covered by a specific exception under the 254(a)(1).
2014.13-433,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2623.482,2625.215,I think you -- I think you may have misspoke.
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,2631.252,2631.754,--I'm sorry.
2014.13-433,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2699.046,2704.55,Those are all things that somebody might pay somebody to do individually.
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,2718.127,2724.281,And nobody would pay anyone to have their changing into a uniform to be a waiter.
2014.13-433,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2728.983,2736.589,"--All I'm saying is that the examples you gave are -- are quite different because those are like mowing the lawn, things like that, those are things you would pay somebody."
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,2740.04,2743.675,--The problem is waiting to receive instructions.
2014.13-433,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2778.333,2782.719,"No, I understand that, but it's -- that enables you to do the thing that the employer is paying you for."
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,2786.788,2792.092,"--It is if you're not -- if it does, in fact, lead to that."
2014.13-433,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2861.752,2866.806,Suppose the employer has enough stations that it just takes a minute to go through.
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,2870.425,2874.994,"If the -- if the employees go through in a minute, it's de minimis."
2014.13-433,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2885.701,2885.951,Gotcha.
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,2886.884,2890.069,The Ninth Circuit uses a ten-minute rule.
2014.13-433,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2977.144,2980.663,What would the rule be -- suppose there weren't a special section about clothing.
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,2988.269,2991.537,"--Well, the way the -- the way the history--"
2014.13-433,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2991.537,2992.071,What is the history?
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,2992.071,2999.041,"--The way the history is, it says if it's necessary for the job and then they distinguish between changing on site and changing off site."
2014.13-433,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3019.638,3020.14,But if it's a uniform--
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,3020.14,3025.458,"But if it's -- even if it's a uniform, if you could wear it to work -- and this happens with police officers."
2014.13-433,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3050.242,3054.127,"--So you're saying if you didn't have that special section, this is compensable."
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,3058.013,3058.479,--Exactly.
2014.13-433,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3058.479,3060.681,And so this isn't really different from that.
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,3060.681,3061.8,That's right.
2014.13-433,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3065.019,3073.358,You're on site and it's no -- it's the same kind of burden that you might have to have protective clothes or some kind of special thing that you change into on site.
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,3073.358,3073.675,Right.
2014.13-433,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3087.182,3090.9,What's the example that you you found that's the closest to this that favors you?
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,3090.9,3092.352,Drug testing.
2014.13-433,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3092.352,3093.152,Hmm?
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,3093.152,3093.802,Drug testing.
2014.13-433,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3093.802,3094.788,Drug testing.
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,3094.788,3108.864,"Because drug testing you can do on the way out or you can do it on the -- on the way in or -- and -- and if they want to test you on the way out because they want you to go -- I mean, there are ways of defeating a drug test by taking other chemicals."
2014.13-433,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3127.523,3128.941,"I mean, is that well established?"
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,3128.941,3138.131,"--There's DOL memo of 1997, September 15, and it says drug testing is compensable."
2014.13-433,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3148.686,3152.056,Is waiting to put on protective gear compensable?
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,3152.056,3154.74,"Waiting to put on, no; waiting to put off, yes."
2014.13-433,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3154.74,3156.708,Say it -- say it again?
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,3156.708,3157.794,"Waiting to put on, no."
2014.13-433,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3157.794,3158.227,No.
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,3158.227,3160.31,"Waiting to put off, yes."
2014.13-433,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3189.079,3194.817,All of the examples you've just been giving and what you say the rules are--
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,3194.817,3195.217,--Yes.
2014.13-433,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3195.217,3197.352,--are they part of the labor regulations?
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,3197.352,3198.169,Yes.
2014.13-433,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3199.537,3200.421,So I can find them?
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,3200.421,3201.471,--Yes.
2014.13-433,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3244.833,3246.602,Unless it's covered by the Portal-to-Portal Act.
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,3249.118,3249.57,--No.
2014.13-433,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3255.208,3266.847,"The notion that if it is compensable work it's covered, there is an exception to -- there's an exception to what the employer requires."
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,3276.471,3297.201,"The -- and we say those exceptions that he's not required to pay for or the transportation to and from the mine, which is (1)(a) -- or (a)(1) of the Portal -- 254(a)(1), and then you don't get to (a)(2) if it's a -- if it's a principal activity."
2014.13-433,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3362.493,3363.16,What about checkout?
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,3363.16,3364.595,Checking out meaning?
2014.13-433,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3364.595,3366.612,"Well, they say this is like checkout."
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,3370.766,3371.166,Yes.
2014.13-433,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3375.601,3376.001,Why?
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,3379.07,3390.145,"Well, the theory, I think -- I -- I think that in 1947, that's what they -- they thought it was such a -- I don't want to use the word “ de minimis ” because it has whole other meaning, but it's--"
2014.13-433,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3390.145,3393.179,"But they're thinking -- see, the other side says, well, this is like checking out, you know."
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,3393.179,3394.114,--But it's not.
2014.13-433,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3436.175,3436.691,Thank you.
2014.13-433,2,56084,mark_r_thierman,,3437.691,3438.025,--working off the clock.
2014.13-433,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3438.393,3440.927,Mr. Clement you have four minutes.
2014.13-433,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3440.927,3443.362,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2014.13-433,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3477.785,3479.502,"That isn't really, I think, their main point."
2014.13-433,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3487.091,3487.574,--I heard their argument.
2014.13-433,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3487.574,3490.843,"--a seminar that you'd have on the thing about sexual harassment, da, da, da."
2014.13-433,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3491.912,3499.549,"Especially as my friend describes drug testing, it doesn't sound like any logical part of the egress process."
2014.13-433,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3504.436,3507.638,"But you, certainly, Mr. Clement, make it part of the egress process."
2014.13-433,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3520.712,3522.481,"--Well, no, I don't think so."
2014.13-433,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3685.652,3686.852,I gave it to you two ways.
2014.13-433,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3698.042,3707.748,"But -- but even as to the modified hypothetical, if you have to stay on the employer's premises for an extra 20 minutes, that's closer to being engaged to wait as opposed to waiting to engage."
2014.13-433,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3724.444,3725.41,"Thank you, counsel."
