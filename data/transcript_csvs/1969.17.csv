1969.17,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.874,"Mr. Hamburg, in number 17, United States against Knox."
1969.17,0,36060,mervyn_hamburg,,10.361,14.311,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,373.111,378.098,Did the District Court consider Dennis?
1969.17,0,36060,mervyn_hamburg,,378.098,382.015,"If it did Your Honor, it's certainly didn't mention in its brief in any way the --"
1969.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,382.015,382.556,Or was it say --
1969.17,0,36060,mervyn_hamburg,,382.556,383.437,"And then, I'm sorry, and its appeal --"
1969.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,383.437,387.547,You know whether it was cited to the Court or not?
1969.17,0,36060,mervyn_hamburg,,387.547,392.567,"As a matter of fact, it was not cited to the lower court."
1969.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,392.567,394.51,It had been decided though at the end?
1969.17,0,36060,mervyn_hamburg,,394.51,396.036,"I believe so, yes."
1969.17,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,405.187,410.205,"So, it's never been considered by the District Court in the light Dennis?"
1969.17,0,36060,mervyn_hamburg,,410.205,417.993,Except insofar as Dennis had been decided and I assume that the Court was aware of the holding in Dennis.
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,788.851,792.938,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.17,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,836.487,840.211,"The District Court didn't decide the case on that ground, did they?"
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,840.211,843.624,"Not only as affirmative ruling in his opinion, no sir."
1969.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,869.145,878.683,"No, this argue is been here on the next appeal limited to the deciding that the issue that the district judge decided?"
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,888.572,894.307,"Mr. Justice White, I would believe that at any time, a criminal defendant can challenge this sufficiency of the indictment."
1969.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,900.368,906.476,"No, but this was dismissed the question of our jurisdiction under the [Inaudible]"
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,906.476,911.673,"That maybe -- I'll be frank with you, I couldn't answer the question as to your jurisdiction."
1969.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,911.673,916.701,"Oh, I rather think you should."
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,916.701,949.006,"Then if I may then turn to the question of the constitutionality problem involved here, and I think that the Government in its position here has wholly failed to recognize that if a statement made, assuming he made a false statement was made, it was made under the compulsion of criminal sanctions if he didn't make a statement."
1969.17,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1015.22,1020.689,Then that's not striking to you familiar to the last argument you just heard here?
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1020.689,1036.509,"I agree with Your Honors on that point, Mr. Justice Black and I think I've urged it explicitly in my brief from the very beginning that I think the Government in this situation come before this Court or in this prosecution with unclean hands."
1969.17,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1036.509,1042.565,"But Mr. Smith as to matter of coercion, he had now the problem?"
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1046.44,1057.65,"He could've done that, yes sir, but the constitution says, either you committed a crime, the most vile crime, you can't be compelled to give information incriminating yourself."
1969.17,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1057.65,1063.993,"Well, if he had stopped gambling, the Government wouldn't have prosecuted him, would they?"
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1063.993,1068.889,Do you mean had he stopped to gambling since he filed that return?
1969.17,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1068.889,1072.443,Around about same time?
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1072.443,1072.869,I doubt it.
1969.17,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1077.538,1098.063,"What about this point about the Government's position that the photo stats here would clear up the indictment and that if he goes back to trial, there will be available to you for whatever use and does that help the point about the indictment being not quite crystal clear?"
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1098.063,1106.293,I don't think that exhibit helps the indictment because I think you got to look at the indictment of what it says and this is something that --
1969.17,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1106.293,1110.955,I'm talking about what indictment says in the light of that?
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1110.955,1125.725,I would say this that the indictment when it says that he is guilty of 1001 because he failed to answer a question; doesn't charge a false statement.
1969.17,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1129.696,1133.447,"Well, has anybody brought that question here?"
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1133.447,1135.382,I raised it in my brief.
1969.17,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1135.382,1137.68,"Well, but you can't raise it first in the brief."
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1147.639,1156.114,"Well, that was I believe Mr. Justice White makes another that a ball and I wouldn't be making the point about the jurisdiction of the Court, I was trying to answer this Court."
1969.17,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1156.114,1160.339,But it shouldn't be focusing on the constitutional issue only here?
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1160.339,1170.005,"This point, they did not state in defense was raised in the challenges to the indictment at trial, but only constitutional question."
1969.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1235.09,1241.107,"But -- when did he file , when did he file?"
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1241.107,1244.362,Back in 1964.
1969.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1244.362,1253.1,When the Government was putting that kind of question on him why the obligation to file had been upheld in this Court?
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1253.1,1254.92,That is correct and that's --
1969.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1254.92,1263.522,"So, while the Government -- do they have such dirty hands at that time?"
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1263.522,1301.091,"Mr. Justice White, I think that the situation there was that the issue of compelling to give the incriminating information was being upheld in the situation of Kahriger-Lewis that this was one of the compulsive points that he is having to file that it was the rule that bore on his having to file or be prosecuted under 7203 for not filing."
1969.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1301.091,1308.947,"But Marchetti and Grosso, do you think they are retroactive?"
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1308.947,1334.923,"I don't think this question of retroactivity because in this particular case, Knox has raised the issue at the very moment of the trial level of challenge the indictment, and this Court has held in Grosso and in Covington, I believe in Leary, Marchetti, all of those that this challenge raised by motion challenging the indictment is unquestionably timely."
1969.17,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1353.713,1357.919,"Just how was he coerced here, would you clarify that for me?"
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1363.229,1386.111,"I would suggest this if please Mr. Chief Justice Burger that here's a man that has a situation if he doesn't file this return, he is threaten to with criminal prosecution under Article 26, Section 7203 and --"
1969.17,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1386.111,1393.663,"Well, isn't that coupled with something else if he doesn't file it and does something else affirmatively?"
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1393.663,1399.358,"Well, I think his willful figure to file is the offense."
1969.17,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1399.358,1407.251,"Well, the filling station operators of grocers have to file this kind of a return, this kind of statement -- gas station operators?"
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1407.251,1414.852,This is applicable to a specific special class of people here like was mentioned to same-same group or the class.
1969.17,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1414.852,1418.808,What kind of people are included in the class?
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1418.808,1419.282,Sir?
1969.17,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1419.282,1422.144,What people are included in that class?
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1422.144,1428.498,"Using this language, accused gamblers under these particular statutes."
1969.17,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1428.498,1429.687,"So, he isn't forced."
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1437.51,1445.225,I believe this Court rejected that concept in overruling Kahriger and Lewis when they came with Marchetti and Grosso.
1969.17,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1445.225,1451.145,"I don't quite read those cases that way counsel, but you go ahead with your argument."
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1451.145,1470.863,"But the point I'm trying to make is this that under the rulings of Garrity and Spivak, he had the choice here either to file or to be prosecuted."
1969.17,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1485.92,1497.507,"Well, he really had the third alternative that you say it was rejected by this Court but which I don't read, he had the third alternative of going out of the illegal gambling business, didn't he?"
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1497.507,1498.008,"Yes, he --"
1969.17,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1498.008,1499.454,He could've gone in to an honest profession?
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1499.454,1507.498,He had the third alternative of course of not to gamble; I can -- understand that in filling this return.
1969.17,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1518.762,1522.096,"But those are honest activities, isn't that something --"
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1522.096,1531.901,"In some states, gambling is an honest and illegal activity also, but it declared in the state of Texas, he was not."
1969.17,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1532.802,1541.989,"My memory maybe wrong, as I recall it was a vigorous to say [Attempt to Laughter] this -- category the other case and I think he can raise that question, doesn't he?"
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1541.989,1558.458,"I think Mr. Justice Black in Kahriger; you yourself said that the bill of Rights applied, but that the gambler has a right himself also to rely on the Bill of Rights, that's almost what you said verbatim and you just said incorrect."
1969.17,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1561.199,1563.186,That was in dissent did you say?
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1563.186,1563.564,I'm sorry.
1969.17,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1563.564,1566.423,"That was in dissent – in dissent, yes."
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1566.423,1568.48,In dissent?
1969.17,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1568.48,1573.316,I didn't dissent?
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1573.316,1586.865,"And as to the coercion phase of these particular statutes, I recall Mr. Justice Brennan in your concurring opinion in Grosso and Marchetti."
1969.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1601.909,1615.31,"We haven't got Grosso and Marchetti, we are not having a reargument on Grosso and Marchetti here, are we, having a review of something else – 1001?"
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1615.31,1629.688,1001 and the point we are trying to make here is that the fact that the Grosso and Marchetti hold that the information that he gave here was required by an unconstitutional statute that --
1969.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1629.688,1635.147,"Well, let's assume it was?"
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1635.147,1644.64,Assuming that the statute was unconstitutional to file this information all that returns.
1969.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1644.64,1649.421,"And you say that therefore, you should not be convicted under 1001?"
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1649.421,1658.621,"That's our argument, yes sir, that if the Government compels him to do something by this unconstitutional requirement --"
1969.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1658.621,1663.28,Can you seriously suggest that we could hold with you and not overrule Dennis?
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1663.28,1664.285,Yes.
1969.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1664.285,1665.405,How is that?
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1665.405,1687.697,"In the sense that in Dennis, Kay and Kapp; all of those were where the individual voluntarily went there and filed those applications for the specific purposes of obtaining benefits like in one of them to get a home loan, I believe it was in another one to -- has made a false statement of about value of his house --"
1969.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1687.697,1696.123,"But it isn't a very -- you don't think it's very coerced if to say that unless you file, you got to lose your job?"
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1696.123,1704.328,"The coercion here was unless you file, you'll be prosecuted under 26-7203, criminally prosecute."
1969.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1704.328,1719.556,"Yes, but the court's already also held that if threats to a -- threats to lose your job creates coercion too, when the labor union official is either filed or he lost his job as the officer."
1969.17,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1719.556,1726.149,"Mr. Smith, how was the coerced into amended --"
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1726.149,1744.335,"This Mr. Justice Marshall, I do not know because I must submit that I did not have knowledge of these particular forms that Government exhibits here in the appendix until the appellate level because amendment and not my client didn't filed that."
1969.17,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1744.335,1746.319,Certainly not.
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1746.319,1748.087,But --
1969.17,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1748.087,1765.809,"Either if coerce is to give them filing the amendment -- I mean filling the return answering the question or stop gambling, I originally asked you that, do you still say that --"
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1765.809,1769.17,And I think was coerce in doing one of the other you had to.
1969.17,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1769.17,1772.5,"Well, let me make it a little more particular."
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1779.266,1788.975,"I was saying he was coerced into filing the return, now, the element of coercion in requiring him to file the informational return."
1969.17,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1788.975,1794.279,But where was he coerced to commit the crime of perjury?
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1794.279,1799.92,He wasn't coerced to make the false statement assuming it was a false statement which I am not --
1969.17,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1799.92,1802.799,But don't we have to here assume that it is a false statement?
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1802.799,1804.86,Well assuming it was a false statement.
1969.17,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1804.86,1805.938,Right.
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1808.587,1812.794,I would not say that he was coerced to false about it.
1969.17,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1815.786,1820.533,"Well, don't you have to in order to prevail here?"
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1820.533,1822.903,"I submit nor sir, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1969.17,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1822.903,1823.955,Why not?
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1823.955,1841.476,I submit to this that when the Government requires an act in violation of its own fundamental law requires you to file a return that violates the Government's own constitution.
1969.17,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1841.476,1849.513,"Then you're free in any crime you want to, including perjury?"
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1849.513,1850.3,May I illustrate by an extreme --
1969.17,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1850.3,1874.129,"-- answer that by saying on your assumption that you are free to commit any crime you want to if you call it a crime to take advantage of the Bill of Rights and not incriminate they say, and he either had to file the statement and admit that he was guilty or committed perjury."
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,1890.366,1905.546,And then you see that the coercion or the informational return must be aligned along with a 1001 to give true information as to his incriminating activities.
1969.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2015.228,2024.332,"Of course, the Government's entitled or at least the court hasn't said yet the Government is not entitled to collect the tax, has it?"
1969.17,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2024.332,2028.004,"No, I'm not arguing that here Mr. Justice White."
1969.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2028.004,2033.611,"Well, but he filed and said he had three employees instead of five?"
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,2033.611,2033.948,But this Court has --
1969.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2033.948,2035.822,To make --
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,2035.822,2036.548,Excuse me.
1969.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2036.548,2044.025,I mean it maybe that the Government at least claims that he had five employees instead of three.
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,2051.744,2053.638,But --
1969.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2053.638,2055.068,He had to file it all --
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,2055.068,2061.277,Let me make this point or maybe or maybe it'll help answer the issue you're raising.
1969.17,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2107.254,2109.238,We have to cross the evidence should be --
1969.17,1,32754,j_edwin_smith,,2109.238,2109.78,Sir.
