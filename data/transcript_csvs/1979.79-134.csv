1979.79-134,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.588,"We will hear arguments first this morning in 79-134, Consolidated Edison Company v. the Public Service Commission of New York."
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,13.725,16.946,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-134,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,77.081,80.451,The order didn't prevent a separate mailing with the same information?
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,80.451,81.227,It did not.
1979.79-134,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,81.227,85.556,Yes.
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,85.556,127.936,Because we felt that the order prevented us from speaking out through the medium of bill inserts we challenged the order below before the Commission and also before the State court on the ground that it violated Consolidated Edison Company's freedom of speech and freedom of press under the First and Fourteenth Amendments and also that the reference in the order to controversial matters of public policy were so vague that it brought into play this rule under the due process clause of the Amendment.
1979.79-134,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,127.936,135.174,"Mr. Block, does Con Ed have a franchise and a monopoly in its territory?"
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,135.174,140.428,It is the only utility authorized to serve that area.
1979.79-134,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,140.428,146.624,Could a private utility simply come in and start soliciting Con Ed's customers?
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,146.624,153.913,It would have to have the permission of the State Public Service Commission to enter our service area.
1979.79-134,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,164.132,174.356,Con Ed does get certain benefits from the State than an ordinary private citizen doesn't get?
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,174.356,189.011,"Con Edison is protected from competition in exchange for which it is subject to very strict regulation, not only as to its rates but as to its service and practically every aspect of its business."
1979.79-134,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,240.441,245.114,"Along with your monopoly you are not free to charge any rates you want either, are you?"
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,245.114,245.799,We are not.
1979.79-134,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,377.232,379.877,"How did they define ""controversial matters""?"
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,379.877,383.231,"They did not, they did not define it."
1979.79-134,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,395.673,403.268,But at least it didn't purport to prevent you from putting in a bill an advertisement that you had a new toaster for sale?
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,403.268,403.98,That is correct.
1979.79-134,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,411.518,418.103,You are saying that there is a terrific television program on on Saturday night that we are financing.
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,418.103,425.009,"Well, it is -- it is very difficult for us to know just exactly what they did mean by this."
1979.79-134,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,430.088,446.812,"The concern of the court seemed to be, and the concern of the Commission, promoting greater use of energy during an energy shortage and that they were advertising appliances that might be inconsistent with --"
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,446.812,454.986,"Well, Your Honor, that is the issue in the second case that is on the call for this morning, the Central Hudson case."
1979.79-134,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,578.253,585.361,"Mr. Block, do you contend you would have a First Amendment right to tell your customers to vote for a particular candidate in the Presidential election?"
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,585.361,588.992,"No, I would say that we are forbidden from doing that."
1979.79-134,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,588.992,589.689,Why?
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,596.301,618.62,"We interpret the Federal Election Campaign Act as prohibiting us from seeking to -- from spending money to influence, to communicate with our customers -- communicate with our customers on political candidate endorsements."
1979.79-134,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,618.62,618.969,I see.
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,620.553,621.672,Yes.
1979.79-134,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,662.213,667.966,"I suppose your company has thousands of shareholders, doesn't it?"
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,667.966,670.41,We have -- we have thousands of shareholders.
1979.79-134,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,672.697,687.397,"And if we are talking about controversial subjects, however that may be defined, at least sort of by definition some of your shareholders will disagree with the position that the company takes, won't they?"
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,687.397,689.073,"That -- that could be, Your Honor, that --"
1979.79-134,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,689.073,689.287,Controversial --
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,689.287,697.282,"Your Honor, that is an issue that was handled and dealt with in the Bellotti case and we are aware of that issue."
1979.79-134,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,718.387,726.5,"But if you should prevail here, then that problem suggested by our colloquy would be around the next corner, wouldn't it?"
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,726.5,733.578,"Well, we have had no -- we have had no registering of opposition by our shareholders whatsoever."
1979.79-134,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,733.578,735.534,But you have been forbidden to do this.
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,735.534,736.454,I beg your pardon?
1979.79-134,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,736.454,738.101,"You haven't been doing this, have you?"
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,738.101,747.962,"Well, before the ban was imposed we were at liberty to use bill inserts to communicate with whoever we wanted to, our customers, our shareholders."
1979.79-134,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,747.962,748.292,Yes.
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,748.292,758.371,"And we never -- during all this time before the ban, for many years we could do this, before it was foreclosed in 1977."
1979.79-134,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,776.471,787.991,"Does the Commission restraint here apply to inserts with the dividend checks, if Consolidated Edison pays dividends?"
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,787.991,789.17,"No, Your Honor, it does not."
1979.79-134,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,793.906,797.737,"They are just as much a captive audience, are they not, as --"
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,797.737,798.62,The shareholders?
1979.79-134,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,798.62,799.576,Yes.
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,799.576,801.679,"Well, we don't -- we don't regard them as being --"
1979.79-134,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,801.679,802.006,Well --
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,802.006,804.131,"-- a captive audience, because --"
1979.79-134,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,804.131,806.33,"Well, you don't regard either of them as being captive?"
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,806.33,809.033,We don't regard either of them as being captive but --
1979.79-134,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,809.033,811.634,The customers are a captive audience in the --
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,811.634,812.183,"Well, I would say --"
1979.79-134,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,812.183,814.26,-- the same sense the stockholders are?
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,814.26,815.902,I would say Your Honor that --
1979.79-134,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,815.902,821.991,Where would he get his gas if he doesn't get it from Consolidated Edison -- I mean his electricity?
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,823.484,824.984,"No, Your Honor, he does not get electricity --"
1979.79-134,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,824.984,830.815,"Well, then, couldn't he be by some stretch of the imagination a captive?"
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,830.815,831.539,"Well, I --"
1979.79-134,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,831.539,835.719,"I suppose he is free to move out, move some place else."
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,835.719,841.669,"Well, I would say that a customer applies to us for service and he is entitled to service."
1979.79-134,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,841.669,844.038,"I don't think you need the captive, do you?"
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,844.038,844.592,Pardon me?
1979.79-134,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,844.592,852.677,"You don't need to argue the captive point, do you? Because it is the captive that pays for the mailing then, too, doesn't he?"
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,852.677,854.688,"Well, the customer pays for the mail, that is right."
1979.79-134,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,854.688,856.343,That is right.
1979.79-134,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,856.343,865.733,A stockholder can always sell his stock but unless if somebody wants to freeze to death -- he can't do it without electricity.
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,865.733,880.905,"Now, I would say, Your Honor, that if the Commission had issued an order that was tailored to meet the problem of unwilling customers getting these communications, that would be one thing."
1979.79-134,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,913.445,919.363,"Mr. Block, when you say a governmental interest, it is the Commission that is the government, not Con Ed."
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,919.363,926.761,"That is correct, the Commission is the government -- is the State agency, I think, under authority of State law."
1979.79-134,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,947.282,956.512,"Well, when you say that you made a showing of a compelling governmental interest, you mean a fortiori the Commission didn't --"
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,956.512,982.586,"I mean -- I meant to say, Your Honor, that it was the Commission's burden, when it imposes a restriction on speech such as this one, it is their burden to justify that restriction by making a showing that will withstand scrutiny before a court, including this Court, withstand exacting scrutiny in the language of this Court, decision."
1979.79-134,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,993.801,998.795,"Mr. Block, I understood you to say that the customer pays for these mailings."
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,998.795,999.542,The question here --
1979.79-134,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,999.542,1000.66,What do you mean by that?
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,1000.66,1006.963,"I mean by that, Your Honor, that the Commission who fixes the rates that we are charged --"
1979.79-134,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1006.963,1007.347,Yes.
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,1007.347,1015.729,-- when it fixes the rates it allows us to recover through our rates the costs of mailing out these bills.
1979.79-134,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1015.729,1021.165,The cost of mailing the bills undoubtedly is an expense.
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,1024.863,1026.787,"It is not, Your Honor."
1979.79-134,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1041.796,1044.329,Do volunteers put them in there?
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,1044.329,1047.689,"No, any labor costs --"
1979.79-134,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1047.689,1048.938,Who pays the labor costs?
1979.79-134,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1048.938,1050.144,Paid by the stockholders.
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,1050.144,1051.996,-- will be paid by the stockholders.
1979.79-134,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1071.778,1089.115,"Let us suppose that -- and this is a straight supposition -- let us just suppose that you could also collect the cost from somebody, like the customer, for a separate mailing of the same material."
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,1091.497,1092.715,"Well, I --"
1979.79-134,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1092.715,1097.354,Or is there some special reason you want to include the materials in the bill?
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,1097.354,1115.139,"Well, the Commission -- I will answer it this way, Your Honor: The Commission has said itself in issuing this prohibition that the bill insert is a unique method which enables utilities to communicate with the stockholders."
1979.79-134,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1115.139,1121.689,"Well, in a sense it enables them without further expense to communicate with the stockholders."
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,1121.689,1127.133,It is true that they -- they do open the billing envelope to get the bill.
1979.79-134,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1131.227,1132.644,So what is the answer to my question?
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,1136.589,1152.128,"It is not only the cost we save by using bill inserts, it is a proven fact that the bill inserts do get into the hands of the customers and those who want to read them will read them; and those who don't want to bother with them can throw them away."
1979.79-134,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1169.467,1185.168,"I take it if you put in a bill a review of the Commission's last decision in your case and said, ""This is a terrible decision and the Commissioners really don't know what they are doing, I suppose you would be breaking this rule?"
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,1185.168,1190.476,"Well, I think we would be running into the problem of --"
1979.79-134,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1190.476,1190.481,What is a controversial --
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,1190.481,1193.455,-- a controversial matter and we would be in the position --\
1979.79-134,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1193.455,1197.398,I can think of some people who would controvert you.
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,1197.398,1197.811,"Well, we're --"
1979.79-134,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1197.811,1200.881,If you put something in an envelope like that.
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,1200.881,1201.068,There are --
1979.79-134,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1201.068,1203.32,At least the Commission wouldn't agree with you.
1979.79-134,0,29238,joseph_d_block,,1203.32,1217.979,"I think this rule -- this order puts us in a position where we are not free to criticize the Commission that governs us, which is not an acceptable state of affairs under the First Amendment."
1979.79-134,1,40908,schiff,,1662.372,1668.684,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-134,2,29238,joseph_d_block,,3706.973,3709.067,"Nothing further, Your Honor."
1979.79-134,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3709.067,3714.074,"Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted."
