1989.88-1374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.987,"We'll hear argument now in Number 88-1374, Jimmy Swaggart Ministries v. the Board of Equalization of California."
1989.88-1374,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,11.71,14.712,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,109.047,112.91,"There you were dealing with a flat license tax, were you not, Mr. McConnell?"
1989.88-1374,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,112.91,126.761,"That is right, Mr. Chief Justice, but the point of the decisions is that that flat license tax in the context of individual itinerant evangelists amounted to a very serious burden on their ability to communicate the message."
1989.88-1374,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,140.773,152.8,"Well, Mr. McConnell, what is the evidence that the imposition of the ordinary sales tax, I guess it is around 6 percent, would burden the Petitioner?"
1989.88-1374,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,157.024,161.748,"--Justice O'Connor, the tax can be passed on to the purchaser."
1989.88-1374,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,161.748,169.212,"That is the norm in... when sales tax is opposed... imposed, is it not?"
1989.88-1374,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,169.212,171.704,"It is the norm, but, Justice O'Connor, don't get me wrong."
1989.88-1374,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,188.149,194.643,Is there any indication that sales are reduced by virtue of the imposition of the tax?
1989.88-1374,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,194.643,205.219,"--Justice O'Connor, the... it's almost a golden, an iron rule of economics that when the price of something is increased the number of sales are going to go down."
1989.88-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,242.685,248.448,"Mr. McConnell, I assume that there is no more... maybe I shouldn't assume it."
1989.88-1374,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,252.301,253.744,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,253.744,271.358,"Well, we held... we held last term, if I recall correctly, that a state not only could impose a tax upon the sale of bibles, but indeed had to impose a tax upon the sale of bibles if it imposed a tax upon the sale of other books."
1989.88-1374,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,287.131,289.412,"Two reasons, Justice Scalia."
1989.88-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,299.31,300.351,"No, but I am buying it for that purpose."
1989.88-1374,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,300.351,301.51,That may--
1989.88-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,301.51,307.016,And you acknowledged that I have as much right to receive a religious message as someone else has to convey it.
1989.88-1374,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,311.069,334.576,"--The constitutional protection here has to do with the longstanding relationship between religious institutions and the government, under which religious institutions are both immune and exempt from various forms of regulation and taxation, and also ineligible for subsidies and other forms of support."
1989.88-1374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,349.068,353.87,"Well, do you say, Mr. McConnell, that the government must exempt churches from real property taxation?"
1989.88-1374,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,353.87,359.454,I think it would be a mistake for this Court to try to paint with too broad a brush.
1989.88-1374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,361.808,372.954,"Well, but I think it is you who are painting with a broad brush, when you say that the government must simply stay away from all religions, and I got the implication, perhaps not tax any aspect of them."
1989.88-1374,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,372.954,383.803,"What I mean by that, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the government must leave the churches alone in their dissemination of religious doctrine and in their worship activities."
1989.88-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,445.266,447.408,Why can't you say the same thing about the receipt of money?
1989.88-1374,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,463.94,475.8,"First of all, Justice Scalia, it is not clear that there is a quid pro quo in the sense that... and that the record shows that it is a policy of Appellant to distribute these materials, whether they receive the price or not."
1989.88-1374,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,531.902,541.456,"Mr. McConnell, the Court certainly sustained in Lee a rather substantial burden on the exercise of religion."
1989.88-1374,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,547.96,551.022,"Greater, but most importantly, very different."
1989.88-1374,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,583.369,587.839,"Well, it would seem to me that would be, that would be an even stronger claim than yours, would it not?"
1989.88-1374,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,587.839,596.995,"--Well, I don't think so, Justice O'Connor, because the separation of church and state has to do with the institutional relationship between religious organizations and government."
1989.88-1374,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,628.419,631.3,Do you think that a general sales tax can be imposed on the sale of newspapers?
1989.88-1374,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,631.3,639.676,I think that a general sales tax can be imposed upon profit making corporations in the sale of newspapers.
1989.88-1374,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,639.676,643.76,Does the ministry make a profit on any of the items it sells?
1989.88-1374,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,643.76,651.676,"The ministries is a nonprofit organization, and so in the technical tax sense there is no profit at all."
1989.88-1374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,704.987,713.843,"Mr. McConnell, did I understand you to say a moment ago, or perhaps to suggest, that the government could not tax a nonprofit corporation which published a newspaper?"
1989.88-1374,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,713.843,719.127,The Court... I was in a sense summarizing the Court's holdings.
1989.88-1374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,769.623,770.104,What is difficult about it?
1989.88-1374,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,770.104,779.861,"--Well, it is difficult because the Sierra Club is not a religious organization and there is no requirement of separation between the government and what the Sierra Club is doing."
1989.88-1374,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,794.801,797.883,But you haven't yet pointed out what the... you're saying where the difficulties aren't.
1989.88-1374,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,806.969,816.696,"--I am suggesting that it probably could, and that the difference is that... is that a religious organization is any... stands in a different footing."
1989.88-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,935.256,952.48,"That is not really true, Mr. McConnell, and maybe there are those of us who think some of the cases suggest going too far in both directions, both in prohibiting non-discriminatory assistance and in... and in prohibiting non-discriminatory taxation."
1989.88-1374,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,978.135,979.527,That is right.
1989.88-1374,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,980.688,983.129,So why can't it apply a non-discriminatory tax similarly?
1989.88-1374,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,983.129,1006.627,"--This Court has carefully distinguished between various forms of municipal services that indirect... that provide indirect benefits to religious organizations, along with all others, and direct subsidies of cash, even when those direct subsidies of cash are being distributed on a... on a general and completely neutral basis."
1989.88-1374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1081.644,1087.858,"But isn't the difference between the two that one is prohibited by the Establishment Clause, and you are making a free exercise claim, aren't you?"
1989.88-1374,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1087.858,1089.168,"Well, Justice Stevens--"
1989.88-1374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1089.168,1091.559,"I mean, the subsidy is an establishment problem."
1989.88-1374,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1091.559,1099.054,"--That is right, but subsidy and penalty are two sides of the same coin, just as free exercise and establishment are two sides of the same coin."
1989.88-1374,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1132.066,1146.525,"But I think you acknowledged that if you had sales, say you sell sacramental wine or vestments or something like that to a church organization for use in purely religious ceremonies, I don't think you deny that a tax could be imposed on those, do you?"
1989.88-1374,0,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,1146.525,1152.45,--I do not deny that a secular wine producer who produces the sacramental wine could be taxed--
1989.88-1374,1,40077,richard_e_nielsen,,1538.098,1559.924,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1374,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1604.602,1606.505,"Mr. Nielsen, you referred us to a page of the record."
1989.88-1374,1,40077,richard_e_nielsen,,1609.828,1628.421,"--Starting with the question about the middle of the page, where it says if they ask for the item and you know the price of the item, could you break that out."
1989.88-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1673.615,1674.316,"Now, wait, wait, wait."
1989.88-1374,1,40077,richard_e_nielsen,,1699.916,1702.68,"--That is correct, it's a matter of the intent of the parties, Your Honor."
1989.88-1374,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1711.648,1723.288,"I thought Mr. McConnell's point was that the cost of the tapes to them exceeded the sale price, not that it was a donation, but just that they didn't charge as much for the thing as it cost them."
1989.88-1374,1,40077,richard_e_nielsen,,1723.288,1724.18,"That was another point, Your Honor."
1989.88-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1785.102,1787.092,What does the first one prove?
1989.88-1374,1,40077,richard_e_nielsen,,1796.318,1808.657,"--Well, I'm following in on page 204, Your Honor, on the bottom of number 12, it says with respect to other items, that prices... the last phrase is prices were not reduced below cost."
1989.88-1374,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1835.78,1849.006,"Mr. Nielsen, does the state tax also, for example, the sale of votive candles in the Catholic churches in California?"
1989.88-1374,1,40077,richard_e_nielsen,,1849.006,1855.431,"That is... that is an interesting question, because I believe it came up in another case recently."
1989.88-1374,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1868.974,1872.206,"Well, is California taxing these things or not?"
1989.88-1374,1,40077,richard_e_nielsen,,1872.206,1875.258,--I have no reason to believe that they are not.
1989.88-1374,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1875.258,1886.388,Do you think California can levy a generally applicable property tax on property owned by religious institutions?
1989.88-1374,1,40077,richard_e_nielsen,,1886.388,1890.708,I think so.
1989.88-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1919.679,1923.161,What about sales of literature in the vestibules of churches.
1989.88-1374,1,40077,richard_e_nielsen,,1935.452,1938.083,I personally do not.
1989.88-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1940.006,1941.468,Do you know that the candles are?
1989.88-1374,1,40077,richard_e_nielsen,,1941.468,1948.993,"--The candle situation, Your Honor, I believe, in order to follow up on the other question, is generally in that situation."
1989.88-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1954.899,1955.948,And you leave the candle there.
1989.88-1374,1,40077,richard_e_nielsen,,1955.948,1958.861,There is no transfer of property.
1989.88-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1958.861,1960.964,"You are buying the fire, I suppose, aren't you?"
1989.88-1374,1,40077,richard_e_nielsen,,1962.344,1963.215,I think that--
1989.88-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1963.215,1964.187,"You're buying something, I suppose."
1989.88-1374,1,40077,richard_e_nielsen,,1968.751,1970.602,--That is not tangible personal property.
1989.88-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1970.602,1972.906,--I see.
1989.88-1374,1,40077,richard_e_nielsen,,1977.4,1977.77,No.
1989.88-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1977.77,1978.611,Could not?
1989.88-1374,1,40077,richard_e_nielsen,,1978.611,1979.16,No.
1989.88-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1979.16,1979.711,Why not?
1989.88-1374,1,40077,richard_e_nielsen,,1979.711,1983.975,Because you are not... you are not getting possession or buying property.
1989.88-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1985.477,1986.306,"Well, it has another kind... it has a rental tax."
1989.88-1374,1,40077,richard_e_nielsen,,1987.527,1989.459,"Yes, I believe an occupancy tax--"
1989.88-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1989.459,1989.589,--So it could?
1989.88-1374,1,40077,richard_e_nielsen,,1989.589,1994.502,"--a general occupancy tax, that would be broad enough to encompass any type of activity, yes."
1989.88-1374,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1997.095,2001.247,"So they just don't, haven't thought of that tax yet, but if they thought of it, they could do that."
1989.88-1374,1,40077,richard_e_nielsen,,2001.618,2015.837,"--The legislature in states have many mean of raising taxes, and I believe that is why it is very critical in this case that you have to look that this is a general, non-discriminatory revenue-raising tax."
1989.88-1374,2,36378,michael_w_mcconnell,,3100.411,3101.533,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
