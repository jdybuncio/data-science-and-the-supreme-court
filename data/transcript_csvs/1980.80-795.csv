1980.80-795,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.704,We'll hear arguments next in Heffron v. International Society for Krishna Consciousness.
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,47.647,48.747,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1980.80-795,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,131.818,135.955,"Mr. Harbison, does the record show what happened in succeeding years?"
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,135.955,139.657,Since that restraining order?
1980.80-795,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,139.657,142.459,You spoke of the 1977 fair.
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,144.542,149.696,"Your Honor, the restraining order applied to the '77 fair."
1980.80-795,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,181.334,195.16,"Well, let me ask specifically, did the Krishna group have a booth in '78, '79, or '80, and did they solicit at all on the grounds during those years?"
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,195.16,207.651,"Your Honor, they did not have a booth and the record doesn't indicate whether or not they solicited during the '78 or '79 or '80 fairs, in part because the record, the trial court record was closed at that time."
1980.80-795,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,207.651,217.774,"Mr. Harbison, following up on Justice Blackmun's question, at pages 35 and 36 of your brief, at the bottom of the page you make the statement,"
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,254.13,256.832,I'll attempt to see if I can add some definition to that.
1980.80-795,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,295.44,298.642,"That is, other fairgoers could?"
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,298.642,299.376,"Anyone, Your Honor."
1980.80-795,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,300.026,314.769,Or anybody inside the premises could try to convince anybody else of the wisdom of his religious or other ideological beliefs and direct such a person to the Krishna booth?
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,314.769,315.438,"--Exactly right, Your Honor."
1980.80-795,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,334.249,336.351,So long as they don't try to collect money or sell something?
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,336.351,341.838,So long as they don't try to collect money or sell things or distribute things in that connection.
1980.80-795,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,341.838,346.123,"Well, but, it does prevent the distribution of any piece of paper?"
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,366.37,370.005,That he may not distribute literature or any other kinds of materials.
1980.80-795,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,370.005,370.872,"Yes, all right."
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,370.872,393.386,"And part of the reason as indicated in this case, the record shows that with respect to these respondents... and I think they indicate this in paragraph 11 of the stipulation... that they don't merely want to just distribute the flowers and the books and the magazines and the buttons or whatever it may be, but indeed, they want to collect money for them."
1980.80-795,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,418.186,422.055,How many acres of that are actually devoted to booths?
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,422.055,432.261,"Your Honor, only about 40 to 45 of those acres, or about one third of that area, comprises that part of the fairgrounds where most of the booth operations and the fairgoing traffic occurs."
1980.80-795,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,436.398,437.348,What else is there?
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,441.117,441.884,"There's a racetrack, Your Honor."
1980.80-795,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,481.227,485.997,"Has it always been that size, or was it expanded after the automobile age came along?"
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,485.997,500.255,"Your Honor, I personally don't know that and I don't the record indicates that but my understanding is that the Minnesota State Fair has for many years been among the top two or three state fairs in the country in terms of size and number of fairgoers."
1980.80-795,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,545.119,555.825,"When you speak of the booths, are you including under that term the halls and areas where they have farm machinery and other machinery?"
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,555.825,556.508,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-795,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,574.802,598.585,"Is the statement in your joint appendix at A-49... A-52 listing all the organizations, the Seventh Day Adventists, the Lutheran Council, Abortion Rights Council, the American Association for Retired Persons, et cetera, are those all people who have rented booths?"
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,598.585,604.405,"Your Honor, these are all organizations that have rented booths for a number of years from the state fair."
1980.80-795,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,700.7,713.726,"Suppose the American Legion Drum and Bugle Corps wanted to have a parade through the streets and through the area to stimulate patriotic reactions, could they do that under these regulations?"
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,713.726,718.095,"Your Honor, they would not be able to do that, I think."
1980.80-795,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,944.56,947.828,"You mean they've abandoned the Sankirtan argument, do you think?"
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,947.828,951.047,It may be overstating it to say they have totally abandoned it.
1980.80-795,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,969.861,972.896,"Well, at page 47 of their brief they say,"
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,984.703,986.287,"Exactly, Your Honor, and that's my point."
1980.80-795,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,986.287,989.255,Or a candidate for a political office?
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,989.255,989.739,Pardon me?
1980.80-795,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,989.739,992.374,"Or a candidate for a political office, I suppose."
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,992.374,999.713,"I would think so, Your Honor, I don't see how the free exercise rights could be elevated over free speech or free association rights."
1980.80-795,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,999.713,1001.763,Do the candidates and the parties have booths?
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,1001.763,1003.332,"Yes, Your Honor, they do."
1980.80-795,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1010.436,1021.293,"Incidentally, your justifications have been, as I recall it, safety and the prevention of fraudulent practices."
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,1036.817,1040.853,"Your Honor, in this case it's important."
1980.80-795,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1042.155,1047.473,--I gather a political candidate can't distribute a little--
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,1047.473,1048.059,Stickers or--
1980.80-795,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1048.059,1048.525,--Sticker; whatever.
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,1048.525,1049.475,"--Yes, Your Honor, that's right."
1980.80-795,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1073.607,1078.344,"Well, I don't quite... how does that make it fraudulent?"
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,1078.344,1089.969,"Because of the fact that there is money involved, Your Honor, and the record already indicates that they have in getting this money have represented themselves to be agents of organizations for which they are not."
1980.80-795,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1092.338,1094.271,Couldn't they do that in a booth?
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,1094.271,1099.992,"--Your Honor, they could do that in a booth and we don't mean to suggest that deceptive sales don't take place at booths, they surely do."
1980.80-795,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1117.719,1132.896,"Well, I gather, Mr. Harbison, your answer to me is that prevention of deceptive practices in connection with the distribution of circulars and that sort of thing, is only when joined with effort to sell."
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,1142.102,1156.978,"Your Honor, I think that it's possible that in a pure distribution setting without any monetary exchange that it's still possible to have some misrepresentation as to what it is, whether it be a record, as it was in the New York case, or--"
1980.80-795,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1156.978,1158.963,"Well, again, I go to the political candidate."
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,1164.465,1171.687,"--I think, Your Honor, it's still possible to have that but beyond that there are other public purposes that this booth rule serves."
1980.80-795,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1188.648,1190.298,How about littering?
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,1191.165,1195.052,"Your Honor, littering would be a problem under that, but we don't advance that as a justification for the rule."
1980.80-795,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1195.052,1204.741,"Well, P. T. Barnum would roll over in his grave if deception were absolutely prohibited at state fairs."
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,1207.626,1210.645,"We wouldn't have egresses I suppose, Your Honor."
1980.80-795,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1265.896,1269.181,"Mr. Harbison, I understand what you're saying when the money changes hand."
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,1287.176,1305.271,"With respect to the overbreadth attack even, it seems to me, under this Court's decisions such as in Broadrick, even in First Amendment cases, that should not automatically be applied and in fact, I think, the phrase, ""substantial""--"
1980.80-795,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1305.271,1310.108,"Well let's assume for the moment... I mean, one argument you make is there should be no overbreadth analysis."
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,1325.868,1328.67,"--Well, Your Honor, that is just one component of it."
1980.80-795,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1329.387,1334.922,I want to know what your justification for that component is.
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,1334.922,1381.37,"--Our argument is that it... especially in contrast with the way the fairgrounds and the fair is set up now, if you have someone walking around the fairgrounds handing out materials... and I think that it would be very difficult to start drawing lines between the kinds of things that would be distributed, but it seems to me that if you had that sort of activity going on with not just the Krishnas but 10 or 20 or 30 representatives from perhaps 30 to 60 or 70 groups, that inevitably is going to draw more attention and going to cause or create more or less moving pockets or moving congested crowds, because of the fact that someone is doing something unique on the fairgrounds, especially giving something away free, I think that's going to--"
1980.80-795,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1381.37,1385.89,"It's a card that says, vote for me for county assessor, or something, but it's a--"
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,1385.89,1403.185,"--Your Honor, but my point would be, with respect to that, that those fairgoers may not know that right away until they actually get up there and receive it, but if all of a sudden the crowd becomes aware of the fact that dozens of people are walking around passing out materials and they're going to inevitably be attracted by that."
1980.80-795,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1405.951,1424.615,"--Well, you... I take it that if the county officer who is running for office puts a sign on his back, vote for me, with his picture on, or on his hat, on his straw hat, you'd let him do that, and you'd let him stop people and try them into voting for him."
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,1435.354,1446.128,"--Your Honor, that sort of thing, to my knowledge of the record, hasn't happened, and my point would be that the booth rule doesn't have to be perfect."
1980.80-795,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1451.682,1458.62,"So, in short, your answer to my brother Stevens, I gather, is you justify it on the basis of crowd control or traffic control."
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,1459.153,1460.538,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-795,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1474.114,1481.901,"Incidentally, Mr. Harbison, when did the Krishnas first request booth space at this fair?"
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,1481.901,1489.124,"Your Honor, I don't recall if the record indicates that, but to my knowledge it was sometime in May or June of 1977."
1980.80-795,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1489.124,1492.159,And was this after this booth rule had first been promulgated?
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,1492.159,1497.98,"Your Honor, this booth rule has been in existence since 1966, at least, and that's before the Krishnas were even in this country."
1980.80-795,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1497.98,1501.615,So that at least its promulgation had nothing to do with the arrival of the Krishnas?
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,1501.615,1502.565,Absolutely nothing.
1980.80-795,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1578.097,1583.084,Does the record show whether barkers are permitted outside of the booths or inside the booths?
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,1583.084,1584.284,"It doesn't show, Your Honor."
1980.80-795,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1592.707,1594.808,Who owns the fairgrounds?
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,1594.808,1596.358,"The State of Minnesota does, Your Honor."
1980.80-795,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1596.358,1607.116,"Is this a... and the booth rule involves the charge of rentals for the booths, doesn't it?"
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,1607.116,1608.299,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.80-795,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1608.299,1612.703,Is this a revenue raising measure of any consequence?
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,1612.703,1613.486,"This is, Your Honor."
1980.80-795,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1623.326,1623.942,Self-supporting?
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,1623.942,1625.844,"--sustaining, self supporting enterprise."
1980.80-795,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1625.844,1628.713,And how much is raised by these booth rentals?
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,1628.713,1630.998,"Your Honor, I don't know and the record doesn't indicate that."
1980.80-795,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1737.732,1743.736,"If you wish to save any rebuttal time, this is the time to do it."
1980.80-795,0,33860,kent_g_harbison,,1743.736,1746.671,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1980.80-795,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1746.671,1748.44,Mr. Tribe.
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1748.44,1751.474,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-795,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1815.082,1817.434,Do we have to decide that issue here?
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1817.434,1824.338,"I think we needn't urge this Court to reach that issue, but it does make clear how broad the rule is."
1980.80-795,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1824.338,1831.176,"When someone puts one of these boards on back and front like advertising for a restaurant, then we'll decide that case."
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1831.176,1838.263,"Well, the overbreadth position that we take here, Mr. Chief Justice, we think is well founded in the Schaumberg case itself."
1980.80-795,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1854.609,1873.87,"But aren't there going to be a large number of people, as suggested in Justice Todd's dissent, at A-73 of the Joint Appendix, who are going to be able to make the same claim as your clients, that they should be able to freely roam and proselytize?"
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1885.061,1885.928,"No, it's not arbitrary."
1980.80-795,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1919.817,1930.207,"But when you have it in the record, all that list of people who have previously paid for booths, presumably all of them would do the same thing your clients have done."
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1930.207,1933.325,"I'm afraid, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I can't share that presumption."
1980.80-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1950.035,1953.321,I thought that Minnesota was a cool state.
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1953.321,1958.89,"Well, I guess that the decision will not turn on the temperature of Minnesota in the summer."
1980.80-795,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1958.89,1964.628,"Mr. Tribe, did I understand you just to suggest that you've abandoned the uniqueness, Sankirtan argument?"
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1964.628,1976.102,"No, we certainly haven't abandoned the argument that the claim is stronger here, nor did we argue below, which is suggested by some notion of abandonment, that a special exemption was warranted."
1980.80-795,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1978.704,1986.092,"Your position now is not that you're entitled to special consideration based on the Sankirtan argument, is that right?"
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1986.092,1987.044,--That's correct.
1980.80-795,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1995.582,2004.505,"While I have you interrupted, do you agree with your colleague that this booth rule has nothing to do with the arrival, chronologically, with the?"
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2004.505,2012.359,"The language of the rule, we agree, pre dates their arrival, but it's interesting to note that the rule on its face says nothing about solicitation."
1980.80-795,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2066.412,2083.571,"Mr. Tribe, I read recently, and I wouldn't want to vouch for what I read in the newspaper, but it suggested that there were 153 religious organizations in the State of California alone that would qualify under this category."
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2098.098,2100.083,"I am certain you could, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.80-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2141.66,2143.162,That to me isn't a specter.
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2151.682,2152.718,So it isn't all that bad.
1980.80-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2152.718,2154.084,What?
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2154.084,2156.92,"So it isn't all that bad if all this should materialize, I suppose."
1980.80-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2156.92,2174.547,"Well, if you have all of these roving groups around the pedestrian malls, they will come to take over the state fair and the kind of agricultural aspect of the thing will totally disappear."
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2174.547,2188.124,But I'm curious why that hasn't happened in state fair after state fair where the lower courts have ruled at the behest of the Krishna Consciousness group that it was unconstitutional to ban solicitation and distribution.
1980.80-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2188.124,2190.291,What about the New York district court ruling?
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2190.291,2224.464,"Well, it is true that the New York district court ruling now pending in this Court seeking certiorari before judgment has gone the other way, but in the majority of cases, in the 4th Circuit, in the 7th Circuit, in the Northern District of Texas, in a number of cases over the past four or five years, I would say the trend has been to say that because this is obviously a public forum, a literal marketplace of ideas, and because the concerns about congestion and fraud can be more narrowly met, that there has to be a relaxation of the rule when it comes to a religious group."
1980.80-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2224.464,2234.672,"Well, is a fairground a ""marketplace of ideas"" as much as a marketplace for wares?"
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2234.672,2242.526,"Well, historically, the fairs of Europe and Leipzig and in other places surely were primarily religious activities."
1980.80-795,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2298.645,2319.542,"Well, Mr. Tribe, would you think the fair could say, well, there's 150,000 a day, perhaps we could put up with 500 wandering people who are soliciting and we'll put the names in a hat and draw by lot as to who gets in that day?"
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2319.542,2328.58,"I think that putting some reasonable ceiling numerically, as the respondents in this case have said they would be willing to live with, is perfectly constitutional."
1980.80-795,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2338.686,2343.323,"Well, would people be permitted to walk around this courtroom of any courtroom?"
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2343.323,2351.544,"It would be so incompatible with the function and decorum of this courtroom, for the people here to walk around, in contrast with the state fair, that I'm sure the answer's no."
1980.80-795,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2351.544,2355.798,"How about out in the halls, where we have exhibits, and the museum downstairs?"
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2355.798,2369.406,"I think the quiet and tranquillity and the educational function of these halls is incompatible with that kind of wandering, although I must admit I haven't carefully enough thought about it to want to be held to that."
1980.80-795,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2371.89,2384.984,"Is not a state fair fundamentally an educational function and in a state like Minnesota, agriculture and agricultural machinery, and a great many other things?"
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2384.984,2391.654,"But educational, not in the sense that a library is, where people wander and carefully, quietly, calmly select."
1980.80-795,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2413.651,2430.994,"Well, the lower Great Hall here, to pursue that, is a museum of sorts and people look at the pictures of the Justices of times gone by and read their biographies attached, and look at a great many things relating to the Court's history."
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2446.288,2479.193,"Well, I suppose, Mr. Chief Justice, that because people come to this Court for a much more specific purpose and with a particular event or set of events in mind, it would not be nearly so difficult to justify the proposition that the purposes of the Court, like the purposes of a library or of the White House or of some other special building, are incompatible with quite the same kind of robust, wide open discussion and distribution and solicitation that clearly is compatible with the function of a fair."
1980.80-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2524.572,2530.459,"Well, if we felt bound by the Supreme Court of Minnesota's decision, presumably we would not have granted certiorari."
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2530.459,2532.178,"Well, that's... certainly, Mr. Justice."
1980.80-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2587.815,2591.2,"Well, would this be different if it came from the 8th Circuit rather than the Supreme Court of Minnesota?"
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2591.2,2595.519,I would not have one additional argument that I think is one that strengthens the case.
1980.80-795,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2614.565,2621.169,"Mr. Tribe, I think a minute ago you conceded that a reasonable limitation on numbers would be constitutional?"
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2621.169,2621.852,--Yes.
1980.80-795,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2621.852,2625.521,Would you say the same thing about a reasonable limitation on area?
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2625.521,2645.517,"Well, as long as the limitation on area did not, was not designed to shunt the devotees into places where in effect they could neither be seen nor heard, as long as in effect they were prevented simply from blocking access, then we do think that area limitations, as have been upheld before, would be okay."
1980.80-795,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2645.517,2650.655,"Well, what about... what if they were excluded from other booths?"
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2650.655,2651.888,Excluded from other booths?
1980.80-795,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2655.49,2656.575,"Well, I mean, just keep them out."
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2662.279,2664.998,--I think as long as all people are granted some--
1980.80-795,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2664.998,2668.283,Or in somebody else's... or in the queues lined up at somebody else's booth?
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2668.283,2670.217,"--I think that probably would be all right, Mr. Justice White."
1980.80-795,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2670.217,2675.304,"Well, certainly, they can be heard and seen in a booth that they have."
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2675.304,2708.642,"They can be heard and seen, but that's an important, I think, additional point, and that is, we suggested that the primary operation of the booth rule, since it's so obviously overbroad and imprecise with respect to the goals of fraud, safety, congestion, and the like, is to limit distribution and receipt of religious literature and solicitation and the making of religious contributions, to those people who already know about, feel some sympathy toward, and are willing to be publicly associated with the very kinds of groups that are going to need most to engage in a kind of outreach program."
1980.80-795,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2740.446,2749.252,"Isn't there another response to that argument, and that is that they do have the opportunity to try to persuade orally the people to go over to the booth?"
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2749.252,2750.069,To some extent.
1980.80-795,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2763.944,2776.152,"I thought it was clear... maybe I missed it, but I thought it was clear that it would be perfectly permissible to accost somebody in the common grounds of the fair and say, we would like to sell you some literature which you must purchase over at our booth."
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2777.838,2780.206,"Well, because... I don't think it is clear, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1980.80-795,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2823.767,2826.535,"Well, the purpose is you confine the exchange of money to booths."
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2826.535,2827.987,--It's not just the exchange of money.
1980.80-795,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2857.64,2859.808,"Well, no, they prohibit the handing out literature--"
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2859.808,2861.075,And even solicitation.
1980.80-795,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2861.075,2864.293,--But no physical transfer of any chattel one way or the other except at the booth.
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2864.293,2865.21,"And also, but also solicitation."
1980.80-795,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2872.731,2874.366,Do you agree that your adversary doesn't read the rule that way?
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2874.366,2877.951,I think he probably does but we will see.
1980.80-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2882.071,2885.706,"On page 35 and 36 of his brief he says,"
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2897.698,2898.848,"--That's correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1980.80-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2920.697,2923.998,"Even if they said, give it at the booth?"
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2923.998,2934.037,--I think there's nothing in the record to suggest that the place at which it is ultimately given determines whether the solicitation of contributions is protected or unprotected.
1980.80-795,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2934.037,2938.625,"Well, what's in the record to show that it is forbidden?"
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2938.625,2941.893,"Well, that's the whole point of the disagreement between the majority and the dissent."
1980.80-795,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2941.893,2945.095,"Well, that's not an answer to my question."
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2945.095,2945.762,"Well, I suppose the--"
1980.80-795,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2945.762,2947.947,Just tell me what's in the record.
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2947.947,2952.935,--The stipulated facts say that soliciting in the fairgrounds is forbidden as well as--
1980.80-795,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2952.935,2955.201,But not soliciting for membership?
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2955.201,2957.353,"--Soliciting for contributions, not membership."
1980.80-795,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2957.353,2959.172,So you can solicit for support?
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2959.172,2960.372,Apparently.
1980.80-795,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2964.392,2970.379,"So there's nothing in the argument, there's nothing in the record any more than that."
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2974.464,2975.314,It says it's forbidden.
1980.80-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3051.764,3070.662,"Do you think a state is forbidden from enacting an ordinance that prohibits a devotee of a religion from suddenly grabbing a pedestrian off the mall and saying, listen, I want to talk to you about my religion for three or four minutes."
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3072.478,3072.995,Yeah.
1980.80-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3092.758,3097.412,But there are also affidavits of some misrepresentation.
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3097.412,3107.918,"Well, there are four sworn affidavits which have not been subjected to the process of cross examination or trial."
1980.80-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3107.918,3111.303,Were you denied... did you request and were denied that opportunity?
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3111.303,3130.383,"No, we think that the issue is one of the facial validity of this rule, and we think it would be far more pernicious to sacrifice the principle that the validity of the rule cannot be sustained by a few episodes, even if true, of misconduct, than to get involved in a sideshow of disputing those particular episodes."
1980.80-795,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3162.02,3169.175,"So is it your position that the rule, the booth rule, is unconstitutional on its face?"
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3169.175,3175.429,"On its face with respect to a certain category of protected behavior, that is, we don't challenge it--"
1980.80-795,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3175.429,3183.066,"Well, isn't every prospective booth renter's behavior protected by the First Amendment?"
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3184.885,3186.635,"--I suppose there would be some... well, we're all protected by the First Amendment."
1980.80-795,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3186.635,3187.101,Yes.
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3187.101,3214.404,"But the distinction this Court drew in Village of Schaumberg v. Citizens for a Better Environment between the category of activities as applied to which the 75 percent rule in that case was unconstitutional, and other kinds of activities, raising money for more conventional charities unconnected with advocacy as to which it might not be unconstitutional, is exactly the same kind of distinction as the one we seek to draw here."
1980.80-795,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3235.351,3244.873,"So this booth rule might, you think, be constitutionally valid as it applied to purely commercial booth renters?"
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3244.873,3245.856,We think it would be.
1980.80-795,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3247.475,3251.36,"Well, what did the... didn't the Minnesota court strike it down on its face?"
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3251.36,3258.566,"Well, the Minnesota court's opinion said that it could not constitutionally be applied to these respondents."
1980.80-795,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3258.566,3259.699,And therefore what?
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3259.699,3262.818,"And therefore, that it was not valid--"
1980.80-795,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3262.818,3277.044,"Isn't your overbreadth argument, though, isn't the bottom line that it's unconstitutional on its face and that if they want to apply it to a permissible category of activity, they should redraw it?"
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3277.044,3279.996,--Redraw it or more narrowly construe it.
1980.80-795,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3281.229,3281.964,We can't do that.
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3282.631,3283.664,--That's right.
1980.80-795,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3286.933,3287.433,"--Oh, yes."
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3287.433,3290.987,--It was not clear that one had to go back to a legislative drawing board.
1980.80-795,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3293.22,3295.656,So... but you don't know what the Minnesota court did?
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3295.656,3297.208,We don't know what they would do.
1980.80-795,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3307.114,3310.549,Did they say whether the ordinance was severable in the sense?
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3310.549,3311.901,They didn't address severability.
1980.80-795,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3311.901,3317.487,All they did was enjoin its enforcement against these litigants.
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3317.487,3318.204,That's right.
1980.80-795,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3324.558,3329.595,"Well, even under their holding I don't think the candidate for political office could get the benefit of this rule."
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3329.595,3332.564,"Well, the dissenting justices didn't quite agree."
1980.80-795,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3352.309,3353.111,And you agree with that?
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3355.028,3357.013,"No, except the majority didn't disagree."
1980.80-795,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3357.013,3359.913,"Well, yes, their order is very specific on A-68."
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3362.999,3363.399,That's right.
1980.80-795,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3366.201,3369.836,And it also emphasized the special character of these litigants in its opinion.
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3369.836,3373.172,Insofar as that made it easier to decide the case.
1980.80-795,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3373.538,3379.609,"What I'm saying is, they clearly have not decided anything other than the fact that these litigants are entitled to relief."
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3381.228,3382.711,"--To that extent, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1980.80-795,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3397.788,3405.326,"No, we got into this because Justice White asked you if the rule was invalid on its face or if the lower court had so held, and I say, it clearly did not so hold."
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3405.326,3406.609,It clearly did not so hold.
1980.80-795,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3409.495,3415.682,Would it give you more relief than you got if it were stricken down on its face?
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3415.682,3419.169,"No, not... I don't think it would give us any more relief."
1980.80-795,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3427.942,3434.096,"Well, why are you entitled to urge us to declare it unconstitutional on its face?"
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3437.215,3440.0,I suppose that it would be an ironic--
1980.80-795,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3440.0,3444.968,"Overbreadth usually applies when it's not unconstitutional as to you but it may be as to others, doesn't it?"
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3444.968,3466.75,"--Well, I suppose the answer is that we are arguing that whether or not all of the activity in which respondents have engaged and seek to engage come within the protected core, we are entitled to have the rule struck down insofar as its enforcement against us with respect to the proposed activities is contemplated."
1980.80-795,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3516.75,3529.74,"But it seems to me there's a refinement here and that is that theoretically, at least, and I don't know whether this is the correct answer, the rule might be overbroad only to the extent that it prohibited the free handing out of literature."
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3535.161,3536.328,"It would do them some good, but they--"
1980.80-795,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3536.328,3538.546,"As I understand it, they don't want to do that."
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3540.298,3541.248,--They would much rather do more.
1980.80-795,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3541.248,3545.467,--Isn't it part of their religious mission to get the money at the time--
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3545.467,3546.719,It is their religious... it is--
1980.80-795,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3546.719,3548.769,--they engage in this transaction because they don't give these things away.
1980.80-795,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3548.769,3561.979,"--That is part of their religious mission, but it would not be incompatible with the religion if that was the best that one could possibly do, to hand out literature which exposed people to the religion and informed them of how they might make subsequent contributions."

1980.80-795,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3648.434,3651.269,"Mr. Harbison, can I ask you one question about the meaning of the rule?"
1980.80-795,2,33860,kent_g_harbison,,3677.018,3686.876,"I think the literal language of it on the face would indicate that, but it's never been applied outside the booth context in the Minnesota Supreme Court interpretive--"
