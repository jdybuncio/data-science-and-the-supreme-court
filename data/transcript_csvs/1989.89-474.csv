1989.89-474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.939,"We'll hear argument next in No. 89-474, William V. Grady v. Thomas J. Corbin."
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,17.962,20.829,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,180.484,188.387,"What is the jurisdiction of the justice court to which you refer, Mrs. Steller, so far as what kind of crimes can it hear pleas to?"
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,188.387,192.808,"Chief Justice Rehnquist, it would generally hear misdemeanors and violations."
1989.89-474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,203.683,204.833,"Binding over, in effect?"
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,204.833,206.466,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,243.491,246.676,Does all... do these facts make any difference to your legal argument?
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,252.247,260.519,"Yes, Your Honor, because we rely on New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law Section 1800(d), and we have relied on it in the state courts."
1989.89-474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,260.519,267.023,"Your position is, even if he pleaded guilty or was convicted of this offense, you could go ahead and prosecute him for the greater offense."
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,267.023,267.706,"That's right, Your Honor."
1989.89-474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,267.706,271.208,"So I don't know, why... what relevance, all these facts have."
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,271.208,271.743,Okay.
1989.89-474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,272.277,274.36,I'm just suggesting that I'm not sure I understand.
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,274.36,286.235,"--It seems to me in this Court in Blockburger and in Vitale has set forth certain rules to be followed, that being that--"
1989.89-474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,286.235,286.603,This Court.
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,290.205,291.622,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1989.89-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,317.706,329.247,But I... I take it from the opinion of the state court that the prosecution is bound by its pleadings in its bill of particulars.
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,348.577,349.327,"Well, Your Honor--"
1989.89-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,349.327,351.362,Is... is that correct?
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,351.362,354.897,"--That, plus additional factors are listed in the bill of particulars, Your Honor."
1989.89-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,357.516,371.943,"Well, there are some additional factors but, really, the essential part of the prosecution's case is going to rely on the matters that were concluded by the traffic offense in the traffic court."
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,373.693,374.693,In large part.
1989.89-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,387.635,388.468,"Oh, well, of course--"
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,388.468,389.737,--known on the night of the 23rd.
1989.89-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,389.737,395.808,"--there will be differences, but the state says the major part of the case is the same."
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,396.991,397.508,A large part--
1989.89-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,397.508,398.241,--that's what your state court says.
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,398.241,398.843,--yes.
1989.89-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,407.366,417.638,So... so don't we take the case as one in which in the second trial the proof is going to be of the same facts that were proven in the first trial?
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,417.638,418.322,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,436.366,443.889,"Well, are you... are you suggesting the case would have different if there had been a trial and the prosecution had introduced all this evidence?"
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,443.889,446.091,"It might present it in a different light, Your Honor."
1989.89-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,447.174,450.376,"Well, what's the legal... what's the legal difference?"
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,450.376,454.763,--In the sense that you would know exactly what evidence was... had been presented--
1989.89-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,454.763,458.799,But we do know because your state court has told us.
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,458.799,469.356,"--The state court has told us that we are bound by our bill of particulars, which does include elements which were involved in the crimes to which the defendant pled guilty."
1989.89-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,469.356,473.641,So I think you have to tell us why that does not constitute a bar.
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,473.641,487.651,"Because, Your Honor, this Court has never held that we must try all offenses that arise from one series of acts or one acts in one trial."
1989.89-474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,487.651,490.436,"Well, what about Harris against Oklahoma?"
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,493.722,506.696,"I don't think so, Justice O'Connor, because in Harris there is a footnote that in the state's brief, the state conceded that both felony murder and the underlying robbery were the same."
1989.89-474,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,564.151,567.52,xxx.
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,567.52,569.203,"Not in every manslaughter case, Your Honor."
1989.89-474,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,574.59,580.161,"But you didn't have any trouble with Ashe against Swenson, did you?"
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,580.161,581.344,"No, Your Honor, I didn't."
1989.89-474,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,581.344,584.413,You didn't even mention it in your brief.
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,587.6,592.218,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1989.89-474,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,599.574,600.724,"In your reply brief, you gave it one sentence."
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,600.724,601.824,"Yes, Your Honor, I did."
1989.89-474,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,601.824,603.209,But you didn't mention--
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,603.209,604.976,"But I don't... I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1989.89-474,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,604.976,607.461,--You didn't mention it in your main brief.
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,607.461,617.619,"No, Your Honor, because I don't believe that we are... this Court has held that we would be collaterally estopped, or that res judicata would apply in this particular case."
1989.89-474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,670.42,673.955,And that's because each has an element that the other doesn't have?
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,673.955,678.407,"On the traditional homicide and assault charges, yes, Chief Justice Rehnquist."
1989.89-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,678.807,692.667,"Ms. Steller, if... if I may put in my candidate for things that aren't mentioned in the brief that maybe should have been, the earliest case I see cited by any side is, I think, 1871."
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,708.546,708.879,--I think--
1989.89-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,708.879,712.915,Have you done any historical research in it at all... what... what... you know what--
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,712.915,718.901,"--I think, Your Honor, this Court's decisions which are cited in our briefs, refer to Blackstone's Commentaries."
1989.89-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,743.284,744.386,Uh-huh.
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,744.386,747.688,--And that results from the common law traditions.
1989.89-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,747.688,750.123,And what does that prove?
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,750.123,752.306,"Well, Your Honor, you asked me about a historical analysis--"
1989.89-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,752.306,752.907,"Right, right."
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,752.907,753.374,--and I believe--
1989.89-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,753.374,754.058,"--well, now how does--"
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,754.058,760.311,--that historically you would not have joined a minor offense with a more serious offense.
1989.89-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,760.311,760.695,--Uh-huh.
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,760.695,770.453,"Obviously at common law we wouldn't have vehicle and traffic violations, but I think that anything of that nature would not have been joined."
1989.89-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,770.453,793.8,But how does... how does that establish that the only application of this provision of the Constitution is to offenses that have different elements as opposed to later prosecution on the basis of the same facts?
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,820.802,830.408,I think that this Court has held previously that it is not... that it is perfectly permissible to use some of the same evidence.
1989.89-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,865.698,876.02,"--But we said in Vitale, although the mere possibility that the state will seek to rely on all of the ingredients necessarily included blah, blah, blah, would not be sufficient to bar."
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,885.994,891.13,"Your Honor, I believe the majority opinion in dicta says a substantial double jeopardy claim."
1989.89-474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,978.171,980.04,"Ms. Steller, may I ask you two questions?"
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,984.075,992.698,"It was my understanding, Your Honor, that the court's... the Supreme Court of Illinois did not permit the prosecution."
1989.89-474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,992.698,993.831,I... I just didn't know--
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,993.831,1006.607,"I think that was the decision, but their decision also was... in the case that was before you, the supreme court's decision was that the failure to slow was a lesser included offense of the homicide."
1989.89-474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1006.607,1007.057,--Right.
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,1007.057,1009.809,That is not the way this case reaches this Court.
1989.89-474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1009.809,1010.342,"No, I understand."
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,1048.267,1050.217,"No, Your Honor, that's not quite my position."
1989.89-474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1057.706,1058.84,"No, I'm not talking about state law."
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,1078.537,1090.427,"We would have to have... if I understand your question... there would be a potential for a failure to keep right trial, a driving while intoxicated trial, an assault trial and a homicide trial."
1989.89-474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1090.427,1090.827,Correct.
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,1095.063,1096.998,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.89-474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1096.998,1097.698,Yeah.
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,1097.698,1103.335,"However, I realize that New York has a compulsory joinder section which would have--"
1989.89-474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1103.335,1107.889,"Oh, I understand, and they've thrown out two of your seven counts for that reason... or three... or two or three, I can't remember."
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,1107.889,1116.495,"--Yes, Your Honor, the driving while intoxicated counts which were included, and I believe either one or two of the vehicular manslaughter counts."
1989.89-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1120.63,1128.569,But... but your answer is there would be no Federal constitutional impediment to the four trials?
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,1128.569,1129.219,"No, Your Honor."
1989.89-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1137.158,1148.383,"Even though the same evidence is introduced and... and the core of all of them is whether... really, whether, he was driving under intoxication."
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,1162.14,1169.463,"Well, Justice Scalia, I think there is an issue here, and that is what was the issue before the jury."
1989.89-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1209.938,1210.373,Right.
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,1210.373,1222.848,"But assuming... even if you assume that he was not intoxicated, I think that the prosecution could still go forward on the homicide theories because there are other elements here."
1989.89-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1250.948,1259.521,"Well, what... what you are now saying gives me cause to wonder whether your response to Justice Kennedy was correct earlier."
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,1273.547,1278.351,"--Your Honor, that would be some of the evidence introduced at this trial."
1989.89-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1282.237,1284.338,You're saying it's not an essential part of its case?
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,1284.338,1285.521,"No, I don't believe that it is."
1989.89-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1285.521,1290.825,That it can win its case even... even if he's... even if the jury doesn't believe he was intoxicated?
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,1290.825,1291.208,The jury--
1989.89-474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1291.208,1292.792,But that's not what the court of appeals said.
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,1304.918,1305.868,"--Your Honor, the evidence--"
1989.89-474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1305.868,1306.685,It seems to me that's--
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,1306.685,1307.218,--that goes to the--
1989.89-474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1307.218,1308.037,--somewhat inconsistent.
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,1308.037,1311.489,--evidence which would we... which the prosecution would intend to adduce at the trial.
1989.89-474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1311.489,1312.356,"Well, they said as the--"
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,1312.356,1312.839,However--
1989.89-474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1312.839,1315.441,--acts necessary to prove these charges.
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,1318.493,1320.345,--We would have to introduce evidence.
1989.89-474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1338.389,1344.21,"Well, I think you may well be right that if there was an acquittal that would bar farther... future prosecutions."
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,1361.005,1361.839,"Well, that's just another--"
1989.89-474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1361.839,1363.956,So I think you could get four separate convictions under your theory.
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,1363.956,1369.008,"--Well, it's not just another element, Justice Stevens, because we would be deleting other elements."
1989.89-474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1369.008,1371.36,"Well, not as I read the court of appeals' opinion."
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,1373.246,1384.787,"I'm sorry, Your Honor, but it seems to me that under the counts of this indictment, if you read the statutory language, as this Court has indicated should be done in its opinions in Blockburger--"
1989.89-474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1384.787,1386.737,"--Yes, but you have to read the bill of particulars too and the--"
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,1386.737,1387.406,--Then you're--
1989.89-474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1387.406,1389.456,--construction that your state court puts on the bill of particulars.
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,1390.608,1396.678,"--Then you are looking at the evidence adduced, and that's the problem, we believe, with the state court's opinion."
1989.89-474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1416.925,1422.21,"But... but you're saying that when you do that, you can do it even if it's precisely the same evidence in each case."
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,1426.697,1427.114,That's true.
1989.89-474,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1430.249,1431.099,Even if it's an entire overlap.
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,1437.303,1439.089,"--As a general rule, yes, Judge."
1989.89-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1470.476,1478.314,"But... but we have to evaluate your legal theory on the basis of what results it could produce, not just the results it might happen to produce in this case."
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,1485.736,1491.723,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.89-474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1560.034,1561.334,"Very well, Mrs. Steller."
1989.89-474,0,18067,bridget_r_steller,,1561.334,1562.153,Thank you.
1989.89-474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1562.153,1566.955,"Mr. Farrell, we'll hear now from you."
1989.89-474,1,39291,richard_t_farrell,,1566.955,1569.239,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1689.602,1696.006,"Well, it may be Latin and old, but how do we know it's deeply rooted in the double jeopardy clause?"
1989.89-474,1,39291,richard_t_farrell,,1696.006,1713.701,"Well, Your Honor, I'm going to have to take the word of the historical exegesis done on several occasions by this Court and by some of the law review writers that track the idea of a proscription against double jeopardy, as we call it now, back to at least Demosthenes' times, about the three centuries before the common era."
1989.89-474,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1827.743,1830.076,"Mr. Corbin had killed somebody, hadn't he?"
1989.89-474,1,39291,richard_t_farrell,,1830.076,1833.563,"--Yes, sir, he had killed somebody and a member of the DA's--"
1989.89-474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1833.563,1835.497,Just... just... just a minute Mr. Steller.
1989.89-474,1,39291,richard_t_farrell,,1842.669,1843.886,--I beg your pardon.
1989.89-474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1843.886,1848.24,And I... I suggest you adjust your entire demeanor to that of a court.
1989.89-474,1,39291,richard_t_farrell,,1848.24,1849.507,"Yes, Your Honor."
1989.89-474,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2317.677,2322.164,"Of course, to agree with Frankfurter and Brock we don't have to adopt the rule that you're proposing."
1989.89-474,1,39291,richard_t_farrell,,2339.943,2340.359,Well--
1989.89-474,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2340.359,2341.726,The prosecutor is not trying to do better here.
1989.89-474,1,39291,richard_t_farrell,,2345.862,2352.433,"--Mr. Justice Scalia, doing better does not necessarily mean trying to win again."
1989.89-474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2415.091,2429.416,"Mr. Farrell, what if the death here had occurred several months after the... after the accident so that at the time your client was prosecuted for the misdemeanor charges in the justice court there had been no death?"
1989.89-474,1,39291,richard_t_farrell,,2429.416,2450.747,"It's... it's quite clear, Your Honor, in the cases both of the state and in this Court, that if the prosecutor does not have available all of the information needed to mount the particular prosecution under attack, then the double jeopardy clause allows a prosecution as... as I understand your hypothetical, the so-called later-death cases."
1989.89-474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2450.747,2456.918,"Now, how... how... how does that fit in under your version of the... the same-evidence test?"
1989.89-474,1,39291,richard_t_farrell,,2456.918,2480.116,"The same-evidence test, as we would envision it being applied in this case, would be to take a look at the situation as the prosecutor knows it at the time that first guilt-imposing proceeding is ready to go to adjudication."
1989.89-474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2533.853,2550.695,"Under your theory, I take it, if the state were to have come several months later on evidence of intoxication which it didn't have at first, then there would be an exception for that too just like there would be for a later death?"
1989.89-474,1,39291,richard_t_farrell,,2550.695,2553.397,"It would be difficult to imagine how that could happen, but I think that--"
1989.89-474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2553.397,2555.283,"Well, just take it as a hypothetical."
1989.89-474,1,39291,richard_t_farrell,,2560.67,2561.07,--Okay.
1989.89-474,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2563.087,2568.491,They lost the blood sample and they find it.
1989.89-474,1,39291,richard_t_farrell,,2568.491,2573.128,"That one, Your Honor, I think I would have to say they had the information at the time."
1989.89-474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2701.678,2703.863,"Well, let me ask you another question."
1989.89-474,1,39291,richard_t_farrell,,2723.026,2776.911,"--If we were to replicate this case in Illinois... in Illinois, where apparently this is not necessary because that is how Illinois v. Vitale got here... if we were to replicate this case, like your hypothetical case, Mr. Chief Justice, who are in Illinois, I would suggest that the approach taken in Vitale might have to be re-examined and to look at... and look for... look for... for this Court to look for in the proceedings in the lower courts the motion to dismiss, let us say, the second indictment, any hearings that are held on that second indictment... to look for the defense... the defense... to establish beyond at least any reasonable question... not beyond a reasonable doubt... but to establish clearly that the prosecution can move ahead only on the same evidence."
1989.89-474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2776.911,2779.363,"Now, how would the defense go about establishing that?"
1989.89-474,1,39291,richard_t_farrell,,2783.398,2795.872,"I suggest, Your Honor, if we take it in this case I think we could probably call the investigating officers, we could call forth the blood--"
1989.89-474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2795.872,2805.93,"Well, they... they could certainly give you testimony as to what happened, but I would think there would be no guarantee that the state would necessarily use all the testimony of the investigating officers."
1989.89-474,1,39291,richard_t_farrell,,2805.93,2807.963,"--No, Your Honor."
1989.89-474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2946.254,2949.306,"Well, it seems to me that's the consequence of your test."
1989.89-474,1,39291,richard_t_farrell,,2968.053,2970.738,"--Well, Mr.... Mr. Justice--"
1989.89-474,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2970.738,2975.79,And I'm... I'm not talking necessarily about this case because we seem to know in this case what's going to happen.
1989.89-474,1,39291,richard_t_farrell,,2975.79,2992.484,"--Yes, Mr. Justice Kennedy, if we were to be willing to rest on a Blockburger first, same... evidence test second, then the problem of the same transaction would not be solvable."
1989.89-474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3014.748,3015.35,What is the third?
1989.89-474,1,39291,richard_t_farrell,,3018.802,3021.504,"The third one is the same transaction test, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.89-474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3021.504,3023.371,"That's never been adopted by the Court, has it?"
1989.89-474,1,39291,richard_t_farrell,,3024.873,3038.363,"No, sir, and it has been pointed out that the Court's declination to adopt that test has been characterized in one of this Court's writings as a steadfast refusal to adopt it."
1989.89-474,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3159.376,3164.78,"Mr. Farrell, before you sit down, what case do you rely on?"
1989.89-474,1,39291,richard_t_farrell,,3164.78,3167.665,Ashe v. Swenson.
1989.89-474,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3167.665,3169.934,Thank you.
1989.89-474,1,39291,richard_t_farrell,,3169.934,3173.052,"Mr. Chief Justice, I apologize, again, for my enthusiasm, my excesses."
1989.89-474,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3174.338,3175.821,"Very well, Mr. Farrell."
1989.89-474,2,18067,bridget_r_steller,,3179.89,3183.777,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.89-474,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3257.325,3259.944,"Well, this hasn't got a whole lot to do with our double jeopardy question, does it?"
1989.89-474,2,18067,bridget_r_steller,,3259.944,3260.694,"--I think it does, Your Honor."
1989.89-474,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3260.694,3261.177,Does it really?
1989.89-474,2,18067,bridget_r_steller,,3261.177,3269.816,I think that this Court in deciding this case has to craft a rule which will be fairly simple and can be applied in all 50 states.
1989.89-474,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3306.656,3311.46,"Well, isn't all of this, the people of New York?"
1989.89-474,2,18067,bridget_r_steller,,3311.46,3312.91,--If you are to presume--
1989.89-474,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3312.91,3314.679,You only have one state.
1989.89-474,2,18067,bridget_r_steller,,3314.679,3315.595,"--That's right, Your Honor."
1989.89-474,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3315.595,3321.582,And... you... the state speaks with one voice.
1989.89-474,2,18067,bridget_r_steller,,3321.582,3324.886,"That's right, Your Honor, but the district attorney is charged with--"
1989.89-474,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3324.886,3328.104,xxx all prosecutions?
1989.89-474,2,18067,bridget_r_steller,,3328.104,3330.121,"--That's right, Your Honor, and the district attorney--"
1989.89-474,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3330.121,3331.373,So what is your problem?
1989.89-474,2,18067,bridget_r_steller,,3334.842,3336.86,"--It's not just a mistake, Your Honor."
1989.89-474,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3338.76,3340.829,If he doesn't know what's going on?
1989.89-474,2,18067,bridget_r_steller,,3340.829,3342.681,"--Even in the absence of a mistake, Your Honor--"
1989.89-474,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3342.681,3347.3,"If he doesn't know what's going on, who gets blamed?"
1989.89-474,2,18067,bridget_r_steller,,3354.656,3355.906,"--No, I'm not saying that, Your Honor."
1989.89-474,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3355.906,3356.789,"You don't put that on him, do you?"
1989.89-474,2,18067,bridget_r_steller,,3356.789,3358.44,"I'm not saying that, Your Honor."
1989.89-474,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3369.248,3370.915,He did get notice.
1989.89-474,2,18067,bridget_r_steller,,3370.915,3372.283,"No, Your Honor, he didn't."
1989.89-474,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3372.283,3374.15,He didn't for six months?
1989.89-474,2,18067,bridget_r_steller,,3374.15,3378.104,"Your Honor, he had no notice on the night the plea was entered that the case was even on the calendar."
1989.89-474,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3378.104,3379.837,"Well, wasn't it in the newspapers?"
1989.89-474,2,18067,bridget_r_steller,,3379.837,3381.223,"Judge, I don't think you can presume--"
1989.89-474,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3381.223,3383.206,Wasn't it in the newspapers?
1989.89-474,2,18067,bridget_r_steller,,3383.206,3384.675,"--Yes, Your Honor, but as a practical--"
1989.89-474,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3384.675,3387.46,"Well, did... didn't that tell him what was going on?"
1989.89-474,2,18067,bridget_r_steller,,3387.46,3396.833,--I don't think that this Court... I don't believe that this Court can presume on this record that anyone in Dutchess County read the newspaper on the morning of October 4th.
1989.89-474,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3397.616,3400.767,"Well, then did it... do you have news--"
1989.89-474,2,18067,bridget_r_steller,,3400.767,3401.467,--There is a--
1989.89-474,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3401.467,3406.421,"--Just to speak for myself, do you have newspapers in Dutchess County?"
1989.89-474,2,18067,bridget_r_steller,,3406.421,3407.304,"--We do, Your Honor, but I--"
1989.89-474,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3407.304,3411.758,"Well, if you have them, I assume somebody read them."
1989.89-474,2,18067,bridget_r_steller,,3411.758,3420.281,"--Your Honor, on the morning of October 4th... this is referred to in the district attorney's answer in the county court to the defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment."
1989.89-474,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3433.672,3436.874,"There was a storm yesterday, and I read the newspaper."
1989.89-474,2,18067,bridget_r_steller,,3436.874,3440.094,"Your Honor, I don't... this is October 4th in the Mid-Hudson Valley."
1989.89-474,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3447.765,3452.735,I am unwilling to write any constitutional law based on a blizzard.
1989.89-474,2,18067,bridget_r_steller,,3453.702,3454.202,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
