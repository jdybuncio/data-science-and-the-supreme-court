1971.70-77,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.263,"-- in Number 70-77, North Carolina against Rice."
1971.70-77,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,8.817,12.765,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-77,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,132.355,141.668,"I noticed Mr. Safron in the brief the reference to the worthless check charge, that has nothing to do with the issues before us (Voice Overlap)"
1971.70-77,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,141.668,144.8,"Only in this regard, Your Honor."
1971.70-77,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,147.351,148.189,Yes.
1971.70-77,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,148.189,154.515,"He pled guilty to those, was then tried upon the plea of not guilty as driving under the influence."
1971.70-77,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,180.774,183.093,But was only partially concurrent.
1971.70-77,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,188.152,188.938,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-77,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,189.546,192.616,"So, we do not have really the concurrent sentence doctrine?"
1971.70-77,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,192.616,206.716,"No, not except for -- to the first year of the sentences were concurrent whereas the Court could have imposed the sentence consecutively, it was imposed concurrently and he received no greater sentence as result of having pled guilty to the twelve worthless check charges."
1971.70-77,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,206.716,211.242,"Now, we have at least one additional year based on the driving while intoxicated?"
1971.70-77,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,211.242,212.501,"Yes Your Honor, that is true."
1971.70-77,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,212.501,221.444,"And in the original so-called sub-constitutional court, “your adversary” his sentence was what?"
1971.70-77,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,221.444,226.375,His original sentence was nine months suspended upon payment of $100.00 fine and costs.
1971.70-77,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,226.375,229.503,"So, we do have before us -- this issue is clearly presented?"
1971.70-77,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,229.503,230.877,"Oh yes, Your Honor, quite clear!"
1971.70-77,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,230.877,235.349,It is not blunted at all really by the concurrent sentence doctrine?
1971.70-77,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,235.349,235.992,"No, not at all."
1971.70-77,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,242.738,248.044,"These are two indictments, not in one indictment, was it, the forged check?"
1971.70-77,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,248.044,249.891,"With all something separate and apart, Your Honor."
1971.70-77,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,258.003,259.333,"Well, was the indicted?"
1971.70-77,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,259.333,263.167,"No, Your Honor, he applied for trial de novo in these cases and --"
1971.70-77,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,263.167,265.336,These were his check cases?
1971.70-77,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,265.336,266.721,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-77,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,266.721,272.951,And was he convicted by the same judge below?
1971.70-77,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,272.951,275.293,"Before whom he appeared in a driving under the influence, Your Honor?"
1971.70-77,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,275.293,275.912,Yes.
1971.70-77,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,275.912,277.399,I have no idea.
1971.70-77,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,277.399,282.174,I am very confused as how did worthless checks got involved in this case?
1971.70-77,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,282.174,294.775,"Well, only this respect, Your Honor, on the same day when his trial de novo for the worthless checks came up for hearing, he also was on for hearing for his drunk driving charge."
1971.70-77,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,294.775,296.528,And that was de novo trial too?
1971.70-77,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,296.528,298.145,"Oh yes, Your Honor, these are all de novo."
1971.70-77,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,298.145,301.999,What is the maximum sentence for the bank check charge?
1971.70-77,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,301.999,303.911,"It defends, Your Honor, upon the amount."
1971.70-77,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,309.035,310.559,Were these all under fifty?
1971.70-77,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,310.559,312.639,"Apparently so, Your Honor."
1971.70-77,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,312.639,319.57,How many offenses that were subject to this procedure of trial do novo?
1971.70-77,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,319.57,322.156,"Every petty offense, Your Honor."
1971.70-77,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,327.61,329.586,But only for a particular offenses?
1971.70-77,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,329.586,336.155,"No, Your Honor, for every offense which is originally tried in what are now say the District Court."
1971.70-77,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,341.354,346.368,"Mr. Safron, what offense, could it the other, what offenses are subject first to trial in the District Court?"
1971.70-77,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,346.368,353.15,"In the District Court, Your Honor or perhaps let me express the other way."
1971.70-77,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,366.984,372.37,"And in the District Court, in any other case tried is District Court, no right to trial by jury?"
1971.70-77,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,372.37,377.465,"There is no right to trial by jury in the District Court Your Honor, criminal matters."
1971.70-77,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,377.465,380.128,Is the offense triable in the District Court?
1971.70-77,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,386.458,388.058,"That is exactly right, Your Honor."
1971.70-77,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,388.058,393.453,"Are these worthless check charges, would they have been triable in the District Court?"
1971.70-77,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,393.453,394.132,"Oh yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-77,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,394.132,396.234,"I see, and where they in fact in this case?"
1971.70-77,0,32898,jacob_l_safron,,396.234,396.969,"Oh yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,1874.56,1880.502,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1925.637,1935.981,"Unlike, the only point I suppose best been outlined is that unlike conventional appeal, one need not even allege any error?"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,1935.981,1936.675,"Indeed, that is --"
1971.70-77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1936.675,1941.853,One has an absolute right to this new trial without even claiming any error in the original trial?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,1941.853,1944.698,Unquestionably correct.
1971.70-77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1964.314,1978.043,"In that connection Mr. Van Alstyne, does this mean that if he feels there is error below in the District Court that he may not even move for a new trial in that court, his only avenue of relief is to take this so-called appeal?"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,1978.043,1981.861,To the best of my knowledge that is the case.
1971.70-77,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2009.962,2011.458,On which offense?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2011.458,2021.219,"On the drunk driving offense itself to be sure the legislator has since revised the maximum penalty downward, Mr. Justice Brennan, but at the time in question it was punishable by two years."
1971.70-77,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2037.814,2053.775,"(Inaudible) one point in 179 as I read it, says for the first conviction, it is punishable by a fine and not in less than $100.00."
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2053.775,2055.541,That is correct Mr. Justice Blackmun.
1971.70-77,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2060.036,2061.983,Alright.
1971.70-77,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2061.983,2077.356,What about the point that has been raised on whether the Superior Court information about the man’s prior record is available which was not in the record of the first court?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2077.356,2082.126,"That of course is a possibility, respectfully Mr. Chief Justice."
1971.70-77,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2102.797,2104.998,Is there a date on that sheet?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2104.998,2106.741,"There is, it has been made available to me."
1971.70-77,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2116.98,2120.691,"Mr. Van Alstyne, do you mean that you have never seen this document?"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2120.691,2122.056,I have not.
1971.70-77,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2122.056,2123.731,And it was not before the court below?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2123.731,2126.645,It was not.
1971.70-77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2126.645,2131.481,"If you are right in your basic contention, this is wholly irrelevant?"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2131.481,2132.672,It is.
1971.70-77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2132.672,2139.752,"I mean, even if the reason had before the enhanced sentence had been information in the wrap sheet, it was not available in the lower court?"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2139.752,2140.678,"Indeed, it is Your Honor."
1971.70-77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2140.678,2144.445,"You are right that you still prevail, this is irrelevant?"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2144.445,2148.528,"Indeed, I do not rest upon this outside observation."
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2201.313,2223.465,"(Inaudible) I take it that the trial de novo was (Inaudible) I mean, there is no (Inaudible) as you set aside as error, it is questionably viewing the sufficiency of the evidence like that, it is a brand new proceeding?"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2223.465,2225.771,"It is new, in no respect different."
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2225.771,2232.794,Or I think that one has to deal with the Superior Court (Inaudible)?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2232.794,2237.688,"Indeed, that possibility is there."
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2237.688,2253.501,"It is not really the question here whether the state may impose between him and a constitutional trial, a trial in the District Court without a jury and a without --"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2253.501,2255.465,I think that is certainly among the questions and if --
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2255.465,2270.662,Is that not a little different question than your Pearce argument which really an expected argument a deal and just following the rule of Pearce.
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2275.132,2288.349,"That is true and respectfully I do wish to suggest that the case is a clearer instance than Pearce itself, but this is an instance where a man is placed in jeopardy of a substantial penalty without even the rudimentary safeguards of Fourteenth Amendment due process."
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2288.349,2291.739,"Yes, but he could point it out without any problem?"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2291.739,2304.533,"Indeed, but Mr. Justice White, is it not in fact an instance where the state first submits the man to trial with no election for trial elsewhere in denial of his constitutional rights."
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2304.533,2317.573,"Your point is that -- your real point is that if he runs to this mode twice, (Inaudible)"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2317.573,2324.677,I think it is a crucial part to the case unlike the outcome in the court below quite right on that basis below.
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2353.868,2362.473,Identify the harm raised to the defendant when he first subject to a trial by District Court before he can get to Superior Court?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2362.473,2381.834,I think the harm is possible and addresses itself to every man’s common sense that to the extent the state says that if you are willing to succumb to the punishment that has been imposed upon you by trading off that which the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees then we will to that extent insulate you from the risk of more severe treatment.
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2390.641,2391.28,"Well, would you have (Voice Overlap)"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2391.28,2391.894,There is no election here.
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2391.894,2397.606,You have to make the same argument that the defendant has a choice in (Inaudible)?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2397.606,2402.046,It seems to me that the case is somewhat different and it is harder and closer.
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2445.542,2453.827,"On your argument, I do not see how the Pearce rationale really solve the, you make this objection?"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2453.827,2456.638,"No, my objection would exist quite apart from Pearce."
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2456.638,2469.253,"I mean, even if the Court of Appeals is correct, even if we affirm this case, it seems to me that basic objection to the two tier procedure still remain."
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2469.253,2472.996,"Yes, (Voice Overlap) I did not attempt in my brief --"
1971.70-77,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2472.996,2483.086,"And indeed it would remain, even if it were North Carolina to provide at some state (Inaudible) that the sentence may not exceed in the Superior Court?"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2483.086,2484.29,"Indeed, I think there is an individual --"
1971.70-77,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2484.29,2485.882,You would still have the same argument?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2485.882,2488.468,Mr. Justice Brennan (Voice Overlap) question of law.
1971.70-77,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2488.468,2489.967,(Voice Overlap)
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2489.967,2500.654,"Respectfully no because it is not necessary for the court to affirm to anticipate a next case, that is to say the appropriate case in which this issue would be raised it seems to me --"
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2500.654,2510.167,Without this basic objection it seems to be that Pearce point -- that the Pearce point is only (Inaudible)?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2510.167,2513.561,"Well, respectfully I think it has separate strength."
1971.70-77,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2549.541,2552.716,In the absence of (Inaudible) subsequent to the initial sentence?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2552.716,2554.459,Indeed.
1971.70-77,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2554.459,2558.097,And which would justify an increased sentence (Inaudible)?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2558.097,2558.248,Yes.
1971.70-77,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2558.248,2561.497,This would come down I gather in resubmission.
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2573.204,2573.688,Yes.
1971.70-77,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2573.688,2575.539,And that would still leave what?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2575.539,2582.244,It is still leaves a constitutional flaw remaining in the system which this Court would doubtless have to consider in the course of trail.
1971.70-77,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2582.244,2588.98,(Voice Overlap) you have to argue with other point which --
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2588.98,2589.816,"Indeed, I would."
1971.70-77,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2589.816,2593.592,Since there I think it is by (Inaudible)?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2593.592,2593.882,Yes.
1971.70-77,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2593.882,2595.528,They may not impose reference?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2595.528,2596.129,That is correct.
1971.70-77,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2596.129,2596.716,I should say.
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2596.716,2597.345,That is correct.
1971.70-77,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2627.98,2643.43,"Is it possible that one response to what Circuit holding if it stands would be for all of the sentences in the first court, now, the District Court, to be the maximum?"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2643.43,2645.287,It is possible Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.70-77,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2684.66,2692.221,What is the remedy that Pearce prescribes for the enhanced sentence on the second time around?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2692.221,2700.049,"The remedy is to permit the enhancement of sentence only by a mode which makes practical then, a subsequent in judicial review."
1971.70-77,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2700.049,2704.612,"My question is when they find the sentence, why not merit it under Pearce?"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2705.349,2707.408,"I beg your pardon, I misunderstood."
1971.70-77,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2735.657,2742.148,It did not read like a clerical error to me Mr. Alstyne and you think it is just an oversight?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2742.148,2745.968,"Respectfully Mr. Chief Justice, I earnestly do."
1971.70-77,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2776.41,2780.593,Which is the language that led merely down the other road?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2790.29,2791.471,It is not.
1971.70-77,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2791.471,2795.191,"But then, this is not a clerical error, but a judicial error, is it not?"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2795.191,2804.058,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice and for this Court appropriately in the disposition of the case to note that and call for its correction seems to me eminently appropriate."
1971.70-77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2810.341,2837.363,"Does that point of the Chief Justice taken even further down the road, if you agree that as I think you are quite right in conceding that there is nothing invalid about this conviction and since he has now served his sentence, the only invalidity went to the length of the sentence which he now served, why is this case not moot?"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2837.363,2844.191,In my judgment that issue was an honest issue which was litigated in the Fourth Circuit.
1971.70-77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2861.958,2863.484,From the conviction?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2863.484,2864.772,I beg you pardon.
1971.70-77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2899.456,2917.431,"The Fourth Circuit did not apparently, either they did not understand or they did not accept your argument because they say in juries consequences because of the conviction might still obtain and you are now conceding that the convictions were improperly set aside?"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2917.431,2918.459,"Yes, respectfully."
1971.70-77,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2924.834,2926.093,Right.
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2926.093,2930.16,"The mootness issue was not only, not raised by the state here in this petition."
1971.70-77,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2939.437,2946.49,What would you suggest would be upon conviction of some other offense if he again committed an offense?
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2957.994,2962.644,"Well, it would not be expunging in two years, it would just be say, it should have been nine months?"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2962.644,2964.492,Suspended on payment of $100.00 fine.
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2973.225,2981.948,"Let us assume it was decided that his confinement beyond nine months is unconstitutional, would he have any civil remedy against the North Carolina"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2981.948,2983.788,Unfortunately he would not.
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2983.788,2985.905,(Voice Overlap)There is no provision for it?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,2985.905,2995.58,"Apparently Congress authorizes none even for compensation of people who spent time in deprivation of constitutional rights, there is no remedy."
1971.70-77,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2996.019,3003.323,"Assuming that Mr. Rice gets to (Inaudible) and does not commit any more crimes, he does not have a word on?"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3003.323,3004.635,I suppose he does not.
1971.70-77,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3008.323,3019.517,"And now we have sort of conflict between you and the Fourth Circuit, I am at loss as to how you solve it."
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3033.664,3035.579,Respectfully Mr. Justice --
1971.70-77,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3035.579,3038.513,I have to decide between you and the Fourth Circuit manner?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3038.513,3039.758,I do not think so.
1971.70-77,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3060.751,3064.919,Was there one word in Pearce that says you were aiming at the conviction?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3064.919,3065.202,"Nothing, nothing."
1971.70-77,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3065.202,3065.829,One word?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3065.829,3066.524,Nothing.
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3081.833,3087.549,"So, you are -- you are assuming here that the convictions are valid?"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3087.549,3088.854,Indeed.
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3160.514,3163.048,Are there any plea bargains in the District Courts?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3163.048,3166.431,"Indeed, I have no personal doubt that there are many."
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3166.431,3182.557,Let us assume there is an outright bargain which is you plead guilty and you get nine months and they present it to the judge and the judge says alright that is satisfactory and everybody’s perfectly of -- and then he exercise his right to appeal.
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3182.557,3186.158,Yes.
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3186.158,3188.294,"And then, you would make the same argument?"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3188.294,3201.726,"No, I would have to answer because of the failure of District Courts to make a record at all that under the decisions of this Court, there being no record made to allow a subsequent court to ascertain the --"
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3201.726,3212.525,"Let us assume everybody agrees that, I mean, on a habeas corpus after his conviction in higher sentence in the Superior Court, the record is perfectly clear."
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3220.481,3234.216,"No, I think that a consistent with the Court’s decision in Parker and Brady and McMinn is perfectly possible to find that this is an honest bargain that the accused has indeed received the benefit and exchange for knowingly giving up that to which he is entitled."
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3234.216,3248.213,And you do not think that this whole system can be interpreted there is sort of an enormous plea bargain in the sense that they are saying to him we are going to run you through.
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3261.402,3266.828,"Mr. Justice White, respectfully there is no possible basis for binding a bargain."
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3271.364,3276.603,Is the choice not after the District Court trial more effective than the choice before?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3276.603,3278.654,"Oh it seems to be clearly, not sir."
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3278.654,3279.747,Why not?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3281.09,3287.557,And they know yours and indeed one has had to incur the expense and the delay and the ordeal and the harassment of the first trial.
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3289.058,3293.651,In terms of a due process choice it is better afterwards than before?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3293.651,3294.404,"Yes, indeed."
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3294.404,3295.174,Yes.
1971.70-77,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3295.174,3300.381,What percentage of all the cases are in forma pauperis to the District Court?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3300.381,3303.33,I do not know whether the figures are even available Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.70-77,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3307.194,3311.226,But do you not think it might be substantial like 90%?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3311.226,3322.379,"I cannot, no honestly and it seems a sensible guess respectfully, but I do not have the figures, perhaps Mr. Safron does."
1971.70-77,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3322.379,3341.835,"If after the guilty plea derived that hypothetical case that Mr. Justice White suggested, the man then asserts his right to a trial de novo, is his guilty plea under the North Carolina law admissible in evidence against him in the new trial?"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3341.835,3353.955,"I will appreciate assistance by counsel of the state because I am not certain I am advised by some local attorneys that it is admissible, but I do not know that and would willingly stand corrected on the matter."
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3353.955,3366.218,"I mean after this there has been an error on the retrial the Superior Court, if he still can produce evidence of what his testimony was in the District Court, is that admissible?"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3366.218,3371.817,"I do not know, I cannot answer that clearly."
1971.70-77,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3379.872,3384.557,But may I ask (Inaudible) there was a record in the Superior Court in this case?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3384.557,3389.721,"Yes, so far as I know that was never made a part of the record in the case now presented to the court."
1971.70-77,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3389.721,3394.901,But at least on the on bad check charges that was a guilty plea presumably?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3394.901,3395.325,Yes.
1971.70-77,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3395.325,3399.641,And (Inaudible) was there a trial of the (Voice Overlap)?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3399.641,3400.734,"Indeed, there was."
1971.70-77,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3400.734,3402.111,And evidence taken?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3402.111,3402.919,"Indeed, there was."
1971.70-77,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3402.919,3410.212,And if you do not know whether the record indicates any cross-examination based on testimony given in the --
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3410.212,3411.963,"No, I do not."
1971.70-77,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3419.389,3421.602,And we got no transcript to the Superior Court?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3421.602,3423.967,We do not.
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3554.415,3575.544,"Let me ask you this, let us assume that North Carolina has the system of trying people in the District Court and having assigned them (Inaudible) that postponed the sentencing and then trying to appeal and to appeal from your conviction."
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3575.544,3581.688,The sentence respectfully to be then determined and imposed by whom and what they --
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3581.688,3589.095,"Well, by then I get to -- you could appeal from your conviction or you can appeal with your sentence."
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3601.882,3608.349,"If he did not appeal from his conviction within ten days sentence will then be imposed, as I understand and the question is --"
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3608.349,3613.966,Does conviction (Inaudible)?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3613.966,3622.184,"Yes, I think that raises at least a very substantial procedural due process question."
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3622.184,3625.672,Do you believe in fact that the question (Voice Overlap)?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3625.672,3626.134,"Yes, indeed."
1971.70-77,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3648.829,3670.191,"Would you see a constitutional question if it developed on a survey that every judge in every case in the District Court imposed the maximum sentence on that in a given percentage, 10% or 15%, they later entertained motions for modification of the sentence and did reduce the sentence?"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3670.191,3671.311,Mr. Chief Justice --
1971.70-77,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3671.311,3673.38,Is there due process question there too?
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3673.38,3694.936,"I do indeed, if firm figures of that kind would be forthcoming in a given piece of litigation then it seems to me at least to yield a prima facie inference of punitive original sentencing which would at least shift a burden of coming forward with some explanation so to account for such an odd and peculiar pattern."
1971.70-77,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3694.936,3704.618,"Well, your argument though right across the board in so-called petty and --"
1971.70-77,1,43808,william_w_van_alstyne,,3704.618,3706.899,It need not of course.
