1990.90-622,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,22.025,"We'll hear argument next in No. 90-622, Florida against Luz Piedad Jimeno."
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,41.597,45.151,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-622,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,161.988,170.273,"Mr. Neimand, what if the automobile had contained a locked briefcase?"
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,173.355,185.853,"If that is a... locked with a key, then the, it probably would not be reasonable to assume that the individual consented to have his property broken."
1990.90-622,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,197.969,201.522,"May I ask then, are you agreeing that the Wells case was correctly decided?"
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,201.522,206.675,--Only because the individual Wells was not present at that time.
1990.90-622,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,206.675,208.728,So you do agree Wells was correctly decided?
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,208.728,209.657,Only on its facts.
1990.90-622,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,209.657,211.289,But at least on its facts.
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,211.289,212.07,"On its facts, yes."
1990.90-622,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,212.8,216.162,And that's the only authority that this... the Florida court relied on in this case?
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,216.162,216.963,--Correct.
1990.90-622,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,216.963,226.92,"When you answered Justice O'Connor and you said that it's unreasonable to assume that there would be consent to break the lock, did you mean that in the technical sense of picking it or actually destroying it?"
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,230.58,236.515,I think that almost goes to the same that if it was just clasp shut and you have a attache case where you could just--
1990.90-622,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,236.515,237.015,No.
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,240.328,242.318,"--Well, if he doesn't destroy the property."
1990.90-622,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,250.345,252.817,What about to simply have his lock picked?
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,252.817,261.512,"--Well, he wouldn't consent to have the lock picked, but it would not violate the reasonableness because he had no property destruction."
1990.90-622,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,261.512,264.805,"I know, but it goes to what the scope of his consent was."
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,264.805,269.857,The scope would be determined by what he was asked to look for.
1990.90-622,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,269.857,272.558,"Well, where do you come out on the question?"
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,281.785,295.614,"In terms of a reasonableness approach, that would probably be unlawful as to the scope of the search because there was a protection interest involved and there would be somewhat of a destruction of the property."
1990.90-622,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,295.614,298.836,How about opening a woman's handbag?
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,305.34,307.901,"I don't think there's a problem there, because it would not be locked."
1990.90-622,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,317.017,321.462,What about a man's wallet that's still in his jacket pocket?
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,321.462,326.084,"--Again, I don't believe that would be unreasonable if you're looking for a particular item."
1990.90-622,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,328.655,335.201,"You mean by allowing... when I consent to have a policeman search my car, I am also consenting to a personal search?"
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,335.201,336.871,"Well, it would not be a personal search."
1990.90-622,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,336.871,337.502,It wouldn't?
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,339.114,344.667,I would say that under the law that in order to touch a person you have to have some sort of reasonable suspicion.
1990.90-622,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,350.32,350.841,I see.
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,350.841,353.862,"--seat of the car, then that would be permissible."
1990.90-622,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,353.862,369.452,"Well, but you have already abandoned in... I think in your answer to Justice Kennedy and in your current answer, the proposition that the only determinant of the scope of the search is what you're looking for."
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,380.22,382.772,"No, the State has not abandoned that."
1990.90-622,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,383.761,388.504,"Well, but you're using something else in telling me that you can't... I mean, my, I am in the car."
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,395.719,402.033,"--I think you would have to ask... because you're saying may I look into your car, you're not saying may I search your person."
1990.90-622,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,402.033,403.385,"Oh, all right."
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,403.385,404.604,And that's the difference.
1990.90-622,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,404.604,405.556,I see.
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,406.827,409.509,And if I wanted to search a person I would ask to consent to search the person.
1990.90-622,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,409.509,418.946,"--Likewise, when you say may I look into your car, I assume your answer to Justice Kennedy implied, it does not say may I... may I look into locked trunks in your car, right?"
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,419.585,423.477,I can extend to that based on the factual circumstances of a particular case.
1990.90-622,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,423.477,425.909,"--Your answer to him was you couldn't pick the lock, right?"
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,428.119,432.433,"Again, what I would say, that it would depend on the facts or circumstances."
1990.90-622,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,453.327,453.758,Oh.
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,456.15,456.911,"--No, sir."
1990.90-622,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,456.911,469.059,"--Well, why don't you use that ground here instead, I mean, you could say no matter what the initial permission was, when there was no objection to looking in the bag, I guess, was that permission to look in the bag?"
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,469.059,471.92,"Well, under the terms here it was, because they were told--"
1990.90-622,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,471.92,473.97,Or does that only work for trunks and not for bags?
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,473.97,474.511,--No.
1990.90-622,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,515.107,520.5,"Well, after they found the narcotics, what use was there in looking in the rest of the car?"
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,520.5,523.712,"--Well, there might have been more narcotics in the car."
1990.90-622,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,523.712,525.215,There might have been what?
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,525.215,531.887,"At the time they located the narcotics in the car, that gave them probable cause to see if there was narcotics--"
1990.90-622,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,531.887,535.46,"Yeah, but why did they have to look for something else after they found narcotics?"
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,535.46,536.202,--But they didn't.
1990.90-622,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,546.377,548.06,They didn't search any further?
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,548.06,548.751,"No, sir."
1990.90-622,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,548.751,551.141,"Because they didn't need to, did they?"
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,551.141,559.396,"In this case, because of the facts, the respondents were under suspicion for transporting that, those drugs in that paper bag."
1990.90-622,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,573.926,576.227,Why was the search valid?
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,576.227,578.49,Because there was a valid consent.
1990.90-622,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,582.601,585.644,"Well, but isn't it at issue to this extent, the scope of the consent?"
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,599.441,602.684,--It can.
1990.90-622,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,607.688,608.768,"Well, what were the facts in this case?"
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,612.241,616.625,--The facts showed that this officer overheard some conversations at a phone booth--
1990.90-622,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,616.625,619.915,But... I understand he has reason for... I just want to know what he said.
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,621.567,624.299,--He said may I search... we believe you are transporting narcotics.
1990.90-622,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,649.474,650.336,--Are these in the findings?
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,652.596,655.1,--This is the fact that is found by the lower court.
1990.90-622,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,655.1,655.789,I see.
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,655.789,659.021,"In the order of the trial court in the special hearing, this--"
1990.90-622,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,659.021,660.714,And where was the paper bag?
1990.90-622,0,36397,michael_j_neimand,,660.714,664.995,"--The paper bag, I believe, was in the, either in the back or the front seat on the floor."
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,911.362,920.989,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,962.935,967.699,Did you say it's probably right that if he had known he was asking to search the bag he would have refused?
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,967.699,968.21,No.
1990.90-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,974.432,980.166,I thought the position of the State was that they did ask for consent to make a search that necessarily included the bag?
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,980.166,982.58,"That's exactly right, but those are two very different things."
1990.90-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,989.502,992.123,But do you know that he means to search the bag?
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,992.123,1005.473,"In the exchange I am conducting an investigation for narcotics, may I search your car, go ahead, I have nothing to hide, reasonably conveys consent to search containers in the car that might contain the object of the search."
1990.90-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1005.473,1008.546,Do you think it means he intended to give consent to search the bag or not?
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1008.546,1010.566,He did not limit the consent he gave.
1990.90-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1010.566,1012.717,"Well, I understand, but what do you think his actual intent was?"
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1012.717,1016.461,I think his intent was to give a general consent to search the car.
1990.90-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1016.461,1019.513,"No, do you... what do you think his actual intent was with respect to searching the bag?"
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1019.513,1024.795,"I think, as the district court found in this case, he could have assumed that the officer intended to open the bag."
1990.90-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1025.455,1026.567,"Okay, you don't ask--"
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1026.567,1027.587,I'll try again.
1990.90-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1031.209,1031.68,--But that wasn't my question.
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1035.573,1048.901,"--I think he hoped that the officer would not search the bag, but that in giving a general consent to search... he may have harbored the hope that the officer wouldn't search the bag, but he did not impose that limitation on the general consent that he gave."
1990.90-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1048.901,1049.893,I understand that.
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1052.384,1058.178,"Because then Jimeno would have realized that the officer was on to him, that he knew about the bag, that he knew that the bag contained narcotics."
1990.90-622,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1060.008,1073.207,But that seems to me to contradict the finding of the district court that the defendant... I think the district court said could have assumed that the intent... the defendant could have assumed that the officer would have searched the bag.
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1073.207,1073.818,--That's right.
1990.90-622,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1074.657,1082.634,"How does that square with your answer that he, he would not have given the consent if it had been asked for?"
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1083.513,1085.105,--Two different situations.
1990.90-622,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1120.909,1124.122,"You don't necessarily say that that includes purses as well, do you?"
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1124.122,1127.865,--You mean if there were... the passengers remained in the car?
1990.90-622,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1127.865,1129.805,The question that Justice O'Connor asked.
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1129.805,1131.585,"No, I don't, Your Honor."
1990.90-622,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1132.326,1135.599,You could draw a line between the paper bag and a purse?
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1135.599,1139.222,"--Oh, purse."
1990.90-622,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1139.64,1140.421,A purse.
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1140.421,1140.942,Oh.
1990.90-622,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1145.076,1146.314,It wasn't left in the car.
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1149.196,1156.162,"--Well, and if she is still in the car, I would say no, it would not necessarily include consent to search that, because that's more--"
1990.90-622,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1156.162,1157.481,Okay.
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1157.902,1159.594,--that's with her as opposed to being in the car.
1990.90-622,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1159.594,1161.175,What if it's just lying next to her on the seat?
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1161.175,1164.567,"Well, then I think the general consent does include that, because it's not--"
1990.90-622,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1164.567,1167.349,"Oh, it depends on whether she is holding it or it's next to her on the seat?"
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1168.1,1176.565,"--Well, I think when it's holding her, it's reasonably understood to be part of her person, and a general consent to search the car does not include a search of the person."
1990.90-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1188.442,1192.884,"But any container they leave in, suitcase, briefcase, purse, general consent includes it?"
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1192.884,1193.545,Yes.
1990.90-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1194.216,1195.906,You think that's a realistic assumption?
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1195.906,1197.388,"I think so, yes."
1990.90-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1212.519,1221.295,"Do you have a single case where a man said you can search the car but you can't search that paper bag, that brown paper bag?"
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1221.295,1223.917,"No, I'm not aware of any case that would be--"
1990.90-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1223.917,1226.847,"Well, why do you think it's proper to say so?"
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1226.847,1228.309,"--Well, if he didn't want--"
1990.90-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1228.309,1229.579,Is it a possibility?
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1229.579,1231.289,--It is a possibility that--
1990.90-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1231.289,1233.282,But it's not a probability?
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1233.282,1233.783,--No.
1990.90-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1237.834,1242.379,Have you any case where the man refused to let you search the car at all?
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1255.315,1256.697,"That's not what took place here, of course."
1990.90-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1258.048,1260.041,That's not true for every case?
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1265.734,1268.685,--Where the people refused consent?
1990.90-622,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1268.685,1269.695,Yes.
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1269.695,1273.998,"I am not aware of any immediately, but I am sure that there could be a case."
1990.90-622,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1289.62,1301.768,Is your argument that an objective test applies and that in these circumstances a reasonable officer would assume that he had the right to search the bag as well as the interior of the car?
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1303.148,1303.679,Exactly.
1990.90-622,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1305.74,1306.491,I understand that submission.
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1316.167,1317.837,"--Well, they're two different situations."
1990.90-622,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1354.992,1363.408,"So, it's really a different case you're talking about when you say if he had asked to search the bag he would not have given his consent?"
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1371.152,1371.773,--That's right.
1990.90-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1428.888,1435.644,"Do you agree with Florida that on its facts the Florida Supreme Court correctly, or I guess the court of appeals, correctly decided Florida against Wells?"
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1435.644,1438.646,"Yes, Your Honor, because that involved a locked container."
1990.90-622,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1450.193,1455.328,"What if it could be opened, say an ordinary briefcase but not locked, just closed and snapped normally."
1990.90-622,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1456.337,1458.779,"That's, we think, no different than the rolled-up paper bag."
1990.90-622,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1495.444,1498.886,"Thank you, Mr. Roberts."
1990.90-622,2,33437,jeffrey_s_weiner,,1501.81,1511.365,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-622,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1584.623,1603.434,"Well, counsel, it... the Florida Supreme Court appears to have established here some kind of a per se rule when it said that consent to search a vehicle does not extend to closed containers found inside."
1990.90-622,2,33437,jeffrey_s_weiner,,1614.192,1617.514,I think that is a fair reading of the supreme court's decision.
1990.90-622,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1617.964,1620.836,Do you think that's consistent with this Court's cases?
1990.90-622,2,33437,jeffrey_s_weiner,,1620.836,1628.904,"--Yes, Your Honor, I do, because I don't believe that, although the Solicitor General urges that an objective test be implemented, that that's the case."
1990.90-622,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1631.214,1643.703,I thought in U.S. v. Ross this Court indicated that a lawful search of a car includes the right to search containers within it.
1990.90-622,2,33437,jeffrey_s_weiner,,1643.703,1650.256,"--That is precisely correct, Your Honor, but that was a case in which there was probable cause to believe that contraband was contained in the vehicle."
1990.90-622,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1650.256,1654.9,"Well, don't you think that consent is the equivalent of probable cause?"
1990.90-622,2,33437,jeffrey_s_weiner,,1656.402,1657.343,"No, Your Honor, I do not."
1990.90-622,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1657.343,1657.844,No?
1990.90-622,2,33437,jeffrey_s_weiner,,1657.844,1662.927,Consent is valid only to the extent that the consent is given for.
1990.90-622,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1677.586,1687.053,It just seems to me that the court went beyond any precedence of this Court in saying the consent just can't include authority to open a bag.
1990.90-622,2,33437,jeffrey_s_weiner,,1687.053,1691.214,I don't think the Florida Supreme Court necessarily said that.
1990.90-622,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1711.839,1721.594,"Well, so you think a search of the vehicle that is consented to, then, simply means to search for things that might be spread over the seat or something like that?"
1990.90-622,2,33437,jeffrey_s_weiner,,1721.594,1722.526,Not necessarily.
1990.90-622,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1736.845,1748.753,"Although all that you can find, if you go that far, even behind the seats, the visors, into the seats, it's okay if you find loose powder, loose cocaine powder."
1990.90-622,2,33437,jeffrey_s_weiner,,1756.968,1758.418,"Well, that's not necessarily so."
1990.90-622,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1783.215,1783.866,I see.
1990.90-622,2,33437,jeffrey_s_weiner,,1789.47,1794.272,Under Arizona v. Hicks it is arguable that that is a search.
1990.90-622,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1794.903,1797.795,"But that was their mistake here, they didn't feel the paper bag first."
1990.90-622,2,33437,jeffrey_s_weiner,,1801.577,1811.622,"--I think that's precisely correct, and they could have... when they had consent to search, if he went to the paper bag... my feeling is he still would have had to say may I look in the bag, or may I look in the containers."
1990.90-622,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1834.379,1841.512,I am trying to think what the reasonable import of my expression is when I tell somebody he can search the car for cocaine.
1990.90-622,2,33437,jeffrey_s_weiner,,1854.352,1870.821,"--Justice Scalia, there are many, many cases at the trial and appellate levels in which cocaine and other contraband is found under mats, in glycine packages which are clearly visible, or the shape or size or smell of which clearly leads to probable cause."
1990.90-622,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1892.717,1906.044,"That's assuming those are lying on the seat rather than... I mean, no one has suggested, I don't believe, that the sort of consent given here would authorize the search of the wallet contained in the jacket of the driver when he got out of the car."
1990.90-622,2,33437,jeffrey_s_weiner,,1906.044,1910.348,I thought the State pretty much indicated that's what they had in mind.
1990.90-622,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1934.354,1940.028,"All your client had to say is, when he reached for the bag, was hey wait a minute, I said you could search the car, but not the bag."
1990.90-622,2,33437,jeffrey_s_weiner,,1942.088,1948.272,"Well, it might have stopped it, probably would have stopped it, but the burden shouldn't be on a citizen to stop a police officer."
1990.90-622,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1982.864,1986.998,"Well, but then that's just saying that our consent law is wrong."
1990.90-622,2,33437,jeffrey_s_weiner,,1993.162,2007.871,"Well, I submit to the Court that that, in this situation it would be entirely proper for this Court to come down with a bright-line rule saying if you want consent to search you must ask for consent to search the items in question."
1990.90-622,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2009.211,2019.619,"But that's contrary to the thrust of Schneckloth, and I think contrary to the thrust of Scott against United States, too, where you're talking about an objective standard, reasonable inferences to be drawn from."
1990.90-622,2,33437,jeffrey_s_weiner,,2024.362,2026.345,I don't think that it's contrary to Schneckloth.
1990.90-622,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2052.782,2053.353,xxx.
1990.90-622,2,33437,jeffrey_s_weiner,,2064.049,2065.12,Absolutely.
1990.90-622,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2067.692,2069.391,Second question.
1990.90-622,2,33437,jeffrey_s_weiner,,2082.572,2083.54,"--No, sir."
1990.90-622,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2083.54,2084.42,Why not?
1990.90-622,2,33437,jeffrey_s_weiner,,2084.42,2085.322,Because their character--
1990.90-622,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2085.322,2086.36,What's the difference between the two?
1990.90-622,2,33437,jeffrey_s_weiner,,2086.36,2096.78,"--The difference is that the intended use of a holster could, is for a weapon, which in many cases is a violation of the law if it's concealed."
1990.90-622,3,36397,michael_j_neimand,,2831.111,2831.952,Thank you.
1990.90-622,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2855.836,2857.428,"Well, what case is that, Mr. Neimand?"
1990.90-622,3,36397,michael_j_neimand,,2857.428,2858.487,That's Horton v. California--
1990.90-622,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2858.487,2858.917,Horton?
1990.90-622,3,36397,michael_j_neimand,,2859.298,2861.589,"--Your Honor, and that came out just recently."
1990.90-622,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2872.258,2884.055,May I ask a question that occurred to me during your opponent's argument on the question whether the consent to search the car gives authority that's coextensive with Ross case probable cause or a warrant.
1990.90-622,3,36397,michael_j_neimand,,2892.741,2893.262,Correct.
1990.90-622,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2893.262,2896.254,"But you don't take that position with respect to a consent search, am I right?"
1990.90-622,3,36397,michael_j_neimand,,2896.254,2896.824,Correct.
1990.90-622,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2901.847,2908.79,But then you are conceding that the search pursuant to consent to search a car is not coextensive with the Ross search?
1990.90-622,3,36397,michael_j_neimand,,2908.79,2911.073,Not as complete as a Ross case.
1990.90-622,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2911.073,2911.474,Right.
1990.90-622,3,36397,michael_j_neimand,,2911.474,2915.666,"Because we will not destruct the personal property, because it would not be reasonable to assume that."
1990.90-622,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2915.666,2922.36,What happens... would he then be required to say I want to search the car and that bag?
1990.90-622,3,36397,michael_j_neimand,,2922.36,2923.629,"No, not at all."
1990.90-622,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2923.629,2924.711,Why not?
1990.90-622,3,36397,michael_j_neimand,,2924.711,2928.164,Because it's the same... the concept is the same.
1990.90-622,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2931.236,2935.169,"Well, the concept is it's one thing to search the car, and it's one thing to search the bag."
1990.90-622,3,36397,michael_j_neimand,,2945.027,2946.637,--The bag is now part of the car.
1990.90-622,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2975.367,2977.658,What about my scenario?
1990.90-622,3,36397,michael_j_neimand,,2977.658,2979.619,It's the same.
1990.90-622,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2991.666,2996.479,"At one time you see the bag was right there by the seat, and now you say the bag you had to search around for."
1990.90-622,3,36397,michael_j_neimand,,2996.479,2996.949,No.
1990.90-622,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2997.841,3000.963,There's no evidence in the record that says you had to search for that bag.
1990.90-622,3,36397,michael_j_neimand,,3000.963,3002.022,"No, I'm not saying you had to search for the bag."
1990.90-622,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3003.774,3004.495,Right.
1990.90-622,3,36397,michael_j_neimand,,3004.495,3007.137,And he went right to the bag and he opened it.
1990.90-622,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3007.137,3013.161,"Well, why didn't he say to him I want to search that car and I want to search that bag in particular?"
1990.90-622,3,36397,michael_j_neimand,,3013.161,3016.163,"He could have, but under this Court's previous holdings he did not have to."
1990.90-622,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3016.163,3017.165,It would have been clearer.
1990.90-622,3,36397,michael_j_neimand,,3017.165,3022.129,"It would have been clearer, but it wouldn't have... it wasn't required under the Constitution."
1990.90-622,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3024.11,3025.089,It would have been clearer?
1990.90-622,3,36397,michael_j_neimand,,3025.089,3026.101,Obviously.
1990.90-622,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3038.468,3041.45,I think as close as we're going to get is clearer.
1990.90-622,3,36397,michael_j_neimand,,3041.45,3043.431,"That's as close as I will get, Your Honor."
1990.90-622,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3103.161,3105.713,But on the facts... I can't... maybe I'm mixing it up with another case.
1990.90-622,3,36397,michael_j_neimand,,3108.945,3110.487,--That was in the record.
1990.90-622,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3110.487,3113.967,So you think it's likely that if he had refused consent he could have just left?
1990.90-622,3,36397,michael_j_neimand,,3113.967,3119.841,"The finding, though, was that the consent was voluntary and that was never challenged below."
1990.90-622,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3119.841,3121.733,But that's not an answer to my question.
1990.90-622,3,36397,michael_j_neimand,,3121.733,3125.336,"I'm... there is no answer to that question, because--"
1990.90-622,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3125.336,3126.466,"Well, the answer is pretty obvious."
1990.90-622,3,36397,michael_j_neimand,,3126.466,3134.19,"--Well, but unfortunately we do not know because they never testified, and so we don't even know in this case."
1990.90-622,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3135.482,3137.245,"Thank you, Mr. Neimand."
