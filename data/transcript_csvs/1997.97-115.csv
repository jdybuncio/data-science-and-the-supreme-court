1997.97-115,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.118,"We'll hear argument next in Number 97 115, Margaret Kawaauhau v. Paul Geiger."
1997.97-115,0,37256,norman_w_pressman,,20.115,25.007,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.97-115,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,47.294,61.441,"Well, Mr. Pressman, when you say that there was a finding that he intentionally administered substandard care, is that any different than a finding that the... that his standard, the standard of care which he recognized was negligent?"
1997.97-115,0,37256,norman_w_pressman,,61.441,68.898,"The distinction here, Your Honor, is that Dr. Geiger knew the standard of care."
1997.97-115,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,86.54,95.176,"Well, I'm not sure I follow you, because you could say that about any number of things where you talk about medical malpractice."
1997.97-115,0,37256,norman_w_pressman,,116.948,121.382,"--The distinction here, Your Honor, is that this is not a case of a slip of the scalpel."
1997.97-115,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,130.228,140.707,"Well, what if you have a driver who intentionally puts his car in reverse and doesn't look back to see what's behind him and drives over somebody."
1997.97-115,0,37256,norman_w_pressman,,155.485,158.746,In that... I would agree with that... that--
1997.97-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,158.746,159.457,You would agree.
1997.97-115,0,37256,norman_w_pressman,,159.457,160.228,"--description, Justice O'Connor--"
1997.97-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,160.228,161.4,Yes.
1997.97-115,0,37256,norman_w_pressman,,161.4,166.983,"--that if somebody intentionally says, I'm going to put my car in reverse and I'm going to drive back and I don't care who's there, I think that is intentional."
1997.97-115,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,170.127,180.362,"You know, I just find it hard to believe that that's what Congress had in mind in writing this provision for exclusion under the bankruptcy law."
1997.97-115,0,37256,norman_w_pressman,,180.362,184.346,"--Well, my response to that, Your Honor, would be twofold."
1997.97-115,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,187.468,191.94,"Well, I find Tinker a little hard to understand myself."
1997.97-115,0,37256,norman_w_pressman,,197.464,216.497,"--Well, Your Honor, I would compare what happened here... and let me start by saying, I think what's hard initially to understand about this case is that people assume that a physician would always act according to his duty and would never intentionally disregard it."
1997.97-115,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,233.237,243.885,Do you think that there's anything in this record that indicates that the doctor intended that the petitioner lose her leg--
1997.97-115,0,37256,norman_w_pressman,,243.885,244.344,No.
1997.97-115,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,244.344,249.059,--or suffer some serious health loss?
1997.97-115,0,37256,norman_w_pressman,,249.059,249.529,No.
1997.97-115,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,268.752,296.072,"--said candidly that you are not contending that he meant to hurt... that the doctor meant to hurt this woman and yet you say that the Tinker case is helpful to you, and that I don't understand, so... I thought Tinker was a clear case of intending what in those days was a very grave offense against a man's property."
1997.97-115,0,37256,norman_w_pressman,,296.072,299.153,"--Your Honor, let me address that point."
1997.97-115,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,333.054,348.654,"Well, but the trouble in Tinker was that the act which the defendant performed could not, as a matter of law or as a matter of definition, be performed without the necessary consequence of the kind of injury for which the law allowed recovery."
1997.97-115,0,37256,norman_w_pressman,,383.457,394.954,"Justice Souter, I believe that Peter Halford, the expert defin... deposition, the expert who testified both in Hawaii and in the bankruptcy court, testified to that fact."
1997.97-115,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,402.751,404.771,There's... I don't think there's any question in anyone's mind that it did.
1997.97-115,0,37256,norman_w_pressman,,420.243,429.91,"And I think the point of your question and Justice Ginsburg's question is, does the term willful apply to the injury or does it apply to the act--"
1997.97-115,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,429.91,430.751,"Well, how--"
1997.97-115,0,37256,norman_w_pressman,,430.751,432.23,--and our point is--
1997.97-115,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,432.23,437.705,--How can you say that an injury was willful if you're not referring to the act by which it was caused?
1997.97-115,0,37256,norman_w_pressman,,440.647,443.86,"--Your Honor, the definition of injury is twofold."
1997.97-115,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,455.498,459.459,How can an injury mean the action which causes the harm?
1997.97-115,0,37256,norman_w_pressman,,460.451,466.344,"In the phrase, for instance, his injury to the painting, it is the act and I believe--"
1997.97-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,466.344,466.885,"Well, his--"
1997.97-115,0,37256,norman_w_pressman,,471.887,480.893,"--Your Honor, let me cite the definition from the Merriam Webster Dictionary."
1997.97-115,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,502.088,502.709,What dictionary was that?
1997.97-115,0,37256,norman_w_pressman,,503.43,511.557,"--That is the Merriam Webster Dictionary and a similar dictionary... a similar definition, Your Honor, appears in the Oxford Second Edition."
1997.97-115,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,511.557,521.181,"--If one asks, what injuries did you suffer, well, I broke my collarbone, I dislocated my hip, that's what one thinks of as the injuries."
1997.97-115,0,37256,norman_w_pressman,,521.181,534.071,"And I believe if I were starting with a clean slate in this case and I didn't have the definition that we had in Tinker, I think I'd have to... I do have to fight that battle."
1997.97-115,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,534.071,563.259,"I mean, the problem I think that at least you have is, this is not your... the tort in your case is not an intentional tort on the Restatement's definition of intentional torts, I take it, and if that is so... if that is so, and I... it seems so, then either the word willful means to pick up intentional torts, in which case you'd lose, or somehow willful extends beyond intentional torts in the way you suggest, in which case you might win."
1997.97-115,0,37256,norman_w_pressman,,595.861,610.36,"I believe that in order to rule in our favor, one has to look at the term willful as meaning the same thing that this Court held, that willful means voluntary."
1997.97-115,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,627.263,640.211,"But then it would work without the special provision for, I knew I got into that car when I imbibed much too much and I happened to kill or maim someone."
1997.97-115,0,37256,norman_w_pressman,,653.92,663.638,"And Your Honor, in 1946 the Eighth Circuit in Harrison v. Walker held that drunk driving was a willful and malicious injury."
1997.97-115,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,674.503,684.941,"Yes, but now we have a specific provision doing that and, if malpractice should work the same way, one would expect a similarly specific provision."
1997.97-115,0,37256,norman_w_pressman,,684.941,699.654,"Our position, Justice Ginsburg, is that the Congress reenacted the identical language in the Bankruptcy Code of 1978 and therefore the same interpretations apply."
1997.97-115,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,706.076,713.992,But you run up against that terrible problem that Tinker was a deliberate trespass on another man's property.
1997.97-115,0,37256,norman_w_pressman,,717.753,719.285,"Criminal conversation, Your Honor."
1997.97-115,1,34492,laura_k_grandy,,1429.711,1435.855,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
1997.97-115,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1485.212,1495.869,Are there some instances in which reckless conduct is so reckless that you can apply the definition of willful and malicious to it?
1997.97-115,1,34492,laura_k_grandy,,1495.869,1497.24,"--No, Your Honor."
1997.97-115,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1522.756,1534.695,"And the case where the man throws the firecracker into the gasoline laden basement and the explosion injures the fellow worker, that's... is... how does that come out, in your view?"
1997.97-115,1,34492,laura_k_grandy,,1534.695,1536.915,"--Your Honor, you're referring to the Hartley case, I believe, which--"
1997.97-115,2,37256,norman_w_pressman,,2329.514,2334.689,"Mr. Chief Justice, unless there are any questions I will--"
1997.97-115,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2334.689,2336.79,I don't mean to be... I'm just curious.
1997.97-115,2,37256,norman_w_pressman,,2338.252,2339.212,--Kawaauhau.
1997.97-115,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2339.212,2340.093,Thank you.
1997.97-115,2,37256,norman_w_pressman,,2343.715,2346.598,Mr. Kaw... I've had trouble pronouncing it.
1997.97-115,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2349.209,2350.218,"Well, you--"
1997.97-115,2,37256,norman_w_pressman,,2350.218,2350.799,Kawaauhau.
1997.97-115,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2352.211,2354.371,--I'm sure you know better than we do.
1997.97-115,2,37256,norman_w_pressman,,2354.371,2356.224,--I may be using the St. Louis pronunciation.
1997.97-115,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2356.423,2357.494,Very well.
1997.97-115,2,37256,norman_w_pressman,,2359.539,2360.289,"Thank you, Your Honor."
