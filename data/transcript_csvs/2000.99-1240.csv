2000.99-1240,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.318,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-1240, the Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Patricia Garrett."
2000.99-1240,0,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,9.341,13.948,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court--"
2000.99-1240,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1517.935,1526.716,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.99-1240,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1575.38,1578.014,"But has... Mr. Gottesman, has any court bought that argument?"
2000.99-1240,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1582.225,1591.81,"--So far there is one district court that has bought the argument, Pierce v. King, 918 F. Supp. 932."
2000.99-1240,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1597.495,1603.161,"--This would be an argument that could be made only by the State, not by a county or a city, I take it."
2000.99-1240,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1603.161,1627.144,"Well, no, because a county or a city... if you take the Fourteenth Amendment away, the Fourteenth Amendment argument... the Eleventh Amendment argument is available, of course, only to a State, but if you say that the ADA is not grounded in the Fourteenth Amendment and courts later hold that it is not grounded in the Commerce Clause, then it is not appropriate legislation directed to either, as we understand it."
2000.99-1240,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1627.144,1634.789,I would think that if you lose the Commerce Clause challenge the least of your worries is the States.
2000.99-1240,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1640.772,1646.444,"Well, except only... title II applies only to the States, and so it, losing title II is losing... I'm sorry."
2000.99-1240,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1656.568,1664.478,"Mr. Gottesman, I'm not sure that the record here presents much in the way of a title II claim."
2000.99-1240,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1701.568,1702.065,"Well, no."
2000.99-1240,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1800.1,1802.178,And how does one usually determine that?
2000.99-1240,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1825.179,1832.008,"Well, surely it's the case that when we see that there could be no rational basis, that will fuel our conclusion."
2000.99-1240,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1832.008,1832.72,I'm not sure it advances the ball.
2000.99-1240,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1835.088,1845.2,"But the irrational purpose prong of Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence is not limited only to those cases where it is irrational, where the decision itself would have to be irrational."
2000.99-1240,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1857.268,1857.268,I understand.
2000.99-1240,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1857.268,1860.657,--that what really motivated them was hostility to the class.
2000.99-1240,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1860.657,1867.953,"I just don't know how you prove that, except by looking at whether there is, in fact, a rational basis."
2000.99-1240,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1869.826,1880.44,"Well, that problem of proof, Your Honor, is precisely why Congress found the need to adopt prophylaxis here, and... but I want to, before I get to that, to lay out just what Congress--"
2000.99-1240,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1880.44,1888.852,--That puts the cart before the horse. They have to have shown unconstitutional State action before they can use the prophylaxis.
2000.99-1240,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1888.852,1888.852,"--Correct, so--"
2000.99-1240,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1888.852,1903.665,"And you're saying the unconstitutional State action is going to be based upon not the realities out there, whether there was a rational basis, but whether, even though there was a rational basis, the States somehow were acting out of irrational hatred of the disabled."
2000.99-1240,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1905.602,1906.053,--Well--
2000.99-1240,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1906.053,1907.27,Did Congress establish it?
2000.99-1240,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1907.27,1907.781,"--Yes, it did."
2000.99-1240,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1907.781,1909.173,Tell me how.
2000.99-1240,1,35889,michael_h_gottesman,,1909.173,1913.136,What it did was find that these kinds of motivated actions are widespread.
2000.99-1240,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2451.158,2462.738,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.99-1240,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2547.251,2549.095,"But General Waxman, it's not magic words."
2000.99-1240,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2574.8,2575.058,--I absolutely--
2000.99-1240,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2575.058,2580.229,--And the Federal balance is altered far more under the Fourteenth Amendment than it is under the Commerce Clause.
2000.99-1240,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2580.229,2603.522,"--Justice Kennedy, I agree, and I would say therefore that the question fairly put is whether the Disabilities Act sweeps more broadly than Congress could reasonably have deemed necessary to remedy and prevent the constitutional problem it found applying this Court's definition of the standard, and what it found were four things."
2000.99-1240,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2622.146,2649.18,"General Waxman, do you agree with Mr. Gottesman that if the... supposing there emerged a 55-year retirement law, rational basis, relied on in Kimel, do you agree with Mr. Gottesman's suggestion that if a court could be persuaded that when the legislature acted, that they really had it in for people over 55, that that would be invalid?"
2000.99-1240,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2649.18,2668.301,"No, I... well, I don't think a court would... a court would not find that invalid, applying a rational basis standard, because this Court has had... has held that under rational basis review of legislation one looks at whether there is a conceivable rational basis that would support a distinction, and that, in fact--"
2000.99-1240,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2668.301,2693.906,"Well, but now, I don't want to put words in Mr. Gottesman's mouth, but I understood him to say that sure, rational basis, but if you could prove that although there was a rational basis for requiring people to retire at 55, if the legislature that enacted that had really been motivated by a dislike for people over 55, then it would... there would be a violation of equal protection."
2000.99-1240,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2693.906,2699.037,"--Well, Justice... Mr. Chief Justice, this Court has made clear that as a paradigm of--"
2000.99-1240,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2699.037,2701.773,Are you in the process of answering my question?
2000.99-1240,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3386.808,3396.089,"Three brief points, Your Honor."
2000.99-1240,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3423.933,3425.529,And how do you explain the results?
2000.99-1240,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3448.908,3452.05,"--Your Honor, I would disagree respectfully."
2000.99-1240,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3463.202,3476.243,"I thought under classic rational basis review the court was not only to listen to the Government's argument, but if there's any basis it could conceive... and surely there were bases that could be conceived--"
2000.99-1240,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3476.243,3476.741,I--
2000.99-1240,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3476.741,3479.411,--that were not driven by animus--
2000.99-1240,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3479.411,3484.967,"--To be honest with you, I've never... I'm not aware that that is the Court's rule, that the Court's job is to conceive of rational basis."
2000.99-1240,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3579.286,3581.407,"Thank you, Mr. Sutton."
2000.99-1240,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3581.407,3587.283,"--Well, if you have a minute, I would like to go back to equal protection of the law."
2000.99-1240,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3619.614,3621.373,"--I understand exactly what you're saying, Your Honor."
2000.99-1240,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3621.373,3621.529,--Yes.
2000.99-1240,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3621.529,3627.907,But to apply the test you're suggesting is one that requires the overruling of City of Boerne.
2000.99-1240,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3629.501,3648.837,"City of Boerne, if I find City of Boerne ambiguous on this point, on the point of whether it's going to... whether a court would find a violation, or whether there is a violation, if I find it ambiguous on that point, can't I pre crank in my institutional considerations?"
2000.99-1240,3,33001,jeffrey_s_sutton,,3648.837,3649.749,"--No, Your Honor."
2000.99-1240,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3675.011,3676.725,"Thank you, Mr. Sutton."
