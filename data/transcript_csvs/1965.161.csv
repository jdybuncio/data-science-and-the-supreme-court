1965.161,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,0.0,39.869,"Mr. Justice Black, if the Court please."
1965.161,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,789.835,794.526,Does 23 (b) require verification by the plaintiff?
1965.161,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,794.526,798.059,"It does not in so many words, Your Honor."
1965.161,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,824.257,825.541,"So, you did not cite that in here?"
1965.161,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,825.541,826.932,We did not sir.
1965.161,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,826.932,827.857,What?
1965.161,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,827.857,833.413,"882, 137 Federal 882 but we would say to do that question --"
1965.161,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,833.413,835.089,137 Federal?
1965.161,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,835.089,835.663,Federal.
1965.161,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,835.663,836.52,That's a second?
1965.161,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,836.52,836.948,"No, sir."
1965.161,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,840.607,846.09,"But apart from that 1905 decision, you know of anything else that --"
1965.161,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,846.09,851.531,There has been some District Court cases which have held that in attorney may verify.
1965.161,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,851.531,855.929,A 1905 decision wouldn't be construing this Rule?
1965.161,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,855.929,862.893,It was construing the old Equity Rule 94 which was the predecessor of Rule 23 (b).
1965.161,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,903.366,913.081,"We have verification by counsel that might have some meaning even in the context of this Rule, don't you agree with that?"
1965.161,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,913.081,924.621,"Yes, it might, Your Honor, but under those circumstances, that if in any case counsel might verify then Rule 23 (b) and the derivative case would add absolutely nothing to Rule 11."
1965.161,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,932.781,936.812,"Well, it's a little more to 23 (b) than that as I read it."
1965.161,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,981.71,992.801,Only in one respect and that is when she was asked whether what fact she had supporting the allegation that this was not a collusive suit.
1965.161,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1037.251,1039.968,Sometimes we have difficulty within ourselves.
1965.161,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,1039.968,1045.056,I think it is rather difficult concept to understand as a matter of fact.
1965.161,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1045.056,1047.086,"But if you do get time, I'd like to know --"
1965.161,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,1047.086,1047.665,"I shall, Your Honor."
1965.161,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1047.665,1052.719,-- the specs generally in which the affidavit is contradicted.
1965.161,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,1052.719,1071.562,"It would be our position that the problem, a plaintiff stockholder and particularly a small plaintiff stockholder faces in bringing a derivative suit are sufficiently difficult without imposing in a further test which we do not believe is required by the history and purpose of Rule 23 (b)."
1965.161,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1071.562,1077.946,(Inaudible)
1965.161,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,1077.946,1101.171,"I think the case is hold, in effect, Mr. Justice Black, that a derivative suit by a stockholder is by that circumstance on behalf of all similarly situated stockholders who might have a right to assert that the corporation should have sued against wrongdoing on the part of officers and directors."
1965.161,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1101.171,1107.772,(Inaudible)
1965.161,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,1107.772,1117.947,"I can't specifically point any at the moment but I know that there are indications that where at one stockholder brings a derivative suit, it has a class suit aspect to it."
1965.161,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1117.947,1120.438,(Inaudible)
1965.161,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,1120.438,1120.928,That's --
1965.161,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1120.928,1122.771,(Inaudible)
1965.161,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,1122.771,1124.725,"I don't believe there is, Your Honor."
1965.161,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1124.725,1125.353,(Inaudible)
1965.161,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1125.353,1126.762,For the class for the corporation?
1965.161,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,1126.762,1134.918,It is for the corporation and the cases hold that the corporation is an indispensable party because any recovery will accrue to the corporation.
1965.161,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1136.099,1141.836,Where the (Inaudible) affidavit relates to class action?
1965.161,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,1141.836,1142.966,"No, it does not, Your Honor."
1965.161,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1160.791,1166.142,I look at the Rule (Inaudible) statute?
1965.161,0,40747,richard_f_watt,,1166.142,1190.33,We held our Rule 23 (b) Your Honor set out at the end of our brief at page 58 and it is described as an action brought to enforce a secondary right on the part of one or more shareholders in an association and so on because the association refuses to enforce the rights which may properly be asserted by it.
1965.161,1,41072,samuel_w_block,,1882.094,1887.575,"Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court."
