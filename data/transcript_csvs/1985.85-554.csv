1985.85-554,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,17.243,"Mr. Lauber, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1985.85-554,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,17.243,26.567,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-554,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,63.532,72.809,"Well, Mr. Lauber, you refer to the Court enunciating a principle, and it was just a sentence in Justice Stone's opinion, wasn't it?"
1985.85-554,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,72.809,80.503,"Well, that's all it began its life as, but it has since taken on a kind of talismanic quality in tax jurisprudence."
1985.85-554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,235.977,237.789,"Mr. Lauber, can I interrupt you?"
1985.85-554,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,246.305,259.983,"My understanding is that the regular jackpots tend to be in smaller amounts and are won much more frequently, and I don't believe the Nevada Gaming Commission regulates regular jackpots, only progressive jackpots."
1985.85-554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,267.028,272.261,"--The regular jackpots, they just do that on a cash basis, then, presumably?"
1985.85-554,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,272.261,274.134,--I couldn't be sure of that.
1985.85-554,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,307.784,311.477,"You demonstrate great familiarity, Mr. Lauber."
1985.85-554,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,311.477,315.38,"Well, I have read the record."
1985.85-554,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,320.002,329.069,"I'm told that they bring it to you and pay you at the window, not at the cashier's window but right at the machine."
1985.85-554,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,329.069,329.89,"Oh, did they come back and--"
1985.85-554,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,329.89,332.852,So that everybody can see you and they can take pictures.
1985.85-554,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,333.23,334.922,--Now you know who--
1985.85-554,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,334.922,335.984,That is what I am told.
1985.85-554,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,336.523,341.866,--But it doesn't actually come out of the machine.
1985.85-554,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,390.778,411.903,"Mr. Lauber, how does the Internal Revenue Service treat funds that are set aside by insurance companies out of premiums to pay off potential expected claims, and is there some correlation between the rules for that and the rules applicable here?"
1985.85-554,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,411.903,415.266,"Well, there is a lot to say about that."
1985.85-554,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,466.878,480.656,Is there any other broad category of business deductions that would potentially be affected by a decision here on the application of the all events test?
1985.85-554,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,480.656,483.74,"Well, that could depend on how the decision was written."
1985.85-554,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,615.837,618.138,Let me ask just one other preliminary question.
1985.85-554,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,633.86,634.679,We agree with that.
1985.85-554,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,685.932,693.636,"Why should the identity of the eventual payee matter, as long as it's certain there will be a payee?"
1985.85-554,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,701.573,709.788,"Well, I would agree with the premise that the ultimate identity of the payee is not important."
1985.85-554,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,719.075,724.189,"No, but you know that someone will, under the Nevada gaming regulations--"
1985.85-554,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,724.189,734.514,"--There is a probability that every time somebody pulls the machine programmed to pay off at one in 10,000, he has a one in 10,000 chance of winning."
1985.85-554,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,738.828,746.713,"--Well, Congress has made the very same kind of a determination in its treatment for insurance reserves."
1985.85-554,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,757.262,770.669,"--Well, I would agree it is quite similar in economic terms, but from a tax point of view they're very different because Congress has authorized insurance companies to set up these reserves for very sound reasons."
1985.85-554,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,813.826,832.83,"Supposing, Mr. Lauber, that in this case it was demonstrated beyond peradventure, so to speak, on the basis of past performance how many people come in, what the machines are set for, but there was going to be a payoff, a certain number of payoffs on this jackpot within a given year."
1985.85-554,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,834.693,846.518,"I think it wouldn't really matter if the probability were based on the laws of averages, and the odds of winning, on past experience."
1985.85-554,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,856.545,866.633,"Supposing just hypothetically that the Government, surely mistakenly in your view, had stipulated in the trial court that it was certain that this thing would happen within the year."
1985.85-554,0,16461,albert_g_lauber_jr,,871.385,874.948,It certainly would happen within the next succeeding year?
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,1810.593,1813.063,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1864.969,1870.182,What kind of transactions would these 20-year deferrals be?
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,1870.182,1871.354,I beg your pardon?
1985.85-554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1871.354,1873.127,What kind of transactions would these--
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,1873.127,1885.743,"Well, one example, there's a Mooney Aircraft case in which an aircraft manufacturer gave a bond at the time it sold a plane which was to mature at the time the plane was retired from service."
1985.85-554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1905.966,1908.309,"--That isn't a very common transaction, is it?"
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,1908.309,1908.667,"No, Your Honor."
1985.85-554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1924.04,1934.174,"Is that money that's taken from these machines every night, is that put in the pool with all the other money, or is that segregated?"
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,1934.174,1942.96,"Well, Justice Marshall, for the years in question here, 1973 to 1977, there was no identifiable fund."
1985.85-554,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2019.27,2020.632,Where do we find that?
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2020.632,2033.709,"Your Honor, that is at pages 15 and 16 of the Joint Appendix, the Motion of the United States for Summary Judgment on page 15, the affidavit of counsel on page 16."
1985.85-554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2054.943,2056.526,"Before you leave that, I want to be sure I follow you."
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2056.526,2057.016,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2057.016,2065.351,"You referred as to page 42 which is Plaintiff's Memorandum of Contentions of Fact and Law, Contentions of Fact... this is a government document, is it?"
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2065.351,2066.901,"Your Honor, no."
1985.85-554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2091.688,2093.769,"So, that the defendant relies on that?"
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2093.769,2094.93,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2094.93,2096.35,And that's the government's--
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2096.35,2097.171,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2109.4,2111.623,--But it says it's a fixed liability which cannot be avoided.
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2116.135,2117.136,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1985.85-554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2117.136,2118.488,Isn't that right?
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2118.488,2123.271,"--No... well, it is a fixed liability as of the time it's accrued."
1985.85-554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2127.432,2128.644,Stick to my question.
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2128.644,2129.225,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2129.225,2134.968,"If you went out of business, say the place burned down and you totally terminated business, would the liability have to be paid or not?"
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2134.968,2140.892,The liability would not have to be paid but the tax benefit rule would require that--
1985.85-554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2140.892,2142.051,That's quite a different point.
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2142.051,2142.712,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2142.712,2146.596,"So, it is not correct that there is a fixed liability which cannot be avoided."
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2147.955,2166.799,"Well, Your Honor, for purposes of the all events test, we say... in fact, the government... and this Court conceded in its reply memo that contention of events like that, remote, speculative events are not to be considered in determining the snapshop issue of whether or not there's a fixed liability."
1985.85-554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2173.353,2181.999,"They may not disagree with you, but you have just acknowledged to me that it is not correct, that this is a fixed liability which cannot be avoided, because it would be avoided by going out of business."
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2181.999,2192.758,"Well, we put summary judgment evidence into the record, Your Honor, concerning the revenues of the casino."
1985.85-554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2211.608,2221.336,"Well, can you give me another example of a proper accrual under the all events test in which the liability would be avoided by going out of business or going into bankruptcy?"
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2226.469,2231.373,"Your Honor, I'm not saying that the existence of the liability would be terminated."
1985.85-554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2234.916,2239.078,"If you went out of business, to whom would the liability be owed?"
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2239.078,2243.171,If you go out of business the liability will not he paid to anyone.
1985.85-554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2243.171,2244.609,To whom would it be owed?
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2244.609,2248.503,"At the time it's accrued, it is owed to a player."
1985.85-554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2252.046,2255.799,Would it be owed to anyone at the time you went out of business?
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2255.799,2256.989,"At the time you went out of business, no, Your Honor."
1985.85-554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2310.655,2312.208,"But you say, in any situation."
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2328.377,2334.831,If his assets are... if he is in bankruptcy and if his assets are insufficient to satisfy... if it's a contractual liability--
1985.85-554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2334.831,2336.643,I'm not talking about satisfying the liability.
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2362.361,2366.813,"--But, Your Honor, I am afraid I must disagree with your premise, and that is, you said there is no liability when he does it."
1985.85-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2684.385,2694.542,"Suppose an accrual basis taxpayer signs a promissory note that, in one year that's payable, six months later in another year."
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2697.164,2700.116,"--If that's an enforceable obligation in year one, he may accrue that."
1985.85-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2700.116,2715.884,"Well, what if at the time the payment comes along and he claims that it was a fraud, and it's determined that he never did owe the money, he's relieved of his obligation?"
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2715.884,2721.029,"In the second year the tax benefit rule, I believe, would require that he would take any income that--"
1985.85-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2721.029,2725.811,"What it means is that it is void ab initio, he never had an obligation?"
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2725.811,2729.445,"--Well, I'm responding to how the Internal Revenue Service would construe it."
1985.85-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2729.445,2743.833,"Well, I know, but I would think in that case, and according to their argument, that you would never be able to accrue that liability because of the possibility that it might be a fraudulent transaction and he never had an obligation."
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2743.833,2745.315,"Well, as I said earlier--"
1985.85-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2745.315,2746.845,Wouldn't that be their argument?
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2746.845,2748.317,"--I'm not sure, Your Honor."
1985.85-554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2760.264,2761.495,"Well, there's another one."
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2768.701,2769.25,All right.
1985.85-554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2776.415,2780.207,That's not my question.
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2782.258,2782.638,All right.
1985.85-554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2798.48,2803.483,How could someone determine that that is carried out?
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2809.617,2814.72,"Your Honor, the Nevada gambling industry is one of the most highly regulated industries in this country."
1985.85-554,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2931.386,2943.945,"I don't know that your case is so much different than Brown on that percentage, because they have a stipulated percentage in Brown of 23 percent on the basis of past experience."
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2946.807,2951.089,"--Well, Justice Rehnquist, our probability is 100 percent of the amount shown."
1985.85-554,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2958.064,2959.995,But it's an estimate as to when you will pay them?
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2959.995,2962.767,"Well, we don't estimate when we're going to pay it."
1985.85-554,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2970.233,2976.236,"Well, but supposing it came out that the retrospective calculation showed 14 months."
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2977.836,2979.418,"--No, Your Honor."
1985.85-554,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2983.141,2986.142,"Well, supposing this thing had showed 26 months."
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2987.594,2989.284,You deduct it in year one.
1985.85-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2990.526,2992.146,But only the amount that's shown at the end of year one?
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,2992.146,2995.699,"--Only the amount shown at the end of year one, that's correct, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.85-554,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3054.806,3068.166,"Mr. Lilienstern, as I understand it the Internal Revenue Service has regulatory authority to determine whether the accrual of counting system is properly reflecting income."
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3068.166,3070.087,"That's correct, Justice O'Connor."
1985.85-554,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3070.427,3076.13,How does that authority fit into this question?
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3076.13,3081.433,"--Well, in our case they have not challenged that our accrual clearly reflects income."
1985.85-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3230.564,3236.548,"Well, what if a casino does lose its license for some other transgression?"
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3240.302,3246.874,"--If the casino is sold, it is the policy of the Gaming Commission... that's typically what happens."
1985.85-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3259.503,3260.554,And then what happens?
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3260.554,3271.812,"If it's transferred, either the Jackpots must be paid prior to the transfer, which it sounds like in your example it would not be, or they must be assumed by the purchaser of the casino."
1985.85-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3274.173,3293.057,"But... this may never happen, but if a casino just decided... a corporate entity owning a casino just wanted to liquidate and they just decided to sell all assets and liquidate, what about the machines?"
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3293.057,3295.367,And there's no surviving entity?
1985.85-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3297.458,3303.802,Say they put the machines right on the auction block and they're bought.
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3307.856,3317.67,"--The liabilities are not assumed on these machines, and the tax consequences would be, of course, as earlier described, they would take into income in the year of sale any amounts previously deducted."
1985.85-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3320.432,3324.105,"Well, what if a casino buys a bunch of slot machines and they don't pay for them."
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3333.963,3336.783,--So that you can no longer have them in play?
1985.85-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3336.783,3337.575,Yes.
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3337.575,3339.796,"Well, there's no remedy available."
1985.85-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3339.796,3346.511,"Well, there's no... there's certainly... why should you accrue in those situations?"
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3346.511,3348.601,"Because, Justice White--"
1985.85-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3348.601,3350.172,"I mean, just--"
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3350.172,3357.398,--The all events test and the fixing of liability is not dependent on the kind of remote contingency you just described.
1985.85-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3357.398,3363.121,"--Well, the liability, as Justice Stevens pointed out to you, what's really contingent is the liability."
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3363.121,3367.754,"Well, Your Honor, the liability is fixed."
1985.85-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3376.669,3384.906,"You think it's fixed because the state law says that, look, George, you must accrue this money and pay it out if and when somebody ever wins it?"
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3384.906,3391.669,--And you may not remove your machines and you may not sell your casino and avoid the liabilities.
1985.85-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3391.669,3393.792,"If certain events happen, nobody is ever going to win it."
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3393.792,3401.045,"That's right, but that affects the payment rather than the imposition of the liability, under our view of the case."
1985.85-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3401.045,3402.856,"Well, it affects... surely it affects both?"
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3402.856,3413.024,"Well, again, if a company goes into bankruptcy and has insufficient assets to pay its liabilities, it's in no different situation than we are there."
1985.85-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3413.024,3416.887,"Well, except that you... except your statement shows that it is."
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3418.726,3420.867,It they can't pay them.
1985.85-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3434.638,3435.908,But everybody agrees there was a liability?
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3435.908,3438.011,--But everybody agrees there's a liability.
1985.85-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3438.011,3439.27,"Well, not here."
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3439.27,3440.182,"Well, no."
1985.85-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3440.182,3444.924,That's the question in the case.
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3444.924,3445.896,"I understand, Your Honor."
1985.85-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3477.077,3479.368,"So, a casino operator could say,"
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3496.058,3502.912,"--A casino operator will probably lose his license and be fined up to $250,000."
1985.85-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3502.912,3504.793,"I know, but he wouldn't be liable."
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3505.995,3506.804,Well--
1985.85-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3506.804,3511.508,He wouldn't have to pay the accrual.
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3511.508,3523.406,"--We have addressed that, Your Honor, by showing how the progressive slot machine productions are immaterial compared to the total wealth of... and revenues of the casino."
1985.85-554,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3530.79,3534.754,"I agree with that, but I can imagine that they'd want to sell their slot machines."
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3544.979,3549.824,"Before they take the machines off the floor, they must address the issue of payment."
1985.85-554,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3558.479,3560.4,--They couldn't sell them to a casino in New Jersey?
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3560.4,3563.853,Not without first discharging the jackpot liability.
1985.85-554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3563.853,3566.484,"Well, how would you find out who's going to win?"
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3566.484,3569.176,"I beg your pardon, Justice Marshall?"
1985.85-554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3569.176,3570.748,How are you going to find out who's going to win?
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3573.111,3576.554,"You mean, once someone has won it?"
1985.85-554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3577.323,3579.156,"No, nobody has won."
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3579.156,3581.797,"--Oh, you have to keep them in play until they're won."
1985.85-554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3581.797,3586.189,I thought you said that they can sell them to Atlantic City?
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3586.189,3587.841,"That's correct, Justice Marshall, but--"
1985.85-554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3587.841,3591.334,What do they do then on their federal taxes?
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3591.334,3602.701,"--If they sell them to Atlantic City before delivering them to Atlantic City, they must first make provision for paying those progressive jackpots to their customers in Las Vegas."
1985.85-554,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3602.701,3604.03,How are they going to do that?
1985.85-554,1,37491,o_clayton_lilienstern,,3604.03,3606.512,"Keep them in play until they're won, Justice Marshall."
1985.85-554,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3611.757,3615.159,"Thank you, gentlemen."
