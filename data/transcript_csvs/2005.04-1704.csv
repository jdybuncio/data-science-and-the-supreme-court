2005.04-1704,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,12.002,"We'll hear argument first this morning in 04-1704, Chrysler versus... DaimlerChrysler versus Cuno, and 04-1724, Wilkins versus Cuno."
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,13.029,16.294,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,103.757,108.867,"Mr. Olson, who would have... who would have standing?"
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,118.609,120.964,"I'm not sure, Justice Ginsburg."
2005.04-1704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,152.377,154.815,"You think there has to be somebody who can challenge it, though."
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,154.815,156.575,"--No, we don't think that at all."
2005.04-1704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,157.336,159.43,"Some of our opinions say that, don't they, that--"
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,159.43,159.941,--Well--
2005.04-1704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,159.941,161.535,--it's not necessarily true that there has to be--
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,161.535,171.443,"--What... Justice Scalia, I think the strongest statement is in the Valley Forge case, at page 489, where the Court said,"
2005.04-1704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,210.252,223.599,"Mr. Olson, I had asked you the question, because I wanted to know whether this case was distinguishable from Flast in that regard, although I recognize your quotation from Valley Forge."
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,233.673,247.614,"--Well, nonetheless, the Court made that distinction in the Flast case with respect to the Establishment Clause, and, specifically, the spending and taxing powers exercised by Congress."
2005.04-1704,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,310.701,312.628,With respect to the claims that are before us.
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,319.598,329.517,"--We believed, at the time, that there was standing with respect to the property taxes... the municipal taxpayers, with respect to the property taxes."
2005.04-1704,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,330.467,330.861,Right.
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,330.861,331.528,--basis for the--
2005.04-1704,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,331.528,350.861,"So, why isn't... these... why aren't the present claims brought under... you know, within the same nucleus of operative facts, the same sort of supplemental jurisdiction that allows the Federal Court to consider purely State law claims if they have jurisdiction of another related Federal claim?"
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,350.861,355.554,"--The Court has never treated Article III standing that way, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.04-1704,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,381.258,386.55,"But just to get... I mean, you don't dispute the standing of the municipal taxpayers on the property tax issue?"
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,386.55,389.072,"--We did not, and do not."
2005.04-1704,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,395.542,397.98,"Well, if it's an Article III issue, I think that's always before us."
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,397.98,404.607,"--Well, with respect to the municipal taxpayers and the... and whether there would be standing to challenge the property tax exemption."
2005.04-1704,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,408.022,420.995,"Well, I was thinking if your... if the argument is that the claims that you're concerned about today can be piggybacked onto the other ones, then we do have to consider whether there's a pig to piggyback them onto."
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,420.995,421.429,--Yes.
2005.04-1704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,442.584,447.876,"--In any case, it's clear that that... that that entity no longer has standing, isn't it?"
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,447.876,451.498,"No, the... there's a separate entity, called Kim's Auto."
2005.04-1704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,452.325,452.675,Yes.
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,452.675,454.336,--that entity no longer has standing.
2005.04-1704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,457.534,458.462,But they don't--
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,458.462,459.095,--that's cause--
2005.04-1704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,459.095,462.316,"--But they don't... I mean, I thought the assumption here is that they don't have standing."
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,463.577,464.088,--The--
2005.04-1704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,464.088,470.298,"--The former standing of Kim's Auto cannot allow this suit to proceed, under any theory--"
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,470.298,470.725,--That's--
2005.04-1704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,470.725,471.042,--can it?
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,471.042,471.359,--That's--
2005.04-1704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,471.359,473.58,Don't you have to have standing during the entire--
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,473.58,474.047,--That's--
2005.04-1704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,474.047,474.43,--process--
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,474.43,475.68,--That's absolutely correct.
2005.04-1704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,488.853,496.739,"--Yes, but the only person who could give them standing, even by this associational theory, is gone."
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,496.739,504.887,"No, there are... there are still property tax... some of the respondents that are still in the case are property taxpayers."
2005.04-1704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,505.303,505.67,But--
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,505.67,506.814,--wasn't the only one.
2005.04-1704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,506.814,514.294,--But they are not property taxpayers who have standing under any... under the argument that you've just made.
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,514.294,514.895,With respect to--
2005.04-1704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,514.895,520.337,The only property tax individual who had standing was somebody whose land had been condemned.
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,523.607,523.924,--In--
2005.04-1704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,523.924,524.241,--have they?
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,524.241,532.005,"--In fairness, Justice Scalia, I think that there are other respondents who claim to be property taxpayers in the City of Toledo, aside from Kim's Auto."
2005.04-1704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,532.005,534.693,Whose land has been condemned.
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,534.693,535.043,No.
2005.04-1704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,536.798,537.398,"Well, but--"
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,537.398,537.81,--property tax--
2005.04-1704,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,537.81,545.03,"--but you say that a property taxowner, simply by being... simply by being subject to the property tax, does not have standing."
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,546.113,559.303,"--No, we're saying... we... the property... under this Court's jurisprudence, municipal taxpayers have been permitted, under some circumstances, to challenge municipal actions, irrespective of the imminent domain proceeding."
2005.04-1704,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,582.402,590.966,"Mr. Olson, I don't mean to deflect you from getting on to the merits, but there was one point in your brief that was of concern to me."
2005.04-1704,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,619.024,619.535,--No.
2005.04-1704,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,653.124,653.874,"Thank you, Counsel."
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,697.133,700.748,"Your Honor, we do not believe that they have standing in State Court, either."
2005.04-1704,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,734.849,735.216,So--
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,735.216,735.449,--this would fall within that.
2005.04-1704,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,735.449,741.736,--And what about the municipal taxpayers on the property tax claim that we were talking about earlier?
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,741.736,742.269,"Yes, Your Honor--"
2005.04-1704,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,742.269,742.93,Do they have standing?
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,742.93,743.674,--Yes.
2005.04-1704,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,771.221,777.858,"And that's because it's a local... it's a Toledo city property tax, is that the distinction you're making?"
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,777.858,786.09,"Well, the property tax exemption is a State tax program, Your Honor, but it requires action by local city leaders--"
2005.04-1704,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,786.09,786.59,"So, that's--"
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,786.59,787.067,--to--
2005.04-1704,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,787.067,788.544,--You would be challenging the local action--
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,788.544,789.061,--It--
2005.04-1704,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,789.061,789.872,--rather than the State--
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,789.872,790.155,--It--
2005.04-1704,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,790.155,792.56,"--action, and that's how you distinguish the municipal taxpayer."
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,792.56,794.154,"--In a sense, that's right, Your Honor."
2005.04-1704,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,819.691,831.037,"So, a tax... just... so, a taxpayer in Wyoming can't challenge a State tax, because his claim is too diffuse, but a resident in New York City can challenge the city tax, because it's not."
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,831.037,839.101,"--Your Honor, when looked at from a numerical basis, I agree that the distinction might not seem to carry a lot of weight."
2005.04-1704,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,868.076,871.097,"There's also a redressability problem, too, isn't there?"
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,880.933,883.027,"It wouldn't, Your Honor, although--"
2005.04-1704,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,883.027,883.538,No?
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,883.538,886.476,"--I think it puts a point on the problem with, in a sense, trying to grow standing."
2005.04-1704,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,896.484,902.521,There are some... at least it's arguable that there's Federal municipal taxpayer standing.
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,915.878,921.088,"Well, that's correct, Your Honor, but, still, there needs to be some way to grow the municipal taxpayer standing into--"
2005.04-1704,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,921.088,921.654,"Well, that's a--"
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,921.654,922.088,--standing to--
2005.04-1704,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,922.088,923.182,--that's the piggybacking question.
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,924.842,925.286,--Right.
2005.04-1704,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1051.199,1057.936,"On the merits, I think that their claim is... take company A and company B."
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1113.358,1116.879,"Well, I don't think that... that's not the way that I understand their--"
2005.04-1704,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1116.879,1117.223,All right.
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1117.223,1117.706,"--claim, Your Honor."
2005.04-1704,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1117.706,1118.223,"Well, then I'm probably wrong."
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1118.9,1133.352,"I understand their claim... I understand their claim more to be that two identically situated businesses, if... both have the same tax bill... one builds a new facility in Ohio, one builds a new facility in Wisconsin."
2005.04-1704,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1139.311,1156.69,"So, that... that is true, and then the effect of that is that firms that now do business in Ohio won't build their new facility in Wisconsin, because they like the lower tax bill in Ohio."
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1161.232,1162.493,Your--
2005.04-1704,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1162.493,1163.243,You were saying they have no harm?
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1164.931,1169.713,"--Well, Your Honor, first, I'd note that's not a harm that they face, of course, going back to--"
2005.04-1704,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1169.713,1170.557,"Well, what is the harm--"
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1170.557,1171.207,"--standing issue, but--"
2005.04-1704,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1171.207,1171.734,"--they think... well, they can tell me."
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1172.234,1172.55,--Yes.
2005.04-1704,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1219.441,1230.611,"--There isn't... the tax credit doesn't give them... require them to buy, in State."
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1236.831,1238.592,"That's absolutely right, Your Honor."
2005.04-1704,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1252.032,1255.065,And the credit's available to out of State companies.
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1255.065,1255.948,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2005.04-1704,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1309.409,1313.774,"Well, but it would be of higher value if they invest it in Ohio."
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1317.056,1317.823,"--Interestingly, Your Honor, it--"
2005.04-1704,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1317.823,1322.6,"--Presumably, the Ohio legislators were not doing this irrationally."
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1322.6,1326.121,"--I would... I would hope not, Your Honor."
2005.04-1704,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1340.805,1344.104,"That... in some sense, at the expense of the citizens in other States."
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1344.104,1345.465,"--I don't know, Your Honor."
2005.04-1704,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1515.715,1517.059,May I ask this question?
2005.04-1704,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1521.091,1528.571,"Your Honor, I don't actually think it would be any different, in the sense that neither one of those two would violate the Dormant Commerce Clause."
2005.04-1704,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1555.192,1556.119,"Thank you, Mr. Cole."
2005.04-1704,2,37868,peter_enrich,,1567.038,1572.841,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.04-1704,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1634.24,1635.167,Is there any--
2005.04-1704,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1635.167,1635.517,What was--
2005.04-1704,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1635.517,1641.971,--Is there any authority at all for saying you can piggyback the basic case or controversy requirement?
2005.04-1704,2,37868,peter_enrich,,1662.131,1668.935,"Justice Ginsburg, there are two reasons why we believe that there is such a basis."
2005.04-1704,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1722.28,1728.767,"I think it was pointed out that, in Flast, at least, you were dealing with the same spending on the part of the Federal Government."
2005.04-1704,2,37868,peter_enrich,,1736.732,1738.742,"That is true, Your Honor."
2005.04-1704,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1775.198,1778.563,--Can I back you up just a bit before we talk about piggybacking?
2005.04-1704,2,37868,peter_enrich,,1787.711,1797.213,"--No, this Court has not ever had to address the question of municipal taxpayer standing, except in Establishment Clause contexts."
