2002.01-10873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.26,"We'll hear argument first in Number 01-10873, Khanh Phuong Nguyen versus the United States and a companion case."
2002.01-10873,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,13.458,16.901,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-10873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,63.591,76.472,"Counsel, may I ask you, in this case, is it possible that a quorum of the court would consist of two members of a three-member panel on the court of appeals?"
2002.01-10873,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,76.472,76.722,Yes.
2002.01-10873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,93.727,94.554,Right.
2002.01-10873,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,97.321,98.519,Even though the panel was unanimous.
2002.01-10873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,98.519,112.448,"Now, if... if we were to agree with you and it went back, could the same two remaining judges constitute a properly arranged panel and decide the case again?"
2002.01-10873,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,112.448,115.237,"No, for... for two reasons."
2002.01-10873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,133.979,137.528,"The same two could be on a new panel, however."
2002.01-10873,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,137.528,154.125,"--I would maintain not in this case for the simple reason that it appears that there has been some participation in the preparation of respondent's brief by the Chief Judge, as well as Judge Goodwin."
2002.01-10873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,161.184,164.899,Is this... is this a right that can be waived?
2002.01-10873,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,168.326,171.215,"--It is a right that can be waived, Justice O'Connor."
2002.01-10873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,185.333,186.902,There was no objection.
2002.01-10873,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,186.902,189.214,I'm surprised you say that there can be a waiver.
2002.01-10873,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,202.673,203.166,"--Well, I think--"
2002.01-10873,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,203.166,210.846,--I thought the whole point of... of your... of your error analysis is this affects the structural integrity of the court and it can't be waived.
2002.01-10873,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,210.846,224.88,"--Well, the additional point I was going to make in response to Justice O'Connor's question is that, in fact, even though there may be consent or even though there may be waiver, that has not stopped this Court from considering these important structural limitations in the past."
2002.01-10873,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,224.88,226.654,"Well, but what... what is your position?"
2002.01-10873,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,233.88,253.16,"I think that the decision is void, and so the position... the position would be that although all Article III provisions can be waived, in this instance because of the nature of the structural error, the consent or the waiver would not matter at all."
2002.01-10873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,253.16,268.021,"Well, then... then your... counsel could have appeared in the Ninth Circuit fully aware that Judge Munson was sitting, go all the way through the argument and the briefing, never mentioning a word about it, and still the counsel would have the ability to void the thing later."
2002.01-10873,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,268.021,269.796,I... I think that's... that's correct.
2002.01-10873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,271.448,273.511,And not to void if he... if he won.
2002.01-10873,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,290.811,300.592,"But, Justice Scalia, I think that relies upon counsel in that situation being confident that this Court would grant a writ of certiorari."
2002.01-10873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,322.641,340.678,"Mr. Green, how does Article III... how can Article III be claimed by your client who was tried not before an Article III court, before a territorial court... your client has no entitlement to an Article III court."
2002.01-10873,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,375.108,380.142,That is true as a general matter at the trial court stage.
2002.01-10873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,397.937,399.833,"Yes, but it didn't have to."
2002.01-10873,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,430.092,431.784,No.
2002.01-10873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,455.44,464.106,"But when Congress created the district court for the Northern Marianas, for Guam, what authority was it exercising?"
2002.01-10873,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,464.106,469.152,--It was... it was exercising its plenary authority pursuant to Article IV.
2002.01-10873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,469.152,487.473,"I... I assume you've got a... maybe I'm wrong, but I assume you've got a fall-back and that is, okay, if you don't accept... we don't accept the constitutional position, you're still claiming that you have a legal entitlement to the Ninth Circuit and, hence, to a completely Article III court."
2002.01-10873,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,487.473,488.959,That... that's exactly correct.
2002.01-10873,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,488.959,493.167,And that could be true if Congress was acting under... under Article IV.
2002.01-10873,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,493.167,494.654,That... that's correct.
2002.01-10873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,525.118,554.468,"Mr. Green, suppose... suppose I disagree with you that... that you... you can sit through a trial and not object with... with impunity, and... and I think that you lose here unless you can show plain error and the usual requirements for avoiding the rule about... about contemporaneous objection."
2002.01-10873,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,608.421,612.675,"In the following senses, Justice Scalia, it did affect it."
2002.01-10873,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,652.716,666.173,"Suppose the panel had included a judge who was holding a recess appointment, a Federal judge who was appointed on a recess basis and therefore at that point didn't have secure tenure?"
2002.01-10873,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,666.173,683.43,"--I... I think there would be issues of... of qualification there, and there might even be... where a... a recess appointment was... was held in a... in a qualified sense, then I would say that was an Article III... an Article III qualification for an Article III court potentially."
2002.01-10873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,688.836,701.385,"But Justice Scalia's question, at least as I understood it, I think meant for you to concentrate on why... why this would bring the administration of justice into disrepute, so to speak."
2002.01-10873,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,701.385,701.618,Well--
2002.01-10873,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,701.618,708.36,"You... you make your argument that this was improper, what was done, and the Government agrees."
2002.01-10873,0,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,711.704,727.102,"--Yes, and... and I would add to my response to Justice Scalia that we have an amicus brief here from Judge Moore who sits in precisely the same seat, so to speak, that Judge Munson sits as a territorial judge in the Virgin Islands."
2002.01-10873,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,749.311,753.109,"Gee, he... he should resign if he feels that way, it seems to me."
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1616.477,1621.595,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.01-10873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1640.254,1642.772,May I ask you a question at the outset?
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1669.77,1673.447,--The... there certainly would still be a statutory violation in those cases absolutely.
2002.01-10873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1673.447,1673.751,Yes.
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1675.609,1676.435,Absolutely.
2002.01-10873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1676.435,1678.375,And would you just say that's harmless error?
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1678.375,1680.194,"Well, plain error I think is--"
2002.01-10873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1680.194,1680.687,Plain error.
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1680.687,1681.597,--a higher standard.
2002.01-10873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1694.107,1694.357,They could create a court with two judges and a British judge.
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1694.357,1697.079,--and a lawyer--
2002.01-10873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1697.079,1697.988,Let's assume they could do it.
2002.01-10873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1697.988,1697.988,--Yes.
2002.01-10873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1697.988,1699.724,But with the statute we have now--
2002.01-10873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1699.724,1700.062,Yes.
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1702.612,1705.418,The... I think our position would be the same as it is here.
2002.01-10873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1705.418,1706.161,That would be perfectly okay.
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1706.161,1709.383,I'm putting aside any sort of due process concerns that might apply--
2002.01-10873,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1709.383,1709.505,"Well, wait."
2002.01-10873,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1709.505,1724.97,"Well, that-- --To get... to get due process, you... you get to... you get to that portion of the plain error doctrine which says plain error applies if it seriously affects the integrity or fairness of the proceeding."
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1736.709,1751.57,"--Well, in American Insurance Company versus Canter, which was opinion by Chief Justice Marshall at the beginning of this Nation, dealing with territorial cases, it addressed there a court that consisted of a lawyer and five... I'm sorry... a notary and five jurors in a territory--"
2002.01-10873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1751.57,1759.083,But that... but that didn't... that was not a court which in... in other parts of its duties was not an Article III court.
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1773.451,1781.541,"--Justice Kennedy, I think there are difficult constitutional questions that would be raised if Congress were to prescribe this."
2002.01-10873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1791.573,1794.461,"Well, but your position is there... there could be a waiver."
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1814.728,1821.582,"--I think, Your Honor, what would prevent them is a decision from this Court declaring limitations on their statutory appointment power."
2002.01-10873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1822.491,1822.741,No.
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1824.886,1839.021,"--And if... and if the Ninth Circuit were to engage, which is not to be presumed by governmental officials, court or executive... but were to engage in some pattern of violating the statute, I think this Court's supervisory authorities could take care of that."
2002.01-10873,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1851.72,1854.571,"Yes, but the interesting case under... leave plain error out."
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1856.344,1856.344,I hope so.
2002.01-10873,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1856.344,1861.545,"But there is, I think, in Justice Stevens' question a very important implication."
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1895.354,1896.447,I--
2002.01-10873,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1896.447,1897.916,Not a due process problem--
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1897.916,1898.326,--Yes.
2002.01-10873,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1898.326,1909.555,"--but a question of what kind of function you can give to a sitting Federal judge because, after all, we have our two sitting Federal judges in the Ninth Circuit."
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,1926.561,1940.308,"I think, Your... Your Honor, that... that we would defend that statute, and we think that it would be permissible, assuming... I mean, the... a better way to approach it is that the analysis that would be applied would be as this Court did in Mistretta versus the United States."
2002.01-10873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1976.34,1980.326,But that... but that... you're... you're... there are two questions.
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2019.996,2020.922,"--No, I understand, Justice Kennedy."
2002.01-10873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2037.419,2042.599,So you think Congress could... could authorize a State superior court judge to sit on this Court?
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2042.599,2044.478,"--No, not on this Court."
2002.01-10873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2085.101,2089.309,"But, again, Mistretta involved the assignment of a judge to a commission."
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2096.989,2096.989,--Yes.
2002.01-10873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2096.989,2106.815,"Under your theory... forget the Supreme Court... the Ninth Circuit could, if it was authorized by Congress, have a visiting State court judge every day as the visitor of the day."
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2106.815,2108.384,At least in territorial cases.
2002.01-10873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2108.384,2112.638,And that would not impair its Article III character.
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2114.988,2118.665,"Well, Justice Kennedy, the way we get to this position is two steps."
2002.01-10873,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2217.034,2236.436,"Ms. Millett, I'm surprised at the answers that you're giving, that they're not prefaced by what you said... I thought you said... in your brief which was that Congress did not enact a statute that allowed the Ninth Circuit to include one of these judges."
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2274.702,2277.509,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, we absolutely agree."
2002.01-10873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2288.177,2293.734,"Well, I think it's... I think it's sometimes not unusual for us to put a hypothetical case to test your proposition."
2002.01-10873,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2313.053,2318.004,And the hypothetical is just simply designed to... to illustrate the point.
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2318.004,2318.459,Right.
2002.01-10873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2338.687,2343.228,I... I agree with you that that's... that that's a hard point in... in the case.
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2364.404,2379.432,"--The... the fourth prong of the plain error analysis is whether the... the error seriously affected the fairness or integrity of judicial proceedings, which would seem to be responsive to... to your concern, and that would be the appropriate place to put it."
2002.01-10873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2404.22,2423.455,"--But your position, as I understand, is this... this right can be waived, and I'm not quite clear on why... supposing we decide with you in this case, why next month the Ninth Circuit might go back and ask for written waivers from all the lawyers in Guam for... to repeat the process and put on the president of the bar association as the third person on the panel."
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2424.298,2439.12,"--Well, Justice Stevens, we're asking this... in theory that could happen, but I think we're asking this Court to decide this case on the assumption that judges, like executive officers, attempt to comply with the Constitution and don't intentionally defy rulings of this Court or statutes--"
2002.01-10873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2439.12,2439.12,"Well, they're complying with the rule--"
2002.01-10873,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2439.12,2439.508,"--No, but if it's--"
2002.01-10873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2439.508,2450.737,"--if there's... if there's a... a waivable right there, and they say we think it's in the interest of harmony between the judges and lawyers in the Ninth Circuit to let one of the lawyers sit with us and see how we work here a couple of times."
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2450.737,2450.904,--But... right--
2002.01-10873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2450.904,2452.019,And they're going to do this.
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2452.019,2456.931,"--But, Justice Stevens, before this Court would address whether it's waivable, it would say whether it's wrong."
2002.01-10873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2457.097,2458.872,"Well, you've already admitted it's wrong."
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2458.872,2459.326,--Right.
2002.01-10873,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2478.191,2478.645,No.
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2491.565,2493.34,"No, Justice... Justice Souter."
2002.01-10873,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2502.505,2502.794,"No, but the... the question I--"
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2502.794,2504.28,--than whether it's a right they can waive.
2002.01-10873,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2504.28,2504.652,--Excuse me.
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2531.484,2532.765,"No, Justice Souter--"
2002.01-10873,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2532.765,2533.879,Okay.
2002.01-10873,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2535.737,2536.563,--The same--
2002.01-10873,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2536.563,2540.938,--hear that with... with what my follow-up question was going to be.
2002.01-10873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2541.847,2551.795,"Why... instead of getting into waiver, why don't we say, under the plain error doctrine, look, everybody agrees that it was wrong?"
2002.01-10873,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2551.795,2554.107,Everybody agrees that it was plain.
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2581.805,2598.113,"--Justice Souter, when we're talking about waiver here, we are talking about something that is unconstitutional, just like someone could waive their... can waive their right to an Article III tribunal, but if Congress passed a statute that violated it, it would still be unconstitutional for the court to sit in that manner."
2002.01-10873,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2647.275,2651.899,It seems to me the waiver would be stronger if it were in advance instead of afterwards.
2002.01-10873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2666.944,2668.059,--The question isn't--
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2696.914,2704.633,And I think this Court's clear rules are that constitutional questions should not be decided unnecessarily.
2002.01-10873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2720.774,2722.055,"Well, I thought--"
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2725.975,2726.43,--And even if it's--
2002.01-10873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2726.43,2729.197,And I'm... and I'm suggesting that it might be more than that.
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2729.197,2741.745,"--And... and our position will be even... we don't think it's a constitutional violation not because of what Congress can do or not do, but because even if it violates Article III, that's no injury to people who have--"
2002.01-10873,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2741.745,2742.201,Right.
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2742.201,2742.823,--no Article III protections.
2002.01-10873,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2742.823,2744.802,Clearly is no due process problem.
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2745.878,2746.149,Mm-hmm.
2002.01-10873,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2746.149,2748.107,Suddenly we're talking about waiver.
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2798.262,2806.352,"That... no, I... thank you for saying much more articulately than I've been able to what... what our point is about waiver versus plain error."
2002.01-10873,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2823.358,2823.441,"Well, in the--"
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2823.441,2824.451,--as to whether this--
2002.01-10873,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2824.451,2834.958,"--in... in our Fulminante case, I think we held that even structural error was subject to harmless error review, that it was not simply an automatic reversal."
2002.01-10873,1,38150,patricia_a_millett,,2834.958,2837.809,"--Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.01-10873,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2861.297,2866.481,May I... may I ask you a very practical question that... this case is now here.
2002.01-10873,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2890.647,2894.074,Please don't tell us that they're asking for express waivers.
2002.01-10873,2,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,3420.118,3426.805,This case was not decided in that kind of narrow context.
2002.01-10873,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3467.801,3471.599,Why isn't the answer to that you just treat them like unpublished decisions?
2002.01-10873,2,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,3473.002,3479.551,--I think actually the Ninth Circuit couldn't do that because of its Article III nature.
2002.01-10873,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3483.266,3487.907,"But Article III courts do issue unpublished... quote, unpublished."
2002.01-10873,2,30625,jeffrey_t_green,,3490.575,3501.72,"--That's true, but we know the issue of... of unpublished decisions is... is changing, and nonetheless there may be some knowledge, intra-circuit knowledge, about how these issues were treated."
2002.01-10873,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3567.478,3568.881,"Thank you, Mr. Green."
