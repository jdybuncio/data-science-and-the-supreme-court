1979.78-1588,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,41.535,Will your argument next in Vance V. Universal Amusement CO.
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,45.761,51.887,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,127.504,128.622,Mr. Ziener --
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,128.622,129.009,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,129.009,140.913,"May I say so, with all due respect, that it is a little difficult reading the briefs to discern what the issues are in this case, at least it was for me."
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,153.532,154.191,"No, sir."
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,154.191,156.209,"Well, I thought you did."
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,156.209,159.655,The brief says that we concede.
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,164.334,171.881,"And the holding of the court that this article is unconstitutional, and I am quoting from your brief now, is not questioned by these appellants in this Court?"
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,171.881,172.691,"In this Court, that is true."
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,172.691,174.756,"Now, isn't that the equivalent of conceding?"
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,174.756,176.052,"All right, Your Honor, --"
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,176.052,177.688,"Or if not, then correct me."
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,177.688,184.9,"Well, all right, that interpretation, yes, sir, we are conceding it."
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,195.491,198.014,Another amicus argues that it is unconstitutional.
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,198.014,198.792,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,198.792,202.538,And yet you say it is not an issue.
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,202.538,203.075,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,204.264,208.684,That is one of the many reasons that cause me not a little confusion in reading this brief.
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,208.684,225.943,"As a matter of fact, I think -- this case, as I say had gotten -- there were so many different cases, with so many different issues, that this issue never really got squarely presented I suppose until it did get to the Fifth Circuit."
1979.78-1588,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,225.943,228.686,But it is an issue now.
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,228.686,229.213,"That is true, Your Honor."
1979.78-1588,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,229.213,234.547,"Because, in effect, you do not question the holding that it is unconstitutional; is that it?"
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,234.547,235.855,I don't --
1979.78-1588,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,235.855,236.205,In that sense.
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,236.205,242.522,"All right, the brief says that this particular point may have been in error in making that statement because of --"
1979.78-1588,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,242.522,244.296,I am more confused now.
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,244.296,247.653,"Well, I think that the Court can correct me if I am wrong."
1979.78-1588,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,247.653,251.715,"Well, you are presenting your case here, and I just wonder what case you have."
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,251.715,277.188,"All right, we will tell the Court -- I think this case could have been settled early on if Moore v. Simms had been decided, and we will suggest to the Court -- and I do suggest to the Court that if you apply Moore v. Simms, you can hold that the court below should not have taken this case at all."
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,277.188,279.147,You don't make that argument in your brief.
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,279.147,280.144,"No, Your Honor, I don't."
1979.78-1588,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,297.27,299.065,What court decided Moore v. Simms?
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,299.065,300.601,"This Court, Your Honor."
1979.78-1588,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,301.586,302.977,What is the citation?
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,302.977,305.606,"Oh, I don't know, Your Honor."
1979.78-1588,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,306.948,310.629,I recall that case.
1979.78-1588,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,310.629,312.651,It was the one involving the juvenile statute.
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,312.651,313.83,"That is true, Your Honor."
1979.78-1588,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,336.499,337.616,"Well, it wasn't decided on --"
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,337.616,342.053,"That is why -- Your Honor, I don't want to concede 4666, even though I may have said so."
1979.78-1588,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,342.053,353.32,"Well, it wasn't decided -- I wrote the opinion -- it wasn't decided in the Pullman extension at all. It was decided on the civil counterpart of Younger v. Harris dismissal abstention."
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,353.32,375.563,"Well, Your Honor, if it was decided on that basis, I am sorry I misrepresented, Your Honor, to a couple of courts, because I said that there was no reason to discuss Pullman if it didn't have some meaning in the case, because obviously Younger is present as far as a pending case, a case is concerned."
1979.78-1588,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,381.145,385.335,I share Mr. Justice Stewart's confusion about your position.
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,386.982,387.134,All right.
1979.78-1588,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,387.134,393.281,I take it that the attorneys' fee issue is not before us.
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,393.281,399.328,"Well, we did mention it in our jurisdictional statement."
1979.78-1588,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,432.503,436.948,Isn't it listed in your questions presented?
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,436.948,444.579,"All right, Your Honor, we will hope to resolve it, the issue below."
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,568.126,574.732,"According to your brief, if not to your oral argument today, that is the only issue presented to us in this case?"
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,574.732,575.084,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,575.084,575.916,The one you have just stated.
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,575.916,577.951,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,577.951,578.813,Do you agree with that?
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,582.236,583.695,"That is what my brief says, Your Honor."
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,583.695,585.232,And you say that today?
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,585.232,586.203,I say that today.
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,596.842,603.684,If the District Court shouldn't have dismissed this case entirely but was correct in considering the merits on the merits --
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,603.684,605.53,That is my single issue.
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,605.53,606.285,And the only issue.
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,606.285,606.704,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,606.704,607.702,Thank you.
1979.78-1588,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,607.702,612.283,"General Zwiener, you say that later today though you are going to argue another issue."
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,612.283,614.063,"Well, no, it is just that --"
1979.78-1588,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,614.063,625.931,"You are going to say that Moore v. Simms, which Mr. Justice Rehnquist pointed out, was a case involving a pending State proceeding, which under Younger barred the Federal Court from proceeding under the court's holding."
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,631.902,632.495,That is true.
1979.78-1588,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,632.495,636.565,"Now, why are you going to ask us to do something different under Moore v. Simms?"
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,636.565,642.084,"Well, in most of the cases the consolidated cases, there were pending civil --"
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,642.084,642.833,But not in this one.
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,642.833,645.946,But not in this one.
1979.78-1588,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,675.896,684.878,"Well, that is -- as I understand it, that Pullman abstention, but it was not applied in Moore v. Simms."
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,687.262,695.759,"Well, until you had told me, Your Honor, what you have told me, Your Honor, you do discuss the Pullman doctrine."
1979.78-1588,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,695.759,698.744,"Well, it certainly is discussed in Moore v. Simms."
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,708.65,732.403,"But let's talk about the procedures, which is criticized by the Appellee that in Texas to obtain an injunction, Mr. Frierson argues that a temporary restraining order can be obtained without notice."
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,824.933,836.253,"Mr. Zwiener, what is the question of obscenity when you are talking about unknown films or books in the future; what can that be?"
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,836.253,842.407,"All right, what we do -- well, of course there has to be some use of the property and that is --"
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,842.407,843.904,An identified --
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,843.904,844.393,All right.
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,844.393,847.952,-- pictures or books in the future.
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,850.482,857.733,"Well, I would say that we are not entitled to even seek injunction unless --"
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,857.733,862.426,My question was simply What do you mean when you say the question of obscenity is considered?
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,862.426,862.849,All right.
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,880.738,884.864,I thought we are talking about books or movies.
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,884.864,886.57,We are.
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,886.57,888.114,And not conduct.
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,888.114,894.762,"No, sir."
1979.78-1588,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1010.367,1012.015,"Well, it is part of the burden of proof."
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1012.015,1018.306,"All right, the burden of proof probably in getting the injunction in Texas at this time would be preponderance of evidence."
1979.78-1588,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1018.306,1018.632,"No, I am not --"
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1018.632,1019.812,I would say --
1979.78-1588,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1019.812,1023.875,As far as the burden of proof on the issue is whether the injunction has been broken.
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1023.875,1028.488,"All right, I think in that situation probably the test is a clear and convincing test."
1979.78-1588,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1028.488,1029.563,Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1029.563,1030.371,Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
1979.78-1588,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1030.371,1034.299,"So in that respect, if no other, it differs from a criminal trial, right?"
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1034.299,1036.358,"That is true, sir."
1979.78-1588,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1036.358,1040.29,You mean you are trying criminal intent?
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1040.29,1049.472,"Well, I mean if you issue this complaint -- say there has been an outstanding injunction and there is a claim it has been violated, then you issue a complaint."
1979.78-1588,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1052.646,1053.945,"Well, I would say it is civil."
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1055.543,1059.672,If it is civil of course there may not be --
1979.78-1588,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1059.672,1072.505,"Well, I postulate -- the reason I said what I did is because the burden of proof has changed in Texas in the commitment of the mentally persons and -- well, I don't think that is involved here, but."
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1072.505,1075.529,"Well, we can send a person to jail so that I think --"
1979.78-1588,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1075.529,1078.039,You might send him to jail until he --
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1078.039,1079.712,Purges himself.
1979.78-1588,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1079.712,1093.166,But you don't suggest that Texas is convicting people of criminal contempt for a certain term in jail on proof less than beyond reasonable doubt?
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1093.166,1094.596,He just did.
1979.78-1588,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1094.596,1099.122,"Well, he didn't; he said he didn't know whether it was civil or criminal."
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1099.122,1100.553,I take that from the law of Texas.
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1122.714,1130.185,Would the defendant have a right if he wanted one to a jury trial?
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1130.185,1130.897,I doubt it.
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1136.302,1137.399,Yes.
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1137.399,1145.038,"-- the courts of Texas have never told me what criminal and civil contempt is, I don't know what the burden of proof is, and I have to confess it to the Court."
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1147.331,1148.055,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1588,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1148.055,1153.027,"Mr. Zwiener, in any event, whatever the proceeding is, civil or criminal, he would get a jail term?"
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1153.027,1155.998,He could be confined to jail until he purges himself.
1979.78-1588,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1155.998,1157.222,How much of a jail sentence?
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1157.222,1158.426,Until he purges himself.
1979.78-1588,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1161.784,1164.377,"If he has violated, how does he purge himself?"
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1164.377,1170.478,He purges himself by not showing this particular movie or taking that particular magazine off the shelf.
1979.78-1588,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1170.478,1172.831,"Well, that is not like civil contempt."
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1172.831,1173.482,I think --
1979.78-1588,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1173.482,1177.364,"you, in effect, hold the key to the jailhouse door in your pocket."
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1177.364,1177.716,Right.
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1177.716,1183.838,"Yes, but he already has by definition according to the State violated the injunction."
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1186.987,1193.572,"He hasn't violated an injunction until it is proved that he has shown an obscene movie, that is true, and that --"
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1193.572,1201.651,"So that the trial, the issue on whether he has committed contempt would be determined by deciding whether he has shown an obscene movie."
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1201.651,1201.901,That is true.
1979.78-1588,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1201.901,1203.029,But in the meaning of Miller.
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1203.029,1203.481,And you are --
1979.78-1588,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1203.481,1209.135,"And now if it is decided that he has, what is he punished to?"
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1209.135,1215.02,I would say that he quit showing the movie.
1979.78-1588,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1236.673,1250.38,"Well, what if someone is convicted for second degree murder in Texas and let's assume the statute permits the imposition by the jury of 20 years."
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1264.619,1269.061,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1588,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1269.061,1274.699,"General Zwiener, I know there are a lot of unanswered questions, how this statute will be construed."
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1291.596,1293.759,"That is correct, sir."
1979.78-1588,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1366.627,1376.162,"I would say I have sent for Moore v. Simms, and I was too critical of your analysis of it."
1979.78-1588,0,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,1384.249,1385.488,"Well, thank you, Your Honor."
1979.78-1588,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1430.841,1432.525,Mr. Graves.
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,1432.525,1436.046,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1588,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1447.788,1452.11,"Well, why is this a prior restraint?"
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,1459.03,1493.883,"The issuance of the injunction against unnamed future films which subject the motion picture operator or otherwise to the various types of either somebody looking over his shoulders, the judge acting as the censor, the unlimited discretion of the trial judge in issuing that injunction, the broad language that is permissible in the injunction, it is doing for the future what Near v. Minnesota applied to a newspaper say shouldn't be done."
1979.78-1588,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1520.842,1524.093,What you are saying is the nuisance route --
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,1524.093,1524.415,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1588,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1524.415,1536.715,"-- that was applied to many different kinds of establishments, including illegal liquor establishments cannot be used in the First Amendment field."
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,1536.715,1538.87,"Yes, sir, and the First Amendment field, because --"
1979.78-1588,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1538.87,1548.231,Even though from time to time opinions of various courts have suggested that is the way -- that was the best way to deal with obscenity.
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,1548.231,1563.981,"Your Honor, the -- the only limited exception that I believe this Court has really looked at is the model statute in Kingsley Books v. Brown in which there was a movie brought before -- or a book brought before the Court."
1979.78-1588,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1605.562,1607.4,That would be a particular motion picture.
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,1607.4,1609.823,"That is the particular motion picture, just like --"
1979.78-1588,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1609.823,1612.232,Not just motion pictures like the bad one --
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,1612.232,1612.776,That is right.
1979.78-1588,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1612.776,1614.494,-- that had previously been identified.
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,1614.494,1620.685,"That is right, sir, because in this case you have the judge says in his unlimited discretion."
1979.78-1588,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1695.921,1701.298,But why isn't the obscenity law then of prior restraint rather than the injunction?
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,1701.298,1708.226,"Well, the obscenity law faces everyone who may or may not want to distribute."
1979.78-1588,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1709.456,1710.351,The criminal laws.
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,1710.351,1711.327,The criminal law.
1979.78-1588,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1754.339,1773.359,"Well, you say the nuisance route that has been occasionally referred to in opinions of this Court is then actually a worse one from the point of view of the defendant than an outright criminal prosecution under an obscenity statue, since the defendant in the nuisance route doesn't have the safeguards of the criminal procedure."
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,1773.359,1791.513,"No, sir, I am not saying that for a civil injunction against the showing of a particular movie in existence which is brought before the court and there is no dissent or hearing on that movie and if there is an injunction on it, then only in the future if you disobey that injunction by showing that particular movie."
1979.78-1588,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1820.207,1821.791,And type filmed involved.
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,1821.791,1822.392,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1588,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1822.392,1824.489,"A specific, identified name."
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,1824.489,1825.892,That is right.
1979.78-1588,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1832.364,1842.129,Isn't it true thought before you can be held in contempt that a move that it is claimed violates the injunction would have to be found to be obscene?
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,1842.129,1843.64,"Not necessarily so, sir."
1979.78-1588,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1845.201,1864.467,"Let's assume -- your colleague disagrees with you on that -- let's assume that you are wrong on that and that before you could be held contempt you have to have the same kind of finding you would have to have under the statute, the same kind of determination of obscenity that you would have to have under the statute."
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,1865.323,1888.039,"You would have if they were trying the movie but you could also be convicted of contempt if you failed to produce the movie -- if the court said, I issue a show cause order, you are arrested, under procedures admissible in Texas you are arrested, and not just a citation for show cause, you are put in jail, you are brought into court and you fail to produce the motion picture."
1979.78-1588,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1904.951,1910.759,Let us assume he does have regular film and there is no issue like that in the contempt proceeding.
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,1920.037,1925.257,"You would have to be, but you are not entitled to all the procedures you would be if you were a criminal trial."
1979.78-1588,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1925.698,1926.989,If there is a criminal trial.
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,1926.989,1927.246,That is right.
1979.78-1588,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1927.246,1928.031,That is right.
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,1928.031,1953.693,"But the real problem with that is you ignore that an injunction action could be brought before a single judge, that the district attorney, the city attorney, the county attorney picks out, that judge says, and he writes a very broad injunction and so a 7-11 store or a department store, the people that the Book Sellers Association here, they say, we are not going to take that book --"
1979.78-1588,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1953.693,1954.019,"Well, Mr. Graves --"
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,1954.019,1955.057,-- and display it any more.
1979.78-1588,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1955.057,1959.748,"-- as you read that injunction, and I gather what you were reading to us was from an injunction --"
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,1959.748,1963.364,That is from the injunction in the State v. Stambaugh.
1979.78-1588,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1963.364,1984.298,"As you read that, that appears as if a violation of a future exhibition of a film could be based upon and a finding of guilt could be based upon, as you read it to us, an isolated excerpt from the film without judging the obscenity of the film as a whole, which is the test of obscenity."
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,1984.298,1987.756,"Your Honor, in the Richards case and in the Locke case --"
1979.78-1588,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1987.756,1988.406,Am I right?
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,1988.406,2003.287,"You are right, sir, because the State of Texas, while they did, the injunction says though, taken as a whole, but the Locke v. State and the Richards case says to state that sexual intercourse and offend, that is obviously obscene."
1979.78-1588,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2003.287,2004.85,Even though it is just an isolated incident.
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,2004.85,2007.102,Even though it is an isolated incident.
1979.78-1588,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2180.211,2205.263,"Well, what if following the Heller approach that this Court decided along with Miller case, a law enforcement officer goes, views a film, files an affidavit, presents it to a magistrate and the magistrate issues a search warrant for the seizure of the -- of one copy of the film."
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,2222.172,2231.414,"I think he would be in violation of the Court of failing to ""The first thing I think the officer would just go in and physically take the film because he had been authorized to."""
1979.78-1588,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2231.414,2237.194,"Well, supposing he stood in the door and said, you are not coming in here."
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,2237.194,2242.88,"Well, I think he would be arrested and physically taken away and they would go take the film on the basis of the search warrant."
1979.78-1588,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2349.75,2368.833,"You have something looking over your shoulder under a perfectly valid statute, under Paris Adult Theater in Miller, depending upon whether a jury were to define whether or not it met the test laid down by that statute, don't you?"
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,2368.833,2417.127,"Yes, sir, but you have the normal checks and balance of a government as to whether or not there will be a criminal indictment or a possible grand jury hearing on it, because there are other criminal procedures to you, as opposed to the fact that just like in McKinney v. Alabama some people won't want to challenge the fact when they have an injunction, whereas if they are distributing a magazine or a book or a motion picture which has some isolated incident of sex act in it, are they going to say that this freezes, it doesn't just chill, it freezes the provisions and becomes what I believe is an impermissible prior restraint in that action, sir."
1979.78-1588,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2466.803,2474.607,What about the proprietor of an adult film theater which shows sexually explicit film?
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,2474.607,2482.643,"This particular case, Your Honor, involved the original case, Universal Theater Amusements v. Vance-involved Deep Throat."
1979.78-1588,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2497.486,2520.026,"So we really don't know that as to a kind of any particular case, except to say that when you have a criminal obscenity statute the proprietor in an adult film theater does have to use some judgment in interpreting that law, at least consult his lawyer."
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,2520.026,2532.399,"But he also has the very uneven application of the law, become some juries determine that it is not obscene and some juries decide that particular films with explicit sex acts are obscene."
1979.78-1588,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2579.079,2583.169,Have there been any contempt proceedings for violations of injunctions of this kind?
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,2583.169,2585.271,"Yes, sir, in the State of Tennessee there was."
1979.78-1588,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2585.271,2586.378,I mean in Texas.
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,2586.378,2602.474,"In Texas, I don't believe in Texas -- of course this statute was passed in '74 and there were some proceedings pending at that time, so that this became involved in the declaratory relief at that time in there."
1979.78-1588,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2602.474,2604.246,This lawsuit has held everything up?
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,2604.246,2614.281,"Well, there have been other injunctions, such as in Dallas in Austin, Texas, but I don't know if there have been any contempt proceedings involved in this."
1979.78-1588,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2615.291,2621.881,"What do you think is the form of the contempt proceeding contemplated by this statute, civil or criminal?"
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,2621.881,2623.481,"I think it is both, sir."
1979.78-1588,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2639.859,2647.659,"The fact of what you have said is that the court doesn't say just stop showing this picture, but stop showing any picture like this."
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,2647.659,2658.311,"That is the general injunction, but if you are cited for contempt because you show a picture like it in the future, and you still had the picture, it would be civil contempt and you are going to stay in jail until you stop showing it."
1979.78-1588,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2658.919,2663.593,But only after a determination that you have violated the injunction.
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,2663.593,2672.867,"Only after a determination that you have violated the injunction except, Your Honor, you are not going to come -- you are not going to be filed with a show cause order and immediately come into court."
1979.78-1588,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2679.562,2680.296,What if the order --
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,2680.296,2682.313,The temporary injunction --
1979.78-1588,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2682.313,2703.264,Let us assume that in some other context as a perfectly valid injunction and the injunction that you would concede was validly issued and substantively acceptable and then there is an order to show cause why the fellow subject to the injunction shouldn't be held in criminal contempt.
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,2716.453,2725.505,"The case as I read in Texas, Your Honor, and the ones I cited is our brief, I would think it would have to be beyond a reasonable doubt on the criminal part, but in the civil part --"
1979.78-1588,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2725.505,2727.028,"Yes, sure -- of course --"
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,2727.028,2730.524,"Like any other civil contempt, yes, sir."
1979.78-1588,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2747.235,2754.568,"Well, criminal intent, is there or is there not in Texas, practice?"
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,2754.568,2756.842,"No, sir, the punishment is six months."
1979.78-1588,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2759.562,2760.6,That is under this statute?
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,2760.6,2761.224,"That is right, sir."
1979.78-1588,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2761.224,2762.213,But if there were --
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,2762.213,2762.633,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1588,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2762.633,2764.748,"-- beyond that, then there would be a jury trial?"
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,2764.748,2765.114,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1588,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2765.114,2767.469,"And what is it 12-man or 6-man, what is it?"
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,2767.469,2774.026,"I am not -- I don't generally practice in Texas, so I can't answer."
1979.78-1588,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2774.026,2780.129,"You agree, Mr. Graves, before you sit down, that Article 4666 is not involved here?"
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,2780.129,2786.379,"I agree that the court down there said that it wasn't involved but, if it was, it was unconstitutional."
1979.78-1588,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2794.779,2796.148,But your view is not it is now an issue here.
1979.78-1588,1,23974,frierson_m_graves,,2796.148,2799.46,It is not an issue in this Court.
1979.78-1588,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2801.695,2807.142,Do you have anything further?
1979.78-1588,2,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,2807.142,2823.021,"Just a minute, Your Honor, I would still repeat that this Texas injunction statute has no more chilling effect on First Amendment rights than does the Texas or any other criminal or any other obscenity statute."
1979.78-1588,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2823.021,2829.112,"Well, what does it -- why, then, do you need it, if it is the equivalent of the Texas criminal law?"
1979.78-1588,2,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,2829.112,2834.814,"I'm not sure that we do, to be frank; but --"
1979.78-1588,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2834.814,2835.991,What does it add to the criminal law.
1979.78-1588,2,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,2840.177,2841.718,I don't think it adds anything.
1979.78-1588,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2897.098,2914.118,"The Texas statute, even disregarding 4666, with a finding of habitual abuse and the declaration of public nuisance under 4667, in your view would the trial court have the authority as a matter of discretion to say the proper remedy here is to close the theater?"
1979.78-1588,2,35306,lonny_f_zwiener,,2914.118,2918.29,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1979.78-1588,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2918.629,2923.442,"Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted."
