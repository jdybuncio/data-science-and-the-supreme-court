1999.98-1189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.197,"We'll hear argument now in No. 98-1189, the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System v. Scott Harold Southworth."
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,11.85,15.111,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1189,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,48.752,54.946,"Counsel, in...  in the course of your argument, it seems to me that there are three different things happening here."
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,99.362,102.994,There are three different funding schemes.
1999.98-1189,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,119.812,124.254,"Now, as to that, are the funds paid out by the Board of Regents?"
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,124.254,128.545,The funds are allocated by a student group.
1999.98-1189,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,141.921,144.771,And are they limited to certain purposes?
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,144.771,145.802,They are.
1999.98-1189,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,157.524,160.125,But I mean the funds that are paid out.
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,167.184,167.267,Yes.
1999.98-1189,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,191.211,199.301,Is it...  is it fair to say that the ultimate control over the payment of funds in this category is retained by the university?
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,199.301,211.273,"The ultimate control, yes, but it is...  it is a student group in all three that determine the funds and the university provides a check..."
1999.98-1189,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,211.273,221.016,"The university, at least in the first category, can...  I guess they haven't done it, but they could say, no, we're not going to pay out the money for...  for what you have selected in this respect."
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,221.016,224.192,"In all three categories, in theory the university could..."
1999.98-1189,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,224.192,225.678,Including the referendum category?
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,225.678,226.421,Yes.
1999.98-1189,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,226.421,248.962,"Why don't you argue, as some of the amici did, that in fact for that reason, you should analogize...  we should analogize the position of the...  the university to the university's position when it decides how to spend its own money, how to choose its curriculum, how to invite speakers to the campus, if it does that?"
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,248.962,249.721,It...
1999.98-1189,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,249.721,251.107,Why don't you argue?
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,252.677,262.913,"It is analogous to that situation, but here it is the students that are choosing which groups will speak, and that is very important..."
1999.98-1189,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,262.913,266.052,"So, you're saying the analogy is not perfect, in other words."
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,266.052,269.396,Because the university itself is not speaking.
1999.98-1189,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,269.396,280.792,"And do you...  do you...  do you wish to adopt the position that...  that some of the friends of the Court have taken, or...  or do you, in effect, wish us not to adopt that position?"
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,280.792,285.621,I think...  I think we hold up under either position.
1999.98-1189,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,296.888,297.26,But who...
1999.98-1189,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,297.26,297.797,Ms. Ullman...
1999.98-1189,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,297.797,298.912,performs the checking function?
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,319.801,335.033,There is a representative from the Dean of Students Office who participates at the committee meetings and someone from the Dean of Students Office who must sign off on the requisitions for the funds.
1999.98-1189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,347.022,350.887,"That is against the guidelines, I take it."
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,356.004,358.522,It is against the guidelines.
1999.98-1189,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,358.522,364.262,"Ms. Ullman, you say...  you say it's viewpoint-neutral."
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,387.174,391.754,"Such a group would get funding, assuming that the group..."
1999.98-1189,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,391.754,392.952,Automatically?
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,392.952,408.927,"If it comes to the forum and does its application correctly, is compliance...  in compliance with the rules of being a registered student organization, doesn't discriminate, can fulfill those requirements, then it will get funding."
1999.98-1189,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,408.927,410.951,"See, that...  that's what I didn't understand."
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,416.153,423.045,"That's correct, with the handful of exceptions of groups who didn't fill out their applications properly."
1999.98-1189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,423.045,435.388,"I take it that even though partisan political activity is not to be funded by...  lobbying activities, lobbying in the legislature is...  may be."
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,437.041,443.357,"Under one policy, it says lobbying should be excluded."
1999.98-1189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,454.586,466.558,"Well, but I...  I suppose funds could be given to an organization generally that engages in lobbying, and the...  the organization could say, well, we get our lobbying money from somewhere else."
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,473.056,473.616,Yes.
1999.98-1189,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,484.102,493.474,"Ms. Ullman, I have a basic question about why we should, in the first instance, adopt the...  the forum analysis here."
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,576.2,580.037,I think there are several reasons for the forum metaphor.
1999.98-1189,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,589.492,597.87,"Well, the legitimacy of the...  of the practice as a whole was not at issue in Rosenberger, as I recall."
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,605.922,611.328,"That's correct, and the parties here on both sides viewed this as a forum."
1999.98-1189,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,639.852,640.845,"Well, does it change...  does it change radically?"
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,644.393,656.076,"I don't know that the percent changes radically, but out of the 18 groups that the respondents objected to, 2 of those were not funded the next year."
1999.98-1189,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,656.653,657.125,Okay.
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,711.494,717.627,"I...  I'm not sure that your second statement is true, that these groups are having speakers come anyway."
1999.98-1189,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,733.148,749.495,"But do you have...  and I don't want to get picky about it, but do you have record support here for the proposition that you simply cannot get prominent outside voices who stimulate thought without this kind of centralized funding mechanism?"
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,749.495,758.122,I do have support from the Dean of Students who said that it takes an honorarium or travel expenses to get speakers...
1999.98-1189,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,758.122,765.431,"Well, sure, but lots of organizations invite us to speak, and they come up with their own honorariums."
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,771.664,779.549,The university made the judgment that it is very important to it to have all of these different groups funded.
1999.98-1189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,789.125,798.613,"Well, Ms. Ullman, I'm curious to know...  we've talked about having speakers come to campus and the...  the forum analogy generally."
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,812.16,819.69,"I don't...  I don't agree that that's true, but it...  the forum is the pot of money."
1999.98-1189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,825.041,830.325,"Well, I was just...  I was just curious factually, you know, whether or not it supports a forum analogy."
1999.98-1189,0,42189,susan_k_ullman,,842.025,859.115,"When I...  in our joint appendix is an excerpt from the funding application of many of these objected-to organizations, and they all talk about how they want to educate other students and what they'll do."
1999.98-1189,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,859.115,868.387,"Well, I'm sure how they want to, but what...  what formal steps do they take to go ahead with this, I mean, other than just, you know, grab somebody while they're walking between classes?"
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,1854.745,1868.863,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1189,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1928.844,1938.42,"Well, I thought there was stipulation in the record that the funding process is administered in a viewpoint-neutral fashion."
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,1938.42,1938.959,That's right.
1999.98-1189,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1938.959,1940.445,Is there such a stipulation?
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,1940.445,1941.509,"Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1999.98-1189,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1941.509,1942.131,Okay.
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,1947.991,1949.189,It...  it does not.
1999.98-1189,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1949.189,1949.848,Okay.
1999.98-1189,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1949.848,1960.456,Can we leave that referendum out of it on the theory that it isn't really developed fully in front of us in the lower court opinions in anything and simply express no view on it and deal with the rest of it?
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,1963.14,1975.029,"I think you have sufficient...  Justice Breyer, sufficient things in the record to see that these groups that are funded by the referendum, WISPIRG, engage in very obvious political and ideological speech."
1999.98-1189,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1976.515,1977.053,"Yes, yes."
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,2006.94,2008.427,I think it's an easier case.
1999.98-1189,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2027.912,2029.027,May I ask...  may I ask this...
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,2029.027,2029.482,Yes.
1999.98-1189,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2029.482,2034.228,"general question, if...  some of these things obviously are troubling that have been identified in the questions."
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,2051.773,2057.224,There would be no First Amendment claim...  challenge that could be brought if it was funded by taxation...
1999.98-1189,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2057.224,2066.141,"I understand that, but that...  I'm trying to leave that out and ask you whether you think the program has these vices in it that would survive no matter how it was funded."
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,2066.141,2067.46,Well...
1999.98-1189,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2067.46,2069.688,"As long as it's State money or student money, either one."
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,2069.688,2073.3,"If it's...  if it's tuition money, I think it would depend on how it's done."
1999.98-1189,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2073.3,2075.882,It's done exactly the same as in this case.
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,2075.882,2082.116,I think that then it would mean there's no government...  they're not agents of the government.
1999.98-1189,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2091.897,2092.351,"So, that would..."
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,2092.351,2092.889,your own agenda.
1999.98-1189,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2092.889,2099.793,Could they salvage the program by abolishing student fees and increasing the tuition in exactly the same amount?
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,2103.626,2106.565,"It...  Justice Stevens, it would depend on how they do it."
1999.98-1189,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2106.565,2108.122,They do it just the way they do it in this record.
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,2108.122,2117.289,I think that we could because...  but it would be a...  it would be shifting tuition to pay for a group in a way that they...  they have not used tuition ever before.
1999.98-1189,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2117.289,2119.639,"Yes, but...  but a fairly simple solution."
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,2121.83,2126.577,"Well, if they're going to make these groups agents of the university, then..."
1999.98-1189,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2126.577,2129.836,They're going to do exactly what they do here except they just raise the money a little different...
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,2129.836,2141.353,Then I think there would still be a challenge because they...  they would be giving government...  they would be giving private money to private groups to do their...  that are independent of the university to pursue their own political and ideological...
1999.98-1189,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2141.353,2150.807,"See, the thing that strikes me about the case is I'm not...  I'm wondering if the source of the funds is really the problem or the way in which their program is administered is the real problem."
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,2152.832,2177.185,"Well, I think that the...  the government speech doctrine I think provides a line here that maybe this is...  I'm trying to discern what you might be getting at here...  that...  if we're talking about things that the university is funding with its academic program with tuition where it says, this is the University of Wisconsin, these are our agents, that type of thing, I think that would be a government speech issue."
1999.98-1189,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2182.303,2195.678,"Well, what if the university uses tuition money to have speakers that come from all these various perspectives at a university auditorium?"
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,2195.678,2196.875,I think that that...
1999.98-1189,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2196.875,2199.393,They use the tuition money to do that.
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,2199.393,2210.621,"That would be acceptable because, from what I understand, it would be part of the government...  it would be the University of Wisconsin extending its agency or sponsorship or something over that event."
1999.98-1189,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2211.986,2222.389,"Well, what if the university does that and lets a student group meet to decide what speakers will be invited?"
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,2222.389,2227.257,"Some of these issues in the middle, I'm not exactly sure."
1999.98-1189,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2243.565,2262.513,"Well, if the university is saying, we want every student to pay $ 50 a semester to an activity fund and we require that and it's going to be used for these activities, then why isn't that government speech?"
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,2262.513,2269.2,"Because there is...  it's clear from the...  the student operations handbook, which is in the record."
1999.98-1189,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2295.867,2297.808,But I don't understand that.
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,2310.235,2311.099,That's correct.
1999.98-1189,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2311.099,2312.547,And you'd have the same situation.
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,2312.547,2312.957,Yes.
1999.98-1189,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2337.932,2339.789,What do you mean by sponsorship?
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,2353.535,2370.049,"Well, as...  as I understand the government speech doctrine from Rust...  and it was discussed somewhat in Rosenberger...  that the...  that there's no claim to challenge the government's own speech or when the government designates agents..."
1999.98-1189,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2370.049,2370.487,"Right, right."
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,2370.487,2371.368,to be their speakers.
1999.98-1189,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2371.368,2371.907,Yes.
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,2371.907,2387.222,"So, if there's an invitation by the university for someone off campus to come on and speak, maybe the...  the speaker is controversial...  I think the...  and I think the issue would be is this...  is there some sort of sponsorship."
1999.98-1189,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2388.254,2392.302,What you're getting at I think is...  is the government ultimately responsible for this.
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,2431.922,2434.322,"Justice Souter, what you said I think is what I'm trying to get at."
1999.98-1189,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2435.148,2435.603,Okay.
1999.98-1189,1,31507,jordan_w_lorence,,2435.603,2438.037,"to capsulize it in one word, I'm having some difficulty doing that."
