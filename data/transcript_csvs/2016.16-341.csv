2016.16-341,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.655,"We will hear argument next in Case 16-341, TC Heartland v. Kraft Foods. Mr. Dabney."
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,8.655,19.31,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Court in this case is presented with an historic choice."
2016.16-341,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,90.39,103.689,"How can that be when in Brunette we said that 1391 governed aliens, the definition of aliens? So that broad statement we couldn't have meant."
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,103.689,129.77,"What the Court held in Brunette was that venue legislation had, since the beginning of the Republic, been extended only to United States domestic persons and that the then-existing 1391(d) of Title 28 was not a venue rule at all, but rather was a codification of a principle that dated back to 1789 that aliens were simply outside the scope of all venued laws."
2016.16-341,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,129.77,134.195,So what do we do with unincorporated associations?
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,134.195,136.3,What we do with unincorporated --
2016.16-341,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,136.3,139.485,Those are -- those are not defined by 1400.
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,139.485,144.35,"Well, 1400(b) in Fourco was held to apply to all defendants."
2016.16-341,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,199.69,200.11,Is there --
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,200.11,201.0,-- Railroad case.
2016.16-341,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,201.0,212.78,"Is there any other provision, venue provision in which a venue for a corporation is only the place of incorporation?"
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,212.78,216.76,Where venue for a corporation is only the place of incorporation.
2016.16-341,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,232.255,251.25,"Well, don't you suppose -- even for diversity purposes, a corporation is -- is diverse based on not simply its place of incorporation, but its principal place of business. Principal place of business counts."
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,253.335,261.14,"Well, since 1948, that has been the general rule that 1391(c) has provided."
2016.16-341,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,299.2,304.0,"Again, whatever it said in Fourco, it was not based on any statute."
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,307.27,310.66,"Well, I would respectfully disagree with that."
2016.16-341,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,339.38,339.78,What do --
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,339.78,340.03,-- one domicile.
2016.16-341,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,340.03,345.66,What do you think Congress would have to do to reverse our decision in Fourco?
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,345.66,349.65,"Well, there are many ways that it could be done."
2016.16-341,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,356.16,364.1,Is there any way Congress could do it without repealing 1400? Is there any change that Congress could make to 1391 that would have that effect.
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,364.1,375.215,"I could imagine that if instead of saying ""except as otherwise provided by law,"" the statute said ""notwithstanding any other provision of law, this would govern."" That would be a way to do that."
2016.16-341,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,375.54,381.64,"That -- that would do it? In other words, your argument in the end rests on that ""except"" provision?"
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,381.64,385.325,"It rests importantly on the ""except"" provision."
2016.16-341,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,438.65,449.44,But -- but Congress also said in 1391(c) that it was defining residency for all venue places -- all venue purposes.
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,449.44,453.21,And the prior statute said for venue purposes.
2016.16-341,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,693.42,706.335,"But, Mr. Dabney, I mean, one oddity of this case is -- is usually, when we say something, when we issue a decision, we can be pretty confident that Congress is acting against the backdrop of that -- that decision."
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,739.835,747.34,"Well, I -- I can tell the Court from someone who does practice that not everyone ever acceded to VE Holding."
2016.16-341,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,850.0,853.3,"Well, wasn't that statute before the 1400 was enacted?"
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,853.3,854.005,It was --
2016.16-341,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,854.005,855.07,I mean that -- that case.
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,855.07,864.69,"That -- that amendment was done in September of 2011 by the same Congress, three months before Congress declined to accept the American law --"
2016.16-341,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,864.69,875.48,"I don't quite see -- two things; one, you can comment on it or not, but these amici briefs, and -- they're filled with this thing about a Texas district which they think has too many cases."
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,908.03,910.82,"Well, let me respond in -- in two ways."
2016.16-341,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,930.08,939.359,"Well, why, when you -- you're complaining about a -- a forum that's friendly to infringers."
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,948.065,962.07,"There -- there has never been, in any other field of law, such a disparity between patent infringement case filings and other case filings in other areas of law."
2016.16-341,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,962.64,963.94,You can go into that if you want.
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,970.205,972.26,Can you remind me what that --
2016.16-341,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,972.26,979.85,"That is, you're asking us to decide where venue is proper for a corporation, and you are not a corporation."
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,983.73,985.7,That -- that's not a correct statement of our position.
2016.16-341,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,989.79,992.649,Is there a holding that it includes you?
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,992.649,997.83,"There's a holding in Fourco that it applies to all defendants, all -- italicized all."
2016.16-341,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,999.67,1000.68,Including a person.
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1000.68,1001.83,Including a person.
2016.16-341,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1073.11,1076.295,"Well, where does this unincorporated entity reside?"
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1076.295,1079.755,"In Indianapolis, Indiana."
2016.16-341,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1079.755,1080.88,No other place?
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1080.88,1083.444,No other place.
2016.16-341,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1083.444,1087.66,"What -- what do we look to, to confirm that? What -- what --"
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1087.66,1091.52,"The corporate charter of the company, it so happens to --"
2016.16-341,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1091.52,1091.7,"No, no."
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1096.9,1107.93,"Under this Court's precedence, the Court has looked to State law to determine where the residence of a juristic person created by a State is located, and so --"
2016.16-341,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1107.93,1112.605,Suppose the State would say we count the principal place of business as well.
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1112.605,1133.66,"It -- well, some states might do that, but the States always require that the domicile to be in the State. So in this case -- in this case it's a very straightforward case because the -- the -- the public office, that is, its legal domicile under Indiana law, is in Indianapolis."
2016.16-341,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1214.3,1217.795,"Well, but for more than 30 years the practice has been the other way."
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1230.33,1239.815,"I -- I -- I heard Justice Souter say something like that in the KSR case, you know, the teaching-suggestion-motivation test has been around so long that, at some point, the mistake becomes the law."
2016.16-341,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1258.78,1291.195,"Well, maybe the Federal Circuit was wrong in not following Fourco, but the question is now before us, and you are asking us to say that venue in a patent infringement case is only where the entity is incorporated or comparable to that, and you have acknowledged that there is no other venue provision for any other kind of claim that is so limited to just the place of incorporation."
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1291.195,1302.755,"Well, I -- I would -- I would respectfully disagree because what 1400(b) does is it provides a different way to define venue for nonresident defendants."
2016.16-341,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1379.17,1380.225,"Thank you, counsel."
2016.16-341,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1380.225,1381.39,"Well, I do, actually."
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1381.39,1382.07,Okay.
2016.16-341,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1382.07,1383.93,Not so fast. (Laughter.)
2016.16-341,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1383.93,1389.145,"Now, as long as you have a minute, maybe you could indulge me and trace me through this."
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1394.89,1395.18,Correct.
2016.16-341,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1395.18,1397.05,But then that incorporated Section 48.
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1401.14,1401.56,Correct.
2016.16-341,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1401.56,1415.43,"And now ""inhabitant,"" how do we know that means where the incorporation is incorporated or something? What does that mean in the case of -- how do we know that that -- that that word ""inhabitant"" means what you think it means? What do you think it means?"
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1415.43,1416.71,Because Fourco said that. Fourco said --
2016.16-341,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1416.71,1426.79,"And Fourco is going really into whether 1391(c) or -- whether they made an exception, whether they included that, and it says no. It's a very short opinion."
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1426.79,1429.895,1400(b) is the relevant part of Fourco --
2016.16-341,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1429.895,1430.35,Yeah.
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1430.35,1431.81,-- is on page 226 --
2016.16-341,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1431.81,1432.17,Yeah.
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1432.17,1470.94,"-- where the Court says, by an eight-to-one vote, characterizing the change from Section 48, in the middle of the page, quoting the revisor's notes, words in subsection (b), ""where the defendant resides"" were substituted for ""of which the defendant is an inhabitant"" because the words ""inhabitant"" and ""resident"" as respects venue, are synonymous. And then there's this parenthetical, ""We pause here to observe that this treatment, and the express reason for it, seems to negative any intention to make corporations suable in patent infringement cases where they are merely doing business because"" --"
2016.16-341,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1470.94,1471.02,Yeah.
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1476.14,1477.02,Correct.
2016.16-341,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1477.02,1481.29,"But you are not an incorporation, so I'm back to my first question."
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1481.29,1489.67,"The -- the treatment of domiciles of -- of chartered entities has, under this Court's precedence and under universal practice --"
2016.16-341,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1489.67,1491.909,And so I should look at what case?
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1491.909,1495.51,We cite the Troutwine case as a -- as an Indiana case --
2016.16-341,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1495.51,1495.61,Okay.
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1495.7,1497.78,-- in our brief as an -- as an example of that.
2016.16-341,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1497.78,1504.11,But I thought you said it depended on what -- that the State can define residence in a different way.
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1504.11,1506.08,"Well, States will tell --"
2016.16-341,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1506.08,1506.94,With respect to LLCs.
2016.16-341,0,29961,james_w_dabney,,1506.94,1516.165,"When a State creates a legal person, a juristic, jural entity, the State will prescribe where its -- its legal domicile is."
2016.16-341,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1520.715,1526.52,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Jay."
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1526.52,1539.98,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If I may, I'd like to offer a different theme for today, and that would be definitions rather than the 30-year point that Justice Kagan posited. Congress has written a definition of ""residence"" that applies for all venue purposes."
2016.16-341,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1539.98,1551.61,"Well, but I mean -- yes, there's a difference between for venue purposes, and for all venue purposes, and for venue under this chapter, but this is something fairly significant in the area of patent law."
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1560.74,1572.84,"Well, of course, Mr. Chief Justice, it isn't here a change from ""for venue purposes"" just to ""for all venue purposes."" There are, I think, four changes in between the Fourco text and the text today."
2016.16-341,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1577.63,1588.375,"But there's no real evidence of any -- including in the nuances you talk about -- of such a significant change. I mean, the -- we can't get -- we can't get rid of this issue."
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1598.875,1604.48,Fourco -- the principles by which Fourco interpret the statutes are still good law --
2016.16-341,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1604.48,1604.9,"Well, then the --"
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1604.9,1608.97,"-- but the definition that Fourco applied is no longer the controlling definition of ""residence."""
2016.16-341,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1608.97,1609.28,Okay.
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1620.72,1643.93,"So, I don't think so, Your Honor. And I think that the function that ""except as otherwise provided by law,"" I'd like to illustrate what work that is doing in the statute, and then I would like to explain why nothing, in fact, ""otherwise provides by law"" in 1400(b). So if you look at the appendix to the red brief, pages 3A to 4A, and then again 5A to 6A, these are the old statutes."
2016.16-341,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1664.235,1667.77,"Is that the end, and then later it's going to be -- it's going to be moved to the beginning."
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1667.77,1668.73,That's right.
2016.16-341,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1708.72,1714.95,"No -- but it wasn't intended to overrule VE Holding, but I suspect it wasn't intended to overrule Fourco at all either."
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1716.96,1718.23,"It certainly is, Your Honor."
2016.16-341,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1806.61,1812.375,Did you raise the significance of the fact that it was an unincorporated association in your brief in opposition?
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1812.375,1820.73,"No, Your Honor, because we don't think that it matters because the definition now applies to all business entities; corporations, and LLCs. The --"
2016.16-341,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1820.73,1828.085,"It seems odd to me you didn't raise it in your brief in opposition, and yet it takes up several pages in -- in your brief on the merits."
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1828.085,1838.98,"Because it's relevant to our statutory interpretation, that our interpretation, but not the other side's, would clear up this issue and save the Court from having to confront in another case where does an LLC reside."
2016.16-341,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1838.98,1839.39,Why another case?
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1839.39,1839.99,-- in another case --
2016.16-341,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1839.99,1844.055,"I mean, look -- look. You -- if you -- if you're right, you win."
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1869.895,1871.26,"I think that that's fine, Your Honor."
2016.16-341,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1871.83,1872.27,That's fine.
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1873.48,1876.19,"Yes, simply because -- because we think, of course, that we win."
2016.16-341,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1877.6,1878.96,"Obviously, you think you win."
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1879.61,1879.79,Yes.
2016.16-341,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1879.79,1880.59,-- and -- (Laughter.)
2016.16-341,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1880.59,1880.78,Look.
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1886.19,1886.63,Right.
2016.16-341,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1911.15,1916.6,But I thought the ALI -- and you -- you rely upon it in your briefs a lot and you rely on it here.
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1921.47,1921.96,That's right.
2016.16-341,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1963.83,1967.095,In -- special or there are lots of different ones.
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1976.33,1976.63,No.
2016.16-341,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1978.95,1979.95,"Well, I mean, getting rid of Fourco."
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1979.95,1980.0,Oh.
2016.16-341,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1982.14,1983.03,Did it say anything --
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1983.03,1983.52,"Well, but -- but -- but."
2016.16-341,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1983.52,1985.58,I mean -- when I used to -- maybe this was years ago.
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,1995.36,2002.73,"What it said, Your Honor, is that the Federal Circuit's decision in VE Holding was it called it a partial palliative."
2016.16-341,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2055.83,2061.96,And -- and -- because I thought that the only thing that left was to govern a suit against an individual.
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2061.96,2069.13,"Well, a suit against an individual would still -- would be more likely to trigger the second half of the statute."
2016.16-341,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2094.92,2106.02,"I'm sorry, Mr. Jay. (B) gets really subsumed by (a) -- 1400(b), the second part of it, gets subsumed by 1391."
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2111.495,2117.27,"So the second half, I agree, does not have much work left to do, except in cases where the defendant's an individual."
2016.16-341,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2122.58,2123.23,"No, but --"
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2123.23,2124.19,But let me answer that --
2016.16-341,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2124.19,2134.51,But you would have specific jurisdiction if the person committed an act of infringement and has regular established place of business.
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2139.86,2144.58,"But the -- for an individual defendant, Justice Sotomayor, the definition isn't based on personal jurisdiction."
2016.16-341,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2145.2,2152.67,Tell me what patent case we've ever had an individual sued that wasn't an agent of a company.
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2152.67,2154.92,I can't cite one right now.
2016.16-341,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2154.95,2155.98,I couldn't find one.
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2155.98,2162.09,"Well, but I can tell you, for example, that, you know, my friend Mr. Dabney says that this -- the problems we've raised are hypothetical problems."
2016.16-341,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2189.61,2195.195,I thought -- I thought you responded to Justice Breyer by saying that is an issue that could be dealt with on remand --
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2195.195,2195.82,"No, Your Honor."
2016.16-341,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2195.94,2199.13,-- the difficulty of determining where an LLC is located.
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2199.13,2199.72,"No, Your Honor."
2016.16-341,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2211.54,2215.86,"It's a difficulty -- again, it's a difficulty you didn't point out to us at the jurisdictional stage."
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2215.86,2224.38,"I think there are -- the reasons to adopt our statutory interpretation are many: The text, the legislative history, and the structural considerations."
2016.16-341,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2240.19,2245.37,"But, Mr. Jay, can I just ask you -- and this is a clarification question, and maybe I should know this."
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2248.83,2249.435,Uh-huh.
2016.16-341,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2249.435,2251.745,Then you have the 1988 amendment.
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2254.34,2255.165,Correct.
2016.16-341,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2255.165,2268.245,"Is it the 2011 amendment that you think changed things, or is it also the 1988 amendment? And if it's the 2011 amendment, exactly which words do you think changed the thing?"
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2268.245,2269.765,"So it's both, Your Honor."
2016.16-341,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2296.88,2304.96,"So why is ""for all purposes"" different from ""for venue purposes"" or ""for purposes of venue"" under this chapter? Why isn't it all the same?"
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2304.96,2314.01,"Well, ""for all venue purposes"" is broader consciously than ""for purposes of venue"" under this chapter because there are more than 200 venue statutes that are outside Chapter 87."
2016.16-341,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2317.04,2319.1,"Yes, but 1400 was within the chapter --"
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2319.1,2319.49,That's right.
2016.16-341,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2319.49,2322.425,"-- so the effect was exactly the same, wasn't it?"
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2322.425,2326.24,It wasn't because now it's no longer just corporate defendants.
2016.16-341,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2415.7,2417.62,You asked me this question -- answer this.
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2444.565,2455.195,"A special venue statute that provides that, instead of the -- so if you -- if you turn the page to 2A, the -- here is the general venue statute, venue in general."
2016.16-341,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2465.175,2466.25,So in other words --
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2466.25,2466.84,-- by law.
2016.16-341,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2466.84,2475.62,"B doesn't apply because of the words in A, except as otherwise provided by law."
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2475.62,2476.16,That is exactly --
2016.16-341,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2476.16,2476.25,Okay.
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2476.25,2478.17,Why Congress put those words into --
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2478.17,2479.73,-- general venue statutes in 1948 --
2016.16-341,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2479.73,2479.855,Yeah.
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2479.855,2481.36,-- and why they are still there today.
2016.16-341,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2481.36,2481.55,Okay.
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2504.4,2508.29,So their function is to prevent B from swamping a special venue --
2016.16-341,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2508.29,2508.82,That might be--
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2508.82,2509.36,But so --
2016.16-341,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2509.36,2511.88,"So -- so -- I know, but B is in a separate section."
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2511.88,2512.27,Yes.
2016.16-341,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2512.27,2515.075,"And now C is the next section, so why doesn't it govern that?"
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2515.075,2516.24,"So, two reasons."
2016.16-341,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2725.92,2740.0,"So a lot of amici discussions as to their reasons for why so many suits are centered in this court in Texas, what is your reason, why do you think that is true?"
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2740.0,2748.22,"So I think that -- if I understand your question is, why do people sue -- what are people suing in this court in Texas or why are so many people suing in this court in Texas."
2016.16-341,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2748.22,2750.035,Is it 1391 or is it something else?
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2750.035,2768.69,"Well, it's only 1391 in the sense that it -- it's a permissible choice, but I don't think that -- that is an answer to the question of why they choose that over all other permissible choices. And I think if there are complaints about the way things are handled in East Texas, and my client, Kraft, has been a defendant in East Texas in patent infringement cases as well."
2016.16-341,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2802.565,2803.99,I -- I didn't understand that answer.
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2815.155,2823.135,"I'm saying two things, Your Honor. Number one, I think the complaints about East Texas aren't really about overcrowding -- and I would like to answer that as my second point."
2016.16-341,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2831.24,2839.745,"But the complaint is that it allows a kind of forum shopping, right? That it -- you -- let's go down to Texas where we can get the benefit of a certain set of rules."
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2839.745,2857.28,"I mean, I think that the same criticism can be made of the rule that Congress adopted for the general venue statute in 1988, or for that matter, the fairly liberal rule that Congress adopted for corporation in 1948, and patent cases, number one, don't have the varying circuit law."
2016.16-341,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2869.11,2875.16,The general -- generous jury verdicts enter into this or is that something we shouldn't think about?
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2875.16,2880.33,"So I -- I think that the empirics -- you know, there is a battle in the amicus briefs about that."
2016.16-341,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2893.795,2900.3,But certainly that might be a perception by the -- by the -- by the bar who brings -- by the -- those in the bar who bring these suits.
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,2900.3,2912.7,"It -- it might well be and I -- and it -- certainly that is -- that is the argument that is being made to Congress, and I think that when Congress is -- you know, takes up this issue as it has already been asked to do and it's already been considering at the committee level."
2016.16-341,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3012.47,3020.07,Were any -- were any of these policy considerations addressed by Congress when it made the change you suggest it made in 2011?
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3020.07,3023.955,The policy considerations about patent -- about where patent venue ought to be?
2016.16-341,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3023.955,3024.385,Yeah.
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3024.385,3031.98,"No, because it -- Congress decided that it was going to -- for purposes of residence it was going to adopt a single definition across the board. But -- but --"
2016.16-341,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3031.98,3042.715,"I laugh slightly because if -- if that is so clear what is this case doing here, and -- and it -- that's why -- that's why I can't cut one way or the other with that -- that particular argument."
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3062.635,3063.02,I -- I can --
2016.16-341,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3063.02,3065.42,-- until I get -- you can? (Laughter.)
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3065.42,3065.77,"Well, sure."
2016.16-341,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3208.54,3214.815,Then why did -- why did Congress reject the ALI proposal to just get rid of 1400(b)?
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3214.815,3229.115,"Well, I can't cite you a page of legislative history, for example, but I think it may well have wanted to continue having a rule that, for example, requires all defendants to reside in the district of venue, which is what 1400(b) now -- now provides."
2016.16-341,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3264.79,3270.96,"It seems to me your answer is quite proper as to 1400(a), but how does your answer apply to 1400(b)?"
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3270.96,3276.24,How does it apply in terms of work left to be done by the rest of the statute?
2016.16-341,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3276.24,3276.665,Yeah.
2016.16-341,1,45148,william_m_jay,,3287.935,3307.345,"Well, it -- it wanted to get rid of the idea of different conceptions of residents under different statutes, and different conceptions of residents that applied to different types of defendants. It wanted to have all of that standardized. Now, that might sometimes result in the word ""resides"" in a venue statute swallowing the rest to some degree."
2016.16-341,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3334.73,3339.035,"Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Dabney."
2016.16-341,2,29961,james_w_dabney,,3339.035,3360.73,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Getting to the point that Justice Breyer made, the domicile of unincorporated associations, limited liability companies has not been a problem in the law for decades."
2016.16-341,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3395.75,3412.89,"What do we do with your adversary's last point about the -- all of the cases, like the pharmaceutical cases that will be upended and made completely impractical by ignoring 1391?"
2016.16-341,2,29961,james_w_dabney,,3412.89,3426.47,"I don't believe that -- I believe that that provision -- that that argument is overstated, for various reasons. First of all, to the extent that venue applies across the board."
2016.16-341,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3632.89,3634.79,Go ahead and finish. Finish your point.
2016.16-341,2,29961,james_w_dabney,,3634.79,3648.89,"The -- the paper by Professors Chien and Risch, that paper cited on page 52 indicates that 68 percent of small- and medium-sized businesses will get venue relief if TC Heartland wins this case. Thank you."
2016.16-341,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3648.89,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
