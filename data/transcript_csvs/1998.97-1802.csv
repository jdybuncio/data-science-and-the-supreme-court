1998.97-1802,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.398,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 97-1802, David Conn and Carol Najera v. Paul Gabbert."
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,12.349,14.903,"Mr Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1998.97-1802,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,100.937,109.843,"Mr. Brazile, if you... you say the conduct wasn't egregious enough to meet what you say is the standard."
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,127.724,131.567,"Justice Ginsburg, no, we... Justice Ginsburg, no, we do not."
1998.97-1802,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,182.0,191.226,"But apart from what... your... your argument about constitutional violation is my question to you was, is there any sanction for this?"
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,215.923,223.548,"Well, there is a sanction for this type of conduct if... under California laws and many others States, there is the tort of abuse of process."
1998.97-1802,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,235.205,241.26,"Is it correct that the service was not coincidental, the time of the service?"
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,243.061,244.811,"No, Your--"
1998.97-1802,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,244.811,246.063,That it was calculated to--
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,246.063,255.79,"--No, Your Honor, we do not concede that the warrant was somehow calculated to interfere or to interrupt with Mr. Gabbert's practice of his profession."
1998.97-1802,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,272.893,277.297,"--Well, how does this... I don't... I'm just not familiar with this procedure."
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,304.287,305.937,Justice Breyer--
1998.97-1802,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,305.937,308.78,Justice Breyer hasn't practiced in California.
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,314.693,315.033,--Well--
1998.97-1802,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,315.033,315.864,Is this typical out there?
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,315.864,316.716,"--Well, Justice--"
1998.97-1802,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,316.716,317.906,Is this the way you normally get documents from lawyers?
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,317.906,332.705,"--Just... Justice Stevens, there is a penal code section that applied here, that requires, when you serve a search warrant on a... on a lawyer, there are certain formalities you have to comply with, one of which is... is getting a special master appointed."
1998.97-1802,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,343.673,349.898,"So, that's the normal way you get documents from lawyers out in your... your esteemed bar, you serve... you serve warrants--"
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,349.898,350.098,--I do have--
1998.97-1802,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,350.098,352.55,--rather than call them up and ask them or serve a subpoena?
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,353.929,355.191,"--Well, I think, yes, it is, Your Honor."
1998.97-1802,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,355.191,355.651,--Wow.
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,369.002,376.186,"Well... well, Your Honor, Justice Breyer, what had occurred is they served a subpoena on the witness, Traci Baker."
1998.97-1802,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,381.391,383.701,"--So, why didn't they have a subpoena for the lawyer?"
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,383.701,384.55,Pardon?
1998.97-1802,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,384.55,386.563,Why didn't they have a subpoena for the lawyer?
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,397.372,399.485,"Well, they chose to get a warrant."
1998.97-1802,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,410.482,411.464,But he's an officer of the court.
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,411.464,412.085,Exactly.
1998.97-1802,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,412.085,421.789,"I would assume that he would not take a... a... is there some reason not to go on the normal presumption that people try to follow the law, who are lawyers?"
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,421.789,433.286,"Well, the problem that the prosecutors were confronted with... days before the appearance of the witness before the grand jury, the subpoena, which required the documents, had been served on Mr. Gabbert at his office."
1998.97-1802,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,464.718,466.952,When did the subpoena require the production of the documents?
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,466.952,467.582,--Pardon?
1998.97-1802,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,467.582,470.791,The subpoena required the production of the document where and when?
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,470.791,476.725,"The subpoena required the production of the documents on March 21st, 1994, the day of her grand jury testimony."
1998.97-1802,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,476.725,480.87,"Well, she didn't have a duty to produce it before she showed up before the grand jury, did she?"
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,480.87,484.122,She had to produce it with... with her at her grand jury testimony.
1998.97-1802,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,484.122,485.772,At the time of her testimony?
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,485.772,486.062,Correct.
1998.97-1802,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,486.062,491.386,"So, at the time you served the... the search warrant, she was not in default on the subpoena, was she?"
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,491.386,493.819,"Well, she hadn't gone before the grand jury at that point in time."
1998.97-1802,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,493.819,494.0,Right.
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,494.0,507.137,"But she had also earlier indicated that the documents that... when her apartment was searched... I believe it was on March the 18th... she told them during that search that all the documents that you want, I've turned over to my lawyer."
1998.97-1802,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,507.137,508.109,And I presume--
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,512.289,517.455,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, the subpoena was valid under California law."
1998.97-1802,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,522.309,538.569,"And I assume that the reason it was served that morning was that she said she wasn't bringing the documents with her, because her lawyer had them, and that they wanted the documents in order to examine her before the grand jury when she appeared?"
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,538.569,540.562,"That's... that's correct, Justice Scalia."
1998.97-1802,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,540.562,548.216,"So, if you didn't get the doc... the documents from the lawyer, and she showed up without them, she'd have to go ahead with her grand jury testimony without the documents to cross-examine her with?"
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,548.216,550.969,"And, essentially, that's what happened."
1998.97-1802,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,552.802,566.508,"Well, did you... when... when your client got to that point, did... did your client say to the... to the lawyer, We... we are told that you have the documents subject to the subpoena; will you give them to us or do we have to subpoena you or get a search warrant; did they say that?"
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,566.508,567.189,--To the lawyer?
1998.97-1802,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,567.189,567.66,Yes.
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,567.66,568.7,"No, they did not."
1998.97-1802,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,568.7,569.341,"Did they say, Please give them to us?"
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,569.341,569.561,No.
1998.97-1802,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,569.561,569.941,They didn't do that?
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,569.941,570.542,"No, they did not."
1998.97-1802,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,570.542,571.644,Why didn't they do that?
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,571.644,578.059,"There was a discussion upstairs, before they went down to the grand jury room."
1998.97-1802,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,584.371,587.373,"But nobody said, May we have them; they're subject to subpoena?"
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,587.373,595.17,"--Mr. Conn did not say that, but Mr. Gabbert knew full well that the documents were subject to a subpoena, because a subpoena was served on his office."
1998.97-1802,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,595.17,595.541,"No, I'm sure he did."
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,597.159,598.311,"I... I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1998.97-1802,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,598.571,599.25,Nobody did.
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,622.57,624.931,"Justice Kennedy, that's correct."
1998.97-1802,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,631.156,643.043,"Do you concede that there may well be a fourth amendment violation... that's not before us; and I take it that will be inquired into on remand to the district court... but do you concede, for the sake of argument, that there may be a fourth amendment violation?"
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,643.043,645.824,I don't concede that there was a fourth amendment violation because--
1998.97-1802,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,645.824,647.667,"But there may be, that that's an open question?"
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,647.667,653.381,"--Well, as to the second search that occurred after the grand jury testimony, that is still an open question."
1998.97-1802,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,654.841,656.162,"I'm sorry, you... you've got the better of me."
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,657.572,658.614,"--There were two searches, Your Honor."
1998.97-1802,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,660.394,664.708,I thought we were talking about the search that was going on during the grand jury testimony.
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,664.708,665.129,--That... that's correct.
1998.97-1802,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,665.7,670.412,That... I thought that was... that... that was the search which he says interfered with his right to represent his client.
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,670.412,670.582,--Correct.
1998.97-1802,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,677.237,679.469,"Well, it may be a valid warrant, but an unreasonable search."
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,683.612,684.082,No.
1998.97-1802,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,684.082,684.853,Okay.
1998.97-1802,0,33773,kevin_c_brazile,,695.47,696.12,That's correct--
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,1749.901,1754.365,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it pleased the Court:"
1998.97-1802,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1795.291,1802.077,Am I right in thinking that Mr. Gabbert was available every time she wanted to consult while she was in the grand jury room?
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,1802.077,1805.556,"Our allega... the answer is no, Your Honor."
1998.97-1802,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1818.656,1824.88,And did the... did the case get any more developed than just on the basis of a complaint and answer?
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,1829.264,1830.496,"There... there were, Your Honor."
1998.97-1802,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1856.654,1858.454,"Well, you just said something, ""he was taken""."
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,1862.198,1863.36,"--He did, Your Honor, that's correct."
1998.97-1802,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1878.239,1882.072,"But every time she asked if she could go to that room, she was told, Yes, you can."
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,1882.072,1887.138,"With all due respect, Justice Ginsburg, that's not what the evidence indicates."
1998.97-1802,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1929.563,1942.913,"Why couldn't he have just said, Client, tell them to wait, instead of giving his... giving... if he had said that, then maybe all of this could have been avoided."
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,1942.913,1948.476,"--Well, you know, Your Honor, she was a 24-year-old young waitress, very unsophisticated."
1998.97-1802,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1950.006,1950.667,"Well, he wasn't."
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,1955.001,1956.263,"--Your Honor, what--"
1998.97-1802,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1956.263,1957.723,Could he... did he ask to do that?
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,1971.222,1972.504,--Twenty minutes to a half an hour.
1998.97-1802,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1987.326,1988.065,Who did nothing with them.
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,1992.85,1993.729,"--No, Your Honor."
1998.97-1802,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2026.71,2029.203,May... may I interrupt you just to ask this question?
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2029.203,2029.353,"Yes, Your Honor."
1998.97-1802,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2029.353,2034.807,"You said that under the California statute that governs this, once he invoked the privilege, the search should have stopped."
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2039.78,2045.203,We... we pled it under the independent jurisdiction of the Federal court.
1998.97-1802,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2052.848,2053.369,"Well, could we--"
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2059.013,2059.684,"We did, Your Honor."
1998.97-1802,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2059.684,2060.422,Okay.
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2077.857,2085.271,"We did, Your Honor, but not on the basis of the timing of the search, so as to prevent him from giving counsel to his client."
1998.97-1802,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2085.271,2087.52,Is there any reason that you could not raise that claim?
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2087.52,2093.405,"Well, Your Honor, we didn't... we don't see this as a... as a... as particularly a fourth amendment problem."
1998.97-1802,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2093.405,2102.601,"Well, you're... you're saying you want us to see it as a 14th amendment problem, but my question is, why shouldn't you raise it as a fourth amendment problem?"
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2127.039,2134.173,"Your Honor, I... I assume that Your Honor is referring to the Albright v. Oliver and Graham v. Connor."
1998.97-1802,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2152.366,2156.549,"Well, the textual source here is the reasonableness requirement of the 14th... of the fourth amendment."
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2169.697,2174.491,"Because our claim, Your Honor, does not have to do with the manner in which they seized the evidence."
1998.97-1802,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2174.491,2178.384,It has the manner... it has to do with the manner in which the search was conducted.
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2201.009,2207.504,"Because, Your Honor, it's my understanding that the fourth amendment guards against unreasonable activity in the procuring of evidence."
1998.97-1802,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2222.751,2226.133,"In any case, you don't want to... you don't want to pursue that avenue of relief?"
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2226.133,2227.816,"--Well, we haven't, Your Honor."
1998.97-1802,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2235.139,2235.57,The second... yeah--
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2235.57,2243.495,"--and we did not pursue that as one of the bases, because we thought that it more properly fell within the due process clause."
1998.97-1802,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2243.495,2245.938,--My questions are much the same.
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2255.484,2256.705,"It is, Justice O'Connor."
1998.97-1802,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2256.705,2268.113,And what holding of this Court do you think comes closest to supporting recognition of a substantive due process violation here?
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2268.113,2277.2,"If I were bound to... to identify one case, it would be Meyer v. Nebraska, decided in 1923, Your Honor."
1998.97-1802,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2277.2,2280.232,"Well, that's not teaching German in a school."
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2282.555,2287.969,"Well, Your Honor, you know, respectfully, I don't think it is a far cry."
1998.97-1802,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2301.218,2303.309,"Well, what... what case supports that proposition?"
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2303.309,2309.183,"Going back to the Dent case, in the 1890's, the 1915 case of Truax v. Raich--"
1998.97-1802,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2309.183,2312.926,"Well, those cases were all overruled in the thirties and forties."
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2312.926,2332.711,"--Your Honor, the... the case that was decided in 1923, the Meyer v. Nebraska, was a case that was a direct appeal of a man who was the teacher and convicted of the crime of teaching in German during a small portion of his teaching day, approximately a half an hour."
1998.97-1802,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2332.711,2338.933,"Well, if that is the case you relied on, surely you lose on the qualified immunity ground."
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2345.187,2349.32,"Well, that's the... that's the closest case in the Supreme Court."
1998.97-1802,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2362.611,2363.632,"Well, but now, wait a minute."
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2369.495,2370.285,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1998.97-1802,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2370.285,2372.608,And that's what happened here.
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2375.819,2379.119,"We... for purposes of this argument, we do, Your Honor."
1998.97-1802,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2379.119,2379.309,Right.
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2379.309,2387.236,"But... but, Your Honor, we're not... we don't claim that every time an attorney is searched that there's a due process violation."
1998.97-1802,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2396.831,2410.703,"Well, of course there was a reason; they wanted to get a letter to use to examine the client, the lawyer's client, about her communications with the Menendez Defendants."
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2410.703,2422.59,"--But, Your Honor, it was made clear to the prosecutors as early as the day the... the subpoena was served on the lawyer that she had a fifth amendment right to refuse production."
1998.97-1802,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2444.266,2446.179,"Isn't that what happened, though, Mr. Lightfoot?"
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2466.942,2467.593,That's correct.
1998.97-1802,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2467.593,2469.463,But she didn't... she didn't give any testimony?
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2469.463,2470.204,She didn't.
1998.97-1802,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2480.601,2482.884,"Well, what would he have told her different from"
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2484.276,2496.835,"Well, it depends, Your Honor, on what... I mean, the reason that the lawyer is there... you... a lawyer, to act professionally, must understand what the question is before he can legitimately counsel his client to invoke the fifth amendment."
1998.97-1802,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2504.162,2505.304,"Yes, but we know now what the questions were."
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2510.088,2510.998,Well--
1998.97-1802,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2510.998,2514.26,"Maybe... go ahead, answer that, please, sir."
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2514.26,2517.163,"--Well, it's fortuitous that it happened that way, Your Honor."
1998.97-1802,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2531.094,2533.865,Did she... have we said there's a right to have counsel in grand juries?
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2535.364,2538.057,"--Well, Your Honor, this... in--"
1998.97-1802,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2538.057,2538.738,That's new to me.
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2538.738,2557.572,"--in 1976, in the Mondujano case, this Court said, with regard to the prosecutor's admonition to a target before a Federal grand jury: You have the right to leave the room and seek the advice and consult with counsel."
1998.97-1802,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2567.309,2568.979,"Constitutional right, did we say?"
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2568.979,2570.521,"--Well, it didn't say a constitutional right, Your Honor."
1998.97-1802,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2573.102,2574.064,Either it is or it isn't.
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2620.073,2623.976,"--Well, Justice Breyer, I would... I would respectfully disagree."
1998.97-1802,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2653.616,2670.205,"Even if... Mr. Lightfoot, even if we took your best argument, didn't your client have some kind of obligation to mitig... something akin to mitigation of damages, both for himself and for the client?"
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2697.944,2708.931,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, the only opportunity he had was when the district attorney's employee... and I... I've indicated this to the Court already... told him that his... his client wanted to talk to him."
1998.97-1802,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2728.364,2736.89,Could not he not have said... you said this was a representative of the D.A.... Would you please tell your boss to hold up until this search is completed?
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2745.217,2748.708,"--Well, in hindsight, Your Honor, maybe that would have been the best course."
1998.97-1802,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2770.083,2775.088,"Mr. Lightfoot, let me ask you a question which I think is basically Justice Breyer's question."
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2835.8,2844.596,"Because, Your Honor, the actions of the prosecutors amount to a serious, serious subversion of the adversary system here."
1998.97-1802,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2846.487,2853.302,"But you recognize... you've already conceded, and quite rightly, that there's no per se rule against searching lawyers."
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2888.395,2908.346,"--Because my answer, Your Honor, is that the core of the behavior that we claim amounts to the constitutional violation is the action of the prosecutors in stepping in and subverting the right of the lawyer to give advice as to the invocation or non-invocation of the fifth amendment by his client."
1998.97-1802,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2938.089,2942.642,My understanding is that there is no constitutional right to a lawyer before a grand jury.
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2945.707,2953.28,"--Your Honor, our claim doesn't rest on whether or not Ms. Baker had a sixth amendment right to counsel."
1998.97-1802,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2961.006,2968.433,You also said earlier in your argument that... that she refused to... she had a right not to turn... a fifth amendment right not to turn over the documents.
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2968.433,2968.994,"--She did, Your Honor."
1998.97-1802,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2968.994,2970.296,What is that?
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2973.868,2977.449,If the production itself would incriminate you--
1998.97-1802,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2977.449,2981.152,"My, it's wondrous things happen to the... to the Bill of Rights out there in California apparently."
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,2987.329,2996.224,"--If the act of production would tend... you're virtually saying, ""These are my documents"", that verbal conduct is incriminating."
1998.97-1802,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3044.988,3046.451,How... how long was she before the grand jury?
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,3047.793,3052.936,--I believe for approximately 15 to 20 minutes.
1998.97-1802,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3062.082,3064.345,"The 20 minutes includes the time she was outside, or was she--"
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,3064.345,3064.566,It does.
1998.97-1802,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3110.099,3122.638,"--There's nothing here that shows that, on the two occasions when she left and came back, that the prosecutors inside the grand jury room knew that she hadn't been able to find her lawyer."
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,3122.638,3125.319,"Well, there... there is, Your Honor."
1998.97-1802,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3139.699,3142.461,"Yes, but she went out in search of her lawyer."
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,3142.461,3142.641,--She went out--
1998.97-1802,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3142.641,3144.464,"She said, Can I see my lawyer?"
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,3155.951,3164.156,"--Well, the record indicates, Your Honor, that, after she left the grand jury the first time, that the two prosecutors left the grand jury room, as well."
1998.97-1802,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3189.815,3194.076,"Well, would he report... under California law, would the special master report to the grand jury?"
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,3194.076,3196.498,"--No, he would report to the prosecutors, Your Honor."
1998.97-1802,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3196.498,3199.99,That's who the special master reports to under that California law?
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,3199.99,3200.871,"No, Your Honor."
1998.97-1802,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3217.912,3221.114,And that... that was all as contemplated by California law?
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,3221.114,3225.407,"Well, not... not all of that, Your Honor."
1998.97-1802,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3384.004,3385.556,"In this case, you're relying on Meyer?"
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,3385.556,3386.698,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1998.97-1802,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3386.698,3389.77,"In this case, as I understand it, you're relying on Meyer and Nebraska?"
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,3389.77,3391.522,"Well, we're... we're relying on Meyer."
1998.97-1802,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3407.722,3412.235,The Schware didn't hold that there was a substantive due process right to practice law.
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,3412.235,3418.388,--It identified... it identified a right that Mr. Schware had to practice law.
1998.97-1802,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3418.388,3422.992,But wasn't that given to him by the State of New Mexico?
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,3422.992,3431.056,"Well, he... he was... he was pursuing a right under the... the liberty clause in the 14th amendment, Your Honor."
1998.97-1802,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3436.39,3440.453,"But the... the right, in any case, was... was a right, as it were, in Gross."
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,3457.454,3458.396,"No, Your Honor."
1998.97-1802,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3466.479,3469.352,"But this is much... I mean, this is a tiny slice."
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,3491.497,3494.531,"--May I respond to your question, Justice Ginsburg?"
1998.97-1802,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3494.531,3494.978,Go ahead.
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,3494.978,3497.62,"Your Honor, that may be."
1998.97-1802,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3513.762,3514.954,"Thank you, Mr. Lightfoot."
1998.97-1802,1,36235,michael_j_lightfoot,,3514.954,3515.395,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1998.97-1802,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3515.395,3516.645,The case is submitted.
