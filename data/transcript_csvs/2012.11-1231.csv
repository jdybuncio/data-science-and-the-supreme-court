2012.11-1231,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.939,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-1231, Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center."
2012.11-1231,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,9.839,12.791,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1231,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,64.224,68.961,"Mr. Kneedler, there's a little bit of at least facial incongruity in your position."
2012.11-1231,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,85.82,104.301,"Well, the 180-day limitation here is not a limitation applied to suits filed in court in which the court is the relevant tribunal, and the court has itself construed the statute's regulating access to the courts or the appellate courts as a matter of internal judicial administration."
2012.11-1231,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,130.099,130.749,Excuse me.
2012.11-1231,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,130.749,131.418,--Excuse me.
2012.11-1231,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,131.418,134.736,You don't mention Union Pacific in your brief.
2012.11-1231,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,145.628,146.611,"Well, I--"
2012.11-1231,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,146.611,150.913,You may or may not be able to establish claim processing rules.
2012.11-1231,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,157.685,170.243,"--Well, I was responding to -- first of all, the -- the Secretary's regulations have from the outset referred to these limitations as limitations on the board's jurisdiction."
2012.11-1231,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,174.461,176.563,"Well, in that respect, I think the amici is right."
2012.11-1231,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,183.317,183.584,--Right.
2012.11-1231,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,189.005,192.007,So what is good cause if not some form of equitable tolling?
2012.11-1231,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,192.007,199.928,There is nothing incompatible between a good cause -- a limited good cause extension and a jurisdictional rule.
2012.11-1231,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,247.743,262.836,"The -- the Court's decision in Henderson v. Shinseki, that also involved an intra-agency appeal, and yet we said that equitable tolling was permissible."
2012.11-1231,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,262.836,265.871,"Well, I mean, there are a number of differences there."
2012.11-1231,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,307.715,312.602,"But, Mr. Kneedler, do you think you could do the same thing in the veterans' benefits context?"
2012.11-1231,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,346.525,361.868,"--Well, I think in Henderson there would have been the problem that the rule, as I understand it, was a rule to -- for appealing to the Court, which was outside the Secretary's rulemaking authority; whereas, here, this is a body within HHS over which the Secretary has rulemaking authority."
2012.11-1231,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,375.009,376.878,Could she have adopted equitable tolling?
2012.11-1231,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,376.878,378.644,--I -- we don't think that she could have.
2012.11-1231,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,400.243,420.157,"I guess the question I was trying to ask, Mr. Kneedler, was do you think it's a general principle of administrative law that when there is a claims processing rule that relates only to internal agency process, that the agency gets to decide how much, if any, equitable tolling to allow?"
2012.11-1231,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,420.157,420.457,--Yes.
2012.11-1231,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,452.176,475.375,"You refer to these -- to the providers as sophisticated, and that certainly is true, but are they really in a position to double-check the calculation when -- if it were true, and I know you don't agree with this -- if it were true that information needed to make the calculation was intentionally withheld, concealed?"
2012.11-1231,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,475.375,479.778,"--Well, as you say, we do not -- we do not agree with that."
2012.11-1231,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,488.015,488.517,"Well, I understand that."
2012.11-1231,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,498.573,500.692,"Well, it -- it may be more difficult."
2012.11-1231,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,522.855,525.557,Assume for the sake of your answer that the error was intentional.
2012.11-1231,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,532.746,533.096,--There -- it--
2012.11-1231,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,533.096,538.132,There -- that might be a contradiction in terms.
2012.11-1231,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,538.132,549.523,"--There may be -- there may be situations in which the provider would not know that, but the need -- but the need for finality under this program we think requires an across-the-board rule."
2012.11-1231,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,554.327,565.634,"If this is a claim processing rule, under what theory could you shield yourself against fraudulent conduct, fraudulent concealment?"
2012.11-1231,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,574.24,574.857,--Well--
2012.11-1231,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,574.857,579.459,--that shielded it from fraudulent acts.
2012.11-1231,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,579.459,582.061,"--First of all, we do not believe this is an ordinary claims processing rule."
2012.11-1231,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,592.052,593.685,Why do you keep fighting the question?
2012.11-1231,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,593.685,601.474,"--Yes, we do believe that the Secretary, in the interest of -- of finality, can impose that sort of limitation."
2012.11-1231,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,608.111,609.163,You keep fighting the hypotheticals.
2012.11-1231,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,638.414,638.8,Yes.
2012.11-1231,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,669.385,680.843,"Mr. Kneedler, you -- what I find incompatible in your argument is you assert that this is a jurisdictional limitation."
2012.11-1231,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,680.843,683.044,Insofar as the board is concerned.
2012.11-1231,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,689.465,702.606,Can you think of any other instance in which we have found something to be a jurisdictional limitation and allowed the person or agency subject to that limitation to extend it?
2012.11-1231,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,708.427,720.735,"--As I said, in Bowles the Court was dealing with the jurisdictional time limit for an appeal, but there was a comparable -- there is a comparable statutory provision for the Court to extend that period for good cause."
2012.11-1231,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,725.788,733.144,"Well, if there is another statutory provision, then that -- then that statutory extension is part of the jurisdictional limitation."
2012.11-1231,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,743.683,743.983,--Right.
2012.11-1231,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,757.927,760.61,"Undoubtedly, but have any jurisdictional time limitations?"
2012.11-1231,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,760.61,764.331,"I mean, you don't need that label, do you, Mr. Kneedler?"
2012.11-1231,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,781.875,782.292,--Right.
2012.11-1231,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,804.556,815.93,"The problem with taking that approach, of course, and I assume why you assert that it's jurisdictional, is that there is a long history of both the board and the Secretary regarding this as jurisdictional."
2012.11-1231,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,815.93,816.647,"--Yes, that is--"
2012.11-1231,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,816.647,817.716,They have said it.
2012.11-1231,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,817.716,818.849,--that is -- that is correct.
2012.11-1231,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,848.751,849.318,All right.
2012.11-1231,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,909.141,909.425,That's correct.
2012.11-1231,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,933.774,934.641,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1231,1,31702,john_f_manning,,948.016,950.552,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1231,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,974.001,975.168,It didn't talk about the board.
2012.11-1231,1,31702,john_f_manning,,979.322,982.038,"--You're entirely, entirely right, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.11-1231,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,993.329,1000.485,That's not the prototypical limitation that Congress uses when it intends a jurisdictional limit on a court.
2012.11-1231,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1000.485,1001.301,"No, it's not, Your Honor."
2012.11-1231,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1021.815,1032.004,"We have talked about what the -- the fact that there almost is a presumption of a claims processing rule, rather than jurisdictional, unless Congress is clear about that."
2012.11-1231,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1068.545,1077.068,"Justice Sotomayor, you're entirely right that the test that this Court has prescribed in this area of law is focused on congressional intent."
2012.11-1231,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1151.316,1175.315,"This -- this agency not more than 3 years extension, that was adopted after notice and comment, and Congress amended this statute several times thereafter, but it left this -- this 3-year outside limit intact."
2012.11-1231,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1185.52,1187.372,"--Justice Ginsburg, you're entirely right."
2012.11-1231,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1248.011,1265.373,"Well, but you have three -- the point that you make is right, that -- that you have specific language in the beneficiary part and not here; but, you have the other way, the point that Justice Ginsburg made, the fact that the language here is -- is -- doesn't say file within 180 days."
2012.11-1231,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1300.379,1301.748,"Quite -- quite right, Your Honor."
2012.11-1231,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1333.982,1343.638,"One was passed long, long ago, and was part of the Social Security Act or something, the one you're talking about, and passed many years before the second one was passed."
2012.11-1231,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1348.506,1350.642,"--You're exactly right, Justice Breyer."
2012.11-1231,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1416.734,1425.273,"That was in part the point I raised earlier, which is we look at what the history is to help inform our use of labels."
2012.11-1231,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1436.998,1437.731,--Well--
2012.11-1231,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1437.731,1441.718,--but it's treated it as a claim processing rule by creating these exceptions.
2012.11-1231,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1441.718,1443.202,"--Well, you're right, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.11-1231,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1485.664,1496.12,"There is -- there is a lot of discussion and confusion between jurisdiction, mandatory claim processing rules, nonmandatory claim processing rules."
2012.11-1231,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1533.46,1541.048,"--Justice Sotomayor, this Court has said that if a time limitation is jurisdictional, that limitation is absolute."
2012.11-1231,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1552.106,1555.058,Why don't you -- why don't you take another minute to finish your answer.
2012.11-1231,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1555.058,1555.558,--Certainly.
2012.11-1231,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1586.494,1587.529,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1231,1,31702,john_f_manning,,1587.529,1587.929,Thank you.
2012.11-1231,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1587.929,1596.885,Mr. Roth.
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,1596.885,1599.254,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2012.11-1231,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1599.254,1602.539,Do you agree with that last statement?
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,1602.539,1603.256,"--Well, I--"
2012.11-1231,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1603.256,1607.341,Do you think an agency is not permitted to have mandatory claim processing rules?
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,1607.341,1609.376,"--Excuse me, Your Honor?"
2012.11-1231,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1609.376,1620.417,"Do you believe an agency is not capable of having mandatory claim processing rules, that it limits the application of equitable principles?"
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,1620.417,1626.821,The agency could have mandatory claims processing rules to the extent -- with the leeway that was provided by Congress.
2012.11-1231,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1662.16,1672.266,"Would our review be an APA review, whether the rule is arbitrary or capricious?"
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,1672.266,1677.004,"Well, I think that -- that the APA review would start under step one."
2012.11-1231,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1707.939,1713.26,"Of course, nobody -- nobody intends that when they -- when they adopt an absolute rule."
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,1731.389,1735.257,"Well, the horrible that we're talking about here, Your Honor, is agency misconduct."
2012.11-1231,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1741.41,1743.077,And why do you say that?
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,1753.402,1767.478,"Your Honor, the -- this case arises on -- comes to this Court after a motion to dismiss was granted, and so that the -- that the Court would have to take as true the allegations in the complaint."
2012.11-1231,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1788.575,1804.335,"Well, in any event, the Baystate case, which is what revealed all of this, in that case the district judge there didn't say -- he said they didn't use the best available data."
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,1806.37,1817.226,"--That's correct, Your Honor, and because that issue was not before the court and it was not necessary for the court to make that finding for purposes of addressing that case."
2012.11-1231,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1916.257,1926.88,"But, Mr. Roth, on the legal question here, I think Justice Breyer is right that this all comes down to congressional intent, how we read this statute."
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,1973.511,1981.034,"Well, of course, Your Honor, the statute is clear and equitable tolling is permitted."
2012.11-1231,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1981.034,1989.639,Of course -- of course one can always make an argument on the other side and the mere fact that an argument is made on the other side does not prove that it's not clear.
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,1993.091,2010.553,"But here, Your Honor, the -- when you look at the factors that underpin the Government's position here that somehow the Government can decide that it can preclude this Court from reviewing agency misconduct -- you heard the Government talk about the need for finality."
2012.11-1231,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2021.175,2021.861,Are there examples?
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2077.611,2086.517,"--Well, Your Honor, the Secretary has addressed this question in the context of fraud or similar fault by providers, and they said there should be no time limit at all."
2012.11-1231,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2086.517,2092.188,"That's their view there, and their view here, which is a different kind of thing, is that 3 years is enough."
2012.11-1231,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2096.242,2108.55,"I thought the 3 years provision applied only to the secretary, that she gives herself 3 years to go back and sort things out, but only gives you 180 days; is that right?"
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2108.55,2111.001,"The Secretary -- well, depends what sort."
2012.11-1231,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2187.067,2190.537,But Justice Scalia was not correct in what he just said.
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2200.042,2215.419,"--Well, the 3-year is both -- it -- it goes both ways, Your Honor, that under the reopening rule that providers have up to 3 years to come in to ask for relief."
2012.11-1231,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2215.419,2215.619,Yes.
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2223.342,2228.746,"It's -- well, but after the 180-day period there is no right to judicial review."
2012.11-1231,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2252.444,2262.383,"Are you challenging -- I mean, there is a rule that says that -- there is a regulation that for fraud it's -- the time is unlimited."
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2276.892,2298.14,"--Well, we -- again, this came to the Court on a motion to dismiss, but we think that the Secretary's interpretation of that ruling has changed from when it was -- when it was promulgated in 1974, when during the rulemaking process they specifically changed that rule to get -- to eliminate the reference only to a provider and it's to any party."
2012.11-1231,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2306.412,2308.012,Did you make that argument in this case?
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2313.566,2320.421,--We -- we speak at some length in the brief under this rubric of the one-way ratchet.
2012.11-1231,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2338.633,2341.602,"Counsel, I'm about 5 minutes behind."
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2349.608,2350.441,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-1231,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2350.441,2351.775,Is that in your brief?
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2351.775,2352.477,No.
2012.11-1231,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2353.427,2354.877,Is that in the amici's brief?
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2354.877,2357.178,"--It is not cited in any of the briefs, Your Honor."
2012.11-1231,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2357.178,2360.98,"Is it anywhere that I can find, other than -- I mean, is it in the appendix to any brief?"
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2360.98,2361.415,No.
2012.11-1231,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2364.634,2368.736,It's a little bit much to chide the Solicitor General for not citing it when nobody cited it.
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2368.736,2374.14,"That is true, Your Honor, and that -- that is correct."
2012.11-1231,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2445.669,2454.675,"Is that reopening -- is that reopening provision, the mysterious gg, is -- is that subject to equitable tolling, too?"
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2454.675,2456.877,"The -- well, the--"
2012.11-1231,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2456.877,2458.51,"And if not, why not?"
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2458.51,2470.72,"--Well, 1395gg simply says that a -- that a -- that a provider and a beneficiary will not be subject to overpayment recoveries if they were without fault."
2012.11-1231,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2524.188,2527.89,"Mr. Roth, I'm not certain about the extent of your argument, so let me -- let me try something."
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2552.439,2572.669,"--Yes, Your Honor, that if the issue is the -- is the agency's own misconduct, that Congress would -- to -- to read that Congress intended in a situation under the -- like this under the Medicare Act, where we're talking about a procedural right to that -- to enforce a substantive right."
2012.11-1231,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2605.89,2609.544,I'm not sure how we can limit this to agency misconduct.
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2619.633,2620.75,That's not misconduct.
2012.11-1231,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2620.75,2621.185,And -- but--
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2621.185,2621.735,"We would agree, Your Honor."
2012.11-1231,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2621.735,2623.635,--But you would say no equitable tolling in that case?
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2623.635,2628.339,"Well, that's not -- that -- this case -- that -- that is a mistake."
2012.11-1231,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2628.755,2629.122,"I mean, that would be good cause."
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2633.874,2636.843,That has never been good cause under Secretary's ruling.
2012.11-1231,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2646.551,2648.001,"Well, I don't know -- I don't know why it wouldn't."
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2648.001,2648.351,What's that?
2012.11-1231,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2648.351,2655.489,"You mean to say that if that happened, under the Secretary's rule, the Secretary would abuse its discretion in extending the time for 3 years?"
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2655.489,2657.189,For -- excuse me?
2012.11-1231,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2658.858,2659.774,Yes.
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2659.774,2660.758,--for a provider to make an appeal?
2012.11-1231,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2660.758,2661.31,Yes.
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2661.31,2662.976,"Well, they don't have to extend the time, Your Honor."
2012.11-1231,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2677.836,2686.442,"Well, I just find it hard -- hard to see why this is -- you're saying that the equitable tolling rule, the agency does have the 3-year rule."
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2686.442,2686.975,--Right.
2012.11-1231,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2686.975,2690.827,It is limited to misconduct?
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2690.827,2691.612,"Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-1231,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2694.028,2697.516,"So you're arguing for -- in a way, for a narrower rule than what the government--"
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2697.516,2708.855,"--Well, Your Honor, let me say that the facts that you're talking about are addressed explicitly in 42 CFR 405.980."
2012.11-1231,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2721.448,2725.0,"Well, suppose it's just what the Baystate court said it is."
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2744.73,2766.911,"Well, in this case, Your Honor -- well, simply, if it was knowing use of bad data, in other words if the government, as in this case, was aware that there was better data to be had, that would rise to the level of the kind of conduct that could be subject to equitable tolling; whereas, simple mistakes are already addressed with the Secretary's regulations--"
2012.11-1231,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2766.911,2771.714,So what -- what circumstances trigger equitable tolling in your view?
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2771.714,2776.766,"--Well, equitable tolling is certainly triggered under the circumstances of this case, Your Honor, because--"
2012.11-1231,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2776.766,2790.776,"Yes, but suppose that the fact finding turns out that the -- that there is no deliberate concealment, but there is merely a failure to use the best available data."
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2790.776,2807.054,"--Well, if we don't -- if we don't have that extra level of -- of that -- of that level of concealment, Your Honor, I don't think that we would have the misconduct that this Court has cited in the -- in the Bowen case, and before that in -- in Irwin and footnote 4 in the Gluss case that would rise to the level of which -- at which equitable tolling would apply."
2012.11-1231,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2807.054,2811.84,So you would have to prove that before we know whether there is equitable tolling.
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2811.84,2816.176,"We -- we -- well, we've made that allegation in our complaint, Your Honor."
2012.11-1231,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2822.813,2833.455,"Yes, but I'm asking you, if you get past that hurdle, then we never -- we won't know that there is equitable tolling until we have tried out the question of the character of--"
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2833.455,2834.605,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
2012.11-1231,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2855.884,2857.736,"I guess I'm not sure I understand this, Mr. Roth."
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2881.619,2882.619,"--No, Your Honor."
2012.11-1231,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2898.147,2898.513,Right.
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2898.513,2900.147,And those were subject to equitable tolling.
2012.11-1231,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2900.147,2908.169,"Well, that most of your argument was built on the presumption in favor of equitable tolling that we've recognized in those cases--"
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2908.169,2908.519,Correct.
2012.11-1231,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2908.519,2910.538,--and whether it applied to the agency context.
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2918.644,2928.0,"Well, the -- what -- the equitable tolling rule that the Court has found in those other cases would certainly come into play."
2012.11-1231,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2936.772,2940.557,So what about -- then let's get back to the question I really meant to ask before.
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2951.032,2952.265,Well--
2012.11-1231,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2952.265,2954.15,"I mean, you want to go back to the Civil War?"
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,2977.047,2993.859,"--Well, Your Honor, in this instance, the -- the question of how to limit a circumstance where a provider is not getting paid, gotten paid the amount promised by Congress, one way to -- to limit that is by time."
2012.11-1231,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3001.879,3006.164,What I hear you saying is go back to the Revolutionary War.
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,3021.692,3022.175,"--Well, if--"
2012.11-1231,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3022.175,3022.742,Is that right?
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,3024.977,3035.433,"--That is -- that is the position because in order to -- to prevail in equitable tolling, we would have to show that the providers here were diligent, and that's a self-limiting factor."
2012.11-1231,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3035.433,3035.683,Okay.
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,3040.404,3042.523,The agency's own determination?
2012.11-1231,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3042.523,3042.756,Yes.
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,3052.462,3082.231,"If the Secretary here decided to attack head-on this concept of equitable tolling and deal with this question of finality straight up and say, you know, here -- here is how we think that -- that finality should be -- should be handled even in the -- even in the context of secretarial misconduct, by for example saying within the 3-year period any provider who feels that we've misrepresented data, come in, you can come in and look at our data, but after 3 years the time limit is over, I think that's a rule that could exist, Your Honor."
2012.11-1231,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3082.231,3088.468,"Well, subject to arbitrary and capricious review under Chevron."
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,3088.468,3091.956,"Subject, of course, to arbitrary and capricious review on that."
2012.11-1231,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3092.672,3100.626,"--Why in your case, even assuming that there might be equitable tolling, here is it -- is it 10 years later?"
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,3132.497,3137.418,"--Well, the complaint was filed, Your Honor, in Baystate after we brought our administrative appeal."
2012.11-1231,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3352.725,3358.712,How many -- how many cases are there like this pending either at the agency level or in court now?
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,3358.712,3371.27,"--Well, I think that when the Government says there are 80 cases that are pending involving 4,000 cost years and 450 hospitals, those probably mostly, if not entirely, or for the most part relate to -- to this case."
2012.11-1231,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3379.293,3379.676,Excuse me.
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,3384.511,3384.83,"Well, there was a change--"
2012.11-1231,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3384.83,3386.897,--claims 12 years ago.
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,3386.897,3387.497,--Right.
2012.11-1231,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3387.497,3390.767,But did they continue from that time forward to the present?
2012.11-1231,2,40372,robert_l_roth,,3390.767,3403.658,"Well, there was a change in the law in 2004 that now give providers access to the data, so they can look at the underlying access to the data instead of -- instead of the Government presenting -- preventing them from being able to get access."
2012.11-1231,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3404.424,3404.858,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-1231,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3407.21,3409.145,"Thank you, Mr.--"
2012.11-1231,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3409.145,3426.274,"Mr. Kneedler, just for point of clarification, the 3-year good cause extension that's permitted under the Government's regulations, would that include -- would good cause -- or could a claim be raised that fraud by the agency is the good cause?"
2012.11-1231,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3426.274,3430.326,--I -- I think that's unclear under the current regulation.
2012.11-1231,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3438.682,3439.048,Okay.
2012.11-1231,3,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3440.765,3441.084,"No, no."
2012.11-1231,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3694.796,3695.896,"Thank you, counsel."
