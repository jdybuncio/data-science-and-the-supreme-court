2018.18-966,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.16,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 18-966, the Department of Commerce versus New York. General Francisco."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,7.16,21.72,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In March 2018, Secretary Ross reinstated a citizenship question that has been asked as part of the census in one form or another for nearly 200 years."
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,23.8,24.32,I'm sorry.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,24.32,25.64,-- of that decision was wrong for --
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,25.64,32.8,"I'm sorry, it's not been a part of the survey, which is where he reinstated it, since 1950."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,59.36,66.64,"Well, but, Your Honor, it has been part of the census for the better part of 200 years, initially as part of the overall census itself --"
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,66.64,67.28,But don't we put --
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,67.28,68.2,-- that went to all individuals.
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,68.2,75.28,"-- don't we ask the question in context? And for 65-odd-plus years, everybody said don't add it?"
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,75.28,81.04,"No, Your Honor, because, in fact, it was included in the long-form census until the year 2000."
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,81.04,82.12,That is a different -- that's the whole issue.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,90.84,95.08,"Yes, Your Honor, but it has been part of the census in one form or another for a very long period of time."
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,95.76,97.12,So the question now before us is --
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,97.12,99.24,"The question, therefore, is two things."
2018.18-966,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,116.68,131.24,Can we just go back a bit to your opening? Why was the citizenship question dropped in 1960 and remained off for all the decades after that? What was the reason for dropping it?
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,131.24,138.48,"Your Honor, in 1960, it didn't appear in anything, and it was moved on to the American Community Survey."
2018.18-966,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,138.48,139.12,But -- but why --
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,139.12,146.48,"That was part of an overall movement of most of the demographic -- I'm sorry, onto the long-form census, not the American Community Survey."
2018.18-966,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,161.88,162.04,But didn't -- didn't --
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,162.04,162.8,It was eminently --
2018.18-966,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,162.8,167.76,-- didn't the Census Bureau give a reason why it was dropped?
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,167.76,173.68,"Well, they generally wanted to move all of the demographic questions onto the long form."
2018.18-966,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,180.32,195.48,But there was nothing -- there was nothing in 1960 to the effect that the Census Bureau found that putting it on the short form would depress the count of non-citizens? Nothing like that?
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,195.48,235.88,"Well -- well, sure, Your Honor, but that's because they thought that, along with all of the other demographic questions in the census, had an overall impact of -- on -- on -- on overall census accuracy. And that underscores why we don't think this is really subject to judicial review, because, really, what you're saying is that Congress -- courts would have to review every question on the long form to determine if the informational value of the question outweighed the impact on census accuracy, because, at the end of the day, if you add any particular question onto the census, you're always trading off information and accuracy. And 141(a) doesn't provide courts with a basis for evaluating that determination."
2018.18-966,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,256.2,283.8,"On the -- on the illegality, is -- is that a -- a predictive factor? In other words, do we, as our cases have often said, do not assume illegal behavior in establishing standing, but is that simply predictive? In other words, we doubt people are going to engage on a regular basis in illegal behavior, and, therefore, we don't think their injury is -- is tangible or likely, or is there something special about the fact that it's illegal activity?"
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,283.8,296.28,"Well, I think, Your Honor, in -- in the Court's past cases, it has often been used as a predictive factor, but I also think that when you put it all together, it breaks the chain of causation for Article III causation purposes."
2018.18-966,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,296.28,303.52,"I mean, it is true that if people go 60 miles an hour in a 55-mile-an-hour zone, that's unlawful."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,308.08,308.24,And --
2018.18-966,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,308.24,309.16,-- or considering standing.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,309.16,314.0,"-- I -- I agree, Your Honor, and that's not our argument here. I think that Clapper is a good analogy."
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,337.24,338.56,"I -- I -- I'm sorry, you're talking --"
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,338.56,340.16,-- that the government would intercept their calls.
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,340.16,344.16,"You're talking proximate cause, which we've never used."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,344.16,344.72,"No, Your Honor."
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,344.72,348.24,We've used determinate or coercive effect.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,395.0,395.48,Uh-huh.
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,395.48,397.72,-- because of the census.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,438.6,442.16,"Right, two responses, Your Honor. First, we're not talking about proximate cause."
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,461.48,462.08,But this is not --
2018.18-966,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,462.08,462.24,You --
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,462.24,465.28,-- the plaintiff acting; this is third parties acting.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,465.28,471.44,"Yes, and that makes it, we think, even worse because the Court's cases have generally said you don't rely on third-party standing."
2018.18-966,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,471.96,473.6,You -- you said you had two responses?
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,473.6,473.8,Yeah.
2018.18-966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,537.48,537.88,On the main form --
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,537.88,539.04,-- on census accuracy.
2018.18-966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,539.04,551.96,"-- on the main form -- on the main form, suppose the Secretary puts in a question about sexual orientation. Suppose he puts a question in about arrest record."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,555.8,556.12,Uh-huh.
2018.18-966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,556.12,559.28,"In other words, we have no role to play no matter how extreme?"
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,559.28,562.76,"Your Honor, you certainly do have a role to play, and I think --"
2018.18-966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,562.76,563.4,All right.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,564.92,565.84,-- and I think your examples --
2018.18-966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,565.84,566.8,That's the question.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,566.8,566.84,Yeah.
2018.18-966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,566.84,587.76,"That's the question. And in this case, there's a statute, and the statute says that the Secretary -- at least on this form, the main form, he shall use administrative records, unless -- it says to the maximum extent possible."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,592.52,593.0,Right.
2018.18-966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,593.0,594.8,To the maximum extent possible.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,646.16,646.32,Uh-huh.
2018.18-966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,646.32,652.88,And some didn't return it at all. Now I haven't seen any evidence to the contrary.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,655.52,655.72,Sure.
2018.18-966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,655.72,689.56,"And as to the second, same question, the second is that several surveys, including Dr. Abowd, told the Secretary: Mr. Secretary, if you add the question to the census, the short form, the direct form, you will discover that even the information you want about citizenship is worse than if you just look at the administrative record."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,690.6,691.24,Sure.
2018.18-966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,691.24,698.04,"Well, A, they say 13 million people, it'll be a wash because you won't get information either way."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,705.12,706.08,Yeah.
2018.18-966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,706.08,727.04,"-- what about them? And as to them, what Dr. Abowd says he says, and I saw it in the record, he says, as to those 22 million, I'll tell you what, you just look to the census returns and you're going to find it not that accurate because some are not going to tell the truth."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,727.04,727.48,Right.
2018.18-966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,727.48,737.36,"So go look at the administrative returns, and they won't be there, but we'll model them. Now the question is, which is more accurate as to citizenship?"
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,737.36,737.64,Sure.
2018.18-966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,737.64,782.08,"The models over here on the administrative part or the answer to the questions on the census part? And here is what Dr. Abowd says: 22 million, he's asked, if you follow your practice, you'd use a survey response, not model it; is that right? That's right. And in your opinion, that would be less accurate than if you just went with modeling over on the administrative part? That's correct. And the conclusion of the Census Bureau remains that adding the question over here, even if you use the administrative part too, produces worse citizen -- worse data on citizenship than just using the administrative data alone? That's the question."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,782.08,783.04,Yep.
2018.18-966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,783.04,807.56,"Answer from the expert: ""That's correct."" So I read that, and, you know, the judges below have listed 14 other examples or 40 other examples, many other examples, and -- and -- but that's the most direct. So where in the decision memo did the Secretary address that problem?"
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,807.56,808.4,"So, sure, Your Honor."
2018.18-966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,808.4,809.24,Both problems.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,809.96,810.2,"Yes, yes."
2018.18-966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,846.64,848.6,"No, he said just what you said."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,850.84,851.2,Sure.
2018.18-966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,851.2,855.0,And that means he can't put scientific numbers.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,873.24,873.96,Right.
2018.18-966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,873.96,875.8,-- is the response rate fell.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,875.8,884.2,"And so, if I could complete my answer, what the Bureau staff told him was that they didn't know which one would be better or worse. So what the Secretary --"
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,884.2,884.96,I'm sorry.
2018.18-966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,884.96,887.12,Where does it say that? Where does it say that?
2018.18-966,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,887.12,888.6,"Maybe you could, if you don't mind, maybe you could complete your answer."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,888.6,888.96,Sure.
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,910.76,911.56,I'm sorry.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,952.16,955.04,"Except for the one time where it mattered, Your Honor, in the key differences --"
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,955.04,955.44,But comparative --
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,955.44,961.48,"-- memo, where they specifically said that they did not know if C was better than D. And so what the Secretary knew --"
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,961.48,963.24,"No, no, no, no, that's not what he said."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,963.24,964.92,That is exactly what he said.
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,964.92,983.24,"He said you can't -- you're -- the words ""comparative errors"" have a different meaning than you're giving it. Comparative errors are I'm comparing this type of error to that type of error and what they compare each other to."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,990.84,991.0,Right.
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,991.0,1003.96,"-- showed you, time and again they told you, you add the survey question, it's going to be less accurate than just relying on administrative records."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1003.96,1004.24,"Your Honor, I --"
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1004.24,1038.2,"So how do you -- how do you take or pluck out of what they say in one sentence, if you're the Secretary, and rely on that one sentence and ignore the wealth of statistics, graphs, testimony, proof, control studies of how -- how these response rates came about and decide that that one sentence is enough to justify ignoring everything else?"
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1038.2,1058.32,"Because, Your Honor, I respectfully disagree with your reading of the administrative record. If you read through the key differences memo, what the Bureau staff is telling to the Secretary -- and, look, there's no question that the Bureau staff preferred not to have this question on the census -- but what they were telling the Secretary was that they couldn't tell which model would be more or less accurate."
2018.18-966,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1061.0,1061.4,"But, General --"
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1061.4,1062.6,They told him that --
2018.18-966,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1062.6,1063.12,Please finish.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1063.12,1091.8,"They told him that if he actually asked the question for 30 -- for 22.2 million people for whom no administrative records existed, he would have got actual answers at 98 percent accuracy. And that the alternative, their preferred alternative, was to use a statistical model to estimate citizenship, not just for the 22.2 million but for 35 million, but they had not yet constructed that model and didn't know what the error rate in that model would be."
2018.18-966,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1091.8,1092.08,But I -- I --
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1092.08,1092.6,And so the --
2018.18-966,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1092.6,1106.04,"-- I think, General, I mean, 98 percent sounds awfully high, but it's kind of irrelevant too. The question is whether, if you used the model, it would be greater than 98 percent. It would be 99.5 percent."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1106.04,1106.72,Right.
2018.18-966,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1106.72,1149.88,"Because then the Secretary would have no basis for saying that you should use the question rather than the model. And as to that, as I think my colleagues are suggesting, there is a bottom-line conclusion from the Census Bureau, and the bottom-line conclusion is that Alternative D, which is the proposal that the Secretary eventually took, would still have all the negative cost and quality implications of Alternative B, which was simply adding the question alone, and would result in poorer quality citizenship data than Alternative C, which is just using the administrative records plus the modeling. So there is a bottom-line conclusion from the Census Bureau."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1156.48,1156.8,Uh-huh.
2018.18-966,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1156.8,1162.0,-- from his experts' recommendations and from his experts' bottom-line conclusions.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1162.0,1162.16,Right.
2018.18-966,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1162.16,1168.52,"But the Secretary needs reasons to do that, and I searched the record and I don't see any reason."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1168.52,1169.36,Sure.
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1197.8,1198.52,But not census --
2018.18-966,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1198.52,1199.88,"Well, if I can just add to the question, and --"
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1199.88,1201.04,But to go -- to go to your question -- yes.
2018.18-966,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1201.04,1222.36,"-- and let me just add to it a bit because you said, you know, an unknown and untested statistical model, but here are his experts in the Census Bureau saying we are confident that we can produce a statistical model that will produce more accurate bottom-line results, and -- and, again, this bottom-line conclusion is the same. They know what kind of statistical models they can build."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1229.2,1231.64,"So there are a couple of reasons, Your Honor."
2018.18-966,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1248.76,1252.24,I think what I read you is them saying that they could beat the 98 percent number.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1252.24,1274.12,"No, Your Honor, I don't think that's what they're saying there. I think what they're saying there is that if you ask the citizenship question, it will make the model a little bit less accurate because you're going to have fewer people for whom there are administrative records, but you actually have to use that model for a much smaller number of people because you have actual answers from 22.2 million at 98 percent accuracy. So that's what they're saying."
2018.18-966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1280.72,1281.12,All right.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1281.84,1282.4,-- or use the model.
2018.18-966,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1282.4,1283.32,So can I just ask --
2018.18-966,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1283.32,1284.96,Would you answer this question? Wait.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1314.16,1332.56,"So, Your Honor, if you look at Secretary Ross's decision memo, the pre- -- the decision memo in the Petitioners' appendix, I would look to a couple of things. First of all, I would look to his discussion on pages 555a with the problems with administrative records."
2018.18-966,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1386.44,1386.52,But --
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1386.52,1388.8,-- told him he would get actual answers at 98 percent accuracy.
2018.18-966,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1388.8,1393.48,"-- if I may say, General, when you think about those statements, I mean, it's just conclusory."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1418.84,1419.04,Right.
2018.18-966,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1419.04,1425.84,"And if I may say -- I'll just finish here, General -- I mean, a lot of your argument -- your briefs are extremely well done."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1425.84,1426.48,Thank you.
2018.18-966,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1426.48,1431.44,But a lot of your argument just do not appear in the Secretary's decision memo.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1451.64,1451.96,Sure.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1456.52,1490.44,"I think the Secretary fully acknowledged that there was an upside to the request, and the upside was the one that the Department of Justice set forth in its letter, that having citizenship data would help improve Voting Rights Act enforcement. He fully understood there was an alternative, using administrative records, and he analyzed that alternative in the language that I just read to Justice Breyer, and he understood there was a downside, that adding the citizenship question would potentially increase self-response -- decrease -- increase the number of -- decrease the number of self-response rates. But he found two things with respect to that."
2018.18-966,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1509.0,1509.68,Which -- which letter --
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1509.68,1511.44,-- and he concluded that the benefits outweighed the costs.
2018.18-966,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1511.44,1513.44,"General, which letter are we talking about?"
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1513.44,1516.52,"Secretary Ross's decision memo in March 2018, Your Honor."
2018.18-966,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1516.52,1517.0,"The memo, not --"
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1517.0,1518.08,"The memo, yes, Your Honor."
2018.18-966,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1518.08,1518.72,-- not the letter from --
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1518.72,1518.92,Yeah.
2018.18-966,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1518.92,1519.32,-- Department of Justice.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1519.32,1520.48,"Yes, Your Honor, the memo."
2018.18-966,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1526.56,1526.96,Can you explain --
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1526.96,1527.68,-- the principal benefit.
2018.18-966,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1527.68,1532.12,-- can you explain how it would improve Voting Rights Act enforcement?
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1532.12,1540.0,"Yes, Your Honor. One of the critical elements of Voting Rights Act enforcement is something called Citizen Voting Age Population, or CVAP."
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1578.4,1578.52,General --
2018.18-966,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1578.52,1579.48,And to just --
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1579.48,1605.76,"-- how do we know that DOJ couldn't do Alternative C, rely on the administrative records? The one thing that we do know is that the Secretary went to the Department -- went to DOJ at the beginning and asked them for help in adding the citizenship question."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1619.6,1620.44,Uh-huh.
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1620.44,1640.48,"-- go back to DOJ. They go back to DOJ, the people they're in touch with, that are not low-level, but they're not the highest level, say no. And Secretary of Commerce speaks to the head of DOJ at the time --"
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1640.48,1641.28,Uh-huh.
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1641.28,1645.08,-- and the head of the DOJ says: We'll give you anything you need.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1680.84,1681.04,Uh-huh.
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1681.04,1693.12,"-- how many people there are, and nobody doubts that there will be less people reported. That's a maximum need of the census survey report, not citizenship."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1705.04,1705.8,Uh-huh.
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1705.8,1709.36,DOJ needs citizenship.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1730.32,1731.12,Sure.
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1731.12,1732.0,-- to that question?
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1732.0,1732.24,Sure.
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1793.2,1795.64,That doesn't tell you why it's not good enough.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1797.0,1797.36,Sure.
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1797.36,1809.92,"But they would then be introduced with one database that has been, according to the chief statistician of the Bureau, introducing multiple layers of uncertainty."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1809.92,1810.08,Right.
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1810.08,1831.08,"Uncertainty about or an undercount of people because they already say that undercount's going to be at a minimum 5.8, less people are going to respond. You're going to have a lesser number that are going to group with the administrative record."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1851.16,1851.72,Right.
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1851.72,1853.96,So he doesn't know that.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1919.4,1920.16,So --
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1920.16,1936.72,"This seems like he thought of something, I want to add a citizenship question, I don't know why, but this is a solution in search of a problem. I've got to find a problem that fits what I want to do."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1936.72,1952.08,"So, Your Honor, there's a whole lot in that question, but I think I will start with where you ended. And if you really think 6(c) is a problem, then we really cannot ask the citizenship question on the American Community Survey since that is just as subject to 6(c) as the census is."
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1952.08,1956.08,"No, what it says -- what it says is to the maximum extent possible."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1956.08,1962.28,And here the Secretary is using the administrative records to the maximum extent possible because he's combining them.
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1962.28,1963.36,But the ACS is not the survey.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1963.36,1974.24,"He's combining them with the administrative records and the self-responses and using administrative records where they're available, using self-responses at 98 percent accuracy --"
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1974.24,1974.8,But the problem --
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1974.8,1976.6,-- where administrative records are not available.
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1976.6,1982.44,"-- but the problem is you can't confuse the survey, which is really the question of 6(c) --"
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1982.44,1982.96,No.
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1982.96,1984.12,-- or the focus.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1984.12,1984.52,It's not.
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1984.52,1984.88,Because --
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1984.88,1990.16,"6(c) applies to all census instruments, not just the census. It fully applies to the American Community Survey."
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1992.04,1996.36,But the ACS is not used -- the ACS is not used for the citizenship purpose.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1996.36,1997.48,"But, Your Honor, your question --"
2018.18-966,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1997.48,1998.52,You already said why it wasn't.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1998.52,2000.4,-- your question is about 6(c).
2018.18-966,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2053.08,2053.48,But just --
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2053.48,2053.92,-- with the bird in the hand.
2018.18-966,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2053.92,2073.64,"-- General, just going back to Justice Kavanaugh's simple question about why the Secretary thought that there was a need for this data, and then part of what Justice Sotomayor was talking about was that it did really seem like the Secretary was shopping for a need. Goes to the Justice Department. Justice Department says, we don't need anything."
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2110.88,2111.28,Yeah.
2018.18-966,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2112.0,2113.0,-- question.
2018.18-966,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2113.0,2114.68,"And I have two responses, Your Honor."
2018.18-966,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2160.0,2164.12,"Thank you, General. General Underwood."
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2164.12,2210.6,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Secretary decided to add this question about citizenship to the 2020 census although the record before him contained uncontradicted and strong evidence that it will cause a decline in the response rate of non-citizens and Hispanics, to the detriment of the states and localities where they live. He gave three reasons for the decision, and none of them can survive APA review. One, he said there was inadequate evidence of an effect on the response rate. But that is flatly contrary to the record. He said he could dismiss or discount any such effect because non-response is an illegal act."
2018.18-966,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2226.52,2246.44,"Do you -- do you think it wouldn't help voting rights enforcement? The CVAP, Citizen Voting Age Population, is the critical element in voting rights enforcement, and this is getting citizen information."
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2246.44,2274.64,"Well, as we have -- as has been discussed at length in the -- during the previous argument, the evidence before him was that it would not give better citizenship information than -- that it's the 22 million that the government points to, the 22 million whose citizenship information will be either modeled or the result of the answer to a census question."
2018.18-966,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2274.64,2288.04,Was there anything that showed that the Department would have been aided in either past cases or cases on the drawing board? Any case?
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2288.04,2289.16,There was not.
2018.18-966,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2361.4,2364.32,What if the answer was uncertain?
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2364.32,2370.04,"Well, if the answer is uncertain, then it is hard to invoke that as a reason."
2018.18-966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2397.64,2398.72,"Well, on the modeling --"
2018.18-966,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2398.72,2400.24,"Well, is that -- go ahead."
2018.18-966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2400.24,2423.48,"On the modeling, there was a lot of talk during the first part of the argument about -- I think it's 22.6 million people who it would -- it is predicted would answer the citizenship question and as to whom there is not administrative data. And there was an estimate that those answers would be 98 percent accurate."
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2446.0,2454.8,"What we have -- what we have is that this -- the model hadn't been generated, but what we have is the Census Bureau saying this is like other modeling that we routinely do."
2018.18-966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2456.4,2482.56,"So, if the Secretary said -- has to choose between two things, and, on one, the Secretary knows there's a 98 percent accuracy rate, and as to the other, the Census Bureau says, we're going to create a model, and we don't know how -- we can't give you any statistics, but trust us, it's going to be more accurate than 98 percent, is it arbitrary and capricious for the Secretary to say, I'll go with the 98 percent because that's a known quantity?"
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2482.56,2487.08,"If there were no cost to the enumeration, that would be a different question."
2018.18-966,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2493.52,2495.0,I don't understand -- sorry.
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2495.0,2495.8,-- with the enumeration.
2018.18-966,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2495.8,2498.04,I don't understand uncertainty.
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2502.68,2503.24,Right.
2018.18-966,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2503.24,2507.44,"The people who are citizens are not going to -- you know, they'll say they're citizens."
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2579.6,2580.48,Yes.
2018.18-966,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2580.48,2584.92,Now I'm sure in their reply brief they pointed right to that.
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2593.44,2608.36,"If you look at that testimony in context, it is perfectly clear that what he is saying is that he didn't have enough evidence for a firm quantitative statement, meeting scientific standards."
2018.18-966,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2637.24,2637.56,That --
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2637.56,2639.16,And -- and the --
2018.18-966,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2639.16,2642.2,-- that's the evidence that he found was not available?
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2642.2,2642.76,"Yes, that's right."
2018.18-966,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2667.08,2667.72,Can -- can I ask --
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2667.72,2668.08,So he is --
2018.18-966,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2668.08,2669.76,"I'm sorry, please finish."
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2669.76,2687.28,"And -- and my point is that, at the same trial, if we're going to look at the trial testimony, at the same trial, other experts said: Maybe so, but there is enough evidence to make a different kind of judgment, not a firm scientific, quantified judgment, but a judgment."
2018.18-966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2687.28,2698.12,Do you think it's proper to look at the trial record on this issue? There's a lot of citation in the Respondents' brief to trial testimony. Aren't we reviewing the administrative record?
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2698.12,2698.72,We are.
2018.18-966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2702.4,2702.84,That's correct.
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2705.12,2705.52,Correct.
2018.18-966,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2713.04,2713.28,Can I --
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2713.28,2713.84,But what I --
2018.18-966,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2713.84,2714.24,-- can I ask a --
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2714.24,2714.56,Yes.
2018.18-966,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2715.16,2716.76,Please finish.
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2716.76,2718.28,"No, going -- going -- going back to your question --"
2018.18-966,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2718.28,2719.08,"Wait a minute, Justice Kavanaugh."
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2719.08,2752.32,"-- while I think there is good evidence, and nothing contrary, that this 22 million would be more accurately identified by the modeling than by the census, I think it is sufficient for this purpose to treat it as somewhat uncertain, because it is uncertainty with respect to the discretionary part of what the Census Bureau does; namely, collect extra information. The core function of the census, not of the Census Bureau in all its actions, but of -- on the census form --"
2018.18-966,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2752.32,2759.28,But the -- the United Nations recommends that countries ask a citizenship question on the census.
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2798.24,2809.36,The same guidance from the U.N. also says to be careful to test questions to make sure they don't interfere with the enumeration.
2018.18-966,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2827.56,2831.56,But you agree it's very -- it's a very common question internationally?
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2831.56,2835.44,"Well, it is certainly useful information for a country to have."
2018.18-966,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2856.08,2866.24,"Well, the principal purpose -- you're -- you're right, the principal purpose is to count the population, but we've had demographic questions on the census -- I don't know how far back, but, certainly, it's quite common."
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2866.24,2869.08,"That's -- that's correct, but we have no evidence about --"
2018.18-966,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2869.08,2871.08,"Sex, age, things like that."
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2881.28,2885.6,"Well, I'd like to say two things about that."
2018.18-966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2903.28,2939.68,"Well, the -- the -- the response rate is very important, so can I ask you a question about that? A lot of your argument and a lot of the district court's argument seems to hinge on this prediction that there will be 5.1 percent fewer responses if the citizenship question is included on the census. But that seems -- that is based, as I understand it, on the fact that non-citizens are somewhat less likely to complete the ACS, which includes the citizenship question, than are citizens."
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2944.0,2945.96,It's not about not completing.
2018.18-966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2949.12,2949.8,Not -- not responding.
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2949.8,2951.28,It's about not -- not responding.
2018.18-966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2951.52,2952.28,That's correct.
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2956.32,2959.36,It's the ACS in one study and the long form in another.
2018.18-966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2959.36,2959.96,Okay.
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,2996.28,2998.4,"The strong -- well, a couple of things."
2018.18-966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3010.48,3013.08,"I thought they did, but, in any event, go ahead."
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3013.08,3032.48,"I'll come back to that -- is a -- is a retrospective review of comparing in one case for 2010 the short-form census and the ACS, and in 2000, it was to compare the short form and the long-form census. It's a comparable comparison."
2018.18-966,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3050.44,3061.04,"But, counsel, isn't -- doesn't Justice Alito have a point to the extent that there could be multiple reasons why individuals don't complete the form?"
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3061.04,3061.72,"Well, the lay --"
2018.18-966,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3061.72,3063.4,And we haven't --
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3063.4,3065.08,"I'm sorry, go ahead."
2018.18-966,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3065.08,3067.08,Plenty of interrupting.
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3093.92,3096.88,"Well, I think -- I think there are a few things to say."
2018.18-966,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3096.88,3097.4,And -- and -- and --
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3097.4,3097.6,Well --
2018.18-966,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3097.6,3098.68,-- and let me just throw in one other question.
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3136.48,3139.24,There are a lot of complaints about the ACS.
2018.18-966,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3169.52,3170.88,I thought that --
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3170.88,3172.12,Now that brings us back --
2018.18-966,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3172.12,3189.56,"-- Dr. Abowd's testimony, or at least the letter, somewhere I read, that they controlled for the -- for all of the other reasons that Justice Gorsuch was mentioning as reasons why people would not complete?"
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3189.56,3191.48,"Well, they certainly controlled for the length of the form."
2018.18-966,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3192.44,3194.72,"Well, not just that. On page 110 --"
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3194.72,3194.96,Yes.
2018.18-966,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3195.28,3201.36,"-- of the Joint Appendix, it says whether the response -- dah-dah-dah -- that they're much greater."
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3207.44,3207.88,Yes.
2018.18-966,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3207.88,3210.72,"-- age, race, ethnicity."
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3216.96,3217.24,It --
2018.18-966,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3217.24,3219.08,-- mentioned insofar as their relevance.
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3219.08,3219.64,It was.
2018.18-966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3231.12,3234.96,"But that's not -- that's a -- that's a different issue, isn't it, what Justice Breyer mentioned?"
2018.18-966,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3234.96,3235.0,Yeah.
2018.18-966,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3236.4,3253.28,"It's -- it's -- it's the decline in the response rate based on those variables, but not -- it doesn't -- it doesn't, as Justice Gorsuch says, disaggregate the many factors that could explain a decline when you're distinguishing between citizens and non-citizens."
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3253.28,3258.44,"Well, it did try to control for other properties that citizens have --"
2018.18-966,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3258.44,3258.56,But we don't --
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3258.56,3258.72,-- and non-citizens --
2018.18-966,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3258.72,3258.96,Am -- am I right --
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3258.96,3259.36,-- have --
2018.18-966,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3259.36,3259.84,-- that there --
2018.18-966,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3259.84,3263.2,"It's fair to say we don't have this isolated, though, isn't it?"
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3263.2,3264.04,They did their best.
2018.18-966,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3264.04,3264.88,They did their best.
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3264.88,3273.04,"There is some degree of isolation, enough to enable them to believe that they had isolated the factors that people thought of as plausible."
2018.18-966,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3273.04,3273.56,"Yeah, I mean --"
2018.18-966,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3273.56,3274.8,Would it be right to say --
2018.18-966,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3274.8,3275.44,-- there are a million factors.
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3275.44,3275.72,Yes.
2018.18-966,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3275.72,3276.84,"There's pet dogs, you know."
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3276.84,3277.04,Yes.
2018.18-966,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3277.04,3278.36,"I mean, there are cats."
2018.18-966,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3312.6,3315.08,-- find any such place in the record.
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3315.08,3323.24,"Nobody proposed, that I know of, proposed factors that might be alternative explanations that should have been tested for."
2018.18-966,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3323.24,3330.0,"And -- and would it be right to say, General, that it was the Census Bureau's conclusion, a bureau full of statisticians --"
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3330.0,3330.28,Yes.
2018.18-966,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3330.28,3336.04,-- that it was the citizen -- citizenship question that was driving the differential response rates?
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3336.04,3337.48,That is -- that is correct.
2018.18-966,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3338.32,3348.36,Are there other -- are there other questions on the census for which the administrative records provide more accurate information?
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3348.36,3352.72,There is nothing in the record about that.
2018.18-966,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3352.72,3355.76,"Well, then I don't want to hear about it."
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3355.76,3356.92,Okay.
2018.18-966,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3357.76,3368.96,"Could you answer the General's point that, if you rely on 6(c), then you shouldn't be even asking this on the ACS form?"
2018.18-966,1,18121,barbara_d_underwood,,3368.96,3369.88,No.
2018.18-966,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3408.24,3418.84,"Thank you. Thank you, General. Mr. Ho."
2018.18-966,2,63128,dale_e_ho,,3418.84,3455.96,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Secretary's decision rested primarily on one assertion, that it would improve the accuracy of citizenship data provided to the Department of Justice. But the administrative record revealed precisely the opposite, that it would make that data less accurate and, thus, harm the Secretary's stated purpose of Voting Rights Act enforcement. And the Secretary's explanation for his decision misstated the evidence in the record in three critical respects. First, the Secretary asserted that adding the question would maximize the Census Bureau's ability to use administrative records on citizenship."
2018.18-966,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3583.64,3596.64,"But this takes us back, does it not, if I'm following your argument, to the 22.6 million people who will answer the citizenship question but as to whom there aren't administrative records? That's what you're talking about?"
2018.18-966,2,63128,dale_e_ho,,3596.64,3597.88,"Yes, Justice Alito."
2018.18-966,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3597.88,3598.32,Okay.
2018.18-966,2,63128,dale_e_ho,,3625.16,3629.52,"Justice Alito, respectfully, I think the Census Bureau said a little bit more than trust us."
2018.18-966,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3637.44,3642.48,"Yeah, well, they said, in our opinion, this would be better, but they can't quantify it."
2018.18-966,2,63128,dale_e_ho,,3647.68,3655.84,"They do say that it would be more accurate than responses to the citizenship question, which they do quantify as being incorrect one-third of the time for non-citizens."
2018.18-966,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3656.72,3656.92,But it is a --
2018.18-966,2,63128,dale_e_ho,,3656.92,3658.0,-- Justice Kavanaugh's --
2018.18-966,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3658.0,3658.4,Go -- go ahead.
2018.18-966,2,63128,dale_e_ho,,3658.4,3659.28,"Oh, I'm sorry."
2018.18-966,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3669.48,3671.12,"I'm sorry, just to -- what can't?"
2018.18-966,2,63128,dale_e_ho,,3671.12,3671.36,I'm sorry.
2018.18-966,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3671.36,3673.0,"I lost sight of the ""it"" in your answer."
2018.18-966,2,63128,dale_e_ho,,3673.0,3676.96,"The Secretary's question, Mr. Chief -- the Secretary's decision, Mr. Chief Justice."
2018.18-966,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3677.72,3682.96,I thought you were talking about whether it's helpful with respect to the voting rights information.
2018.18-966,2,63128,dale_e_ho,,3682.96,3684.4,That's right.
2018.18-966,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3742.8,3743.64,"Well, when we --"
2018.18-966,2,63128,dale_e_ho,,3743.64,3745.08,-- at that granular block-by-block level.
2018.18-966,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3745.08,3779.72,"Well, when we talk about the block-by-block level, one of the complaints that we've heard from the other side is that the data that we rely on from the ACS is at too high a level and that the census goes down to a more granular level. And, in fact, some of the states who are now Respondents before us have in litigation, including in this Court, argued that ACS data should not be relied upon for purposes of citizenship or other purposes, that the census data is more accurate. What do we do about that? It seems to me like you kind of put the government in a bit of a Catch 22."
2018.18-966,2,63128,dale_e_ho,,3785.2,3788.32,"Justice Gorsuch, let me say two things in response to that."
2018.18-966,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3801.56,3806.12,"Well, we -- we know states have argued this, including some of the Respondents before us."
2018.18-966,2,63128,dale_e_ho,,3807.96,3821.8,"Okay, that -- that's fair. But what the Census Bureau recommended was that it could develop that block-level data either with existing ACS data or using administrative records and that that would be, in fact, the best and most accurate way to do that."
2018.18-966,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3821.92,3829.28,So -- so the states that said previously that wasn't enough now are going in all future litigation to bind themselves to accept that it is enough?
2018.18-966,2,63128,dale_e_ho,,3829.28,3830.0,Well --
2018.18-966,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3830.0,3831.32,Are you prepared to say that?
2018.18-966,2,63128,dale_e_ho,,3831.32,3838.36,"-- Justice Gorsuch, we've never taken -- our clients have never taken that position, and I -- I'm not aware of my organization ever taking that position in litigation."
2018.18-966,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3838.36,3859.28,"And how -- how about the underreporting or the folks who stop and break off answering the long form and -- and we're asked to believe that that's solely attributable to this question? We have a whole bunch of states that say that, in fact, the break-off rate because of that question, at that question, is something like 0.36 percent."
2018.18-966,2,63128,dale_e_ho,,3859.28,3859.56,Well --
2018.18-966,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3859.56,3884.24,"So that it's very difficult to understand why that question would be the cause of people stopping answering, whereas another possible explanation that hasn't been explored, as I understand it at least, is the length of the form itself may deter those with less means and less time to fill them out, just as simple as that, and we don't know. And what do we do with the fact that we don't know?"
2018.18-966,2,63128,dale_e_ho,,3884.24,3889.24,"Justice Gorsuch, the Census Bureau's conclusion was that the most likely explanation was the citizenship question."
2018.18-966,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3975.04,3976.04,It seems to me --
2018.18-966,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3976.04,3976.4,So --
2018.18-966,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3976.4,3977.52,Go ahead.
2018.18-966,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3977.52,3980.68,"-- I was just -- what is the ""it"" in that sentence? What did the Secretary not address?"
2018.18-966,2,63128,dale_e_ho,,3980.68,3991.96,"He did not address the fact that because of the bureau's disclosure avoidance protocols, it can only provide estimates of citizenship at the block level. If I could, let me explain why."
2018.18-966,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4024.64,4029.04,"Well, this is -- this gets really, really technical, but -- well, and your -- I'm sorry."
2018.18-966,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4029.04,4030.24,"No, go ahead."
2018.18-966,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4030.24,4031.52,That's -- that's fine.
2018.18-966,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4031.52,4032.0,Okay.
2018.18-966,2,63128,dale_e_ho,,4032.8,4058.8,"Thank you, Your Honors."
2018.18-966,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4058.8,4061.16,Mr. Letter.
2018.18-966,3,21108,douglas_n_letter,,4061.16,4073.12,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I just want to say right upfront the Speaker of the House wishes to thank the Justices for their courtesy in hearing from the House today."
2018.18-966,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4073.12,4074.6,Tell her she's welcome. (Laughter.)
2018.18-966,3,21108,douglas_n_letter,,4074.6,4075.24,Thank you.
2018.18-966,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4168.36,4183.8,"But do you think that any decrease in the actual count, if -- if you add any question beyond counting people, and that decreases the actual count to any degree, then that additional question is improper?"
2018.18-966,3,21108,douglas_n_letter,,4183.8,4188.56,"Justice Alito, I -- I'm sure that -- that the Court would find there's a de minimis exception."
2018.18-966,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4224.56,4271.96,"Mr. Letter, I'm sure you've given this some thought, but -- I know you have. In terms of assessing what a reasonable relationship is, what do we do with the history and the fact that this question has been on for what a long time was the only form in the census through almost all of our history, and it continues to be asked today in the long form or in the ACS. It's not like this question or anybody in the room is suggesting that the question is improper to ask in some way, shape, or form. And what we do as well with the evidence of practice around the world and virtually every English-speaking country and a great many others besides ask this question in their censuses? So I'm sure you've given consideration -- thought -- thoughtful consideration to those questions."
2018.18-966,3,21108,douglas_n_letter,,4271.96,4311.48,"Absolutely, Your Honor, although I can tell that you also have. First of all, I don't know if the other countries that are listed, for instance, in the -- the U.N. recommendations have an actual Enumeration Clause written into their constitution that is of paramount importance. So I'm not sure that, when -- when the U.N. made that recommendation, that that matters for the United States. Second, Your Honor, the -- if -- there -- there are other factors that would undermine actual enumeration. There is no evidence in the record here."
2018.18-966,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4353.04,4386.52,"Mr. Letter, the -- Congress has the primary control over what the census will be, not the executive, and Congress has been alerted to this citizenship question for some time, and it has done nothing about it. So one question is, who should decide? Congress is silent."
2018.18-966,3,21108,douglas_n_letter,,4388.04,4392.32,"It's a very fair question, Your Honor."
2018.18-966,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4458.2,4470.32,"I thought all the information available, as I understand it, leads to only one answer, and so why isn't that answer sufficient for them to take whatever action they consider appropriate?"
2018.18-966,3,21108,douglas_n_letter,,4470.32,4472.04,"The -- I'm sorry, Chief Justice."
2018.18-966,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4472.04,4480.6,"Well, we've been told there was no basis for the Secretary to make any decision, other than the recommendation that was submitted to him by the bureau, because that's the evidence."
2018.18-966,3,21108,douglas_n_letter,,4491.68,4494.84,We want to know what -- you -- you decided otherwise.
2018.18-966,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4510.76,4524.44,"Well, I thought Justice Ginsburg's question went more to why doesn't Congress prohibit the asking of a citizenship question in the same way that Congress has explicitly provided that no one can be compelled to provide religious information?"
2018.18-966,3,21108,douglas_n_letter,,4524.44,4524.84,Right.
2018.18-966,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4540.8,4562.72,"On the -- on the statute, I had one question, which is you make a good first principles point about enumeration being the purpose of the census. But it turns out that the census, as you know, has been used for lots of other statistical and demographic collection purposes throughout -- throughout our history. So it's not just for enumeration."
2018.18-966,3,21108,douglas_n_letter,,4581.48,4583.2,Your Honor is exactly right.
2018.18-966,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4611.28,4616.56,"Well, assuming there is review and assuming it's arbitrary and capricious, as you know, it's deferential."
2018.18-966,3,21108,douglas_n_letter,,4616.56,4617.28,Yes.
2018.18-966,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4617.28,4643.64,"And the question I think here is a policy judgment that it's more important to get accurate citizenship information even at the expense, potentially, of a slight decrease, potentially, in response rates. And the question is: Given the statutes, why does that judgment fall below the standard of reasonableness in assessing the different policy considerations?"
2018.18-966,3,21108,douglas_n_letter,,4643.64,4657.64,"Our position is that, one, the Justice Department can get this information elsewhere, as we know. But, two, you can't undermine the accuracy of the actual enumeration in order to get information --"
2018.18-966,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4657.64,4657.76,So --
2018.18-966,3,21108,douglas_n_letter,,4657.76,4658.96,-- for the Voting Rights Act.
2018.18-966,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4658.96,4667.04,"-- the constitutional backdrop, I think, if I'm translating your argument, means that anything that would undermine the enumeration is impermissible and unreasonable?"
2018.18-966,3,21108,douglas_n_letter,,4667.04,4682.28,"I believe so, Your Honor. And the only thing -- the only addition I would make to that is, as I said to Justice Alito, undoubtedly, there's a de minimis determination. But, again, this Court is -- this Court is the expert on the Constitution. Thank you, Your Honor."
2018.18-966,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4682.28,4685.52,"Thank you, counsel. Four minutes, General Francisco."
2018.18-966,4,37093,noel_j_francisco,,4685.52,4687.56,"Mr. Chief Justice, thank you."
2018.18-966,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4797.56,4797.8,I --
2018.18-966,4,37093,noel_j_francisco,,4797.8,4800.56,"-- ""will affect the accuracy of the count."" And --"
2018.18-966,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4800.56,4824.72,"-- I thought that Dr. Abowd stated and the district court found that the follow-up process was, at best, riddled with a number of -- of -- of inadequacies and that it wouldn't be adequate enough to take care of the shortfall."
2018.18-966,4,37093,noel_j_francisco,,4824.72,4838.52,"Well, we can debate about whether it would be adequate enough, but in order to say that the final self-response rate would drop by 5.1 percent, you have to conclude that it's zero percent accurate. And I don't think that there's any basis in the record to conclude that it's --"
2018.18-966,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4838.52,4839.48,So how much accuracy --
2018.18-966,4,37093,noel_j_francisco,,4839.48,4840.44,-- zero percent accurate.
2018.18-966,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4840.68,4846.96,-- would be -- let's assume it were 5.8 or something close to it.
2018.18-966,4,37093,noel_j_francisco,,4849.68,4852.36,"Your Honor, I think --"
2018.18-966,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4852.36,4853.76,-- inconsequential?
2018.18-966,4,37093,noel_j_francisco,,4853.76,4858.0,-- I think that that is largely an impossible question to answer.
2018.18-966,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4874.72,4875.44,That's why you keep --
2018.18-966,4,37093,noel_j_francisco,,4875.44,4875.72,-- my friend's --
2018.18-966,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4875.72,4876.6,-- the short form.
2018.18-966,4,37093,noel_j_francisco,,4876.6,4894.04,"Right, Your Honor. And under my friend's on the other side's position, you are effectively empowering any group in the country to knock off any question on the census if they simply get together and boycott it. There are many people in this country who might find the sex question objectionable because it limits individuals to a binary choice."
2018.18-966,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4898.68,4898.84,General --
2018.18-966,4,37093,noel_j_francisco,,4898.84,4899.52,-- as long as you include --
2018.18-966,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4899.52,4899.68,General --
2018.18-966,4,37093,noel_j_francisco,,4899.68,4901.92,"-- that sex question, you're effectively empowering --"
2018.18-966,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4901.92,4902.56,"General, are you --"
2018.18-966,4,37093,noel_j_francisco,,4902.56,4903.24,-- them to knock that off --
2018.18-966,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4903.24,4903.8,-- suggesting --
2018.18-966,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4903.8,4904.4,Justice Sotomayor.
2018.18-966,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4904.4,4910.04,"Are you suggesting -- are you suggesting that Hispanics are boycotting the census, that they --"
2018.18-966,4,37093,noel_j_francisco,,4910.04,4910.2,Not --
2018.18-966,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4910.2,4917.12,"Are you suggesting they don't have, whether it's rational or not, that they don't have a legitimate fear?"
2018.18-966,4,37093,noel_j_francisco,,4917.12,4919.84,"Not in the slightest, Your Honor."
2018.18-966,4,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4921.0,4921.28,So --
2018.18-966,4,37093,noel_j_francisco,,4921.28,4938.0,"-- of my friend's theory on the other side is that it countenances precisely that type of coordinated behavior that would empower groups to knock off any question of the census that they found to be particularly objectionable. Mr. Chief Justice, unless the Court has further questions?"
2018.18-966,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4938.0,4938.44,We're all done.
2018.18-966,4,37093,noel_j_francisco,,4938.44,4939.32,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2018.18-966,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4939.32,4940.04,"Thank you, General."
