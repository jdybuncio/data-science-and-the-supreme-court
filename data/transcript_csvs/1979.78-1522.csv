1979.78-1522,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,65.191,"We will hear arguments next in 78-1522, Andrus v. Utah."
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,66.993,70.568,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1522,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,197.632,200.46,"How many sections in a full township, 32?"
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,200.46,201.148,36.
1979.78-1522,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,201.148,201.477,36.
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,201.477,202.875,That's right.
1979.78-1522,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,211.254,216.874,Why has it taken the secretary so long to pass on any of these selections?
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,216.874,222.51,"Well, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, there are a variety of reasons which we've set out in some detail in the brief."
1979.78-1522,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,237.128,252.575,"I can see where there could be a delay of several years, and I can see why there could be delays on particular sections, but to just have a complete blockage for a period of more than ten years strikes me as quite unusual."
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,252.575,259.166,"Well, I mean, for one thing this case has been in litigation now for five years, so that takes it back to 1974."
1979.78-1522,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,305.309,310.623,"There has also been a change in policy in the Department of the Interior, hasn't there?"
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,315.813,317.831,Not to the best of my knowledge.
1979.78-1522,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,317.831,318.446,I thought there --
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,318.446,322.568,-- the district value policy is still the policy of the Department of the Interior.
1979.78-1522,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,322.568,333.352,But I thought it had not been the -- the department did not follow that policy at an earlier date?
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,333.352,336.458,"Well, you have to understand the chronology here."
1979.78-1522,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,388.626,391.866,But he didn't get the legislation?
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,391.866,393.539,"No, he did not."
1979.78-1522,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,393.539,405.551,"But then, how long has he been following formally the equal value concept?"
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,405.551,453.078,"Well, the first statement signed by the Secretary of the Interior is dated January 16, I believe, 1967, but in answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question, when I said he had been following it since '63, I was basing it on the fact that there was this series of communications between Representative Aspinall, the Chairman of the House Committee on the Interior, and the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Interior, which discussed the general question of his discretion under Section 7 of the Taylor Grazing Act and the applicability or the availability of that discretion as a means of importing this evaluation policy into the process of ruling on indemnity selections."
1979.78-1522,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,625.779,635.995,"Now, as you understand your brother's position, is that position that the Taylor Grazing Act, particularly Section 7 thereof, is wholly inapplicable?"
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,635.995,637.673,Yes.
1979.78-1522,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,639.749,640.731,That's what I thought.
1979.78-1522,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,640.731,650.8,"Mr. Buscemi, you referred to Secretary Udall's approval of the memorandum on pages 43 through 45 of the appendix."
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,659.789,661.715,Yes.
1979.78-1522,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,661.715,664.949,"The department has, then, changed policy?"
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,664.949,669.838,"Well, the date of the solicitor's opinion is September 1962."
1979.78-1522,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,700.56,717.609,And to that extent the present policy does not stand on quite the same footing as if it had been contemporaneous and consistently followed under the traditional rules we've applied in giving validity to administrative interpretation of congressional acts?
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,717.609,721.77,"Well, that is right to a limited extent."
1979.78-1522,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,746.799,749.348,With respect to mineral lands?
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,749.348,758.666,"Well, the grossly disparate value policy as it is stated in that memorandum applies to all lands, and there is no limitation to mineral lands."
1979.78-1522,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,759.465,775.535,"So to that extent the policy, one way or another, would predate the statute permitting mineral lands to be selected?"
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,775.535,777.891,"I am sorry, I don't think I understand your question."
1979.78-1522,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,777.891,794.596,"Well, the first time the disparate value issue might have come up, wouldn't be when the mineral lands were approved as open to selection?"
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,796.672,813.487,"Well, the possibility for it is older than that, certainly, but I think the point is that the likelihood that such a problem would arise was substantially increased in 1958 with the congressional decision to allow states to select mineral lands."
1979.78-1522,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,819.931,832.438,"Well, are you saying that if there ever was a policy the other way, that's contrary to what you're now pushing, it was only between '58 and '62?"
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,832.438,832.566,Well --
1979.78-1522,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,832.566,836.965,"Only then, because that's when they first began hassling about it?"
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,836.965,845.833,"Well, Mr. Justice White, my point is that between '36 and 1958, I don't know what every approval of indemnity selection involved."
1979.78-1522,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,846.841,849.796,"Well, was there a policy during that time that you can point to, or not?"
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,849.796,854.166,I cannot point to any statement of a grossly disparate value policy between '36 --
1979.78-1522,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,854.166,862.177,"Well, the solicitor in 1962 stated a position that you don't now agree with?"
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,862.177,862.951,That's right.
1979.78-1522,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,862.951,865.896,"Well, had that been a policy of the department?"
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,865.896,868.118,Not as far as I know.
1979.78-1522,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,871.995,875.831,That's the first time that anybody in the department had really said anything about it?
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,875.831,878.086,I think that that's basically true.
1979.78-1522,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,883.766,887.76,So there wasn't any policy in the department prior to then?
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,887.76,895.954,"Well, to the extent that the department had to act on individual state selections, they obviously had a method of determining whether to approve or disapprove."
1979.78-1522,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,895.954,902.697,"You think there was a practice which reflected such a policy, even though the policy itself was inarticulated?"
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,902.697,908.3,"Well, I simply don't know, because in the indemnity selection rulings, I don't think that there is any discussion of the --"
1979.78-1522,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,908.3,909.155,You can't tell.
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,909.155,909.751,-- values.
1979.78-1522,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,910.127,911.928,Maybe I misunderstood.
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,922.729,935.215,"Well, that certainly provided the major impetus, but I can't deny that there may have been some indemnity selection before 1958 that for timber or other reasons involved lands that were substantially more valuable than the lost land."
1979.78-1522,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,935.215,938.784,Should be the fertility of the land; I mean desert land against very fertile farmland.
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,938.784,939.109,Precisely.
1979.78-1522,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,939.109,944.26,"It was never formalized, whatever the policy was, if there was one."
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,944.26,947.077,That's right.
1979.78-1522,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,947.077,955.479,Do you know the length of Congressman Aspinall's tenure as chairman of this House Interior Subcommittee?
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,955.479,957.985,"No, I don't."
1979.78-1522,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,957.985,964.191,"Well, you shouldn't be blamed for not remembering that long."
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,970.991,978.249,"Now, the critical issue in this case, I think, as we have seen, is the relationship between the indemnity selection statute and the Taylor Grazing Act."
1979.78-1522,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1043.212,1055.656,"When you say he had complete control, you don't mean that he could simply flatly refuse to allow a newly admitted state any sections?"
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1055.656,1056.538,Not at all.
1979.78-1522,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1056.538,1056.707,Well --
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1056.707,1069.887,"What I mean to say, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, is that the 1826 statute said in I think so many words, the Secretary of the Treasury, because there was no Secretary of the Interior then, ""shall select the lands for the state."""
1979.78-1522,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1154.421,1169.362,"You think the secretary is under any duty to act within any time limit or reasonable time on a state's request for lieu lands or state selection of lieu lands, assuming that he does have discretion?"
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1169.362,1173.605,"Well, I think it's certainly true that the secretary should act as expeditiously as possible."
1979.78-1522,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1280.754,1282.45,Don't you have to accept them?
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1282.45,1282.93,Yes.
1979.78-1522,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1294.289,1304.267,"Can you point anything on the, in the debates or in the committee reports, which looks unfavorably on Payne-Wyoming?"
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1304.267,1308.471,You mean to say the debates in the --
1979.78-1522,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1308.471,1309.506,Anything in the legislative history.
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1309.506,1312.984,No.
1979.78-1522,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1329.485,1333.454,"But its basic thrust was to open up more public lands, wasn't it?"
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1336.066,1337.761,"I don't believe that's so, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1979.78-1522,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1369.168,1378.073,But the grazing districts themselves would then be subject to Taylor Grazing Act leases to private individuals?
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1378.073,1378.806,Well --
1979.78-1522,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1378.806,1385.481,"I mean, you don't have a grazing districts, and the idea wasn't the government was going to graze cattle on those grazing districts."
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1385.481,1387.217,"No, that's not what I mean to say."
1979.78-1522,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1489.289,1501.442,"Did the 1947 case distinguish between the various four nouns, settlement, location, entry, or --"
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1501.442,1505.148,"Not that I remember, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1979.78-1522,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1544.611,1551.995,What's wrong with the House report you cite on page 55 and 56 of your brief?
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1566.862,1574.681,"Yes, I agree, Mr. Justice White, but I understood Mr. Justice Blackmun's question to concern the legislative history of the '34 act at the time it was adopted."
1979.78-1522,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1587.709,1591.347,"Well, this was in connection with amendments."
1979.78-1522,0,37735,peter_buscemi,,1591.347,1594.56,"Yes, that's true."
1979.78-1522,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1723.75,1731.808,Mr. Dewsnup.
1979.78-1522,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,1731.808,1738.209,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1522,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1856.084,1860.534,"Well, you describe Utah as though it were like some other states I can think of."
1979.78-1522,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,1860.534,1869.686,"I think it is, but I think Utah had a particular problem in that Utah was settled 50 years before statehood was granted because of polygamy and other problems that delayed it."
1979.78-1522,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1950.906,1958.113,"Do you think the House Interior Committee knew what the secretary was doing, for example?"
1979.78-1522,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,1958.113,1959.951,I doubt it.
1979.78-1522,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1968.11,1976.734,"You don't think the staff and the chairman of the committee, for example, knew how this was being administered?"
1979.78-1522,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,1976.734,1994.446,"With respect to school indemnity selection, there is not any kind of explanation or amplification at all, and if they did, there is no indication, not one word of debate or discussion that congress focused on that issue, that was not an issue of the legislation."
1979.78-1522,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2042.437,2044.338,"When you say ""that policy,"" the equal value policy?"
1979.78-1522,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,2044.338,2046.679,The equal value policy.
1979.78-1522,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2658.713,2664.638,"Ordinarily you don't call a Taylor Grazing Act lease an entry, do you?"
1979.78-1522,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,2664.638,2667.285,A Taylor Grazing lease an entry?
1979.78-1522,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2667.285,2669.279,Yes.
1979.78-1522,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,2669.279,2669.636,No.
1979.78-1522,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3113.569,3138.986,"As a matter of fact, it took an act of Congress in the 1960's in order to prevent mineral usage from being allowed on areas in some of the Western states where homes had been built, did it not?"
1979.78-1522,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,3138.986,3140.496,Yes.
1979.78-1522,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3310.672,3314.885,"Is that the one dated December first, or at least filed here on December first?"
1979.78-1522,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,3314.885,3315.694,October 9.
1979.78-1522,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3322.499,3325.775,"It was filed here in the Court on December first, according to the stamp here."
1979.78-1522,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,3325.775,3330.753,"Oh, fine; I appreciate that for clarification and identification."
1979.78-1522,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3460.876,3467.511,"When you say a reference in the act, do you mean in the text of the act enacted by Congress or in the legislative discussion?"
1979.78-1522,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,3467.511,3482.622,"I am referring here simply to a response by Senator Hayden to attorney Richard Page in the June 35 19 hearings, to a statute that received a pocket veto and never became law."
1979.78-1522,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3585.231,3589.282,"Well, we've given you that extra minute because of the lateness of the filing of this brief."
1979.78-1522,1,39124,richard_l_dewsnup,,3589.282,3591.144,That's an adequate quid pro quo.
1979.78-1522,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3594.131,3598.029,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Buscemi?"
1979.78-1522,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3598.029,3599.087,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.78-1522,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3741.222,3744.854,"Mr. Buscemi, I have a question or two I'd like to ask you."
1979.78-1522,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3757.387,3758.229,"Well, I don't think so."
1979.78-1522,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3761.517,3773.215,"Well, provisions relating to allocation of lieu lands to the states, the Western states, and that sort of thing."
1979.78-1522,2,37735,peter_buscemi,,3773.215,3773.793,Oh.
