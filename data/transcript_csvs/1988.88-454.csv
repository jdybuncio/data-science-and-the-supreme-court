1988.88-454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.398,"We'll hear argument next in No. 88-454, United States against Monsanto."
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,11.179,14.422,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,76.362,81.043,"When you say realized, you don't use that word as synonymous with intended, do you?"
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,81.043,81.694,No.
1988.88-454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,91.751,97.946,Congress I'm sure enacts many laws which have consequences that it doesn't realize.
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,103.331,104.98,--Absolute... absolutely.
1988.88-454,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,154.203,162.528,xxx you're suggesting that perhaps we shouldn't... we shouldn't just take the words Congress used at face value.
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,162.929,167.513,--I'm saying that you cannot do that if one is going to be consonant with Catholic Bishop.
1988.88-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,202.285,211.342,We have later cases after Catholic Bishops that say that you don't avoid constitutional questions by reading a statute to say something it doesn't say.
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,219.458,220.778,This is true.
1988.88-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,220.778,222.441,And there's just no exception here for attorneys' fees.
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,222.441,235.621,"There's no exception for attorneys' fees, but I think what's important is... is that when... when this statute was passed, there was no consideration as to the possible Sixth Amendment ramifications that would exist."
1988.88-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,235.621,238.934,It may have been one of the mistakes that the Chief Justice was referring to.
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,247.6,247.94,Well--
1988.88-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,247.94,249.623,But you're asking us to sort of rewrite the statute--
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,249.623,249.813,--No.
1988.88-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,302.003,303.635,--Do you have a case where we've done that?
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,303.635,307.809,The... excuse me?
1988.88-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,307.809,313.125,"Where we say it would be okay if Congress wanted to do it, but we don't know whether they really wanted to do it."
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,319.913,331.06,"Catholic Bishop suggested it, and I know that Justice O'Connor's opinion in... her concurring opinion in Thompson v. Oklahoma said exactly that."
1988.88-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,363.681,366.065,"It will certainly make our life lot easier up here, I must say."
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,380.576,387.571,"--Well, there is the... the certification procedure as to particular kinds of questions."
1988.88-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,419.487,422.209,We'd use legislative history to decide whether they Seriously co considered or not.
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,425.293,425.972,That's the--
1988.88-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,425.972,429.154,"And if they... if there had been a lot of that discussion there, then it's okay."
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,431.245,431.395,--Well:
1988.88-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,431.395,432.056,--send it back to Congress.
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,443.785,466.692,"--Legislative history might be sufficient if Congress spoke a clear enough of a voice, except the only problem with legislative history, of course, is that when you're dealing with a committee report as opposed... or a House report as opposed to necessarily Congress speaking in terms of the wording of the statute, that would, of course, give the Court the clearest indication."
1988.88-454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,532.497,544.675,"Mr. Chikofsky, suppose we think Congress did make it clear here that all property was subject to forfeiture, including that which could be used for attorneys' fees and food and other necessities."
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,544.675,556.514,Then I think we've got a square sixth Amendment question with regard to whether or nut this has a unconstitutional impact on counsel the defendant's--
1988.88-454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,556.514,556.674,Okay.
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,556.674,558.006,--right to counsel of choice.
1988.88-454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,558.006,563.037,Do you... do you concede that in your case there is no Fifth Amendment due process problem?
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,563.037,565.038,"I make no such concession, Your Honor."
1988.88-454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,565.038,565.459,Why not?
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,570.074,577.229,"Well, the defendant received a hearing, but let me back up a little bit to give the Court a little bit of the procedural context."
1988.88-454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,593.592,594.603,The case is still pretrial.
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,594.603,595.873,--It is not.
1988.88-454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,595.873,596.334,Not.
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,596.334,597.903,There has since been a trial.
1988.88-454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,597.903,598.123,Okay.
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,598.123,601.085,I will... I will take the Court through... through the procedures quickly.
1988.88-454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,761.478,763.591,And then you went back to district court?
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,763.591,764.52,--Excuse me?
1988.88-454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,764.52,766.964,And then it was sent back to the district court.
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,766.964,771.164,It was sent back to the district court while the trial was still in abeyance.
1988.88-454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,839.532,852.958,"Now, although the federal government applied to us for certiorari you filed the opening brief and are making the first argument."
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,852.958,854.22,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1988.88-454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,854.22,857.821,And that's because of the remand and what happened at trial?
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,857.821,862.065,"Well... Well, this was by... this was by agreement--"
1988.88-454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,862.065,862.696,By agreement?
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,862.696,864.398,--This was by agreement with the parties.
1988.88-454,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,875.255,875.455,I see.
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,875.455,876.777,--of the parties.
1988.88-454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,994.628,998.301,He's limited in that respect by his financial means.
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,998.301,1009.658,"--Absolutely he is limited in those financial means, but he may not necessarily be arbitrarily limited by governmental action that chooses to impoverish him."
1988.88-454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1009.658,1016.794,"Well, that chooses to his impoverish him by, in the government's view, reclaiming money that is rightfully the government's not his in the first place."
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,1016.794,1026.319,"Well, but that... and I think this is where I think the Court must consider what the nature of a criminal forfeiture penalty is on the one hand, and also the relation-back doctrine."
1988.88-454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1074.392,1084.81,"Well, so, under... under your theory, the... the defendant in a case like yours could use his money even to hire counsel on appeal."
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,1084.81,1088.163,Well that's a question that's really not before the Court.
1988.88-454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1088.163,1090.805,"Well, but I mean, you're saying until the procedure has been completed."
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,1100.742,1129.772,"Well, the statute, of course, views it in terms of a judgment of conviction and a verdict of conviction and forfeiture, and so that... and perhaps an argument wight be made that perhaps appellate rights might be viewed in a somewhat different context, although as a constitutional matter, I would not like to necessarily bind myself to a conclusion that you would not necessarily on your direct appeal be necessarily bound by that."
1988.88-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1242.644,1243.816,What about medical services?
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,1248.951,1263.251,"Well, Your Honor, I think that there is within the statute itself... I think that under those circumstances, the court might well have the quitable discretion."
1988.88-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1263.251,1264.9,I'm talking about constitutional right.
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,1269.104,1279.552,"Well, I don't... I... I think that there is certainly a lesser constitutional right to... to a doctor necessarily than to a lawyer--"
1988.88-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1279.552,1280.763,Even if it is necessary for your life?
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,1284.073,1316.187,"--Well, then there might... then there might be... and I think Your Honor has... I would stand corrected that, obviously, where there may be a taking under these kinds of circumstances that would affect Fifth Amendment values, the court might well under those kinds of circumstances determine on an individual case basis the nature of the interest that's affected by the deprivation and the defendant's interest and you might get into, as I say, the Mathews v. Eldridge test."
1988.88-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1316.187,1318.086,"--It includes property, too... life, liberty or property."
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,1323.472,1324.153,Well--
1988.88-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1324.153,1328.804,"So, it's a deprivation of property unless you... unless you let me keep this money."
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,1328.804,1332.538,"--Well, I think part of what we must keep in mind here also--"
1988.88-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1332.538,1334.358,I'm suggesting a where-does-it-all-end argument.
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,1335.878,1336.088,--I think it has--
1988.88-454,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1336.088,1338.732,"--that lawyer's fees are something, you know--"
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,1338.732,1354.491,"--I think that there have to be sufficiently flexible procedures that is a... that is to be applied, and that... in terms of deciding matters other than attorneys' fees and counsel fees."
1988.88-454,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1427.284,1452.01,"--Well, you... you talk as though... it's true that counsel of one's choice is... is apparently a value in itself, but there still is left the question of whether this regime the government is insisting one would deprive the defendant of effective counsel."
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,1452.01,1454.292,"Well, I think that what that is doing--"
1988.88-454,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1454.292,1465.371,"Now, let's say... now, I take it that you... you're not making any submission that... that under the government's proposal that you wouldn't have effective counsel."
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,1468.593,1471.215,"--Well, they are different--"
1988.88-454,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1471.215,1471.834,Isn't that right?
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,1471.834,1473.086,--They're... that's correct.
1988.88-454,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1480.142,1482.533,I just wanted to make it clear--
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,1482.533,1482.693,--Absolute--
1988.88-454,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1482.693,1484.105,--clear that that's what you're arguing.
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,1484.105,1484.506,--Exactly.
1988.88-454,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1484.506,1496.506,"Even assuming you would have perfectly adequate counsel under the government's submission, you... this is... it's... the... the... the statute is unconstitutional as construed by the government."
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,1496.506,1497.905,"Absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1988.88-454,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1501.097,1504.41,"And by the way, why did you argue first in this case?"
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,1506.11,1510.734,Counsel for both sides agreed for the convenience of the Court.
1988.88-454,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1511.686,1513.936,"Yes, well, I just... somehow I missed that agreement."
1988.88-454,0,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,1513.936,1515.739,I apologize.
1988.88-454,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1515.739,1518.11,"Thank you, Mr. Chikofsky."
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1518.982,1521.853,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1988.88-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1906.502,1912.486,"Mr. Bryson, could I ask you a question about protective orders?"
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1922.313,1922.564,--Well--
1988.88-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1922.564,1927.028,"--to have this statute work, right, I mean, especially as far as lawyers are concerned."
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1927.028,1931.732,"--Well, I suspect as far as lawyers are concerned, that's probably true, although not necessarily so."
1988.88-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1954.159,1955.641,Right.
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1955.641,1956.74,--bona fide purchasers for value.
1988.88-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1961.845,1962.166,"Right, I understand."
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1962.166,1964.947,But it appears from reading the statute frankly... the money is gone.
1988.88-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1964.947,1965.278,You follow the res.
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1965.428,1966.8,That... that it's gone.
1988.88-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1966.8,1967.06,I understand.
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1967.27,1969.313,And we can't get it from the lawyer.
1988.88-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1980.632,1984.846,But suppose you don't... you don't apply for a protective order.
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2008.435,2017.959,"Well, there... I know of no case in which that situation has arisen because we almost invariably apply for and obtain protective orders in this setting."
1988.88-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2049.693,2063.36,"But it... but it really is the case that as soon as you file an indictment, whether you seek a protective order or not, and therefore whether you have a... some kind of a due process hearing or not, effectively this fellow can't get a good lawyer."
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2063.36,2066.864,--I... I think that is not necessarily so.
1988.88-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2067.733,2067.864,Well--
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2067.864,2068.955,--things that have to happen.
1988.88-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2074.172,2077.304,"--Assuming all his assets... I mean, assuming all his assets are covered by the--"
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2077.304,2079.205,"--Well, there are... that's right."
1988.88-454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2129.508,2131.771,"--Well, what if they become known during the course of the proceedings?"
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2141.017,2148.964,"Well, if they were products of crime, we could... we could either supersede... we could file a superseding indictment naming those specific assets."
1988.88-454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2148.964,2150.994,But does the forfeiture request have to be in the indictment itself?
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2150.994,2151.485,Yes.
1988.88-454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2151.485,2152.506,"It does, okay."
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2152.506,2155.017,"Yes, Rule 7 of the... of the Federal--"
1988.88-454,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2155.017,2156.917,And it has to identify the assets?
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2156.917,2157.338,"--The property, that's right."
1988.88-454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2157.338,2157.478,I see.
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2158.019,2159.098,"Yes, that's right."
1988.88-454,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2176.672,2180.986,That's true even as to assets that are in the possession of the defendant?
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2193.457,2195.4,"Well, only if they are named in the indictment."
1988.88-454,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2198.461,2199.983,"The statute doesn't... the statute doesn't require that, does it?"
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2199.983,2210.872,"--No, but Rule 7 and Rule 31 together have the effect of saying that you... the forfeiture that's entered in the criminal case is limited to those properties that are alleged in the indictment."
1988.88-454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2216.966,2218.338,That's Rule 7 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure?
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2218.338,2218.468,--That's right.
1988.88-454,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2218.468,2218.778,Is that what it is?
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2218.778,2227.814,The... the... it's significant I think to point out that a number of things have to happen in other words for somebody to be denied their right to counsel.
1988.88-454,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2257.408,2260.8,Do you want us to rewrite the rule about counsel of choice?
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2260.8,2261.761,"--No, Your Honor."
1988.88-454,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2263.464,2263.804,xxx.
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2263.804,2269.2,"--entirely consistent with the counsel of choice provision, the... the construction of the Sixth Amendment."
1988.88-454,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2269.2,2275.822,You also assume that you can get counsel of your choice without money?
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2275.822,2286.47,"Your Honor, there's no question that this is in some cases going to mean the difference between getting counsel of choice and ending up with an appointed counsel."
1988.88-454,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2302.593,2305.535,Do you know of any list of lawyers that are willing to work for nothing?
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2305.535,2309.278,"Well, the... nobody is going to be put in a position of having to work for nothing."
1988.88-454,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2318.174,2318.545,Then you're taking--
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2318.545,2320.786,--lawyer who is working for CJA funds.
1988.88-454,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2320.786,2322.657,--Then you're taking over the defense.
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2322.657,2328.754,"Well, not any more than we take over the defense of any defendant who is represented by appointed counsel."
1988.88-454,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2333.698,2335.358,"Well, so other people have also had experience."
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2335.358,2341.022,"--Well, that's right, and... and I think... I think that very often those people do very fine work."
1988.88-454,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2341.022,2344.043,Have you had any experience in... in getting lawyers to defend people?
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2344.043,2347.317,"I have not, no."
1988.88-454,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2375.305,2377.707,You keep stressing this money that belongs to the government.
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2381.87,2382.491,"Well, Your Honor--"
1988.88-454,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2382.491,2383.593,I mean--
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2383.593,2388.354,"--I am sure that... that this is a drop in the bucket, but it is a--"
1988.88-454,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2388.354,2390.778,"--How much... well, how much is involved?"
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2393.738,2396.63,--I don't know what the total amount of forfeitures is.
1988.88-454,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2396.63,2397.992,You've been talking like it's millions.
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2397.992,2398.683,"Well, it is millions."
1988.88-454,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2400.213,2401.395,It's many millions.
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2401.395,2402.717,"Many millions in forfeitures, oh yes."
1988.88-454,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2402.717,2402.794,How many?
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2402.794,2406.056,"I can't tell you the exact figure, but I know it's many millions."
1988.88-454,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2410.39,2413.032,"Well, we're talking about trillions around here now."
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2413.152,2413.372,"--Well, that's true."
1988.88-454,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2422.919,2432.076,"Mr. Bryson, you do not challenge in this case the ruling of the Second Circuit panel on procedural due process."
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2432.076,2433.308,"We don't, no, Your Honor."
1988.88-454,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2434.139,2443.476,The... the Respondents have it in their red brief as question 4.
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2446.357,2447.887,"--Not I don't think it is, Your Honor."
1988.88-454,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2507.133,2510.165,Your opponent thinks there was a question as to it.
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2510.165,2511.243,"He does, and he can present, that question."
1988.88-454,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2534.342,2535.402,It did not rule on the procedural due process.
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2535.402,2538.183,"--And it did not address the procedural question, not the on banc court."
1988.88-454,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2616.761,2620.304,"Well, it Isn't all that clear to me what the section means."
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2624.308,2634.054,"Well, Your Honor, I think what it does is... and... and the... you have to look at the purpose underlying the restraining order provision as... as indicated, both in the statute and in the legislative history."
1988.88-454,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2641.86,2648.833,"Well, does the district court have discretion to permit the money to be used for attorneys' fees?"
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2648.833,2651.985,"Your Honor, the... no is our... is the short answer to that."
1988.88-454,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2678.275,2680.305,"Well, a bond is one of the opt ions--"
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2680.305,2680.456,--That's right.
1988.88-454,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2680.456,2681.027,--given In the statute.
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2681.027,2681.167,That's right.
1988.88-454,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2681.878,2688.122,That's what I suggested that maybe the... the court's discretion is limited to the three options In the statute.
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2688.122,2692.526,"--Well, I think there may be other situations where the court may not want to grant a restraining order."
1988.88-454,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2692.526,2693.167,Like what?
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2693.167,2701.565,"Well, the... in the Caplin & Drysdale casein for example, Caplin & Drysdale took the $25,000 check and put it an escrow account."
1988.88-454,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2706.346,2706.487,Uh-huh.
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2706.487,2711.362,"I could understand a court saying Caplin & Drysdale is a reputable firm, They aren't going to spend these monies."
1988.88-454,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2716.146,2723.8,Would be an abuse of discretion if the trial court were to say I'm Just going to deny this and let him use the money--
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2723.8,2723.93,Yes.
1988.88-454,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2723.93,2726.253,--for an operation or attorneys' fees or what have you?
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2726.253,2732.779,"Yes, and the reason is this, and this is the crux of our disagreement with points two and point three of... of the argument."
1988.88-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2763.481,2768.604,"xxx so, and... and if it did, you would... you would be wise simply never to apply for--"
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2768.604,2769.285,Yes.
1988.88-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2769.285,2770.066,--a protective order--
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2770.066,2770.596,That's right.
1988.88-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2770.596,2772.669,--at least if you wanted to deprive--
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2772.669,2772.889,That's--
1988.88-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2772.889,2773.888,--your opponent of counsel.
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2773.888,2775.04,--That's exactly right.
1988.88-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2775.04,2776.99,Because you don't need one to do that as we--
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2776.99,2777.341,That's right.
1988.88-454,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2777.341,2778.492,--as we discussed earlier.
1988.88-454,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2778.492,2786.139,"And Section C, as we view it, simply does... does nothing to altar that regime."
1988.88-454,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2878.068,2879.347,"Thank you, Mr. Bryson."
1988.88-454,2,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,2882.399,2892.435,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1988.88-454,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3006.957,3015.321,"Well, why wouldn't it be reasonable to... for Congress to say that where post-indictment, you have a finding of probable cause by a grand jury, and before that you don't?"
1988.88-454,2,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,3015.321,3034.363,"Well, because of the fact that It is not required... and as he noted in our briefs, and particularly citing the Grammatikos case, that there is no requirement that the grand Jury in its return of an Indictment enumerating forfeiture counts find probable cause or even consider probable cause."
1988.88-454,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3094.431,3103.934,It may be that the Rule 7 should be construed to require the specification of the particular asset.
1988.88-454,2,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,3103.934,3110.129,"Well, the... the... I think that it would... that It might be perhaps even better rather than to--"
1988.88-454,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3110.129,3114.313,The government seems to say that's... that... that their rule requires it.
1988.88-454,2,22122,edward_m_chikofsky,,3114.313,3118.396,"--Well, I think that the courts seem to be at variance with the government."
1988.88-454,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3125.75,3127.9,Thank your Mr. Chikofsky.
