1977.76-5344,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,16.309,"First case on for argument this morning is number 76-5344, Moore against Illinois."
1977.76-5344,0,37972,patrick_j_hughes_jr,,20.366,26.243,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-5344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,209.201,210.41,Mr. Hughes.
1977.76-5344,0,37972,patrick_j_hughes_jr,,222.441,223.219,"Well, no sir."
1977.76-5344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,228.894,230.816,So this is just an excerpt on report?
1977.76-5344,0,37972,patrick_j_hughes_jr,,230.816,232.337,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1977.76-5344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,366.582,373.072,You think your first contention was treated by the Supreme Court of Illinois in its opinion?
1977.76-5344,0,37972,patrick_j_hughes_jr,,373.072,374.863,"No, we do not think that was treated sir."
1977.76-5344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,374.863,377.61,Was it ever treated in any other state court proceeding?
1977.76-5344,0,37972,patrick_j_hughes_jr,,377.61,380.492,It -- it was not treated -- there was -- there were only two.
1977.76-5344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,383.593,385.302,And that was not treated into those proceedings?
1977.76-5344,0,37972,patrick_j_hughes_jr,,385.302,385.81,No.
1977.76-5344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,407.981,410.804,But was it pursued in the Supreme Court of Illinois?
1977.76-5344,0,37972,patrick_j_hughes_jr,,410.804,414.907,"It was not pursued as such in the Supreme Court of Illinois in terms of right to counsel, no sir."
1977.76-5344,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,414.907,418.19,What do you do about the exhausting requirement of habeas?
1977.76-5344,0,37972,patrick_j_hughes_jr,,418.19,432.152,"We are -- clearly the issue of violation of Wade, Stovall and Gilbert is -- was raised in the state -- in the Illinois Supreme Court."
1977.76-5344,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,532.423,548.408,"Prior -- prior to this courtroom episode, there have been at least two, I guess there were two opportunities for her -- exhibits to her various photographs, have they not?"
1977.76-5344,0,37972,patrick_j_hughes_jr,,548.408,549.495,Yes sir.
1977.76-5344,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,549.495,551.535,And what happened to those?
1977.76-5344,0,37972,patrick_j_hughes_jr,,551.535,567.916,The first one was a group of about 200 from which she selected people who had the general -- physical characteristics of -- of the person that she -- that she described as her assailant. It was not intended to pick out any person and she clearly did not.
1977.76-5344,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,568.474,571.618,What was its purpose?
1977.76-5344,0,37972,patrick_j_hughes_jr,,571.618,578.837,"The purpose apparently was to narrow down as much as possible, the number of possible suspects."
1977.76-5344,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,578.837,584.091,"And she did not, was -- did not have as its purpose any effort for her to identify her assailant?"
1977.76-5344,0,37972,patrick_j_hughes_jr,,584.091,610.777,"Well, I presume that one of the police’s interest -- one of the police interest was to have her make an identification if possible, but it was clear in her mind and I think clear on the detective’s testimony because they testified at the hearing on the motion to suppress the identification at trial that essentially that viewing was of a large number, it was almost like the police folder book which in some jurisdictions is kept in the police’s station."
1977.76-5344,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,615.865,616.837,Some 200 pictures --
1977.76-5344,0,37972,patrick_j_hughes_jr,,616.837,617.177,Some 200 yes.
1977.76-5344,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,617.177,618.791,of 200 different people?
1977.76-5344,0,37972,patrick_j_hughes_jr,,618.791,621.45,"200, probably 200 different people, yes sir."
1977.76-5344,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,623.395,624.543,And then the second one?
1977.76-5344,0,37972,patrick_j_hughes_jr,,624.543,629.333,Then the second one she was shown approximately between 9 and 12.
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,1874.843,1881.969,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-5344,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1920.416,1922.123,"Now why was he there, at all?"
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,1929.023,1934.049,"Complaint was filed prior to arrest, Your Honor."
1977.76-5344,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1934.049,1938.945,"Or does this happen just if he has been arrested, even if no complaint has been filed?"
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,1938.945,1941.231,It happens even if no complaint has been filed.
1977.76-5344,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1941.231,1941.46,Anybody --
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,1941.46,1942.33,-- generally a complaint is filed --
1977.76-5344,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1942.33,1947.994,Anybody who has been arrested is brought before the Court rather promptly and the purpose is to set bond?
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,1947.994,1959.641,"Purpose is to set bond. On a complaint filed prior to the arrest, a tentative bond is set, but you are still brought before the Court to -- for a bond hearing."
1977.76-5344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1959.641,1964.496,But this complaint was not filed before the arrest?
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,1964.496,1965.659,"Apparently it was not Your Honor, no."
1977.76-5344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1965.659,1968.131,Apparently the record shows that it was not?
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,1968.131,1969.084,"That is correct Your Honor, I am sorry."
1977.76-5344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1969.084,1973.112,"Well, why was he arrested, stick to the record?"
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,1973.112,1973.936,I will Your Honor.
1977.76-5344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1973.936,1974.864,If you can.
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,1974.864,1980.235,"I do not, I can Your Honor to the best of my ability."
1977.76-5344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2042.429,2049.734,"I am not -- I am not a being critical, but on that basis you say it is unimportant as to who did actually lead the arrest?"
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2049.734,2052.791,"No, I am not saying it is unimportant, Your Honor."
1977.76-5344,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2052.791,2054.094,It is not an issue in this case?
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2054.094,2054.695,It is not an issue in this case.
1977.76-5344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2054.695,2056.469,"Right, right, right, right."
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2056.469,2060.61,It is never -- the probable cause for the arrest has never been shown below in a state courts or in the federal court.
1977.76-5344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2060.61,2062.692,May that be --
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2062.692,2064.257,That is correct.
1977.76-5344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2064.257,2071.534,"Getting her to sign the complaint, after he was arrested was just an abundance of (Inaudible)."
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2071.534,2073.559,"No, it was necessary to file a complaint, anyway."
1977.76-5344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2073.559,2079.313,"Oh! It was, okay, but under Illinois law at some time, they had to file the complaint?"
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2079.313,2089.025,"Yes Your Honor and when a arrest is made prior to filing complaint, Illinois law requires it to be filed as fast as possible."
1977.76-5344,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2089.025,2092.55,"Sometimes as I suppose is filed by the -- by the police, by the arresting officer, is it not?"
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2092.55,2095.864,"Yes it is, yes it is."
1977.76-5344,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2146.431,2148.019,It is in the appendix?
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2148.019,2148.489,Pardon?
1977.76-5344,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2148.489,2150.278,"You are talking about, it is the appendix?"
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2150.278,2151.913,"Yes, it is Your Honor."
1977.76-5344,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2155.899,2156.94,"68, thank you."
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2156.94,2160.862,Yes.
1977.76-5344,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2184.42,2185.154,Looked like the man?
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2185.154,2194.25,"She said, it looks like the man, but I would like to see him in person and I think did indicate that she was using some care in the identification."
1977.76-5344,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2340.34,2344.876,Does this case really not parse down to this question?
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2394.507,2395.633,That is correct.
1977.76-5344,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2474.515,2489.057,Your comments are -- seem to be premised on the assertion that there was a right to counsel at this hearing that took place and I take it your brief indicates that you or at least you assume there is a right to counsel.
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2495.076,2510.015,"I do not think there is any doubt in this case, Your Honor that the confrontation that occurred on December 21st, 1967 was in the midst or after the institution of a criminal charge."
1977.76-5344,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2510.015,2524.855,"So you think there was a right to counsel under Wade or Gilbert, you think the right to counsel that did -- had attached and that there was a violation of it and you just argue about whether what the consequences are."
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2524.855,2529.373,"If Wade and Gilbert apply to this case, as this is lineup as --"
1977.76-5344,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2529.373,2531.137,"Well, how about -- what is -- what is your position?"
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2533.194,2538.178,"My position, Your Honor is this that there was a prior identification in this case."
1977.76-5344,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2552.078,2563.397,"You are going to argue now about -- about whether the identification was reliable, then how about the right to counsel at the hearing right?"
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2563.397,2570.799,"If Wade and Gilbert and I maintain it that they do not, if they apply to this type of situation where an individual was --"
1977.76-5344,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2570.799,2572.943,What is your position about whether they apply or not?
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2572.943,2577.322,This is -- I am getting to that Your Honor.
1977.76-5344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2623.938,2630.139,"Well, is it true that she did not want to sign a complaint?"
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2630.139,2634.594,"I do not recall that from the record, Your Honor."
1977.76-5344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2634.594,2637.505,"Well, she did not sign it until that day, did she?"
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2637.505,2639.265,"She did sign on that day, yes."
1977.76-5344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2639.265,2647.461,"Well, is it not normal that after she identifies somebody you sign the complaint, is that not normal?"
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2647.461,2648.223,It is normal --
1977.76-5344,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2648.223,2652.563,Why is that she did not sign until that day?
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2652.563,2653.985,"I do not know, Your Honor."
1977.76-5344,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2658.622,2672.436,"Your argument is that that -- that at this hearing no right to counsel had attached at all and so Wade and Gilbert had not -- had no applicability at all, is that your position now?"
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2672.436,2674.826,"That is one of my arguments, Your Honor."
1977.76-5344,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2676.151,2678.128,"Well, you did not make that argument in the brief."
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2680.251,2682.441,"Well, I conceded Your Honor."
1977.76-5344,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2695.692,2697.48,So that if this was a lineup --
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2697.48,2699.609,If this was a lineup Your Honor --
1977.76-5344,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2699.609,2701.5,"-- then Wade would not apply, but your claim is that --"
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2701.5,2701.959,Yes.
1977.76-5344,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2701.959,2704.416,-- was not a lineup or nothing equivalent to a lineup?
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2704.416,2708.92,I do not think it is anything near a lineup or what ordinarily one would call a lineup.
1977.76-5344,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2708.92,2721.172,"Are you arguing that this identification that you have in case, the same kind of an identification as is made -- as was as made in open court at the trial?"
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2721.172,2721.923,"Yes Your Honor, I believe --"
1977.76-5344,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2721.923,2725.6,"In other words, your argument is that it was not a lineup at all?"
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2725.6,2726.983,No it is not.
1977.76-5344,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2726.983,2730.458,At the trial for certiorari had the right to counsel?
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2730.458,2731.281,Yes it is correct.
1977.76-5344,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2731.281,2731.971,Has the right to counsel?
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2731.971,2733.813,That is correct.
1977.76-5344,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2733.813,2735.994,Long before Wade and Gilbert?
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2735.994,2738.645,That is correct Your Honor.
1977.76-5344,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2785.91,2788.464,"You have not -- you have not argued this in your brief, have you?"
1977.76-5344,1,19400,charles_h_levad,,2788.464,2791.212,"No, I have not Your Honor."
