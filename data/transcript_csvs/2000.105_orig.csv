2000.105_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.566,"We'll hear argument now in Number 105 Original, the State of Kansas v. the State of Colorado."
2000.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,8.688,12.388,"Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, and may it please the8 Court:"
2000.105_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,144.257,148.948,Why should any prejudgment interest be awarded as between States?
2000.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,152.831,155.854,"This is based on the compact, yes, Your Honor."
2000.105_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,155.854,161.006,And is there any provision in the compact for the provision of prejudgment interest?
2000.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,161.006,174.046,"No, there is no specific provision on prejudgment interest, nor is there any provision specifically addressing the remedy, just as there was no provision in the Pecos River Compact, which this Court--"
2000.105_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,174.046,182.661,"Well, the common law rule, I assume, is that you don't award prejudgment interest for unliquidated damages."
2000.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,182.661,192.767,"--That is the traditional rule, Your Honor, but it is a largely discredited rule at this point in history, and the Court has recognized that most recently--"
2000.105_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,192.767,196.82,"Oh, but as between State sovereigns, I mean, who is going to pay the bill in Colorado?"
2000.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,198.5,200.273,--It's the State of Colorado.
2000.105_orig,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,201.472,212.649,"The taxpayers of the State of Colorado will end up footing the bill, and it just seems odd to me that we would all of a sudden craft some rule allowing prejudgment interest against a sovereign State."
2000.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,225.728,237.476,"--In almost every case, the compacts that are in place now do not specify the precise remedy, or in most cases any remedy that might be afforded by this Court."
2000.105_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,237.476,241.58,"Did they just assume that, what, normal contractual remedies would be applied?"
2000.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,241.58,245.841,"I think that is the correct analysis, Your Honor."
2000.105_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,259.562,267.826,"Was that the very first case in which damages, money damages were even awarded in one of these original jurisdiction cases?"
2000.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,267.826,277.891,"That is the first case, Your Honor, in which the prospect of money damages for violation of an interstate water compact were allowed."
2000.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,286.938,288.861,"The point wasn't even contested here, was it?"
2000.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,306.212,315.819,"In this case, Your Honor, if I understood your point, Colorado took the position initially that compensation should be in water, without interest."
2000.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,318.942,324.386,"Right, and this is the first case we've had where that conflict has been presented to us."
2000.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,327.439,328.047,That is correct.
2000.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,328.047,346.019,"And if we didn't allow money damages, I presume it would... and if one of the parties would prefer monetary damages, I presume they could negotiate it out and pay... I mean, Colorado could negotiate it out and pay money instead of water."
2000.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,346.019,354.334,"That's correct, and Colorado is not challenging the determination by the Special Master here that the remedy should be in money."
2000.105_orig,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,354.334,355.386,"I know they're not, but--"
2000.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,370.947,374.57,"Money damages certainly has that to recommend them, Your Honor."
2000.105_orig,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,387.436,401.925,"It's... the interest question was never adjudicated before, but you're saying as well the damages question was never adjudicated, because last time around both parties said that's what they wanted."
2000.105_orig,0,30017,john_b_draper,,401.925,415.386,"Last time around it was not clear that the parties were in agreement on the possibility of money damages, but this Court ruled that that was an option that should be considered by the Special Master."
2000.105_orig,1,31838,jeffrey_p_minear,,1499.411,1513.68,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2000.105_orig,2,21428,david_w_robbins,,2126.995,2132.398,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
