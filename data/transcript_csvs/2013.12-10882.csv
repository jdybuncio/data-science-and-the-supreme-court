2013.12-10882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.487,"We'll hear argument this morning in Case 12-10882, Hall v. Florida."
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,8.087,13.641,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-10882,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,55.735,59.122,"Mr. Waxman, a line has to be drawn somewhere."
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,78.966,86.356,"--Let me first take -- take some issue, with all due respect, with your characterization of Atkins."
2013.12-10882,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,139.991,153.833,But -- but we didn't -- we didn't base our decision in Atkins upon a study of what the American Psychiatric Association and other medical associations considered to be mental retardation.
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,188.787,196.243,"Justice Scalia, I have -- I would like to respond with four points, and I hope desperately I'll remember them."
2013.12-10882,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,320.907,324.209,The SEM being -- being what and -- and established by whom?
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,324.209,329.513,"The standard error of measurement, which is established by the creators of the test."
2013.12-10882,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,364.353,366.686,For what purpose do they establish these scores?
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,380.78,392.838,"Well, what they're -- they are looking for -- I mean, intelligence tests supply a -- I mean, they weren't created for the definition of -- clinical definition of mental retardation."
2013.12-10882,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,400.359,401.359,Right.
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,401.359,405.947,"--a true IQ test score -- I mean, the general clinical--"
2013.12-10882,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,405.947,407.43,I'm not talking about IQ tests in general.
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,423.809,444.138,"--There are many reasons why a person's IQ, that is, a person's intelligent -- intellectual functioning, may be important for a whole variety of reasons, medical, psychological, developmental, and as a component of the clinical condition of mental retardation, the Eighth Amendment."
2013.12-10882,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,445.838,455.094,"Mr. Waxman, could we just clarify one thing, that what you refer to as the SEM, that is not limited to IQ of 70, 75."
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,457.196,466.319,"--I mean, the -- the concept, the statistical concept of a standard error of measurement has -- applies to all forms of testing."
2013.12-10882,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,466.319,471.54,So it has nothing to do with the death penalty and mental retardation--
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,471.54,472.023,No.
2013.12-10882,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,484.763,485.465,May I come back to a question?
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,498.957,511.581,"I think it can because that falls -- because the standard definition of prong one, that is, intellectual functioning, is two or more standard deviations below the mean."
2013.12-10882,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,511.581,511.967,All right.
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,513.417,513.9,I'm sorry.
2013.12-10882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,546.671,548.723,So that's just saying -- I'm sorry.
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,555.027,555.777,--Correct.
2013.12-10882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,555.777,560.68,And your submission is that you need to have a 95 percent degree of confidence.
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,565.334,566.084,Well--
2013.12-10882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,566.084,567.067,I thought the standard--
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,567.067,570.905,--The -- on a test that is normed at 100--
2013.12-10882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,570.905,571.388,--Right.
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,571.388,574.457,--70 is two standard deviations below the mean.
2013.12-10882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,580.261,580.627,I know.
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,582.177,594.271,"--That's exactly -- what it means is that someone, for example, with an I -- an obtained IQ test score of 71, as Mr. Hall received, has a 95 percent probability--"
2013.12-10882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,594.271,594.837,Okay.
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,594.837,596.721,--that his score will be between 76--
2013.12-10882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,596.721,598.306,So why is 95 percent?
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,599.373,600.675,--That -- that is--
2013.12-10882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,600.675,601.207,--under Atkins?
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,605.626,608.411,--I'm not doing any picking.
2013.12-10882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,608.411,612.232,Why did the other -- why did the -- the organizations pick 95 percent.
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,612.232,627.908,"It's been 95 -- it's been two standard error of -- two SEMs, which is 95 percent, for decades and decades, and this Court recognized that consensus, that universal consensus, in footnote 5 in its opinion in--"
2013.12-10882,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,627.908,634.146,Which party has the burden of persuasion on the issue of IQ and what is the standard?
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,634.146,636.698,--So it varies from State to State.
2013.12-10882,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,636.698,639.05,"I mean, what -- what does the Eighth Amendment require?"
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,662.665,668.735,"So I -- the short answer is, I believe, what I will come to is yes, so that you see where I'm going."
2013.12-10882,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,717.316,722.037,Why can't the State -- you told me that the State can establish a hard cutoff.
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,750.171,752.739,--I think -- let me see if I can explain this.
2013.12-10882,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,755.941,757.06,"No, I understand."
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,757.06,757.593,Okay.
2013.12-10882,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,757.593,759.11,But I'm talking about the general issue.
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,760.579,778.706,"As -- as to the general issue, let me -- let me -- let me state it this way: The whole idea behind measurement error is that you can't make a valid judgment that somebody doesn't have a true score of 70 or below if the obtained score is within the measurement error."
2013.12-10882,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,825.204,826.237,--I understand that argument.
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,842.483,867.114,"--So I -- what I'm -- this -- this would not be a standard I would endorse, but I believe that in light of the consensus test that all professional organizations apply that was recognized in Atkins, a score that is above the standard error of measurement of two standard deviations above the mean would be okay."
2013.12-10882,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,911.293,911.726,--Retrospectively.
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,911.726,912.21,--Excuse me?
2013.12-10882,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,912.21,930.771,"The district court did make a finding that he did not show adaptive behavior, and the district court said that that was so because all of those experts that you've referred to were speaking retrospectively."
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,940.995,943.681,"That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.12-10882,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1000.618,1007.172,"--Well, what -- there was nothing that limited you to the retrospective proof."
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1032.322,1034.222,You're correct.
2013.12-10882,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1093.479,1102.585,"If you talk about the condition of mental disability that's involved here, I want to go back to something you've said in response to Justice Scalia."
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1133.354,1135.139,"That's exactly what it means, Justice Kennedy."
2013.12-10882,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1144.728,1157.47,Is -- is there -- is there any evidence that society in general gives substantial deference to the psychiatric profession in this respect?
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1163.557,1174.597,--I -- I'm actually not aware of anything that suggests that one -- that society doesn't look to professional evaluations to do this.
2013.12-10882,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1201.665,1206.253,We have later in the week an argument about economic theories.
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1224.78,1232.47,"--Oh, I think it has to be much, much, more because, as this Court pointed out, this is a clinical condition."
2013.12-10882,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1239.79,1241.024,Mister--
2013.12-10882,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1241.024,1243.526,"They change -- they changed their mind, counsel."
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1254.883,1255.699,Justice Scalia--
2013.12-10882,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1255.699,1262.489,And they have changed their minds as to whether 70 or 75 is the -- is the new test -- for for mental retardation.
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1262.489,1264.774,--The latter is not true.
2013.12-10882,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1308.284,1311.636,"--Mr. Waxman, can I take you back to a question that the Chief Justice asked?"
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1368.009,1376.245,So the fact that two SEMs gives you a 95 percent confidence level is just the statistical fact.
2013.12-10882,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1382.316,1384.351,Well -- and that's not really my question.
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1384.351,1384.868,"Oh, I see."
2013.12-10882,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1384.868,1387.553,I understand why they might use it for a wide variety of purposes.
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1398.878,1402.563,Because the whole -- and this goes to the reason that they use it.
2013.12-10882,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1456.732,1457.299,Is that what you want?
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1477.128,1477.746,Yes.
2013.12-10882,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1477.746,1478.896,That is in tort law.
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1505.863,1508.499,"Well, let me just, as to your latter point--"
2013.12-10882,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1508.499,1509.015,Am I right?
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1510.034,1513.736,--You are not right in some of the things you've said.
2013.12-10882,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1513.736,1514.253,Okay.
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1514.253,1516.521,"The last thing you said is not right, which is--"
2013.12-10882,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1516.521,1517.088,"No, no."
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1519.557,1520.29,"--Well, the last thing is important."
2013.12-10882,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1520.29,1526.311,"I'm not saying it isn't important, but I want -- my thinking to the last thing is dependent on my being right on everything before the last thing."
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1529.513,1546.957,"You are right that 95 percent is just a feature -- is, generally speaking, a feature that is widely adopted as a confidence level, and it is particularly important here because the constitutional guarantee announced in Atkins is against the execution of persons with mental retardation."
2013.12-10882,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1547.374,1551.694,"On Justice Breyer's last point, before your -- your time expires, because I do think this is important."
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1569.24,1587.784,"--So, this is the last point that I wanted to get to, and I think if you -- that the best thing I can -- before my time runs out, I just want to point you to page 10, Footnote 3 of our reply brief, which cites the Oxford Handbook of, I don't know, Clinical Diagnosis or something, and we've given you the pages."
2013.12-10882,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1676.009,1680.913,"That's not consistent with my understanding of it, but I don't claim that I have a deep understanding of it."
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1690.769,1693.387,"Well, we know what Florida does, which--"
2013.12-10882,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1693.387,1695.756,"Well, what does the Eighth Amendment require, in your view?"
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1695.756,1717.586,"--Well, in our view, the Eighth Amendment requires that if a State chooses to use IQ test scores as a proxy for intellectual functioning rather than a full inquiry into intellectual functioning, it cannot refuse to employ the standard error of measurement that is inherent in the test."
2013.12-10882,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1717.586,1725.073,"And if it were 76, you would not need to go on to adaptive behavior; is that your view?"
2013.12-10882,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1725.073,1749.307,"Our -- our view is that a State consistent with Atkins could say that if you have no obtained score on a valid, properly administered, up-to-date test that is 70 -- that is below 76, you may -- you may constitutionally be precluded."
2013.12-10882,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1767.185,1767.869,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1767.869,1774.356,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-10882,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1848.804,1871.002,"So you want us to decide this case and establish the principle, the -- the very significant principle that where you have a -- a criminal defendant condemned to death for -- for murder whose scores are 71, 72, 73, 74, and 80, that's okay?"
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1893.618,1896.57,"Well, we certainly think the particular scores in this case are good enough."
2013.12-10882,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1910.461,1911.746,So what--
2013.12-10882,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1911.746,1913.979,"Well, let -- let me ask you this."
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1939.647,1942.283,"Well, I have two responses to that."
2013.12-10882,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1957.208,1961.01,This is not clinical; this is statistical criteria with the tests you're relying on.
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1961.01,1961.76,"--Well, there's two parts--"
2013.12-10882,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1961.76,1965.546,"You keep saying clinical, but the SEM is not a clinical judgment."
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1970.066,1980.222,"--Well, that's right, but Justice Kennedy's question as I understood it was how can Florida deviate from what the DSM and what the AAIDD suggest are best practices."
2013.12-10882,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1981.091,1981.624,No.
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,1991.529,2000.285,"--Well, the -- the test measures published the error measurement; but it's the DSM and the AAIDD that are suggesting how many deviations that you should--"
2013.12-10882,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2000.285,2000.885,"No, no."
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2034.292,2040.196,"--Well, it's a three-prong test, so in any instance you would have to demonstrate the existence of all three prongs."
2013.12-10882,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2043.731,2044.864,Can I stop you there?
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2044.864,2046.1,"--Yes, certainly."
2013.12-10882,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2046.1,2061.793,"I thought that you don't have to go to, under your view, you don't have to go to the second and third standards if you -- on the first, it's 70 or below."
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2075.535,2076.702,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2013.12-10882,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2087.343,2091.479,So what is wrong -- this -- there may be agreement among you on this.
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2201.366,2201.866,Sure.
2013.12-10882,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2208.956,2211.324,--It doesn't raise the limit to 75.
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2235.439,2243.629,"--What is so terrible about doing it is you would end up increasing the proportion of people, the number of people who would be eligible for a mental retardation finding."
2013.12-10882,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2243.629,2246.914,But only those who in fact are mentally retarded.
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2246.914,2248.014,No.
2013.12-10882,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2248.647,2249.466,Because?
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2249.466,2254.318,They're not mentally -- there is no disagreement that 70 is the appropriate threshold here.
2013.12-10882,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2274.064,2281.568,"--But, General, the ultimate determination here is whether somebody is mentally retarded; and the IQ test is just a part of that."
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2335.055,2351.565,"--Well, first, with respect to the mitigation, this is -- this Atkins hearing in Florida is completely separate from the mitigation phase, and so he does still have individualized decisionmaking with respect to whether to -- to have a death sentence, and he's still had an opportunity to present all evidence--"
2013.12-10882,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2351.565,2353.85,"But he doesn't have it with respect to this critical question, right?"
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2378.816,2391.559,"--Well, with respect to the IQ test just being one part of the intellectual functioning prong, that is a very recent development and one of the -- one of the problems we have with the idea of constitutionalizing medical criteria is that it is changing."
2013.12-10882,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2405.633,2406.335,"General Winsor, we--"
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2406.335,2407.001,Yes.
2013.12-10882,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2407.001,2410.52,"--we don't allow all factors to be considered, do we?"
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2435.92,2436.37,"Yes, sir."
2013.12-10882,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2436.37,2450.097,Could the State bring that in and say somebody who is mentally retarded enough -- so mentally retarded as not to be responsible and not to be subject to the death penalty certainly could not have pulled all of this off.
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2456.951,2458.101,"Well, the State certainly--"
2013.12-10882,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2458.101,2461.37,--in refutation of -- of his mental retardation evidence?
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2461.37,2463.988,--Only adaptive functioning is a portion of the test.
2013.12-10882,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2490.905,2524.228,"But it seems to me that, to follow from Justice Kagan's question, and I think this is a very important question, that we've been talking about here about the -- the inaccuracy, to some extent, of IQ scores, and your rule prevents us from getting a better understanding of whether that IQ score is -- is accurate or not because you -- we cannot even reach the adaptive functioning prong."
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2533.668,2534.701,"--Well, it's a three-prong test."
2013.12-10882,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2551.463,2566.139,"But in very close cases, doesn't it illuminate whether or not the IQ test is exactly as reported or if it is subject to some decrease or increase depending on what the evidence of adaptive functioning shows."
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2566.139,2567.189,"--No, Your Honor."
2013.12-10882,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2577.697,2579.763,"Well, I'll read -- I'll read Atkins again."
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2579.763,2580.449,"--Yes, sir."
2013.12-10882,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2580.449,2583.434,But I thought Atkins did -- did refer to the adaptive functioning.
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2583.434,2583.951,"Oh, no."
2013.12-10882,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2591.521,2593.707,"But that was even under DSM-IV, correct?"
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2593.707,2594.457,"Oh, yes, sir."
2013.12-10882,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2604.364,2608.566,"But, General, at the very least, you give somebody an IQ test, he scores a 71."
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2639.02,2655.363,"--Well, the adaptive functioning is a critical component, but even the guidelines that DSM would agree, that no matter what your deficits are in adaptive functioning, you do not qualify for a mental retardation diagnosis without also showing substantial deficits in intellectual functioning."
2013.12-10882,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2655.363,2662.553,Since when -- I know that there's less emphasis now on the IQ test than there was before.

2013.12-10882,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2680.847,2684.799,That's been the same in all medical diagnosis.
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2684.799,2689.553,"--Well, I think that the -- the application of the SEM has been a component of this for some time."
2013.12-10882,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2700.742,2701.678,They're not arguing for that.
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2706.73,2714.4,"--Well, I think what they're arguing is that you should -- you should do this, you should apply the SEM in the same way that clinicians do because that's the way the clinicians do it."
2013.12-10882,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2719.787,2730.678,Is it the case that those who use IQ tests always require a 95 percent confidence level and always must require a 95 percent confidence level?

2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2764.332,2765.316,"Oh, certainly."
2013.12-10882,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2819.419,2819.953,General.
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2819.953,2820.553,--Yes.
2013.12-10882,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2820.553,2825.573,Could the State change its statute to say we're -- we're now using a threshold of 60?
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2825.573,2828.609,"Well, the State certainly has substantial leeway."
2013.12-10882,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2846.653,2847.92,"Well, I guess I don't understand it."
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2849.505,2849.988,--Sure.
2013.12-10882,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2849.988,2853.307,Because I thought that the 70 was -- is very longstanding.
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2865.965,2889.647,"Well, I think you'd look at, again, at the -- the special interest at issue in Atkins and -- and the fact that the State may need to be more restrictive because of the -- the malingering and -- and incentives that inmates would have to -- to score lower than they -- than they would ordinarily perform at, that you wouldn't have in a clinical setting or you wouldn't have in -- necessarily in a school setting where people are always trying to perform--"
2013.12-10882,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2889.647,2891.032,That's why you have the other two prongs.
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2891.032,2891.699,--I'm sorry?
2013.12-10882,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2891.699,2893.367,That's why you have the other two prongs.
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2893.367,2895.084,"Well, you have -- you certainly have--"

2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2913.163,2921.952,"--Well, we're not stopping them from putting on -- all we're stopping is the consideration of the other prongs when it's clear that the first prong can't be -- can't be satisfied."
2013.12-10882,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2934.861,2935.278,Can you--

2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2936.111,2937.496,"--Yes, sir."
2013.12-10882,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2937.496,2938.763,--Then I misunderstand the case.
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,2955.442,2956.575,"No, that -- that's -- that's correct."
2013.12-10882,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2973.919,2979.14,"So you do not get -- if you do not satisfy prong one, you do not get to prongs two or three, period."

2013.12-10882,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2989.679,3005.89,"--What happens if right now, today, under the law of Florida a similar case and there is an IQ score of 71, and the prosecutor points out to the judge that that's higher than 70."
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,3033.958,3042.981,"If I understand the hypothetical correctly, you have one test score of -- of 71, and so without an attained test score of 70 or below, he would not."
2013.12-10882,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3042.981,3043.582,All right.
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,3044.082,3044.8,But he would have--
2013.12-10882,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3044.8,3046.201,--So then this is a dispute in the case.
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,3048.717,3050.403,--That's right.
2013.12-10882,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3050.403,3051.103,Okay.
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,3052.521,3052.905,Yes.
2013.12-10882,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3053.438,3059.175,"Then we get to my first question, which I won't repeat, and this man has been on death row for over 35 years, I take it?"

2013.12-10882,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3075.619,3076.487,How has it gone on this long?
2013.12-10882,1,62295,allen_winsor,,3079.089,3081.791,--There have been a number of appeals in this case.

2013.12-10882,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3134.842,3138.127,--as most of the delay has been because of rules that we have imposed.
