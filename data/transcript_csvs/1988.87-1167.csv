1988.87-1167,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.346,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-1167, Price Waterhouse v. Ann B. Hopkins."
1988.87-1167,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,79.852,83.345,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1167,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,185.413,203.395,"As you put it, the District Court must have... if there was a mixed motive, didn't it necessarily find that one of the reasons for the refusal was, was gender based?"
1988.87-1167,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,203.395,215.353,"Justice White, that's the part of the opinion that I frankly find inexplicable, and somewhat I like an O'Henry novel, because he first found all the factors that should have resulted in Price Waterhouse's winning this case."
1988.87-1167,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,229.111,232.323,"Well then, I'd better wait until you tell me what the Court of Appeals did."
1988.87-1167,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,232.323,237.335,I'll tell you now that the Court of Appeals affirmed it.
1988.87-1167,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,238.547,241.509,You interpret an undefined role to mean some role?
1988.87-1167,0,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,241.509,242.389,Yes.
1988.87-1167,1,30928,james_h_heller,,1623.699,1632.657,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1167,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1692.795,1700.71,Do you suppose that this finding as historical fact sort of saying that is subject to the clearly erroneous standard in the Court of Appeals?
1988.87-1167,1,30928,james_h_heller,,1700.71,1712.928,"I would have thought it was subject to the clearly erroneous standard, and I will, I see very little mention of Anderson v. City of Bessemer City and Pullman v. Swint in the briefs either of the government, as a matter of fact, or of Price Waterhouse."
1988.87-1167,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1954.221,1980.457,"Suppose an, suppose an employee gets his, gets reinstated on the basis of such a suit, having established that the dismissal was for a mixed motive, I assume that having won that wonderful victory the employee could thereupon immediately be re-fired for the valid reasons that, that were themselves self-sufficient."
1988.87-1167,1,30928,james_h_heller,,1981.719,1983.662,--You might... that certainly is possible.
1988.87-1167,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1987.605,2000.703,"Well, yes, but... but in theory there is, it's a hollow victory, to get reinstated and say you, the effective factor was not necessarily unlawful."
1988.87-1167,1,30928,james_h_heller,,2006.636,2018.935,"That's a little bit, I think, Justice Scalia, that's a little bit like what the findings and testimony were about whether or not a partnership price, such as Price Waterhouse, really tries to control this sort of thing."
1988.87-1167,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2053.536,2054.438,I wonder.
1988.87-1167,1,30928,james_h_heller,,2076.693,2080.616,"--Well, we agree that that is, we certainly agree that that is open to them."
1988.87-1167,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2082.907,2085.198,"Well, nevertheless, it is open to them."
1988.87-1167,1,30928,james_h_heller,,2085.198,2086.237,--There's no question.
1988.87-1167,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2086.237,2090.13,"It's just not enough, it's just not enough in any particular case that it's a mixed motive case."
1988.87-1167,1,30928,james_h_heller,,2090.13,2090.721,Oh no.
1988.87-1167,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2093.062,2096.976,Although there is some submissions in this case that indicate that that should be the standard.
1988.87-1167,1,30928,james_h_heller,,2096.976,2099.077,"--Well, we have not taken that position."
1988.87-1167,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2119.782,2121.813,"And Mt. Healthy goes to liability, doesn't it?"
1988.87-1167,1,30928,james_h_heller,,2121.813,2123.774,--No.
1988.87-1167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2142.908,2144.68,"Well, that's not what Mt. Healthy held."
1988.87-1167,1,30928,james_h_heller,,2144.68,2147.001,--Mt. Healthy--
1988.87-1167,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2147.001,2156.278,Mt. Healthy said there was no Constitutional violation if the employer could show that he would have fired the person for the non-Constitutional reason.
1988.87-1167,1,30928,james_h_heller,,2156.278,2160.521,"--That, that is true, in Mt. Healthy, that that is what Mt. Healthy held."
1988.87-1167,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2178.451,2193.591,"What do you think the two courts below said, meant when they said that the employer could have shown that it would have engaged in this denial of the partnership anyway, but it didn't do it?"
1988.87-1167,1,30928,james_h_heller,,2194.903,2199.724,"--I think they meant to say, show us some standards that you've written out, some history that's clear--"
1988.87-1167,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2199.724,2200.565,"Right, right."
1988.87-1167,1,30928,james_h_heller,,2209.141,2210.781,"--I wouldn't have supposed it would, no."
1988.87-1167,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2236.33,2237.7,And no reinstatement.
1988.87-1167,1,30928,james_h_heller,,2237.7,2243.854,"And no reinstatement, If you make that showing by the necessary standard, which we've said should be clear and convincing."
1988.87-1167,2,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,2625.215,2628.327,"There are just two points I'd like to address, Your Honor."
1988.87-1167,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2770.924,2771.865,"Thank you, Ms. Oberly."
