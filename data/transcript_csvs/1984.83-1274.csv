1984.83-1274,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.976,We'll hear arguments next in Metropolitan Life Insurance Company against Ward.
1984.83-1274,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,79.324,82.416,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1274,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,324.474,327.315,In its equal protection cases?
1984.83-1274,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,327.315,328.086,Pardon me?
1984.83-1274,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,328.086,329.779,In its Equal protection cases?
1984.83-1274,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,329.779,331.069,"Yes, Justice Rehnquist."
1984.83-1274,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,377.88,391.14,"Well, Mr. Zinn, I take it you have to concede that in this case protectionist purposes in light of the commerce clause, the fact you can't rely on the commerce clause, are permissible for the state?"
1984.83-1274,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,391.14,391.839,"--Oh, yes."
1984.83-1274,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,399.584,425.761,"Well, but just arguing perhaps from the point of view cf res nova or whatever you want to call it, you know, something that hadn't been decided before, if you can't claim that a protectionist purpose is illegitimate under the commerce clause, any legislative purpose is legitimate, virtually, under the equal protection clause."
1984.83-1274,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,425.761,430.243,"Well, we would say that that is the position the Appellees are putting forward."
1984.83-1274,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,430.243,433.365,"Well, what's the matter with it as a matter of logic?"
1984.83-1274,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,433.365,446.665,"Well, if you state the purpose at a level of generality, such as a purpose to encourage rural insurance, to pick one of the 17 purposes that the Appellees have identified... that is one of their 17."
1984.83-1274,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,474.234,477.615,"Well, that's what rational basis is all about."
1984.83-1274,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,480.008,481.949,"Our stress here... yes, I think that is."
1984.83-1274,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,545.699,552.725,"Well, but isn't this business of the commerce clause and not the equal protection clause to protect against local favoritism?"
1984.83-1274,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,552.725,553.897,Yes.
1984.83-1274,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,563.521,565.974,"We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock, Mr. Zinn."
1984.83-1274,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,578.781,582.714,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1984.83-1274,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,761.781,771.267,"Mr. Zinn, do you think those cases that are pre-McCarran-Ferguson Act and don't deal with insurance are really relevant here?"
1984.83-1274,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,771.267,772.118,Absolutely.
1984.83-1274,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,830.097,841.374,"But was that all spelled out in the Reserve life case, the 1965 case, that although the commerce clause doesn't apply because of McCarran-Ferguson, we nonetheless--"
1984.83-1274,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,841.374,851.261,"The Appellees have argued that we are placing too much weight on the Reserve life case, because it didn't spell all this cut."
1984.83-1274,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,973.343,974.594,--And just citing--
1984.83-1274,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,974.594,976.895,--Wheeling Steel versus Glander.
1984.83-1274,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,976.895,1000.36,"--But if that's the correct state of the law, then the McCarran-Ferguson Act is almost meaningless, because although you can't... they've lifted the commerce, Congress has lifted the commerce clause bar to state regulation of insurance, the equal protection clause in your view kicks in and does just the same thing as the commerce clause."
1984.83-1274,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1000.36,1002.661,We would not agree with that.
1984.83-1274,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1094.201,1106.889,"Well, even if the McCarran Act... even if the equal protection clause would make the McCarran Act irrelevant in this case, it would just do it for taxation."
1984.83-1274,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1109.901,1122.788,"--Absolutely, and one of the arguments that the Appellees make in this case is that they say it is more difficult to regulate out-of-state companies than it is domestic companies."
1984.83-1274,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1446.804,1449.886,"Do you mean, Mr. Zinn, that only domestic companies have lobbyists?"
1984.83-1274,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1449.886,1453.909,"--I would suggest obviously not, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.83-1274,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1493.465,1509.185,"You said, at least I thought I heard you say, that obviously, or generally, this type of tax would encourage companies to come into the state."
1984.83-1274,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1514.21,1519.683,"Well, the empirical data has been offered by the Appellees in this case, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.83-1274,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1533.971,1538.524,The point I was curious about is that you seem to concede that.
1984.83-1274,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1541.906,1549.813,"--We think we're entitled to summary judgment in this case, regardless of all the evidence that the State has entered through its experts."
1984.83-1274,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1580.341,1592.269,"Mr. Zinn, how about the purpose of assuring greater security in-state for Alabama residents covered by insurance?"
1984.83-1274,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1592.269,1596.954,"We have no quarrel with that purpose, Justice O'Connor."
1984.83-1274,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1613.554,1615.724,Or having certain assets within the state?
1984.83-1274,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1615.724,1617.717,--Yes.
1984.83-1274,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1617.717,1622.61,And certainly that's a portion of the effect of the tax scheme.
1984.83-1274,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1622.61,1633.987,"But those purposes here... the state is trying to accomplish those purposes through taxation, and what we're saying is that that is not the proper way to accomplish them."
1984.83-1274,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1637.519,1643.523,"Well, it does seem to have a rational basis and not be an invalid purpose."
1984.83-1274,0,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,1645.484,1653.22,--But the purpose has to relate to the particular means by which the state is seeking to accomplish its goals.
1984.83-1274,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1785.096,1790.299,Mr. Lightfoot.
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,1790.299,1793.892,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1984.83-1274,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1873.313,1876.976,Doesn't that offset the whole burden?
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,1876.976,1879.918,"No, sir, it never will, Mr. Chief Justice."
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2095.692,2099.613,"Your basic purpose, though, is to benefit local industry, isn't it?"
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2099.613,2101.816,"--That's it, that's the basic purpose."
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2101.816,2109.359,And so you're just saying that the discrimination is justified because we want to discriminate.
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2109.359,2117.094,"We're saying that they're different, Justice White, that they're different in what they do."
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2117.094,2126.59,"I know, but all you have to do is move into the state and become a resident and the discrimination ends."
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2126.59,2133.926,"Under the facts that are before you, that are admitted by the foreign insurers, domestic insurance companies perform differently."
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2157.351,2164.124,"But you still say, we're entitled to discriminate in favor of local companies?"
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2164.124,2171.38,Because there is a distinction in the benefits to the State of Alabama and to the market place.
1984.83-1274,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2212.137,2214.659,Why can't they make it without that special protection?
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2214.659,2222.703,"It's because of the economics of scale and because of the capital requirements, and these facts are all admitted by the foreign insurance companies."
1984.83-1274,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2237.414,2250.603,"Are you suggesting, with reference to the industrial insurance, that because traditionally that's not a very profitable business that the domestic companies are willing to carry that burden, but the foreign companies shy away from it?"
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2250.603,2257.025,I think that the domestic companies can tailor their sales force and their policies to the needs of the local populace.
1984.83-1274,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2289.946,2294.431,Does Metropolitan no longer handle industrial insurance?
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2294.431,2296.281,I don't know the answer to that.
1984.83-1274,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2302.846,2308.62,"Surely Metropolitan did at one time, if it doesn't now, sell industrial insurance?"
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2308.62,2310.991,I could find that statistic.
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2425.776,2430.02,"Mr. Lightfoot, what does the McCarran-Ferguson Act say?"
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2430.02,2436.605,"As I read it, Your Honor, it takes the business of insurance out from under the protection of the commerce clause."
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2436.605,2443.02,"Well, it can only do so by giving Congressional consent discriminate against interstate commerce."
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2446.63,2451.154,"It gave, as I understand it, the states the power to tax and regulate."
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2451.154,2457.067,"So that Congress says that in insurance it's perfectly reasonable to discriminate against interstate commerce, didn't it?"
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2457.718,2459.269,"Yes, sir, it did say that."
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2459.269,2470.055,And do you suggest that that kind of a Congressional policy ought to be taken into consideration in deciding whether something is reasonable under the equal protection clause?
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2470.055,2477.902,I think this Court has said on occasion that it would look at Congressional enactments for public policy.
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2485.356,2493.492,And you think maybe the Court has just made a mistake in Reserve Life?
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2499.864,2502.138,It cited Wheeling Steel versus Glander.
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2502.138,2503.808,"When was that, '46?"
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2503.808,2505.18,Wheeling Steel was '49.
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2507.181,2508.663,And that was before McCarran-Ferguson?
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2508.663,2509.021,That was after.
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2509.021,2509.621,After.
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2509.621,2510.743,Both of those are after.
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2510.743,2514.795,So we made... so the Court you say really stumbled twice?
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2514.795,2515.476,Not at all.
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2521.871,2522.652,"Oh, no, no."
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2528.025,2529.915,Residence and location.
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2564.689,2582.689,"You would say that a tax law that says, we tax all non-resident insurance corporations X and all resident corporations, all insurance companies incorporated in Alabama, by half X, you would say that's unconstitutional under the equal protection clause?"
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2582.689,2587.383,"--I would say it would be a harder case than the one I have here, because--"
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2587.383,2588.262,How would you decide it?
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2588.262,2589.414,--Sir?
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2589.414,2593.247,"You say it would be a harder case, but would it be controlled by Reserve or not?"
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2593.247,2596.64,"No, I don't think Reserve would control that, for this reason."
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2600.882,2604.675,"Well, would it control... would Wheeling cover it?"
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2604.675,2606.766,Wheeling was an ad valore tax.
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2607.697,2608.876,Would it or not?
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2608.876,2613.971,--Wheeling would not control because the statute there was to encourage reciprocity.
1984.83-1274,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2623.666,2625.198,"Well, Wheeling didn't even involve insurance."
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2625.198,2625.829,--That's right.
1984.83-1274,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2878.213,2880.214,"What do you mean, it works?"
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2880.214,2881.994,The system works.
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2881.994,2883.296,"Well, what do you mean, it works?"
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2883.296,2886.028,It works because we encourage domestic companies--
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2886.028,2887.5,What do you mean by it works?
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2887.5,2899.799,"--We have a healthy domestic insurance industry that serves one segment and certain types of insurance needs, and we have a very, very healthy foreign industry that serves other needs."
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2901.789,2904.842,Why do you suppose the Northeastern states are against it?
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2904.842,2918.979,"Well, as I understand it, Connecticut has the big companies incorporated in Connecticut and they tax domestics more than foreigns, and they don't want to see... they'd like our law changed so their domestic companies can compete better."
1984.83-1274,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2961.779,2968.452,"Counsel, should I advise you that we don't have a computer that'll do all of that for us, who's on what side?"
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2968.452,2970.935,"Yes, sir, I'm not trying to come up with--"
1984.83-1274,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2970.935,2971.794,I just want you to know--
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2971.794,2972.595,--a weight of numbers.
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2972.595,2974.655,--I don't have one in my office.
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,2979.939,2985.603,"Well, on that point, Your Honor, the foreign insurance companies say they get taxed without representation in Alabama."
1984.83-1274,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3012.87,3021.396,"My only point is, I for one don't decide cases on the number of amicus that are on one side or the other."
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,3023.647,3024.478,"Yes, sir."
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3106.013,3108.484,"I wasn't alone in Allied Stores, I don't think."
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,3108.484,3109.293,Sir?
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3109.293,3111.096,I wasn't alone in Allied.
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,3111.096,3112.455,"In Allied Stores, I know."
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3188.226,3191.308,How does this aid them?
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,3196.531,3198.622,"No, I don't think it does."
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3201.583,3202.616,"Well, I know."
1984.83-1274,1,45362,warren_b_lightfoot,,3206.057,3206.606,--Yes.
1984.83-1274,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3206.606,3207.838,"Well, how does that help them?"
