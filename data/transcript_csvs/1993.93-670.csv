1993.93-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.038,"We'll hear argument next in 93-670, Albert Howlett v. Birkdale Shipping Company."
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,56.738,59.49,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-670,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,145.756,150.26,Is a cargo stow an object or a function?
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,150.26,152.0,I--
1993.93-670,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,152.0,154.632,Or a... or a task or a place?
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,154.632,156.973,--I consider it a condition of the vessel.
1993.93-670,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,166.219,177.048,"So, when we're talking about a cargo stow, we're talking about a certain place on the ship, plus the functions that were necessary in order to put the cargo in that place?"
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,177.048,182.542,Plus the functions and the operations and how that cargo is held in place or stored in place in the ship.
1993.93-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,206.635,228.059,"Well, do you argue that the shipowner has a duty to go into the cargo stow area after it has been loaded on board to see the condition of it and to try to determine if there are any hidden defects or problems?"
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,228.059,228.46,No.
1993.93-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,228.8,229.471,Is that your argument?
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,229.471,229.912,--No.
1993.93-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,247.583,256.49,"Well, are you arguing that the shipowner only has a duty of care as to conditions that are open and obvious in the stow?"
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,256.49,264.747,"--To the extent that that phrase might be tantamount to something that is discoverable by a reasonable inspection, I would plead the answer is yes."
1993.93-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,272.862,286.78,"So, your theory is, if it's an open and obvious problem in the cargo stow area, then the shipowner is liable if in the unloading process someone is injured by virtue of that condition?"
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,286.78,309.625,"If it was open and obvious... and they have become somewhat words of art and I want to use them carefully if I may... if it was open and obvious sufficiently to be observed at the time of loading, even though it may subsequently, in the course of loading, be concealed, it is a condition that the shipowner should be responsible, because it is the type of condition which would... he would have knowledge of if he made the observation."
1993.93-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,309.625,319.151,"Well, what if it's open and obvious before, during and after the original loading, and it is open and obvious at the time of the unloading?"
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,319.151,327.746,"If it's open and obvious at the time of the unloading, insofar as there might be any duty to warn of that condition, the fact that it is open and obvious constitutes the warning."
1993.93-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,352.745,362.281,Was... was there a finding by the District Court here that the plastic that was laid under the cargo was an open and obvious condition?
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,362.281,363.6,--Not in... not in that sense.
1993.93-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,384.214,388.528,"Well, I just thought... I just thought that the District Court had made a finding that it was open and obvious."
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,388.528,388.828,No.
1993.93-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,404.376,404.827,The District--
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,404.827,405.738,He did not find that.
1993.93-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,405.738,408.991,"--The District Court granted summary judgment for the respondent, didn't it?"
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,410.04,410.561,That is correct.
1993.93-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,413.503,415.586,If there's no finding in the sense of it being in a bench trial?
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,415.586,416.354,That is correct.
1993.93-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,416.354,420.579,"Now, are you saying that the shipowner had a duty to inspect here?"
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,420.579,427.702,"I... I'm saying that the shipowner has a duty to conduct reasonable inspections of the manner in which the cargo is stowed, yes."
1993.93-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,427.702,429.425,"Well, what's your authority for that proposition?"
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,429.425,441.902,"My... my authority for that proposition is the general negligence duty created by Scindia, which it would be no different than inspecting for other conditions which exist on a ship when the ship comes in and is presented to the discharging longshoremen."
1993.93-670,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,441.902,454.279,"But, Mr. Sovel, as I understand Scindia... correct me if I'm wrong... in Scindia, there was no negligence by a person engaging in providing steve... stevedoring services to the vessel, was there?"
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,455.651,456.653,"Well, the... the problem in that--"
1993.93-670,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,456.653,457.401,--By the vessel?
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,457.401,462.406,--In the Scindia case... the Scindia did not involve an unsafe condition existing at the start of cargo operations.
1993.93-670,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,462.406,463.656,"Well, regardless, start, finish."
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,463.656,464.057,Okay.
1993.93-670,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,464.057,471.981,There was no negligence by a... by persons engaged in providing stevedoring services.
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,471.981,472.362,That's correct.
1993.93-670,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,472.362,474.225,But that is what we have here.
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,483.928,484.559,"Yes, by the... but--"
1993.93-670,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,484.559,501.242,"And the statute reads, it seems to me, very clearly, that if the injured person was employed by the vessel to provide stevedoring services, no such action shall be permitted if... if the injury was caused by the negligence of persons engaged in providing steve... stevedoring services to the vessel."
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,506.144,512.529,"--No... that cause, which also was interpreted in Edmonds, has to refer to negligence by the employer stevedore."
1993.93-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,512.529,513.909,"Well, that's not what it says."
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,513.909,514.559,And it's not what it says.
1993.93-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,514.559,516.961,It's... it's flat... it's a flat statement.
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,518.383,519.393,Okay.
1993.93-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,575.482,577.311,What is the citation to Kopke?
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,578.731,579.903,It's in the reply brief.
1993.93-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,579.903,581.055,In the reply brief?
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,581.055,581.395,Yes.
1993.93-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,594.783,595.334,Thank you.
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,595.334,597.565,Referred to at page 10 of the reply brief.
1993.93-670,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,597.565,602.967,"Mr. Sovel, have you pursued a claim against anyone else other than the shipowners?"
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,602.967,611.353,"Well, we have a claim also... a pending claim against the... the... the... the answer to that essentially is no."
1993.93-670,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,655.675,662.08,"But the word ""employer"" is not used in... in the provision that... that seems to flatly cover this case."
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,675.187,676.388,Okay.
1993.93-670,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,676.388,681.741,--No such action shall be permitted if the injury was caused by the negligence of persons... it doesn't say employers.
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,681.741,682.072,Okay.
1993.93-670,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,682.072,687.096,By the negligence of persons engaged in providing stevedoring services to the vessel.
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,687.505,688.186,"Yes, that's correct."
1993.93-670,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,692.838,703.827,"--It doesn't say if... if it isn't caused solely by the negligence, it said, if it was caused by the negligence of persons engaged in providing stevedoring services... not employers engaged in... just persons providing stevedoring services."
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,703.827,708.479,"--Well, but that would then say that anybody, including a nonemployer stevedore--"
1993.93-670,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,708.479,708.88,Yes.
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,708.88,709.871,--Is to be exempted.
1993.93-670,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,709.871,711.591,That's... that's what it says.
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,711.591,714.654,"No, I don't... I... I don't think that... it would be inconsistent to hold."
1993.93-670,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,716.694,717.055,Why?
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,720.457,728.491,"--Well, the term ""stevedore""... the stevedore is the employer, and it's the exclusive remedy provision of the Act that... that you're dealing with here, Your Honor."
1993.93-670,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,743.071,743.872,They could have said that.
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,757.072,765.136,"--Well, then, in that case, Your Honor, you're... the... essentially, the same type of argument was considered by this Court and rejected by this Court in the Edmonds case."
1993.93-670,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,768.388,768.779,In... in what case?
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,768.779,769.42,--In Edmonds.
1993.93-670,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,769.42,770.289,Edmonds?
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,770.289,777.995,"Edmonds, where the argument was made by the stevedores... by the shipowner that they should apportion the damages between the employer and the stevedore."
1993.93-670,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,806.753,807.615,Which is what we have here.
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,807.615,811.088,--Yes... well... and therefore... but that was specifically rejected in the Edmonds case.
1993.93-670,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,820.983,832.64,"Well, but there... there, the negligence was... was independent, separate negligence, not what you have here... the negligence of the shipowner in failing to catch the negligence of the stevedore."
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,836.154,838.765,"Your Honor, if I might posit a situation to the Court."
1993.93-670,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,868.995,871.606,Maybe it should have written something else then if it didn't have such an idea.
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,871.606,874.589,"Well, I think it did when it said that they have negligence based on State law."
1993.93-670,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,887.659,890.449,"Maybe you know that, Mr. Sovel, but I only know what I read in the statute."
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,891.981,897.813,"Well, that... if you were to accept that same interpretation, Your Honor, your... the decision in this Court in Edmonds would have been different."
1993.93-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,899.004,902.457,"Well, the decision in Kopke wouldn't have been."
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,905.299,910.093,"--Well, Kopke involves the interpretation that when you... viewing the term ""employer""--"
1993.93-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,910.093,912.094,Which isn't what we're talking about here.
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,912.094,912.375,--No.
1993.93-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,928.984,934.229,"Well, but surely... surely we're not going to say the legislative history prevails over the language of the statute?"
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,934.229,934.928,--No.
1993.93-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,955.702,961.274,"Yes, but what we have here surely is not joint negligence in the sense that we're talking about it in Edmonds?"
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,961.274,962.366,--No.
1993.93-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,992.997,995.489,And so you jump from that to there's a duty to inspect.
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,995.489,1006.525,"--Well, I... I think that there is a duty of reasonable inspection with respect to the manner in which cargo is stowed... which is the traditional duty... not duty so much as what the practice is."
1993.93-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1014.963,1019.467,"But if you're right and they did in fact inspect, then they would know."
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1019.467,1020.346,Right.
1993.93-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1020.346,1022.827,And you wouldn't have to rely on any duty to inspect.
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1022.827,1023.168,That's right.
1993.93-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1023.168,1024.981,But I gather from what you say that that's contested.
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1027.922,1031.863,"No, it's not contested in the facts of this case that they did in fact inspect."
1993.93-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1033.345,1037.209,"So, you don't rely on any duty to inspect; is that correct?"
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1037.209,1037.686,--Not in this case.
1993.93-670,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1046.592,1047.333,I'm really getting confused now.
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1054.57,1060.132,--I say that it is not true that you have a... an actual duty to inspect.
1993.93-670,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1074.643,1076.643,"Well, but if they do it, you're saying they're doing it negligently."
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1077.033,1077.354,Yes.
1993.93-670,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1077.354,1080.726,--It doesn't matter if it's... if they do it negligibly unless they have a duty to do it.
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1080.726,1081.067,Right.
1993.93-670,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1081.628,1083.368,But I'm trying to... I really want to be sure I understand.
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1083.368,1084.27,--Okay.
1993.93-670,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1084.27,1092.724,Do you... can you prevail in this case and still assume that the shipowner had no duty to inspect the loading operation?
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1092.724,1096.066,Yes.
1993.93-670,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1100.889,1107.715,"Well, doesn't the evidence have to show that they did in fact know the plastic was there, as opposed to simply standing there while plastic was put down?"
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1107.715,1108.503,--No.
1993.93-670,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1116.159,1118.201,"So, you're saying the evidence, in effect, was that they did see it?"
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1118.201,1118.731,They did see it.
1993.93-670,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1118.731,1120.411,Because they were standing there and they must have?
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1120.411,1120.732,Right.
1993.93-670,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1121.753,1129.947,"But if a finder of fact concluded that they did not in fact see it, then you'd have no case... unless we hold that--"
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1129.947,1130.248,--Well--
1993.93-670,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1130.248,1134.091,"--Unless we hold that there is in fact a duty to inspect, as Justice Stevens suggested?"
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1134.091,1147.041,--If the factfinder found that they did not... the factfinder would have to find that there is... that they... it was not a condition which they could see based on the inspections which they admittedly made.
1993.93-670,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1175.621,1175.688,No.
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1186.077,1186.427,--Right.
1993.93-670,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1186.427,1195.543,"If they don't have a duty to inspect, then the most you can rely upon would be proof that they actually did know that the plastic was here."
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1195.543,1195.914,Yes.
1993.93-670,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1195.914,1196.795,Okay.
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1196.795,1211.456,"That would be correct that... I think... while under the facts of this particular case, having established the inspection, and that it was a kind of condition that is... was capable of being observed on inspection, that should have been sufficient to--"
1993.93-670,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1211.456,1211.864,No.
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1212.345,1212.846,--That's different.
1993.93-670,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1212.846,1223.833,"--It seems to me that is simply another way of saying, well, they actually did have a duty, because we're going to charge them with knowledge of what they would have learned making a reasonable inspection, whether we have direct proof that they knew it or not."
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1223.833,1224.454,Okay.
1993.93-670,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1225.535,1226.364,Isn't that fair to say?
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1226.364,1226.675,--Yes.
1993.93-670,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1239.544,1241.074,How does one discharge that duty?
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1253.762,1262.448,"To the extent that the term ""supervising"" implies anything more than the observations that they would make of the normal stowage, I'm not claiming that there's a duty to supervise."
1993.93-670,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1263.7,1268.722,But you said there's a duty to make sure that the cargo is in safe condition to be unloaded.
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1268.722,1269.133,--Right.
1993.93-670,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1269.133,1274.757,"So, can you be as precise as you can in telling me how one discharges that duty?"
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1274.757,1275.227,Okay.
1993.93-670,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1305.517,1307.908,"Well, what is it that... what is the relevant thing that they've admitted here?"
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1307.908,1330.182,"Here they admitted, first of all, that they... they inspected; that they would have seen the plastic if it was placed under it; that they required that something be placed under the cocoa beans so that, to that extent... by the way, they're supervising what the stevedore does, they are giving them the material... the only source of the plastic or paper or whatever it is has to come from the ship."
1993.93-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1416.469,1422.343,"Mr. Sovel, what was the theory of the District Court when it granted summary judgment?"
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1438.355,1448.141,"The ship... the District Court here, relying on Derr, said that there was no duty to inspect and no duty to do anything with respect to cargo, period... nothing."
1993.93-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1450.021,1460.718,"Well, when I... when I read the District Court's opinion, I interpret them... it as saying there... the condition of the plastic was open and obvious."
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1462.61,1463.031,--No.
1993.93-670,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1463.031,1466.963,"Because the unloading people would see it, too."
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1466.963,1472.797,"Well, the... the... it has to go back, Your Honor, to the Derr holding."
1993.93-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1564.736,1566.188,By stacking cargo on top of the--
1993.93-670,0,20128,charles_sovel,,1566.188,1567.249,"--By stacking it on top of it, yes."
1993.93-670,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1572.733,1573.472,"--Very well, Mr. Sovel."
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,1574.233,1580.767,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-670,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1596.369,1602.243,"Just as a preliminary before you get into that conflict, who... who was Howlett employed by?"
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,1603.221,1604.493,Northern Shipping Company.
1993.93-670,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1604.493,1606.032,Is that--
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,1606.032,1607.034,Which is a stevedoring company.
1993.93-670,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1607.034,1610.006,"--That's different from the vessel, I take it?"
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,1610.006,1610.858,Yes.
1993.93-670,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1615.089,1619.884,"Well, how... how does the statutory exclusion on which you rely then apply?"
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,1629.041,1647.483,"--We're... we're... they're seeking to impose liability on us, not for the negligence of Mr. Howlett or his employer... they're looking to impose liability on us for the negligence of the loading stevedore in Guayaquil, Ecuador."
1993.93-670,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1647.483,1658.121,"But you rely, I take it, on the second sentence of the provision in section 5(b)?"
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,1658.121,1667.205,"That and the numerous references in the legislative history that says a shipowner should not be liable for the negligence of another party, including the stevedore."
1993.93-670,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1667.726,1673.26,"Well, but the statute says, if such person was employed by the vessel to provide stevedoring services."
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,1681.885,1682.766,--I think... I think you're missing the Act.
1993.93-670,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1690.222,1694.503,"Well, you said... you said that he was employed by someone other than the vessel."
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,1696.136,1698.887,I think the reference is there.
1993.93-670,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1709.323,1711.885,So that we don't have to follow the precise language of the Act?
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,1711.885,1718.489,I'm not... I'm not sure that I understand.
1993.93-670,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1718.489,1732.139,"Well, I... I take it that your... your case requires a very close interpretation of the Act in order to allow the... the vessel the exemption which it gives."
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,1738.992,1739.383,Right.
1993.93-670,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1739.383,1741.204,But I'm... I'm just somewhat--
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,1741.204,1743.236,"My argument, Your Honor--"
1993.93-670,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1743.236,1746.318,--I'm uncertain as to how... as to how the language of the Act applies here.
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,1746.318,1746.939,--Okay.
1993.93-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1765.029,1777.458,"Well, maybe... maybe your argument shouldn't be relying on that sentence at all, because what... what Justice Kennedy is just suggesting is also... was... we also explicitly said that in Edmonds, didn't we?"
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,1801.524,1802.964,Absolutely.
1993.93-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1802.964,1806.437,"So, according to Edmonds, that sentence doesn't apply at all... zero."
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,1806.437,1809.668,Although it was read during your direct questioning... it could be read--
1993.93-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1809.668,1813.631,"Well, I'm trying to find the weak parts in his case and the weak parts in your case."
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,1813.631,1814.092,--Right.
1993.93-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1814.092,1816.083,And it seems to me that the weak part in your case is Edmonds.
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,1816.083,1820.227,I will address that in a minute.
1993.93-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1824.789,1830.843,"Well, what do you do about that sentence in Edmonds which... which simply says that this sentence has no provision here... it has no application here?"
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,1830.843,1844.622,--The... the Edmonds situation does not impose a duty on the shipowner... the legislative history behind the entire 1972 amendments was to relieve the shipowner of any liability for the negligence of another party.
1993.93-670,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1861.972,1878.735,"Mr. Buchholz, I can see what you're saying if we were dealing with the typical triad... that is, this certainly meant to exonerate the shipowner from liability to the employer of the longshore worker."
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,1918.172,1920.483,"--There are two answers to that, Your Honor."
1993.93-670,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1946.13,1952.873,But even a domestic loading stevedore is not going to be the one that compensates the longshore worker.
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,1963.221,1963.632,--Right.
1993.93-670,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1996.755,2001.458,With respect to anybody... let's take... make it a seaman instead of a longshore worker.
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2011.306,2014.207,--No; there would... there would probably be liability on the vessel's part.
1993.93-670,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2026.646,2041.458,"Are you saying it would only be on seaworthiness, not negligence, to allow the plastic to be used in places where sea... crew members might be walking or jumping on?"
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2041.458,2047.339,"--I... I would... there could be a case in which, if the shipowner knew about it or had constructive knowledge of it, you might be able to make out a case of negligence."
1993.93-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2053.014,2057.817,"So, your basic claim here is that there is... there is simply no negligence on your part; is that it?"
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2073.937,2082.795,"You... you... because of the Scindia case and the lack of any obligation to supervise the work of the loading or discharging stevedore, you--"
1993.93-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2082.795,2084.225,You're not charged with knowledge of the defect?
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2084.225,2084.726,"--Right, right."
1993.93-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2084.726,2091.248,"However, if you happen to have knowledge of the defect, you would acknowledge that... that you might be negligent in failing to pass that on?"
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2091.248,2100.595,"My proposed duty would... would be, if you had actual knowledge of a hidden defect that you knew or had to reason to know would present an unreasonable risk of harm to experienced longshoremen."
1993.93-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2100.595,2101.005,Right.
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2101.005,2106.708,"In that limited situation, you would have a duty vis-a-vis the longshoremen in the next port."
1993.93-670,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2106.708,2107.049,So--
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2109.4,2110.732,No.
1993.93-670,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2116.365,2136.889,"Well, I... I thought I heard the argument and I thought I read in the brief that the shipowner's employees actually provided the plastic and required that something be put under the cocoa beans, gave them the plastic to put under it, knew that the plastic was under it, and subsequently, when it was loaded, it was not obvious."
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2139.66,2144.723,"--That may be their theory, Justice O'Connor... if that was the record, there would be liability in this case."
1993.93-670,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2177.187,2181.107,"Well, but this... this was a case that was decided on summary judgment, was it not?"
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2181.107,2181.708,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-670,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2181.708,2183.669,Before any trial?
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2183.669,2184.961,Before any trial.
1993.93-670,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2184.961,2196.599,"Well, in... so, the District Court had to say that there... this... this point was absolutely undisputed that no reasonable person could conclude there was actual knowledge on the part of the vessel?"
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2196.599,2198.108,Yes... which he did.
1993.93-670,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2198.108,2200.281,And... and you support that here.
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2203.164,2203.765,Right.
1993.93-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2214.39,2216.0,"Well, it's down to a very narrow case."
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2216.0,2217.682,Plastic is used for a number of purposes on the ship.
1993.93-670,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2244.551,2246.611,Do you know why it was a summary judgment situation?
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2266.613,2268.764,"--That was, Your Honor."
1993.93-670,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2300.545,2303.057,"May I ask this question, Mr. Buchholz?"
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2336.589,2350.077,"--Well, again, the legal duty, as Justice Kennedy referred to throughout, the difference between the Ninth and the Fifth in the Circuit is whether there is a legal duty to do inspections or supervisions of the cargo stow during the loading by the stevedore."
1993.93-670,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2350.077,2353.58,"And if there is such a duty, the fact that you don't know about it, you would lose under this?"
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2353.9,2354.912,That's correct.
1993.93-670,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2354.912,2358.035,"--So... so, there is no factual issue on that... on that legal question?"
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2358.035,2361.137,The question and what the Circuit Court--
1993.93-670,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2361.137,2364.987,"And what this boils down to also is that your real defense is, you're not negligent, period?"
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2371.713,2373.762,"--Well, somebody... if there was negligence--"
1993.93-670,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2373.762,2387.774,"--What I'm saying is that, going back to that argument... the debate between... or your opponent's colloquy with Justice Scalia earlier... the fact that the... the loading stevedore was negligent would not exonerate you if you were also negligent?"
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2387.774,2388.542,--That's correct.
1993.93-670,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2388.542,2389.093,Yes.
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2398.18,2398.6,Exactly.
1993.93-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2398.6,2399.692,Okay.
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2406.705,2411.998,That is a duty that has... that the genesis is the Ninth Circuit's case in Turner.
1993.93-670,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2502.828,2503.957,"Well, could... could I ask you about this?"
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2516.317,2516.988,"--No, no."
1993.93-670,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2516.988,2519.409,That was what I thought you said.
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2519.409,2520.701,"If... if I said that, I misstated it."
1993.93-670,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2524.512,2527.584,That... that's kind of a general principle anyway--
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2527.584,2527.964,--Right.
1993.93-670,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2527.964,2530.057,"--Of property ownership, I suppose?"
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2530.057,2532.309,That's the duty the vessel owes--
1993.93-670,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2532.309,2536.028,A duty to warn of known hazards or things you should have known of?
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2536.028,2549.408,"--That's the vessel that... that this Court imposed in Scindia and the... of knowledge or should have known relates to the vessel and its... its equipment, its appurtenances, its gears, things that are permanently attach... attached to it and affixed to it."
1993.93-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2560.936,2562.598,"You're just saying they shouldn't have known, that's all."
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2562.598,2564.048,--It requires actual knowledge.
1993.93-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2564.048,2564.94,I think you're agreeing with Justice O'Connor.
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2573.145,2573.605,Right.
1993.93-670,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2582.271,2599.352,"Well, is... well, is that really... isn't there an intermediate position that if they should have known for reasons other than supervising the... the loading... in other words, supposing they turned the loading operation entirely over... the ship entirely over to the loading stevedore at the time of the loading... they had no personnel on the boat."
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2623.858,2627.31,"Again, if you have the elements of actual knowledge of a--"
1993.93-670,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2627.31,2631.382,"No, it's not... it's... it's... it should have... they should have known about it."
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2632.113,2632.493,--Okay.
1993.93-670,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2632.814,2639.847,"It's quite apparent that you can't prove anybody actually saw it, but do you find that 19 people walked by this place every day and you can't believe they didn't look at it... but you can't prove they actually saw it."
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2639.847,2641.77,"--My answer to that, Your Honor, is no."
1993.93-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2672.99,2673.901,"Well, it wasn't in this case."
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2686.73,2687.91,--That... on your hypothesis.
1993.93-670,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2710.884,2725.233,"Well, it seems to me there could be cases in which the shipowner would be aware of... of dangerous conditions that wouldn't... that they would notice while the... the ship was at sea that the unloading steve... stevedore might not know about unless he were warned."
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2726.615,2730.529,I... I... I think you're getting very... very close to the actual knowledge situation in that scenario.
1993.93-670,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2730.529,2731.167,Yes.
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2741.093,2753.523,"The reason for that is any so-called expert is going to be able to come in after the accident and say, a reasonably competent shipowner or master should have... and that's enough to get to the jury."
1993.93-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2783.932,2785.734,"--Well, of course, that's still true in an actual knowledge case."
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2785.734,2786.375,--Excuse me?
1993.93-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2786.375,2788.165,That's still true in an actual knowledge case.
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2788.165,2792.849,"In an actual case, there's a basis to impose liability on the shipowner for that situation."
1993.93-670,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2792.849,2823.009,"Is it possible that a condition could be open and obvious at the time that the owner starts the voyage, after the cargo has been loaded, but during the course of the... the trip, the cargo shifts around so that on arrival it is not open and obvious and, yet, the owner would have been aware because it was open and obvious?"
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2823.009,2829.824,"In that situation, again, you... you have actual knowledge of a... of a... a... if you have actual knowledge, which--"
1993.93-670,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2829.824,2838.109,"No, I didn't say that there was, but just that it was an open and obvious condition initially, and it changed later."
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2838.109,2847.516,"--Well, if... if it's an open and obvious condition... if the shipowner does not have actual knowledge of it, no, there is... there is no such duty."
1993.93-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2855.45,2865.798,"Mr. Buchholz, I'm... you know, I'm really not sure that your... your... your alarmist prediction of what's going to happen is... is true to life."
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2892.186,2893.215,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2901.121,2908.194,"--As we've established in Justice Stevens' question, you're going to win this case under either approach."
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2908.194,2908.625,--Right.
1993.93-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2908.625,2910.377,Whether you're liable for should have known or not.
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2922.716,2935.032,I don't think there's... there has been a very limited number of cases in the Third Circuit where this duty has been imposed for... for exactly that reason... that the standard under the Derr case is admittedly extremely limited.
1993.93-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2935.032,2937.305,"If you should have known, it's probable that you knew."
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2939.666,2943.058,As to... on which duty is... should have known is Your Honor referring to?
1993.93-670,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2943.058,2948.132,"Well, the typical case is... is the one that Justice Stevens gave... gave of the cargo shiftings."
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,2978.271,2987.167,"Having tried cases since 1970 and seen what changes the Derr situation made in the Third Circuit, I... I have to respectfully differ with you."
1993.93-670,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3011.144,3016.777,Is there... are there occasions when onloading and offloading proceeds at the same time?
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,3023.171,3023.84,Yes.
1993.93-670,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3036.39,3037.661,Using the same stevedore?
1993.93-670,1,18367,carl_d_buchholz_iii,,3037.661,3037.899,Yes.
1993.93-670,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3052.17,3053.22,"Thank you, Mr. Buchholz."
1993.93-670,2,20128,charles_sovel,,3055.872,3056.802,If the Court please:
1993.93-670,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3087.243,3090.666,"Well, I thought there was also testimony that plastic is used for a lot of things?"
1993.93-670,2,20128,charles_sovel,,3090.666,3092.246,"Well, first of all, there was no testimony of that."
1993.93-670,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3150.843,3152.786,"Well, no, but no one could seriously contend that."
1993.93-670,2,20128,charles_sovel,,3159.479,3161.99,"--If there is other evidence to support it, and--"
1993.93-670,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3161.99,3164.253,"And if there isn't, then the jury shouldn't infer it."
1993.93-670,2,20128,charles_sovel,,3164.253,3164.564,--That's right.
