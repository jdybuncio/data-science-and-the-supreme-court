1994.93-1911,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.618,"We'll hear argument next in Number 93-1911, Cinda Sandin v. Demont Connor."
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,58.08,63.953,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,114.245,117.017,But it does make it a relevant finding.
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,117.017,130.164,It is relevant in the sense that a bad disciplinary record can be but need not be a basis for the denial of parole.
1994.93-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,130.164,130.886,Right.
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,146.487,158.155,"Yes, and Justice Souter, I would say that the driving force for parole decisions today in our State would be prison overcrowding."
1994.93-1911,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,249.665,254.359,"Before you continue with that, would you just step back for a moment?"
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,265.366,274.04,"Right, and Justice Ginsburg, I would refer Your Honor to the guidelines that begin on page 125 of the Joint Appendix."
1994.93-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,344.077,348.189,Is there a third alternative for us?
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,361.018,388.037,"Justice Souter, I suppose that because the concept of de minimis does exist in the law, that one could have that, but it would mean that a very large number of privileges that from a subjective sense to the prisoner would not be viewed as de minimis would be eligible for procedural due process protection."
1994.93-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,388.037,391.089,"Well, I presume we'd have an objective de minimis rule."
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,391.089,406.8,"Even then, in an objective test, I would think the category of de minimis, if the Court is going to treat it as it has been treated in the law, would mean that only a very small number of changes would be exempt from Federal judicial scrutiny."
1994.93-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,406.8,411.962,"It wouldn't be worth the trouble, from your standpoint, to have a de minimis rule?"
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,411.962,418.678,"We think that the longstanding theme of this Court's decisions dealing with prison management, that--"
1994.93-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,418.678,423.68,"Well, would it... just from your standpoint, from your client's standpoint, would it be worth your while to have such a rule?"
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,423.68,425.893,--It would be better than--
1994.93-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,425.893,429.655,"Would you rather have all or nothing, in effect, rather than have a de minimis rule?"
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,429.655,435.588,"--We don't think that line is administrable, no, Your Honor."
1994.93-1911,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,435.588,436.129,Okay.
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,455.512,458.255,"In that sense, Mr. Chief Justice, yes."
1994.93-1911,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,458.255,458.715,Yes.
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,466.33,467.361,Yes.
1994.93-1911,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,480.989,485.002,What is the underlying theory for that?
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,493.437,506.157,"Your Honor, we ask the Court in this case to look at the structure of cases such as Wolff v. McDonnell, as well as the extensive progeny in this area."
1994.93-1911,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,596.805,604.419,"May I ask you to test your position on Equal Protection, or, I suppose, the Eighth Amendment, too."
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,638.232,642.156,There would be review under the Equal Protection Clause--
1994.93-1911,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,642.156,642.937,"Yes, but I'm assuming no--"
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,642.937,643.428,--for minimum rationality.
1994.93-1911,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,643.428,665.169,"--no racial charge, nothing like that, just the person who made the decision, the argument would be, he acted arbitrarily because the crime... I mean, the offense was not nearly so... you know, whatever the reason might be, but you have to assume total discretion on the warden to use the kind of punishment I suggest, even if 99 percent of the time, in fact, it would mean an extra year in prison."
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,665.169,668.422,"Several answers, Your Honor."
1994.93-1911,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,682.661,690.548,"You may be right as a matter... all I'm asking you, am I not correctly describing the situation that your rule would tolerate?"
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,690.548,697.271,Our rule would not tolerate it if this was a charge that was simply made up.
1994.93-1911,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,699.083,699.675,Why not?
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,699.675,723.908,"--Because, as even this Court's cases recognize, although the equal protection line of arguments, the rational basis test, is a very lenient test, it is not a toothless test, and that, for example, City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, the Court actually will require some evidence to show that there is a rational basis for the assignment."
1994.93-1911,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,723.908,727.692,"So there would be judicial review of the sufficiency of the evidence, under your test?"
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,727.692,734.537,"Our position is that there would be only a minimal evidence requirement, but yes, there could be judicial review, so that--"
1994.93-1911,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,734.537,738.798,"But it would be a procedural requirement in my case, of minimum evidence?"
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,741.929,746.825,--I believe the... in my discussion with you that we're at least clarifying our brief.
1994.93-1911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,783.257,785.45,There's a lot less here than meets the eye.
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,795.638,796.429,"Well, the Court--"
1994.93-1911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,796.429,800.182,But you want them in there just on different evidentiary standards.
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,800.182,806.804,"--Well, we certainly don't want... as a client matter, I'm sure that my client would be thrilled if they were never there at all."
1994.93-1911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,812.838,815.76,"Well, it's a way to win the case, I suppose, but I just don't know how much you're winning."
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,827.709,829.131,--Yes.
1994.93-1911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,829.131,829.739,--What's that?
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,829.739,853.076,"I can understand Your Honor's concern that as a general matter, when reviewing legislation, the court will use the imagined rational basis standard, but even cases like... but in cases where there are as-applied equal protection challenges, and these challenges could be brought now, but obviously the litigants don't do... the plaintiffs don't do that, because they have a howitzer with the procedural Due Process Clause."
1994.93-1911,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,865.323,874.259,"Isn't there a good reason to think that the Cleburne case was something of a sport, in view of our subsequent equal protection jurisprudence?"
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,874.259,881.895,"Well, we do offer that as the support for what the constitutional backstop would be if the Court wanted to go in that way."
1994.93-1911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,881.895,882.736,I don't think it's a backstop.
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,912.383,915.375,"Well, it would be a minimal test, and at the same time, Your Honor, we--"
1994.93-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,915.375,916.647,"Yes, but may I interrupt you?"
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,968.539,988.194,"--I'd respectfully disagree, Justice Souter, because the present system is not only as complicated as you make it, but even much more so, because under Superintendent v. Hill we do have to provide already some evidence, and so we already would have to meet that component under procedural due process analysis."
1994.93-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,988.194,997.351,"Well, is there any reason to believe things would be simpler on a sufficiency of... minimal sufficiency of evidence test?"
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,997.351,1019.723,"Yes, indeed, because there are at least several other aspects of procedural due process protections, namely the requirement of a contemporary statement, and there are all kinds of conflicts that arise as to what has to go in the statement, how specific the reference has to be to the evidence, and these provoke a great amount of litigation, and in this case particularly, the issue of witnesses."
1994.93-1911,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1022.876,1033.693,"Well, suppose the prison authorities transferred the prisoner to solitary confinement, and he says, there's no reason for doing this, and they said, oh, we've heard a rumor that you're a troublemaker."
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1034.984,1048.786,I would say that being a troublemaker per se is not governed by the specific rules that we have in our institution.
1994.93-1911,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1048.786,1065.836,"No, I mean in this hypothetical regime, where we don't have procedural due process protections to any degree, but we do have a minimum requirement of some rationality, would the case that I put fit within that requirement and meet that requirement?"
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1065.836,1069.849,"I would have to answer that, Justice Kennedy, yes and no."
1994.93-1911,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1079.414,1080.315,"No, you don't have a rule."
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1085.909,1087.331,Then the answer would be yes.
1994.93-1911,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1087.331,1109.264,"I'm trying to follow Justice Souter's point, which is to try to explore whether or not the regime we would be substituting is really much of an improvement, and so I put you the case of an assignment to solitary confinement based on a rumor that he's a troublemaker, and I want to know if that meets the minimum small core of rationality that's required for prison officials to act."
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1109.264,1109.855,Yes.
1994.93-1911,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1111.935,1118.601,"What would be the inquiry, whether the person was in fact a troublemaker, or whether there was a rumor that he was a troublemaker?"
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1118.601,1128.018,It would be whether the official genuinely believed that that rumor had basis.
1994.93-1911,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1128.018,1129.179,But why is that?
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1192.879,1199.564,"Justice Scalia, the Court could certainly decide the case on that basis, and frankly my client would be thrilled if it did."
1994.93-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1201.144,1203.077,"Well, are you asking us to, or aren't you?"
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1203.077,1205.127,--What we offered--
1994.93-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1205.127,1208.14,Is that the basis upon which you want us to decide this case?
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1208.14,1209.88,--We have offered to the Court--
1994.93-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1209.88,1211.372,"Well, yes or no?"
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1211.372,1219.125,"--We would like that, but it is not necessary to decide it in that manner for us to prevail."
1994.93-1911,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1219.125,1224.489,"Mr. Michaels, can you spell out your equal protection theory, because I'm not sure I understand it."
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1229.123,1248.095,"Well, our position is that the Equal Protection Clause requires a rational basis for the decision with respect to a legitimate State interest, and it would go beyond, Your Honor, the type of suspect class analysis, and this is the way we presented it in both the cert petition and in our brief."
1994.93-1911,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1248.095,1254.9,"And I take it that's based on the theory, but maybe I'm wrong, that the Government must always have some reason for what it does?"
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1274.461,1275.352,That may well be--
1994.93-1911,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1275.352,1278.985,"Other than that, it's because there is some kind of liberty interest, as Justice Stevens' question points out."
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1278.985,1287.992,"--It is our position that, even in as-applied cases, that there has to be some rational basis."
1994.93-1911,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1292.215,1310.825,"Mr. Michaels, suppose we don't adopt your proposed new rule, do you think that application of existing precedents requires affirmance of the judgment below in this case?"
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1310.825,1312.748,"No, Justice O'Connor, we do not."
1994.93-1911,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1312.748,1314.779,Are you going to talk about that at all--
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1314.779,1315.269,Yes.
1994.93-1911,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1315.269,1315.788,--or not?
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1315.788,1316.139,Yes.
1994.93-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1365.583,1368.494,"Well, if you really could do that, why don't you go ahead and do it?"
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1375.478,1382.422,"Because it would not get us exactly where we want to go, which is to have guidance to our lower level officials."
1994.93-1911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1392.1,1393.409,You could... Hawaii could adopt all of those that it wants.
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1400.786,1403.006,"Yes, and what we submit is that--"
1994.93-1911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1403.006,1403.867,You want them to be.
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1409.181,1423.489,"--Our position is that as a matter of constitutional doctrine this Court's decisions in Hewitt v. Helms have made statements that the Court should be sensitive to the State's incentives in this area, and--"
1994.93-1911,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1423.489,1437.568,"Do you concede that Hawaii has created here a State-created liberty interest under the scheme you have here, under our existing precedents?"
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1437.568,1442.142,"--We disagree with that, Justice O'Connor, and with... and I'll address that now."
1994.93-1911,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1442.142,1443.692,And why do you disagree?
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1450.107,1452.348,It's a two-part argument.
1994.93-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1507.595,1511.296,"Well, doesn't that mean simply it's like an administrative Fifth Amendment?"
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1518.021,1522.616,We respectfully disagree with that characterization.
1994.93-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1532.981,1536.103,"Well, let me ask you a different question."
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1548.662,1552.082,Not explicitly.
1994.93-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1552.082,1556.977,"Well, you say it explicitly or you don't, and I take it there's nothing that says that."
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1564.591,1571.236,"It's our position that the way the rule is structured, that the committee can convict on less."
1994.93-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1571.236,1583.584,"No, but just tell me how the rule is structured, and on the question of conviction, as I understand, you say two things, the rule says two things: you shall convict on substantial evidence; silence is not enough."
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1585.074,1587.946,It says that you must convict on substantial evidence.
1994.93-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1587.946,1591.188,"Well, must, shall, it's mandatory, but that's all it says, isn't it?"
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1591.188,1591.909,"Right, and--"
1994.93-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1591.909,1592.4,Okay.
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1605.197,1607.851,--That's one possible reading of the rule.
1994.93-1911,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1607.851,1609.411,"Well, is it unreasonable?"
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1609.411,1618.017,"In light of the overall purposes, we believe that it is, in light of the overall purposes of the regulation."
1994.93-1911,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1618.017,1629.704,"So is there a case somewhere... I mean, how many instances have there been in which prisoners were, in fact, punished under this rule, though there was a finding there was not even substantial evidence, and they didn't admit guilt?"
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1631.945,1634.168,I can't cite any to the Court.
1994.93-1911,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1661.463,1662.315,What a weird system.
1994.93-1911,0,41729,steven_s_michaels,,1673.742,1675.084,It does vest--

1994.93-1911,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1736.474,1754.606,"But that word is constantly used to describe options for the appellate forum, court, and it doesn't mean that a court of appeals, for example, can do whatever it wants with regard to a district court decision just because it has authority to affirm, reverse, or modify."

1994.93-1911,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1932.012,1935.144,"Well, Hewitt certainly doesn't say that in so many words."

1994.93-1911,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2293.748,2297.58,"Exactly, and we're talking about how many should be lost."

1994.93-1911,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2341.499,2351.915,"Mr. Hoffman, suppose the State had a rule that disciplinary sanctions are within the sound discretion of the warden, period."

1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2403.178,2418.119,"--Well, I think the way that I would resolve the anomaly is to say that this Court would then be confronted with the question, or courts would be confronted with the question of whether the Due Process Clause itself provides protection against that form of arbitrary punishment."

1994.93-1911,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2513.041,2514.481,It's part of the punishment.
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2514.481,2530.281,"--I think that it's inconsistent with the many statements that this Court has made that there's no iron curtain between the Constitution and prisoners, because if the Due Process Clause means anything, I think the touchstone is protection of the individual against arbitrary Government conduct."
1994.93-1911,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2530.281,2540.599,"Yes, but you say you... in answer to my question you said, somebody could be treated much more arbitrarily and has no rights, if the State doesn't have a code of fair prison procedure."
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2549.095,2570.29,"Well, I think under this Court's State-created liberty interest doctrine, one of the thing that the Due Process Clause protects, in addition to whatever it protects apart from what the State provides, is that when the State provides something that a person can reasonably rely on as an entitlement, that this Court protects that entitlement by fair procedures, and in this--"
1994.93-1911,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2570.29,2581.796,"Well, in the supposition that Justice Ginsburg has put to you, where you have a State that says in the sound discretion of the warden you can be put in solitary confinement, suppose that were the regime?"
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2581.796,2582.307,--Yes.
1994.93-1911,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2582.307,2583.126,No rules.
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2596.837,2598.247,"Well, I think that if--"
1994.93-1911,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2598.247,2612.194,"And it sounds to me like it might well be, but would there be an underlying due process claim that you could bring to show that this was not within sound discretion as that term is generally understood under the law?"
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2612.194,2623.564,--I believe that this Court left open in Hewitt the question about whether there could be due process claims for that kind of arbitrary decision.
1994.93-1911,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2684.494,2690.447,But then it seems that even if there's a sound discretion standard there's going to be some litigation under the Due Process Clause.
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2692.168,2739.238,"Justice Kennedy, I believe that if, in fact, States gave unlimited discretion... in fact, if we went back to the days of the hands-off rule before Wolff started, what would happen is, there would be a new generation of litigation about what the due process required in a variety of situations and I believe, and certainly I would be urging, that what the ultimate result of that would be, is something that looked a lot like Wolff v. McDonnell and, in fact, I think Wolff v. McDonnell layes out a set of procedures that are well understood in the prisons of this country that are applied every day in hundreds of different situations, that are accepted, and about which there's not a lot of controversy, and they are very deferential to the States."
1994.93-1911,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2739.238,2777.244,"Well, counsel, after Wolff the Court decided a case called Vitek v. Jones in 1980, and this is what was said in that opinion: that changes in the conditions of confinement having a substantial adverse impact on the prisoner are not alone sufficient to invoke the protections of the Due Process Clause as long as the conditions or degree of confinement to which the prisoner is subjected is within the sentence imposed on him."
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2787.881,2805.874,"But this Court also said in Wolff that solitary confinement should be treated in the same manner, and I think that... and in this Court in Wright v. Enomoto summarily affirmed a case in which the issue of disciplinary segregation that was the only one that was involved."
1994.93-1911,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2805.874,2824.235,"Not just solitary, because you made a distinction between administrative segregation, so you could be in solitary and you wouldn't have this right, but one thing that puzzles me about this particular case, the 1983 action was begun at an interlocutory stage."
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2857.014,2860.758,"Well, I don't think that the warden's decision changed the character."
1994.93-1911,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2874.756,2880.342,"But didn't the warden, who has review authority and did review this, say that was wrong?"
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2887.416,2908.589,"Well, what happened is that after Mr. Connor filed a section 1983 claim in Federal District Court in March of 1988, the... Deputy Administrator Pikini expunged as part of the administrative review the 30-day sentence involved in the case, in May of 1988."
1994.93-1911,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2908.589,2914.042,So it's just like talking about a district court decision that's been vacated by the court of appeals.
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2914.042,2925.781,"Well, what is still at issue, although not in the questions presented, is whether there is any damage claim relating... for the wrongful 30-days in disciplinary punishment."
1994.93-1911,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2928.192,2945.703,"Would there be a damage claim for someone, let's say, who is incarcerated pending trial, and then that person is... it's found on appeal that the evidence was insufficient?"
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2949.836,2952.758,"--Not, I believe, on those facts."
1994.93-1911,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2952.758,2953.929,Then why is this different?
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2959.744,2969.408,"Well, I believe what... the problem is that he served the time, and he served the time because the State violated its due process obligations under the law."
1994.93-1911,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2969.408,2973.653,"But there was an appeal right and it was taken, and was successful."
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,2973.653,2986.261,"But he still suffered the harm, and the harm... I mean, I think he would have to show, as a matter of fact when it goes back down, that the harm was caused by that failure to afford him with due process, and his--"
1994.93-1911,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2986.261,2990.331,"Well, you're saying that the essence of the harm is its disciplinary character."
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3018.762,3032.901,"--Well, but I think that that... the question, as I understood it, presented in the case was whether there was a liberty interest created by these regulations so that he would get those benefits."
1994.93-1911,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3033.642,3061.138,"I'm interested right now in Justice Ginsburg's question, and it seems to me that in answer to her question there is nothing left for you to complain about with respect to a due process violation once the disciplinary character has been taken away, because the mere... the mere, minor increase in discomfort would not in and of itself present a liberty claim, had it been done administratively."
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3061.138,3065.682,"--Well, it's not... first of all, it's not clear that it would have been done administratively."
1994.93-1911,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3078.63,3081.143,Your answer is that it was not done administratively.
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3081.143,3081.802,It wasn't.
1994.93-1911,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3081.802,3084.254,You cannot retroactively make it done administratively.
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3086.527,3087.105,That's that.
1994.93-1911,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3087.105,3092.1,"And you can say later that was a mistake, but in fact it was done as a punishment."
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3092.1,3092.54,Right.
1994.93-1911,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3095.122,3102.946,"And there may be some question whether you can recover for that under 1983 or not, but that's not a standing question, it's a question of the merits."
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3102.946,3104.378,That's our position.
1994.93-1911,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3104.378,3114.003,"But it could be important, too, if the Court adopts some sort of calculus as to consequences for parole and that sort of thing."
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3127.653,3134.718,"Well, I think that that's true, Chief Justice Rehnquist, and I think that one of the problems, if I may just address the bright line proposal that--"
1994.93-1911,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3134.718,3142.455,Isn't there something like a failure to... the 1983 was at an interlocutory stage.
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3149.167,3167.04,"--I think that... as I understand it, after Patsy at least, there's no requirement to have exhausted the remedy to begin with, and that the section 1983 action would not be changed simply because there was this particular action that was taken after the section 1983--"
1994.93-1911,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3167.04,3169.961,"But in fact he did appeal, and in fact was successful on appeal."
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3169.961,3177.468,"--He was successful on that one issue, but he still served the time and suffered the punishment for no good reason, because from his standpoint he had a staff--"
1994.93-1911,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3177.468,3179.268,He didn't suffer the punishment.
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3191.126,3205.955,"--Well, there are no collateral consequences at this point, given what the administrator did with respect to this finding of misconduct, but what I would urge is that with respect to deciding what process is due, one can't know that in advance."
1994.93-1911,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3263.364,3270.089,"Mr. Hoffman, there's just one... you said... brought up the Patsy case, but that's going outside the prison setting."
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3288.13,3299.418,"--Well, but I don't think he... at that point, he had not even tried to take advantage of the due process that was afforded... he wouldn't have a violation at that point, because it's there."
1994.93-1911,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3299.418,3308.794,--Isn't part of the due process that you can go to the warden... it's certainly in that code that you're relying on for other reasons that says you can apply to the warden for review.
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3308.794,3343.596,"Well, but Wolff says that you also get a chance to call witnesses to prove your point, and so the due process violation that he's claiming is not that he didn't get something else that he could have gotten, but that he didn't get one thing that was central to his point, which was to try to prove that he didn't do what they said he did, and one of the things that Wolff does is say that unless there is some higher institutional interest in terms of institutional security, you get a right to call that witness in order to be able to prove your case."
1994.93-1911,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3343.596,3352.983,Wolff didn't present this situation of a warden having overturned the denial of good time at an earlier stage.
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3352.983,3353.602,Well--
1994.93-1911,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3353.602,3355.054,"I mean, suppose that had happened in Wolff."
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3363.348,3371.984,--I think that there would still be a due process claim about whether you receive due process at the time.
1994.93-1911,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3407.918,3409.959,So it's a bad procedural right.
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3427.373,3445.161,"--Well, I think that in truth the amount of damages that you suffer in a case like that if you're not, for example, put into solitary confinement but you've lost good time alone would be very hard to establish very many damages, but I think at least theoretically, if you've been denied the process due--"
1994.93-1911,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3445.161,3453.797,"You could... you'd have your claim, you could get declaratory relief, and you could get, what is it, 1 in damages, maybe."
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3453.797,3457.4,"--I mean, you might get nominal damages, you might not get nominal damages."
1994.93-1911,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3458.742,3462.914,"But it wouldn't... but the claim, you'd still have the claim, on your reasoning, right?"
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3462.914,3472.361,"--Well, I think that the claim, if there's a State-created liberty interest, or a liberty interest under the Due Process Clause, you would have a claim if the proper procedures are denied you, yes."
1994.93-1911,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3554.974,3573.055,"What the Court has basically done, I guess in this area as in property, is that it's said that one way of looking to see if there's a liberty or property interest is to see if the discretion of the decisionmaker to remove the thing from the person is significantly confined or cabined by State rules or regulations, right?"
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3573.055,3573.716,--Yes.
1994.93-1911,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3573.716,3581.161,"And sometimes the problem is, that protects things that seem trivial, and sometimes it doesn't protect things that seem important."
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3600.024,3603.627,"Well, I think it would be very difficult to draw the line."
1994.93-1911,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3608.138,3609.48,"Is there a better way, really?"
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3609.48,3612.312,"Well, I'm not sure that there is abetter way to draw the line."
1994.93-1911,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3650.877,3662.355,"Well, why wouldn't it suffice if we held for those matters it's a denial of due process if the States do not provide State court review of the prison determinations?"
1994.93-1911,1,37956,paul_l_hoffman,,3662.355,3690.201,"Well, I think that this Court's cases, certainly the Perat line of cases seem to indicate that when there's random and unauthorized State action, that post deprivation remedies would be appropriate, but I think that in a case where there's an established procedure like this one, that's been in existence for more than 20 years, that the issue is really what process is due as part of this determination, not at some later point in a State court hearing on damages."
1994.93-1911,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3690.201,3691.453,"Thank you, Mr. Hoffman."
