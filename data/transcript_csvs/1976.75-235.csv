1976.75-235,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,14.057,"The Court will hear arguments first this morning in No. 75-235, G.M. Leasing Corporation v. the United States."
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,17.599,20.534,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-235,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,92.508,96.565,(Inaudible)
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,96.565,103.437,"No, Your Honor I do not believe so they cost approximately $40,000 a piece."
1976.75-235,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,103.437,106.169,The contemplation was nonetheless these were going to be leased?
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,106.169,110.95,"Yes, I think it was going to be worldwide Your Honor."
1976.75-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,121.644,125.278,Didn’t the Utah record show they had made any business at all?
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,125.278,127.519,They had not yet leased the cars Your Honor.
1976.75-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,127.519,129.279,Or anything else?
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,129.279,148.811,"Well, they had obtained the lease forms, they were preparing the cars for lease; they had not yet have them for that amount of time and they had negotiated to acquire a showroom, they had obtained lease forms, they contacted prospective lessees, they contacted other dealerships to see if they could obtain cars at a discount price for leasing."
1976.75-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,151.49,154.216,And had they any employees?
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,154.216,156.932,The record shows they had no employees.
1976.75-235,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,156.932,159.446,How recently had the company that incorporated?
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,159.446,165.892,"My recollection Your Honor, I am not positive, but I think it was within the year."
1976.75-235,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,221.37,223.06,Is Mr. Norman a fugitive now?
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,223.06,225.34,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.75-235,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,225.34,230.849,"Does this bring into play possibly the Molinaro doctrine, you know the Molinaro case?"
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,230.849,234.358,I am not certain of that doctrine Your Honor.
1976.75-235,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,365.373,370.608,"Mr. Leedy, you are referring to Mr. Norman and petitioner as if they were two separate entities."
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,374.616,383.15,"I certainly do, I would rather adopt the trials court’s finding that they were not alter ego or nominee status."
1976.75-235,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,523.621,534.051,"In your view the counsel who was in court, before court in that proceeding if the taxpayer was a fugitive?"
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,534.051,539.34,The petitioner whose assets have been seized Your Honor he was seeking to obtain the return of his assets.
1976.75-235,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,539.34,542.296,When you say the petitioner and he?
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,557.372,561.551,"I was referring to the District Director refusing to answer the questions, Your Honor."
1976.75-235,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,561.551,566.055,I am asking you who was in the court on behalf of the taxpayer.
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,566.055,568.94,Myself.
1976.75-235,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,573.444,576.49,I think that is what gives rise to some problem perhaps.
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,576.49,579.474,I understand.
1976.75-235,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,579.474,589.718,"You do not claim that you have contemporary authority from your client who is a fugitive to you, Mr. Norman."
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,589.718,595.093,"I have his Power of Attorney, Your Honor, and I do represent him in tax court."
1976.75-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,602.434,605.815,"Well, in his absence who is running the Corporation?"
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,605.815,607.558,"His son, Your Honor."
1976.75-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,607.558,609.244,Is he a party to this?
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,609.244,613.685,He became an intervener when they seized certain assets of his own.
1976.75-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,613.685,617.394,"Why did he have to intervene, if he represents the Corporation?"
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,617.394,623.57,"The Corporation brought suit on its own name, Your Honor, for the assets that were seized from the Corporation."
1976.75-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,623.57,628.947,"And if that was his Corporation, he would not have intervene, wouldn’t he?"
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,628.947,634.468,"My belief that the Corporation has a standing of its own to bring its own lawsuit, for the loss of its assets."
1976.75-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,634.468,641.091,"Well, this is a one man corporation -- is the Corporation a fugitive too?"
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,641.091,645.593,"No, Your Honor."
1976.75-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,645.593,649.965,"Well, supposing on, and levying on the Corporation, how would you?"
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,649.965,654.025,You would give notice to its officers and directors I believe.
1976.75-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,656.266,659.429,"They are what, who?"
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,659.429,661.298,"There were three individuals, Your Honor."
1976.75-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,661.298,667.492,"You keep saying ‘were’ -- I am asking, are the officers as of today?"
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,669.094,670.398,"Yes, I do."
1976.75-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,670.398,672.147,"Well, is the Corporation had meeting?"
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,672.147,674.709,"Yes, it has, Your Honor."
1976.75-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,674.709,676.905,Without the President?
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,676.905,682.346,"He is no longer President -- the fugitive, you are talking about, he is no longer the President, Your Honor?"
1976.75-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,682.346,685.21,Was that in his record?
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,685.21,687.585,"I believe it is, yes, Your Honor."
1976.75-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,688.918,692.094,He is a fugitive in the record.
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,692.094,696.937,"Yes, but I believe the evidence showed that the son testified at the District Court level."
1976.75-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,711.222,713.935,What position does his mother has?
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,713.935,717.055,"I am not certain, but the officers said she is the Director."
1976.75-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,717.055,721.593,"Is she the one that told the agent she had nothing to do with the Corporation, she was just a housewife?"
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,721.593,726.754,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1976.75-235,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,726.754,733.238,"Mr. Leedy, any claims of Norman III, the son, are not addition here are they?"
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,733.238,739.852,"No, Your Honor, he also prevailed in the District Court and the government, did not appeal as the decision in his favor."
1976.75-235,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,739.852,747.836,"One last question, precisely where the automobiles when they were seized?"
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,749.958,753.592,There were two in a parking lot in Los Angeles.
1976.75-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,763.815,766.997,(Inaudible)
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,766.997,772.143,"The evidence showed Your Honor that when the IRS agents visited the house, there were some in the driveway."
1976.75-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,782.522,789.278,Were all of them aware of the that?
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,789.278,791.25,"I do not believe so, Your Honor."
1976.75-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,792.09,795.341,But this case -- whether in the street or whether in the garage.
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,795.341,796.742,"Not as I view it, Your Honor."
1976.75-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,796.742,800.659,(Inaudible)
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,800.659,802.599,Well they did for those -- excuse me.
1976.75-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,802.599,805.759,One or the other (Inaudible).
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,805.759,807.155,"No, Your Honor."
1976.75-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,807.155,808.985,Why not?
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,808.985,816.088,"Now the door that they removed the locks on, Your Honor had to do with the office building where they went in and took the records of the --"
1976.75-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,816.088,818.337,Seized on the public streets?
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,818.337,822.192,"I did not say that, I said I did not know, Your Honor, I did not believe so."
1976.75-235,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,822.192,824.291,"But, don’t you know the record?"
1976.75-235,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,830.069,833.546,"Mr. Leedy, one last question and I will stop bothering you."
1976.75-235,0,39800,richard_j_leedy,,839.683,840.334,"Yes, Your Honor."
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1508.234,1509.921,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1976.75-235,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1674.742,1682.407,"Well, now all of this goes to the reasonableness and validity of the jeopardy assessment which I thought you began by saying, it was not an issue?"
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1682.407,1687.516,"Well, I think Mr. Justice Stewart it goes somewhat at least to the reasonable..."
1976.75-235,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1687.516,1695.833,I thought in this case we began; we proceeded upon the premise that there was a jeopardy assessment and the validity of that assessment is not an issue here.
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1695.833,1697.237,That is quite correct Mr. Justice Stewart.
1976.75-235,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1708.631,1712.808,Are you suggesting that there are different gradations of jeopardy assessments?
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1712.808,1717.235,"No, no I am not discussing the jeopardy assessment Mr. Justice Stewart, I am discussing the entries and so forth to the background."
1976.75-235,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1717.235,1724.347,That is right and we begin then with a jeopardy assessment as a given upon that premise.
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1731.977,1742.367,"Well, I am going to suggest, I think that the reasonableness of an entry in certain kinds of cases could be drawn into question for outrageous entry, a private residence for example."
1976.75-235,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1747.497,1754.549,"Well, if the jeopardy assessment were less clearly valid, would this be a different kind of case?"
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1754.549,1756.128,No sir.
1976.75-235,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1756.128,1757.409,That was my question.
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1757.409,1762.082,I made to describing the urgency which they began to feel about this case.
1976.75-235,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1762.082,1772.829,I suppose if you needed the -- if the board decides that you needed to enter this premises you are probably suggesting that there is some probable cause.
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1772.829,1774.77,I am suggesting that Mr. Justice White.
1976.75-235,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1774.77,1783.361,And do you think that the government needed probable cause to enter these premises?
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1783.361,1788.28,"Well, if needed probable cause the former probable cause it needed I believe was an assessment."
1976.75-235,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1788.28,1793.786,"I know, but I asked you whether they needed probable cause."
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1793.786,1800.162,"No, I do not think so Mr. Justice White unless it needed an assessment."
1976.75-235,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1800.162,1806.726,"Well, let us assume there is a jeopardy assessment and you say it is valid, assume that."
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1815.924,1820.99,"No, no, I think they have to have a good faith belief that there is property in the premises."
1976.75-235,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1820.99,1822.066,And assets of the taxpayer?
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1822.066,1834.39,"Assets of the taxpayer, and I should point out that the service, as a matter of policy does not enter private residences if there is any objection unless consent is given."
1976.75-235,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1834.39,1836.764,That policy must be motivated by something.
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1836.764,1838.145,I think it is motivated by --
1976.75-235,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1838.145,1840.395,By the Constitution?
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1840.395,1846.532,I think it is motivated by their concern that private residences have a much greater privacy interest.
1976.75-235,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1846.532,1848.833,In which Constitution of the United States?
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1848.833,1850.382,I would think so.
1976.75-235,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1862.167,1868.803,"Your position is still is though that there was no probable cause requirement, to enter the premises of the government, isn’t it?"
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1868.803,1872.511,"Well, probable cause varies Mr. Justice White from case to case and I think --"
1976.75-235,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1872.511,1876.468,"Well, whatever it was, you say, you could forget about it."
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1876.468,1883.971,"Well, I do not know if we are talking about the same thing, what I am saying is you cannot forget about certain pre-requisites, which may call probable cause."
1976.75-235,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1896.942,1900.941,That much was necessary in any event in effect to enter the premises.
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1900.941,1909.79,"Well, I think, -- yes, if they had no idea whether these premises were the taxpayers or whether there was any property anywhere around, I think that would be --"
1976.75-235,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1909.79,1914.295,"But surely, even so your position certainly is that there was no necessity for any warrant?"
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1914.295,1915.834,"Certainly, that is our position."
1976.75-235,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1915.834,1927.696,"And the probable cause I take it focuses on whether or not there were assets, whether there was probable cause that assets could be discovered on the premises that would satisfy the jeopardy assessment?"
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1927.696,1939.668,"Yes, but I think Mr. Justice Rehnquist, a case when it is the taxpayer’s property, that would almost always be probable cause to think that this building was seized as well."
1976.75-235,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1945.851,1955.271,What if there were probable cause only to believe that there was evidence but no probable cause to believe that there were assets?
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1957.103,1959.837,Evidence Mr. Justice Rehnquist of what?
1976.75-235,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1959.837,1961.484,Of criminal tax liability.
1976.75-235,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1961.484,1963.215,"Well the books, the books of the company."
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1963.215,1970.792,"No, I do not think one could use this kind of entry to secure evidence of a crime were --"
1976.75-235,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1970.792,1974.279,"I know, but what about the books of the corporation."
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1979.552,1983.621,"Well, I think those could be seized for the purposes that the --"
1976.75-235,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1983.621,1987.146,"If you know they were not worth anything, you would not pay any taxes."
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1994.47,1996.811,"Well, let me say two things about that."
1976.75-235,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2041.613,2048.909,How did they found out that some of the cars were located down in Los Angeles from these records?
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2048.909,2051.26,I do not know the answer to that Mr. Chief Justice.
1976.75-235,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2053.502,2066.268,At what stage did the agents observed the apparent surreptitious removal of boxes of materials sometime from the --
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2066.268,2071.393,"Well, they made the first entry into the bungalow office on the 21st of March."
1976.75-235,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2252.689,2258.125,Would it have made any difference if the automobiles had been on the private property of the taxpayer?
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2258.125,2263.294,"Well, Mr. Justice Powell, I think if they had seized the automobile in the garage."
1976.75-235,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2293.569,2299.079,(Inaudible)
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2299.079,2301.149,"I think it would, Mr. Justice White."
1976.75-235,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2301.149,2304.682,But not in the garage?
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2304.682,2308.373,"I do not know that I am willing to say that it was not in the garage, but it is slightly the case."
1976.75-235,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2308.373,2309.293,But it was like the factor --
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2309.293,2312.668,"No, that is quite right."
1976.75-235,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2355.244,2358.055,"Mr. Solicitor General, you mentioned entry into the office."
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2361.539,2365.607,"I do not think so, Mr. Justice Stevens."
1976.75-235,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2365.607,2367.412,"It was the residence of the son, was it not?"
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2367.412,2379.788,"Well, the record shows, George Norman III, the son, who was 19-years-old at that time, testifies at page 34 of the Appendix, that he had moved in for security purposes because there have been some break-ins."
1976.75-235,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2396.71,2402.572,"Well, does your argument in this case depend on assuming that it is not a residence then?"
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2402.572,2405.744,"I think if this were a residence, it would be a more difficult case."
1976.75-235,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2405.744,2411.531,"Well, I know, but is your argument -- what are you asking us to hold?"
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2416.581,2421.876,I am asking you to decide the case in reply to a non-residence Mr. Justice Stevens.
1976.75-235,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2438.96,2444.882,"If they did not think it was a residence, why did not they continue their total search the first time they entered?"
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2447.264,2452.522,"That is correct, they went in and they saw the stove and the refrigerator and out of abundance of caution went out."
1976.75-235,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2581.956,2600.956,"It was adopted however against the background of revulsion against writs of assistance and general warrants and specifically against the background of the use of those devises to search to see whether or not a person owe taxes, isn’t that correct?"
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2600.956,2602.922,"To search to see, whether or not a person owe taxes."
1976.75-235,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2602.922,2605.85,"That was a specific background, was it not?"
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2605.85,2616.78,"It is quite correct Mr. Justice Stewart, by the writ of assistance, a general writ of assistance was an authority search almost at random to see whether there was property in the houses and had no --"
1976.75-235,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2616.78,2619.508,Population excise tax should have been paid to do advertising.
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2619.508,2620.788,That is quite correct.
1976.75-235,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2630.104,2632.726,It has been determined unilaterally.
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2632.726,2640.672,"Well, it has been determined in this case for example after consultation with the Revenue Council, with all the agents, it was quite a federal investigation here."
1976.75-235,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2640.672,2644.953,"Hasn’t it been determined after any adjudication, which has been determined unilaterally by the collector?"
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2644.953,2657.679,"That is correct, but that is precisely what has happened throughout our history, from the adoption of the constitution on the First Congress which proposed the adoption of the Fourth Amendment along with the rest of the Bill of Rights of course."
1976.75-235,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2683.104,2689.675,Your position is -- you never need a warrant.
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2692.847,2696.873,I do not advance the position that brought here today Mr. Justice Marshall.
1976.75-235,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2697.964,2703.346,"Well, I think you are pretty close to it because you had weeks, you had three weeks here."
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2705.101,2706.504,We had three weeks?
1976.75-235,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2729.492,2736.6,You see I have trouble with the practical point because it is just as easy to go and get a warrant.
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2738.808,2740.73,Oh I think there was an urgency once the assessment --
1976.75-235,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2740.73,2744.077,"I do not know, I cannot recognize an urgency when you stand for three weeks."
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2745.852,2753.445,"Well, Mr. Justice Marshall the assessment was actually made I believe on the 19th, on the next day on the 20th they went to Mrs. Norman and demanded payment."
1976.75-235,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2760.168,2763.376,What was three days?
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2763.376,2781.819,"Well, I have been arguing that, in this case as in the case like Biswell, the operation of the program would be brought to a standstill, if you had to locate a property and then go get a warrant for each item of property particularly describing it --"
1976.75-235,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2781.819,2785.876,"I said that when they knew about these six cars, wasn’t it six?"
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2785.876,2786.889,I believe it was seven but --
1976.75-235,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2786.889,2792.725,"Seven, when they know about those, could not they have gotten a warrant to seize those?"
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2792.725,2796.019,"Well, they would have the goal for example."
1976.75-235,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2798.444,2801.607,If they could describe the cars.
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2801.607,2808.612,"Yes, but if you regard this as a Fourth Amendment search and seizure warrant I would suppose you have to describe their location and so forth."
1976.75-235,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2808.612,2823.591,"Well, I just recognize the Fourth Amendment is there, it is my trouble, and I can understand why in certain occasions IRS has a great emergency and the guys at the airport with a bundle of money under their bag may take off."
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2835.184,2844.538,"I think in this case you would have had to locate the automobiles, post guards on each one of them, can go back to the court and get the warrant for the seizure and since there was --"
1976.75-235,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2844.538,2847.845,How many cars did you see in the driveway the first day they went there?
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2847.845,2849.419,"The record only says ‘several’, but they did not --"
1976.75-235,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2849.419,2850.037,Several.
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2850.037,2851.646,They did not try to seize them that day.
1976.75-235,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2851.646,2854.01,They could have gotten a warrant that day.
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2854.01,2855.218,They did not know who the cars belonged to.
1976.75-235,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2861.265,2863.514,Then they could have gotten a warrant.
1976.75-235,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2863.514,2864.939,They could have gotten a warrant.
1976.75-235,2,39800,richard_j_leedy,,3426.87,3430.902,I was going to indicate I believe my time is almost gone Mr. Chief Justice.
1976.75-235,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3517.255,3525.908,"Mr. Leedy before you sit down, will you refresh my recollection on just exactly what the posture of Mr. Norman III, the son, is in the litigation now."
1976.75-235,2,39800,richard_j_leedy,,3527.523,3528.655,"No, Your Honor."
1976.75-235,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3547.189,3551.736,And he does not have any pending claim for damages or anything like that?
1976.75-235,2,39800,richard_j_leedy,,3552.08,3553.724,"Yes, I think there would be, Your Honor."
1976.75-235,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3559.532,3560.872,"Yes, he is still (Inaudible)."
1976.75-235,2,39800,richard_j_leedy,,3571.724,3575.99,"The only person before this Court is G.M. Leasing Corporation, the petitioner."
1976.75-235,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3588.203,3592.478,But in any event in this Court we are only concerned with the status of G.M. Leasing Corporation.
1976.75-235,2,39800,richard_j_leedy,,3592.478,3592.625,Yes sir.
1976.75-235,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3592.625,3593.999,Its interest in the premises.
1976.75-235,2,39800,richard_j_leedy,,3593.999,3596.889,"Yes sir, thank you."
1976.75-235,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3596.889,3597.799,Thank you gentlemen.
