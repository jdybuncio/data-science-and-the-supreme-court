1995.94-1592,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,14.121,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-1592, Brother... spectators are admonished to be quiet until you get outside the courtroom."
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,35.916,44.761,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1592,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,84.571,87.363,What do you mean when you say train operations?
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,87.363,94.488,"--Meaning, a crew goes on duty and performs service for the railroad."
1995.94-1592,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,193.206,195.058,"Where are you reading from, Mr. Mann?"
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,195.058,195.416,"--Excuse me, Your Honor."
1995.94-1592,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,195.416,195.967,And where will we find it?
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,195.967,199.48,This is section 21103--
1995.94-1592,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,199.48,202.021,Page 2 of the petition?
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,202.021,208.496,"--In my brief, Your Honor, it is... yes, page 2 of the petition."
1995.94-1592,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,240.258,242.411,"Well, are you reading out the word, interim?"
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,242.411,252.286,"--The interim, Justice Souter, means interim between the time you go on duty and the time that you're finally released from duty."
1995.94-1592,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,252.286,256.099,It doesn't mean interim as between two periods of active duty?
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,256.099,257.391,"It does not, Your Honor."
1995.94-1592,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,257.391,260.075,Do we have a definition in the statute?
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,260.075,262.185,"Well, we have some legislative history."
1995.94-1592,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,281.537,283.069,"I'm sorry, I'm just not getting it."
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,289.016,289.403,"--Well, interim--"
1995.94-1592,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,289.403,289.964,Interim.
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,289.964,303.805,"--Interim means, as discussed in the House hearings and the industry spokesman, the Association of American Railroads, made that point clear, Your Honor, if I--"
1995.94-1592,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,303.805,310.848,"Well, he may have done it, but is there a House or a Senate report that defines the term, or indicates--"
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,310.848,311.399,--It does not define the term.
1995.94-1592,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,313.202,323.316,"--If I understand your argument correctly, your meaning would have been conveyed better if the word interim were left out, just a period available for rest."
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,323.316,323.576,--Well--
1995.94-1592,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,323.576,328.721,What does interim add that helps rather than hurts your position?
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,328.721,332.114,--It... I submit it doesn't hurt my position.
1995.94-1592,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,336.045,343.1,"But you would be stronger, your argument would be stronger, would it not, if the statute didn't say, interim?"
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,343.1,404.491,"Somewhat, but I don't think it's definitive, because as the railroad... the chief railroad witness, and I think it's very critical, testified, and I refer to the House hearings at page 135, where Mr. Manion... Mr. Manion was the vice president of the Association of American Railroads, and he was talking about the problems of deadheading transportation and what would happen if the bill as was introduced were adopted, and after he discussed that part, he said, however, under another provision of H.R. 8449, which is the section dealing with interim periods for rest, section 1(b)(3)... now, that is exactly the same as what was passed, subsection (5), and I quote:"
1995.94-1592,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,427.737,428.278,Who says this?
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,437.645,457.839,"Except, Your Honors, this was an industry spokesman, the Association of American Railroads, on a bill that only affected them, and what Congress was attempting to do is to close all these loopholes, and I submit to you, this statement as far as I am concerned--"
1995.94-1592,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,457.839,462.642,"Well, how do we know that Congress intended to ""close all these loopholes""?"
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,462.642,466.054,"--Well, the act solely--"
1995.94-1592,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,466.054,468.335,It's not called the loopholes-closing act.
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,468.496,468.816,"--No, Your Honor."
1995.94-1592,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,513.926,518.48,But is there something in there that talks about the definition of deadhead transportation?
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,518.48,518.64,"Yes, there is."
1995.94-1592,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,518.64,526.958,"Deadhead transportation, I would think sometimes when people are transported they include the time that they're sitting around in the station waiting room--"
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,526.958,528.128,"Well, that's--"
1995.94-1592,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,528.128,528.739,--or the airport--
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,528.739,530.301,--That's one of the issues.
1995.94-1592,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,530.301,537.393,"--and sometimes they don't, so it all seems quite ambiguous to me, anyway, and if it's ambiguous, shouldn't you leave this kind of interpretation to the agency?"
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,537.393,542.288,"Well, two things, Justice Breyer."
1995.94-1592,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,561.104,563.495,"But that doesn't do it, does it?"
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,563.495,563.835,Well--
1995.94-1592,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,563.835,565.246,I say I'm traveling to Boston.
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,570.488,571.189,--That's correct.
1995.94-1592,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,571.189,571.359,All right.
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,581.567,582.658,There are three things.
1995.94-1592,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,607.032,622.032,"--Mr. Mann, is it your position that if you are deadheaded back to your final point of release, while you're waiting to get the first train, let's say to Omaha, that is on-duty time?"
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,634.012,636.142,All time... all time--
1995.94-1592,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,636.142,646.571,"--So you're not on duty while you go from Omaha to... where did... from wherever you're... wherever you end your work to Omaha, you're not on duty--"
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,646.571,647.162,--You are on duty.
1995.94-1592,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,647.162,648.574,--While you're being transported?
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,648.574,649.365,You're on duty.
1995.94-1592,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,655.872,658.526,I thought deadheaded transportation back is not counted.
1995.94-1592,0,34809,lawrence_m_mann,,658.526,664.501,"--Deadheaded transportation back, at the end of your tour of duty, at the end of your tour--"
1995.94-1592,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1893.331,1900.825,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1592,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1985.316,1986.796,"Well, what about the abuse argument?"
1995.94-1592,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2003.661,2004.742,"Well, a couple of responses."
1995.94-1592,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2019.094,2020.837,"They didn't draw any distinction, you're saying."
1995.94-1592,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2020.837,2021.518,"--No, and--"
1995.94-1592,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2021.518,2025.21,So that the problem Congress had was a unified problem.
1995.94-1592,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2025.21,2052.757,"--That's correct, and the Senate committee report stated that part of the problem was that an employee... several hours of an employee's off-duty time might be time deadheading back from his duty assignment, so clearly... there's no evidence in the legislative history that Congress believed that the ride in the deadhead vehicle itself was typically short, but that the waiting periods were typically lengthy, so I don't believe that the legislative history provides a basis for distinguishing between the two."
1995.94-1592,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2076.737,2081.549,"May I just get your view on one, kind of fundamental thing for me?"
1995.94-1592,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2092.417,2095.679,"--I don't know if I would say that Mr. Manion specifically, but yes, I think--"
1995.94-1592,2,39617,ronald_m_johnson,,2756.068,2763.832,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1592,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2820.359,2820.59,What do you call them?
1995.94-1592,2,39617,ronald_m_johnson,,2824.275,2829.709,"--There's a lot of industry jargon, Your Honor, and the crew is outlawed at that point in time."
1995.94-1592,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2894.243,2907.052,"What about the period of time when the employee reports to go on duty, and is waiting for transportation to the duty station?"
1995.94-1592,2,39617,ronald_m_johnson,,2907.052,2910.315,"Well, they're paid at that point in time, too, Justice O'Connor."
1995.94-1592,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2910.315,2912.085,For the waiting period?
1995.94-1592,2,39617,ronald_m_johnson,,2912.085,2915.177,"Yes, and actually they're paid a little extra amount, because--"
1995.94-1592,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2915.177,2919.801,And are they considered on duty during the waiting period?
1995.94-1592,2,39617,ronald_m_johnson,,2919.801,2920.041,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-1592,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3046.075,3064.577,"What penalties are there for violating... I mean, I can imagine you might have a snowstorm or something, and you can just stop the train, but if that unforeseen delay causes your crew to be on duty longer than you had expected, what would the penalties be?"
1995.94-1592,2,39617,ronald_m_johnson,,3064.577,3070.642,"Well, the penalties, the minimum penalty to be imposed is $500 per violation."
1995.94-1592,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3099.152,3101.135,"Of course, they might make an exception for snowstorms."
1995.94-1592,2,39617,ronald_m_johnson,,3119.058,3119.878,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-1592,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3182.184,3186.658,May I ask to whom the penalties are paid for violations?
1995.94-1592,2,39617,ronald_m_johnson,,3186.658,3189.44,--The penalties are paid to the United States Government.
1995.94-1592,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3223.724,3226.355,"Well, of course, I mean, you know, an argument can be made for the other side."
1995.94-1592,2,39617,ronald_m_johnson,,3232.342,3236.021,--The minimum rest period is 8 hours.
1995.94-1592,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3239.894,3240.615,Okay.
1995.94-1592,2,39617,ronald_m_johnson,,3240.615,3250.443,"Now, that rest period doesn't begin... what happens when they reach... you know, there's all this railroad industry jargon in the statute, but again, the place of final release simply means the building that they walk into when they clock out."
1995.94-1592,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3272.54,3283.328,"Okay, but doesn't this scheme of the statute show that Congress thought that an 8-hour rest period is needed for a... what, 10-hour normal work period?"
1995.94-1592,2,39617,ronald_m_johnson,,3283.328,3284.507,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.94-1592,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3284.507,3289.852,"But a 10-hour rest period is needed for a 12-hour work period, is that right?"
1995.94-1592,2,39617,ronald_m_johnson,,3289.852,3290.551,Yes.
1995.94-1592,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3290.551,3326.865,"So the law... you can't say there's just an absolute rest period which is going to be a balm for all ills, no matter how long you've been on... you know, working before then, and what the union is saying is look, realistically, traveling, deadheading back is... it takes it out of you, and if I should get 10 hours' rest for 12 hours' duty, I should also get 10 hours' rest for 10 hours of duty plus 2 hours of deadheading back, including the waiting time for the deadheading."
1995.94-1592,2,39617,ronald_m_johnson,,3342.496,3349.062,"Your Honor, they have a way to get that, and the way they get that is expressly addressed in the statute, and that is through collective bargaining."
1995.94-1592,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3361.119,3367.134,"This is a safety issue, they say, and Congress... you know, Congress was concerned with safety."
1995.94-1592,2,39617,ronald_m_johnson,,3367.134,3372.238,"--That's true, Your Honor, and Congress, though, has made the judgment that safety is satisfied here."
1995.94-1592,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3440.898,3444.71,"Indeed, it's purely fortuitous whether it helps that problem or hurts that problem."
1995.94-1592,2,39617,ronald_m_johnson,,3445.841,3465.906,"That's correct, Your Honor, and again, the parties are meeting together in task force to address the safety issues that may result from these irregular work schedules, and Congress last year did add an amendment to the Hours of Service Act that encouraged the parties to work together to develop a solution, if there is a problem here, on irregular work hours."
1995.94-1592,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3495.096,3498.198,May I ask one very important question?
1995.94-1592,2,39617,ronald_m_johnson,,3504.262,3513.789,That picks... that refers to the crew that comes out from the terminal to pick up the train that got outlawed because it fell short of its final destination because the first crew outlawed--
1995.94-1592,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3513.789,3514.76,So they're the substitute crew.
1995.94-1592,2,39617,ronald_m_johnson,,3514.76,3516.412,"--They're the substitute crew, Your Honor."
