1991.91-543,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,18.373,"We'll hear argument now in No. 91-543, New York v. United States, 91-558, the County of Allegany v. United States, 91-563, the County of Cortland v. United States."
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,19.745,23.665,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-543,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,214.952,226.409,"Mr. Schiff, is that all this case is about, that Congress is going to have to tie New York's continuing receipt of highway funds to its assumption of this responsibility?"
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,226.409,230.701,"Well, if that is legal, but it hasn't done that, Your Honor."
1991.91-543,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,230.701,236.164,"It seems like a lot of trouble for very little, very little point."
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,236.164,252.306,"Well, it's our position that the means that the Congress uses is a very important consideration in the constitutional structure of this, of the Government."
1991.91-543,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,281.695,299.887,"Mr. Schiff, do you suppose Congress could provide that a state without a site for radioactive waste, that no shipments of radioactive waste could be sent out of state?"
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,299.887,302.269,"Yes, we think that's perfectly acceptable."
1991.91-543,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,313.775,315.558,Let me ask you another question.
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,320.37,323.192,We think not.
1991.91-543,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,323.192,324.674,Why not?
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,332.138,354.263,"Well, as we point out in our brief, we think the legislative history, all of which really shows up in the congressional record I think on December 19 of 1985, the day that this law was passed, shows that the, we don't think it would have been passed by simply excising the take title provision."
1991.91-543,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,372.906,378.991,"Well, I would have thought the problems were so acute that they probably would have passed it without that clause."
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,387.737,408.309,"Well, as we read the legislative history, it came at the instance of the governors of the so-called sited states, ones that had disposal sites, and they made it plaint that they did not think that the legislation as it stood at that point was sufficiently, it didn't have enough teeth."
1991.91-543,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,448.706,453.379,"What do we do if there's no legislative history, or we don't think any of it is very convincing?"
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,458.641,463.065,"--Well, I think--"
1991.91-543,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,463.065,464.846,How do we decide severability?
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,470.0,472.561,"--Well, I think there are two elements, Justice Scalia."
1991.91-543,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,513.618,515.668,"Well, did the title provision originate in the Senate?"
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,515.668,517.631,Yes.
1991.91-543,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,521.423,522.794,"And your senator was all for it, I take it?"
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,522.794,527.807,Senator Moynihan supported the legislation.
1991.91-543,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,535.761,536.222,That's all right.
1991.91-543,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,537.894,541.576,"He wasn't representing the State of New York anyway, was he?"
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,542.327,545.49,"Not in a constitutional sense, Your Honor."
1991.91-543,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,545.49,547.122,"He was representing the people of New York, wasn't he?"
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,547.122,560.992,"He was representing the people of New York and he was acting as a senator, but he was not representing the constituted government of the State of New York which has to speak through the legislature and the governor."
1991.91-543,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,631.198,637.512,How exactly does this act of Congress violate the Tenth Amendment in your view?
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,637.512,645.188,Because this act regulates not so much commerce as it regulates the states.
1991.91-543,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,668.825,673.048,"Well, how about where Congress regulates a state-owned railroad?"
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,673.048,690.078,"Well, this is... the difference between this case and those cases, Your Honor, is that there what Congress is doing is to regulate an activity that the state has already chosen to undertake."
1991.91-543,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,726.761,737.239,You say the Congress just included states among the people it was regulating for carrying on a certain activity and it didn't single out states?
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,737.239,737.749,That's right.
1991.91-543,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,789.125,792.086,"Mr. Schiff, are you asking that Garcia be overruled?"
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,792.086,793.396,"--No, we're not."
1991.91-543,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,793.396,798.271,You're willing to sit on the little open door that was left there?
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,798.271,799.99,Absolutely.
1991.91-543,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,809.707,811.698,Are you asking that FERC be overruled?
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,813.1,814.22,No.
1991.91-543,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,843.341,849.645,"Well, you know that it, you know that's a, just a dream world."
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,849.645,869.398,"--Well, that's what some of the, that's what the dissenters indicated, and I'm not... but the fact of the matter is that the decision as it was written indicated quite plainly that that was critical to that decision."
1991.91-543,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,869.398,877.265,What are the underlying values that you're trying to further by the Tenth Amendment argument that you urge upon us?
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,887.31,911.757,"Well, we think, Justice Kennedy, that, as Justice O'Connor's opinion recently in the Ashcroft case indicated, that the Federal system is a very significant element in the constitutional structure, so we don't think it's a matter of etiquette."
1991.91-543,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,921.784,928.369,Is that so that the states can be held accountable to their own political constituencies for the results they reach?
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,928.369,929.207,--Absolutely.
1991.91-543,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,929.207,951.113,"Do you think that the state would be any less clear in the responsibility it had to its constituencies if the Federal Government had enacted the statute such as Justice O'Connor proposed earlier, that no nuclear, no nuclear waste could be shipped out of a state unless all of these conditions are met?"
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,962.86,981.543,"We think that, for one thing it is the question of... waste can be stored as opposed to disposed of on a short-term basis, short-term basis meaning quite a few years."
1991.91-543,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1069.13,1082.671,I suppose my problem is that it does seem to me that if the Federal Government just sat down for a bit with a pencil and paper it could devise some sort of constitutional scheme to accomplish precisely this result.
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1092.096,1098.749,"Well, Justice Kennedy, we think the Government could also probably find an appropriate means of doing it."
1991.91-543,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1103.754,1115.312,"Well, Mr. Schiff, I suppose there's a difference between offering incentives to the states to make their own choices and simply mandating that those choices be made."
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1116.401,1117.923,That's precisely our position.
1991.91-543,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1117.923,1127.52,"Now, I suppose that finding a location for radioactive waste is a little like trying to find a location for a prison."
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1139.627,1143.589,"Well, as a matter of fact, Your Honor, no, it's not totally correct."
1991.91-543,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1144.55,1146.001,By and large--
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1146.001,1154.939,"--It may be like finding a prison, except that I know our experience in New York is that there are some areas that want prisons because of the income that it--"
1991.91-543,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1154.939,1171.188,"--Well, those are pretty few and far between, and I suppose it's not very attractive to Congress to have to make that choice, and this is a rather clever way of shifting responsibility for making the choice to the states, which is politically very unattractive, I would think."
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1171.188,1186.169,"--Well, we agree with that position, and what's happened here is that the Congress has made the directive and all the burdens, all the accountability is shifted to the state which doesn't have the right to decide whether to do it or not."
1991.91-543,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1186.169,1194.684,"Certainly it's the State of New York deciding in this case and not Allegany and Cortland Counties deciding, I guess."
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1196.006,1200.357,"Well, I think the basic decision is that of the state."
1991.91-543,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1201.719,1205.16,There's no Tenth Amendment that protects the counties from the state.
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1205.16,1207.263,"--Not in this case, no."
1991.91-543,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1220.25,1231.66,"Would it have made any difference to you if the Congress had said and by the way, we'll pay half the cost, that this law, that will be foisted onto the State of New York?"
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1231.66,1238.052,"Well, if it's only, if it's foisted on, Justice White, it wouldn't make any difference."
1991.91-543,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1245.908,1251.091,"No, they're ordering you to do it and they're saying... what if they say we'll pay the entire cost?"
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1251.091,1258.217,--I think our position is that as long as they mandate it without giving the legislature--
1991.91-543,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1258.217,1263.69,"So you don't think this is just, this is just a budget problem for New York?"
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1263.69,1264.159,"--No, I don't think so."
1991.91-543,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1306.537,1315.346,"Mr. Schiff, is the State obliged to regulate under this law?"
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1320.969,1322.341,No.
1991.91-543,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1369.081,1372.003,"But you don't challenge it on any ground other than the Tenth Amendment, do you?"
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1372.003,1373.755,"Well, the Tenth Amendment, the Guaranty Clause."
1991.91-543,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1391.896,1404.535,Do you think Congress can pass a law that's generally applicable around the country that says if you're going to operate a waste disposal facility you have to do it in the way we prescribe?
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1404.535,1406.728,I think it can do that.
1991.91-543,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1418.433,1422.746,May I just ask a small question about your argument directed at the take title provision?
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1435.295,1439.597,"Well, it's really all three in combination."
1991.91-543,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1439.597,1441.73,So it wouldn't really matter to you if you didn't have to take title?
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1441.73,1453.127,"I think the worst part of it is really being responsible, being liable for anything that may happen if we don't take it."
1991.91-543,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1478.434,1482.257,But isn't there a way you can avoid that liability?
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1482.257,1485.62,"I have no idea how we... well, yes, that's why we're here in Court."
1991.91-543,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1488.452,1492.145,"There's no way you can get a, set up a program that would avoid your taking--"
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1492.145,1502.14,"Well, I suppose, sure, but, I mean, but that's again telling us we have to do something, then we would have to do the regulatory scheme that Justice Scalia was asking about."
1991.91-543,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1511.617,1516.561,--Taking title you say is the sanction for not regulating as the Government has told you to regulate?
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1516.561,1524.685,"That's right, but it's a form of regulating because once we have it eventually we would have to do something with it."
1991.91-543,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1537.573,1540.117,"Well, Mr. Schiff, it's a pretty clever scheme."
1991.91-543,0,38303,peter_h_schiff,,1546.291,1548.863,"Well, that was a question that we had thought about."
1991.91-543,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1586.606,1588.267,"Very well, Mr. Schiff."
1991.91-543,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1589.889,1595.382,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1692.625,1709.549,"Mr. Wallace, that dilemma that the three states that had waste disposal facilities, that they confronted of either shutting them down so that even they couldn't use them for their own in-state waste or else having to accept waste from everywhere, Congress could have solved that problem under the Commerce Clause, I presume, couldn't it?"
1991.91-543,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1720.404,1723.837,--We believe Congress did solve the problem under the Commerce Clause.
1991.91-543,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1752.468,1754.007,"That had 47 votes going in, I'm sure."
1991.91-543,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1776.353,1801.881,"Well, it is giving the state a choice of options because the states came to Congress and proposed that Congress solve this problem by retaining authority in the states to provide for the handling of the low-level nuclear waste."
1991.91-543,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1801.881,1804.592,"No, but it says the state shall take title."
1991.91-543,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1804.592,1832.991,"That is only if the state doesn't exercise any of the other options available to it, some of which involve minimal state undertaking, such as contracting with an existing disposal site in one of the compacts, or authorizing a private contractor to develop a site within the state."
1991.91-543,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1832.991,1837.996,But can we begin by saying that there is no direct precedent for an enactment of this kind?
1991.91-543,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1837.996,1841.358,I think that is true.
1991.91-543,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1885.426,1899.596,Could the Federal Government command that the states take title to all illegal handguns within their borders and be responsible for the damages caused by failing to take title and possession?
1991.91-543,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1899.596,1907.249,I can't answer that question definitively.
1991.91-543,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1911.484,1913.524,"Generically it's the same kind of statute, isn't it?"
1991.91-543,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1913.524,1936.649,"The take title provision, which we don't believe is even ripe for decision today in the setting of this case, it may never apply to New York, it can't take effect until 1996, is only one option down the road if New York doesn't undertake any of the other options that are available here."
1991.91-543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1970.852,1976.327,It's rather like saying that 30 years in prison is one of your options for embezzlement.
1991.91-543,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1991.39,1993.573,Perhaps.
1991.91-543,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2286.096,2301.898,"Mr. Wallace, if we disagree with you on whether the take title provision is valid and if we disagree with you and think it is indeed ripe for decision, do you think it's severable from the balance of the act?"
1991.91-543,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2301.898,2323.112,"We do indeed, for the reasons I stated a few moments ago, that otherwise the 1980 act, which Congress and the National Governors' Association all had found unsatisfactory, would be resurrected to replace the improvements that were enacted in the '85 act."
1991.91-543,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2464.934,2471.759,By deal breaker you mean the enactment would not have succeeded if they had not used this particular device?
1991.91-543,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2471.759,2474.802,"Well, what--"
1991.91-543,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2474.802,2478.875,"Because if that's the import of your question, then this case does have great significance, doesn't it?"
1991.91-543,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2478.875,2505.143,"--Well, what I am suggesting is that what was acceptable to the parties who over a period of years negotiated a compromise between the sited and the unsited states and what... is not always apparent in hindsight to someone who didn't participate in those negotiations."
1991.91-543,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2522.386,2522.536,It's like the poor.
1991.91-543,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2524.118,2548.004,"Well, it's very different from the state discrimination against interstate commerce cases, where somebody who is not a vigorous participant in the state's political processes is affected by what the state has done in a way that discriminates against interstate commerce."
1991.91-543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2562.643,2574.931,"I think what you're saying, Mr. Wallace, is that we really don't know whether this deal would have been put together without this provision, and therefore if we find it invalid I guess the only fair thing to do is to find the whole statute invalid."
1991.91-543,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2579.043,2581.735,"I'm not saying that it's not, I'm not saying that it's not severable."
1991.91-543,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2583.718,2586.64,"I don't think you can make both arguments then, though."
1991.91-543,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2596.485,2615.417,--The argument I'm making is that this additional disincentive was within the legislative power of Congress to enact because it made a judgment about what would be an appropriate grouping of incentives and disincentives.
1991.91-543,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2668.082,2668.923,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
1991.91-543,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2671.154,2688.297,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.91-543,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2737.629,2749.119,"Isn't what you mean, Mr. Collins, that as a matter of arguments before this Court the states are not all on one side, not that the statute doesn't pit Federal power against state power?"
1991.91-543,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2749.119,2750.308,"--Well, indeed, Your Honor."
1991.91-543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2766.239,2771.021,"That's just, that was just a regrettable consequence of human selfishness."
1991.91-543,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2783.891,2787.143,"That's exactly right, Justice Scalia, and that's why this is a different kind of case."
1991.91-543,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2787.884,2810.869,"I think it is somewhat surprising that the State of Washington and South Carolina and Nevada are arguing that the Federal Government has the right to direct them to enact a law and direct them to take a governmental action without conditioning it the way it's often, the way it's usually done."
1991.91-543,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2810.869,2812.291,"--Well, first, Justice--"
1991.91-543,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2812.291,2813.232,I think that's very surprising.
1991.91-543,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2813.232,2814.932,"--Well, I don't think it's surprising at all."
1991.91-543,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2869.607,2876.473,"Well, Mr. Collins, I just don't see any way to draw the line that you would have us draw on behalf of those three states."
1991.91-543,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2907.364,2907.814,No.
1991.91-543,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2909.284,2915.859,"Well then how do you justify it here, because it's a principle we have to deal with, not some individual scheme?"
1991.91-543,2,44202,william_b_collins,,2915.859,2917.319,--That's right.
1991.91-543,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2995.242,3006.991,"Well, and I suppose everyone would agree that we need to solve the problem of medical care of the indigent and we need to solve crime and we need to solve prison space, and so forth and so on."
1991.91-543,2,44202,william_b_collins,,3006.991,3009.602,"But it's a unique concern of the Federal Government, Justice O'Connor."
1991.91-543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3059.153,3077.487,"Isn't there a fundamental difference between this case and Garcia in that when this statute says each state shall be responsible for providing for the disposal of waste, it doesn't limit it to waste generated by the state itself."
1991.91-543,2,44202,william_b_collins,,3090.656,3092.937,"It's directing the state to take responsibility, Justice Scalia."
1991.91-543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3092.937,3100.701,"Well, you can put it that way if you like, but it can't take responsibility for somebody else's waste without exercising its sovereign powers."
1991.91-543,2,44202,william_b_collins,,3102.133,3103.283,That's what I'm saying.
1991.91-543,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3106.064,3108.927,"I'm saying it's worse than Garcia in that respect, not better."
1991.91-543,2,44202,william_b_collins,,3108.927,3116.072,"The states are not, are given maximum amount of flexibility to decide how to do this."
1991.91-543,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3221.905,3224.477,"Thank you, Mr. Collins."
1991.91-543,3,38303,peter_h_schiff,,3226.928,3230.33,"I have nothing further absent questions from the Court, Your Honor."
1991.91-543,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3230.33,3231.862,Very well.
