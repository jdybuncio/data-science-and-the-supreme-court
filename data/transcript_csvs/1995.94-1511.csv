1995.94-1511,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.654,"We'll hear argument next in Number 94-1511, Samuel A. Lewis v. Fletcher Casey."
1995.94-1511,0,26300,grant_woods,,9.839,13.974,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1511,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,94.121,104.162,"Mr. Woods, what are the findings of the district court that would support a system-wide violation of Bounds?"
1995.94-1511,0,26300,grant_woods,,112.767,116.469,"We believe there is not, Justice O'Connor."
1995.94-1511,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,136.3,144.823,"Well, you take the position that Bounds was an either-or situation, that the State can provide a library or assistance?"
1995.94-1511,0,26300,grant_woods,,144.823,145.873,--Yes.
1995.94-1511,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,145.873,148.44,"Well, Bounds said that in so many words, didn't it?"
1995.94-1511,0,26300,grant_woods,,148.44,148.74,Yes.
1995.94-1511,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,158.213,175.775,"Well, if you do that, I certainly think there is some indication that a prisoner who cannot read or who does not speak English might not have meaningful access to a library even if it were there, and you want us to take the position that there's no requirement to provide any assistance at all."
1995.94-1511,0,26300,grant_woods,,175.775,177.877,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1995.94-1511,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,182.346,208.813,"You take the position that, if a prisoner is illiterate or is illiterate in English, that that... that the requirements therefore are still satisfied so long as there is, in fact, a library in existence to which the prisoner could resort if he were able to read it, or a legal helper to whom he could turn if he were able to communicate?"
1995.94-1511,0,26300,grant_woods,,208.813,210.681,--That's correct.
1995.94-1511,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,219.537,220.104,Well--
1995.94-1511,0,26300,grant_woods,,222.089,226.858,The obligation is really not an affirmative duty.
1995.94-1511,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,237.082,237.632,Well--
1995.94-1511,0,26300,grant_woods,,259.947,261.514,Justice Souter--
1995.94-1511,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,261.514,262.983,Why isn't it senseless?
1995.94-1511,0,26300,grant_woods,,262.983,264.166,--This is wy we believe it's not.
1995.94-1511,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,293.585,305.477,"Well, suppose we don't agree with you on the meaning of Bounds, because there certainly is language in it that speaks in terms of meaningful access, do you have a fallback position?"
1995.94-1511,0,26300,grant_woods,,305.477,311.047,"Yes, we do, Justice O'Connor, and the fallback position is that Arizona goes above and beyond the requirements of Bounds."
1995.94-1511,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,320.319,325.306,"Well, do you want us to find that the district court findings were erroneous?"
1995.94-1511,0,26300,grant_woods,,335.079,344.435,"--We're asking you to reverse the findings of the district court, because Arizona has met the requirements set forth in Bounds."
1995.94-1511,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,348.922,356.992,"So you don't make an argument, then, today, that the injunction exceeded the scope of the district court's authority?"
1995.94-1511,0,26300,grant_woods,,359.211,360.563,"--Yes, we are making that argument."
1995.94-1511,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,417.4,433.743,"General Woods, was there a point... ever a point, after finding constitutional violation, at which the State was asked to come up with a plan to cure the violation, or was this directly referred to a special master?"
1995.94-1511,0,26300,grant_woods,,433.743,449.954,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, what the district court did was, we had a prior ruling from him in the Gluth case which was just applicable to one prison unit and, again, micromanaged the entire unit much as this order does."
1995.94-1511,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,462.845,473.153,"But before that, isn't it usual in these situations to give the State the first opportunity to present a remedial plan?"
1995.94-1511,0,26300,grant_woods,,473.153,484.192,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and that's exactly what Bounds requires, is that... that you will give deference to the States, and the States will be allowed to formulate their own plans."
1995.94-1511,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,484.192,489.762,Did you ask at any point to be permitted to do that before you encountered the special master?
1995.94-1511,0,26300,grant_woods,,489.762,495.666,"We anticipated that that would be how... the answer is yes, but we were not allowed to do so."
1995.94-1511,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,521.246,522.899,"Mr. Woods, Attorney General Woods--"
1995.94-1511,0,26300,grant_woods,,522.899,523.883,"--Yes, sir."
1995.94-1511,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,523.883,535.541,"--did you give consideration, or have any of the people who have written in this field in the scholarly community given any consideration to whether or not the library requirement makes sense at all?"
1995.94-1511,0,26300,grant_woods,,548.099,572.832,"I think we've... we've considered that, and I think these things will change with the advent of computers and technology changing, where the old style law library may some day be a thing of the past, but what the Bounds court told us was that we could choose between a law library or... and I believe the disjunctive was used something like 10 times in the decision... or some other form of legal assistance."
1995.94-1511,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,575.701,581.153,"Well, I'm asking whether or not other forms of legal assistance were considered by you."
1995.94-1511,0,26300,grant_woods,,609.005,617.611,"--I don't know specifically if anyone has been bold enough to do that, Your Honor, in the face of the Bounds decision."
1995.94-1511,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,624.499,625.465,"Well, it says other forms--"
1995.94-1511,0,26300,grant_woods,,625.465,625.967,--Yes.
1995.94-1511,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,625.967,626.551,--of legal assistance.
1995.94-1511,0,26300,grant_woods,,626.551,636.589,"But I think we would be... I'm supposing that the States would be hesitant to come up with too minimal of a plan for fear that it wouldn't meet the standards, and also--"
1995.94-1511,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,636.589,639.191,Have there been any studies on the effectiveness of prison libraries?
1995.94-1511,0,26300,grant_woods,,639.191,649.166,"--Well, there have been... there have been commentators who have commentated upon it, but I don't know that that's particularly persuasive."
1995.94-1511,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,663.807,672.513,"General Woods, isn't it the case that in Bounds the district judge would have preferred some other form of legal assistance?"
1995.94-1511,0,26300,grant_woods,,691.243,708.186,"--I believe that's correct, Justice Ginsburg, and this Court, as... following the direction that it has given ever since then, deferred to the State administrators, which is only reasonable given the very difficult nature of prison administration, and also--"
1995.94-1511,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,708.186,710.355,"So it's the State that made this choice, isn't it, the States?"
1995.94-1511,0,26300,grant_woods,,710.355,711.99,--That's correct.
1995.94-1511,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,711.99,717.06,"It was not something that this Court, and surely not the district court in Bounds, dictated."
1995.94-1511,0,26300,grant_woods,,724.361,742.692,"Yes, we have, and Justice Kennedy, let me make it clear why we believe it is adequate, and why this 18-year period of the States complying with Bounds mainly with law libraries is sufficient, and it's because we put people on equal footing as to the people who have not committed crimes and who are not in prison."
1995.94-1511,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,775.163,778.448,"Well then you're not taking the position that it's irrelevant that they're illiterate, then."
1995.94-1511,0,26300,grant_woods,,783.567,785.102,"What we can do, Justice--"
1995.94-1511,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,785.102,786.036,"Well, isn't that correct?"
1995.94-1511,0,26300,grant_woods,,792.556,794.475,--It's not formalistic in this sense.
1995.94-1511,1,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,1587.823,1593.208,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.94-1511,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1677.063,1678.063,I thought that--
1995.94-1511,1,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,1691.556,1692.44,But--
1995.94-1511,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1692.44,1692.99,Is that inaccurate?
1995.94-1511,1,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,1692.99,1695.442,--They never asked for anything else.
1995.94-1511,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1695.442,1701.246,"It's too late to ask for that when the judge summons you up and says, tell me why this order shouldn't be applied State-wide."
1995.94-1511,1,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,1701.246,1709.185,"No, Your Honor, I don't think that's so, because they had five opportunities to say anything in this order is not correct, and any--"
1995.94-1511,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1709.185,1716.439,"They had five opportunities, but were they ever given the opportunity to propose, to draft and propose their own order?"
1995.94-1511,1,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,1718.54,1721.075,"--Not in that form, but I don't think--"
1995.94-1511,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1721.075,1725.211,"Well, that's... what form did it give them, the right to comment on its proposal?"
1995.94-1511,1,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,1725.211,1728.896,"--Yes, but that did not limit in any manner--"
1995.94-1511,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1728.896,1732.967,"Ms. Alexander, is that common in these institutional decrees?"
1995.94-1511,1,21786,elizabeth_alexander,,1754.881,1758.016,"--Justice O'Connor, that is a common--"
1995.94-1511,2,26300,grant_woods,,3298.381,3300.564,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1995.94-1511,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3311.271,3321.496,"I count 30... 29 in those footnotes, I mean, I don't know what you mean by actual injury, but he listed 29 instances in which there were delays that he thought were significant or--"
1995.94-1511,2,26300,grant_woods,,3321.496,3324.881,"This is the question, Justice Breyer."
1995.94-1511,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3422.677,3422.993,"Thank you, General Woods."
1995.94-1511,2,26300,grant_woods,,3422.993,3423.46,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1995.94-1511,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3423.46,3424.643,The case is submitted.
