1984.84-262,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.789,We will hear arguments next in Mountain States Telephone Company against Pueblo.
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,85.02,93.459,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-262,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,250.526,253.978,"Ms. Krause, am I correct, however, no answer was ever filed in that suit?"
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,253.978,256.93,"You are right, Justice Blackmun, there was no answer filed."
1984.84-262,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,265.084,268.619,"Before you leave your earlier suit, may I just ask this question about it?"
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,276.558,280.443,"I am sorry, Justice Stevens--"
1984.84-262,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,280.443,291.917,"In other words, you claim that was an adjudication that Mountain Bell had previously acquired the right-of-way or that it was an adjudication that the conveyance that was approved by the Secretary of Interior was a valid conveyance?"
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,295.119,296.152,--That is right.
1984.84-262,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,296.152,297.185,What is it that you say they decided?
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,297.185,307.177,I think the order was a final judgment on the merits to the effect that Mountain Bell had good title to its right-of-way.
1984.84-262,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,324.888,332.792,Then you are saying that that adjudication was to the effect that Mountain Bell had good titles before the lawsuit was filed?
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,332.792,338.296,"Well, the order is dated, I think, May 31, 1928."
1984.84-262,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,338.296,338.812,"I understand that, but--"
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,338.812,343.1,And it does not address whether it is speaking about before or after.
1984.84-262,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,343.1,344.433,--I understand that.
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,349.104,362.929,I think the court adjudicated the fact that Mountain Bell had good title as of that date for certain and did not actually address whether it had it before or not.
1984.84-262,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,373.885,377.32,I am still not sure I understand your position.
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,392.881,393.798,Okay.
1984.84-262,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,395.031,399.702,I know you say that it means as of the date of the entry of the order they owned the property.
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,404.589,412.426,I think the judgment rests on the fact that we had secured a valid right-of-way from Pueblo of Santa Ana that was approved by the Secretary.
1984.84-262,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,416.747,419.016,"Well, let me try and rephrase it."
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,423.8,424.318,Right.
1984.84-262,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,424.318,428.121,One was that you got it back in 1905 or whatever the date of your original position.
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,428.121,428.571,Right.
1984.84-262,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,428.571,433.173,The second theory was that after the lawsuit was filed the Secretary approved the conveyance to you.
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,437.958,444.112,I think the theory that we had acquired the right-of-way as of 1928 supports the order.
1984.84-262,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,447.749,456.854,"So you are saying that this was an adjudication not of any issue tendered by the complaint, rather of the validity of the post-complaint conveyance?"
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,456.854,458.238,--Well--
1984.84-262,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,458.238,460.223,That is what I understand you to be saying.
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,460.223,469.329,--I think that the principles of res judicata support that it bars something that could have been litigated as well as those things that were litigated.
1984.84-262,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,494.73,497.246,Thank you.
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,497.246,517.159,"The Pueblo in 1980 reputed its right-of-way grant to Mountain Bell arguing that the second clause of Section 17 did not authorize it to grant a conveyance to Mountain Bell, and that, in fact, that statute prohibited any such conduct on their part."
1984.84-262,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,602.999,610.355,"Judge Breitenstein thought the statute was clear as a bell, clear as Mountain Bell."
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,610.355,611.538,Clear as Mountain Bell.
1984.84-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,679.849,690.821,"Ms. Krause, I guess your interpretation really makes Section 16 of the Act superfluous, doesn't it?"
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,690.821,692.24,"Not at all, Your Honor."
1984.84-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,708.682,716.372,"Well, then I suppose if 17 means what you say it means, then Section 16 was not needed--"
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,716.372,717.372,--Well--
1984.84-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,717.372,729.013,"--because the Pueblo, with the consent of the Secretary, could have disposed of lands that otherwise would have been disposed of under Section 16 possibly."
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,729.013,741.57,"--That is possible, but Section 16 has responsibilities that are imposed on the Secretary of the Interior that are not imposed on him under Section 17."
1984.84-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,773.625,774.225,"Well, wait."
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,788.301,810.548,"--Well, they couldn't have used Section 17 if they wanted the Secretary to make distinctions between the claimant who bought the property and the claimant who lost the property and they couldn't have used Section 17 if they wanted the Secretary to credit when it was the claimant who bought the property and to disburse funds for improvements when it was the claimant who didn't purchase it."
1984.84-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,810.548,812.85,Do you know whether Section 16 was ever used?
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,812.85,816.386,I do not know if it was used.
1984.84-262,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,910.763,912.615,"The agency changed its mind, didn't it?"
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,912.615,919.536,"Well, it depends on if you are talking about in-court documents or out-of-the record documents."
1984.84-262,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1013.081,1016.683,Do you see eye to eye with the United States amicus brief?
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,1016.683,1022.02,Not on the res judicata issue we don't see eye to eye.
1984.84-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1025.305,1027.657,The construction of the statute?
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,1027.657,1029.692,--The construction of Section 17.
1984.84-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1030.209,1036.18,"So, you think Section 17 is limited to just conveyances of right-of-way?"
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,1036.18,1042.417,--I think the United States indicates that this Court could limit its decision if it so chose.
1984.84-262,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1042.417,1043.45,Was that your position?
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,1043.45,1050.023,This Court... Mountain Bell's position would be that it could.
1984.84-262,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1064.097,1067.632,That is my difficulty as to where one draws the line.
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,1077.238,1088.045,"Well, I think the justification is we reached the Tenth Circuit and, indeed, reached this Court was because that is what the record was based on and that is what the administrative practice basically involved."
1984.84-262,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1210.407,1215.895,"Ms. Krause, can I go back for a second before I lose the thought to the question of limiting the case to rights-of-way."
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,1229.405,1240.777,The deposition that was before the Tenth Circuit makes reference to the fact that there was one out-right conveyance but it goes into no detail and I have no knowledge about the surrounding circumstances from the record.
1984.84-262,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1240.777,1241.379,I see.
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,1248.966,1257.155,I think the United States would like the administrative practice and the decision of this Court to be limited.
1984.84-262,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1285.742,1286.592,It isn't really what we want to hold.
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,1292.579,1293.246,I would agree.
1984.84-262,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1516.556,1523.544,"Yes, but the section does speak of transfers in any other manner, doesn't it?"
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,1523.544,1531.9,"It doesn't speak of transfers in any other manner, it says or in any other manner, no right, title, or interest or in any other manner."
1984.84-262,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1533.983,1538.054,Doesn't that suggest something other than just involuntary transfer?
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,1538.054,1545.791,--It suggests something broader than involuntary alienations under laws of the State of New Mexico.
1984.84-262,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1569.406,1574.31,And where do you get the source of that interpretation?
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,1574.31,1590.07,"--Well, it is the interpretation of the Department and it is also an interpretation that arises out of a generally well-recognized statutory construction canon and that is that a general phrase is limited--"
1984.84-262,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1590.07,1590.486,Used in generous.
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,1590.486,1590.953,--Right.
1984.84-262,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1608.448,1627.759,"While I have you interpreted, I think you may have already answered this in response to Justice O'Connor, but giving 17 the interpretation that permits voluntary sale on the Secretary's approval, what point is under Section 16?"
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,1627.759,1638.051,"Under Section 16, Justice Brennan, the Secretary of the Interior has some very clearly stated administrative responsibilities with money."
1984.84-262,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1685.282,1690.834,Is that to say that 16 has nothing to do with the form that the conveyances should take?
1984.84-262,0,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,1690.834,1700.207,"--It does not address what type of form they should and the Secretary is the seller under Section 16, not the Pueblo."
1984.84-262,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1725.757,1732.577,Mr. Borg?
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,1732.577,1736.195,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.84-262,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1782.141,1790.097,But ever since 1924 have most or all of these been transfers only with the consent of the Secretary?
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,1790.097,1791.114,Yes.
1984.84-262,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1794.9,1795.967,That is all?
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,1795.967,1798.685,"Yes, but not with the consent of Congress."
1984.84-262,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1798.685,1804.356,Any suggestion that there be consent of Congress before this date?
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,1804.356,1813.695,Congress... The idea is that Congress under the Non-Intercourse Act must authorize conveyances of Indian land.
1984.84-262,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1874.483,1876.685,"Mr. Borg, you say the Secretary has never been given this authority."
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,1882.339,1889.259,Section 16 does give congressional approval for a carefully limited kind of transaction.
1984.84-262,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1889.259,1893.461,"I mean that is a carte blanche congressional approval, not as to each particular Act or anything like that."
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,1893.461,1893.897,No.
1984.84-262,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1918.178,1922.063,If it is consent conditioned on the approval of the leaders of the tribe and also--
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,1922.063,1922.663,Right.
1984.84-262,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1922.663,1926.248,--the Secretary are the same condition in Section 17.
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,1926.248,1940.424,"No, those are not the same conditions because... not precisely the same conditions because Section 17 does not impose any requirement that the transaction be judged in the best interest of the Indians as does Section 16."
1984.84-262,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1953.748,1963.187,"The difference is, I suppose, that in Section 16 you are dealing with conveyances conceivably of an individual member of the Pueblo who might not want himself to dispose of his land."
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,1963.187,1963.956,No.
1984.84-262,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1975.094,1977.98,Why does the statute then refer to any Pueblo Indian living in a community?
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,1982.084,1994.225,"--It seems to contemplate such ownership in the future and I would bring to the Court's attention that Mountain Bell does not do anything to explain that particular clause, the second clause of Section 17."
1984.84-262,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2040.254,2042.789,--But those two kinds of authorizations are quite different.
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,2062.619,2063.669,Indeed.
1984.84-262,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2316.735,2326.424,"If you have mentioned the deference that the Court sought to give to the Secretary of the Interior, I have missed that."
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,2332.161,2336.38,We believe that reliance is not called for at all to the administrative interpretation.
1984.84-262,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2346.837,2355.443,"What I am addressing or referring to is the Secretary's attitude toward that language for many, many years."
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,2355.443,2364.716,--The Secretary's attitude toward that language was not the kind of attitude that this Court traditionally gives deference.
1984.84-262,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2383.027,2385.043,But the Secretary did give approval to the--
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,2385.043,2392.049,The Secretary did give approval but I would remind you that the approvals were given to very irregular conveyances.
1984.84-262,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2393.299,2399.869,"--Nevertheless, the Secretary apparently thought he was acting in accordance with the law."
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,2399.869,2402.321,--It is not clear.
1984.84-262,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2405.207,2409.392,Do you think it is clear that the Secretary acted contrary to what he thought the law was?
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,2409.392,2414.628,"No, I would not say that the Secretary knew how he was acting."
1984.84-262,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2423.651,2425.501,"That is the action of the Secretary, isn't it?"
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,2425.501,2427.12,"--Well, this interpretation... I suppose it is."
1984.84-262,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2442.63,2448.767,You don't think any congressional committees knew how the Secretary was applying this statute?
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,2448.767,2455.289,--We do not believe that it was brought to the attention of a single congressional committee in any kind of direct fashion.
1984.84-262,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2470.965,2475.101,"Mr. Borg, really, how important is this case?"
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,2475.101,2479.321,"This case is very important, Your Honor."
1984.84-262,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2479.321,2481.638,What hangs on our decision here?
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,2481.638,2491.546,What hangs on your decision here is whether the Pueblo Indians are going to be found by this Court to have been placed in a completely different status than any other Indian tribe in this country.
1984.84-262,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2491.546,2498.966,"That philosophically sounds very broad, but how much is involved really, just a few easements?"
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,2498.966,2503.37,"In practical terms, not very much, just a few easements."
1984.84-262,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2524.784,2540.543,"Well, I am just wondering, what justifies what must be substantial expense in getting this case up here if all we are talking about are nominal damages and a few rights-of-way to provide as easements, go back in the 30's really."
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,2540.543,2541.126,Right.
1984.84-262,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2542.859,2544.578,Is this a lawyer's lawsuit?
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,2544.578,2547.863,"--No, this lawsuit was brought to us by our clients."
1984.84-262,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2555.1,2560.604,"Is there anything else behind this, anything by way of water rights or other things that are more substantial?"
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,2560.604,2562.956,"Yes, there are considerations--"
1984.84-262,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2562.956,2565.575,That is what I am trying to get out and I don't get it from you.
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,2565.575,2569.709,"--Well, the effect on water rights is an indirect one."
1984.84-262,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2616.757,2619.142,"Of course, sometimes people don't want federal protection."
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,2619.142,2622.327,"Indians, Your Honor, do want federal protection."
1984.84-262,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2670.492,2673.777,Let me ask one factual question before you move on.
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,2679.414,2681.616,--Yes.
1984.84-262,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2689.37,2689.637,"--Oh, were there?"
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,2689.637,2695.274,"And, 55 of those were within a six-year period from 1926 to about 1932."
1984.84-262,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2792.854,2795.472,I thought it was drafted by the lawyer for the Pueblo.
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,2799.174,2803.21,--Section 17 was drafted by Francis Wilson.
1984.84-262,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2826.576,2827.527,Maybe I misspoke.
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,2834.847,2849.774,"Francis Wilson was trying to represent the interest of a lobbying group on behalf of the Indians, generally a fairly wealthy group of persons in the early 1920's in New Mexico and in New York who wanted to preserve Pueblo culture and Pueblo arts and crafts."
1984.84-262,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2873.822,2889.166,"You know, one thing that I guess that has run through my mind a couple of times when you mentioned the importance of the case to the Pueblo, because it treats them differently than other Indian tribes, in a way it treats them with a higher degree of respect if it gives them greater autonomy in their right to dispose of their land."
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,2889.166,2902.491,"On the surface that might be true, but in actuality the Pueblos and Indian tribes generally do not exercise very much independent judgment in these kind of affairs."
1984.84-262,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2945.402,2955.96,"In the Kerr-McGee case that is going to be argued to us next week, the government... the Indian tribes take the position that the last thing the tribes should want is Secretarial approval."
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,2966.166,2968.934,Some people might agree.
1984.84-262,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3016.949,3024.62,The Indians don't want their own governing bodies to be able to convey land without the approval of the Secretary of the Interior?
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,3024.62,3026.703,Or without the authorization of Congress.
1984.84-262,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3032.274,3052.103,"Mr. Borg, have the Indians, the Pueblos ever asked Congress to amend Section 17 to clarify the section in all these years where the Secretary of Interior had a different interpretation?"
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,3052.103,3052.887,No.
1984.84-262,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3065.328,3068.297,"So, no suggestion has ever been made to Congress on that?"
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,3068.297,3068.597,No.
1984.84-262,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3082.123,3087.026,Has Section 16 ever been utilized t your knowledge?
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,3087.026,3090.228,"Section 16 was utilized, but Sectio 17, as you--"
1984.84-262,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3090.228,3090.778,How often?
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,3090.778,3094.48,--I have no idea of just how frequently.
1984.84-262,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3179.234,3181.002,It is something the Indians wanted.
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,3181.002,3183.621,The transaction?
1984.84-262,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3183.621,3186.59,You say that is what the Indians wanted Section 17.
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,3186.59,3189.442,The Indians wanted Section 17 because--
1984.84-262,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3189.442,3192.227,Was it the Indians or the Indians lawyers?
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,3192.227,3194.595,--That wanted Section 17?
1984.84-262,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3194.595,3195.078,Yes.
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,3195.078,3200.082,Section 17 was drafted by a representative for a pro Indian organization.
1984.84-262,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3200.082,3202.415,"Representative of the Indians, not the Indians."
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,3202.415,3203.051,No.
1984.84-262,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3209.021,3212.907,Do you mean the Indians don't want to operate their own property.
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,3212.907,3216.442,"--No, the Indians do not want to operate their own property."
1984.84-262,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3219.377,3220.411,They just want a little bit of say.
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,3220.411,3221.679,That is right.
1984.84-262,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3226.048,3232.185,"Will you name me the Indian tribe that said that, the tribe that said that?"
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,3232.185,3232.637,Sure.
1984.84-262,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3234.187,3237.438,You are speaking for your tribe now.
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,3237.438,3238.624,"No, I am not a member of the tribe."
1984.84-262,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3238.624,3239.524,I know you are not.
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,3243.092,3243.759,That is right.
1984.84-262,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3243.759,3249.913,"And, you, speaking for the tribe, say the tribe... It is ashame we don't know what the tribe says."
1984.84-262,1,41054,scott_e_borg,,3249.913,3252.432,"Well, we have a couple of tribal members here today."
1984.84-262,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3483.384,3486.502,"Do you have anything further, Ms. Krause?"
1984.84-262,2,33875,kathryn_marie_krause,,3489.704,3490.287,Thank you.
1984.84-262,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3630.361,3630.361,"Thank you, counsel, the case is submitted."
