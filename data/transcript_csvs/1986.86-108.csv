1986.86-108,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,71.262,"Mr. Holl, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,71.262,86.039,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--
1986.86-108,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,173.045,175.58,You mean the Carter court did not explicitly reject--
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,175.58,176.314,Yes.
1986.86-108,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,176.314,178.366,--likelihood of success on appeal?
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,178.366,179.199,That's correct.
1986.86-108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,309.584,312.119,"You're here arguing for the state, I take it."
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,312.119,313.686,"That's correct, Justice White."
1986.86-108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,313.686,321.724,And you want to... you've convicted a person and you don't want him at large until there is some final ruling on the habeas corpus.
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,321.724,323.041,"Yes, that's correct, Justice White."
1986.86-108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,323.041,332.847,Does New Jersey have a post-conviction relief operation?
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,332.847,333.347,"Yes, we do."
1986.86-108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,333.347,347.072,"Well, let's suppose that a convicted defendant files for state habeas or state collateral relief, and he wins in the lower court and then he's on appeal in the state system."
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,356.095,359.38,"No, I don't believe that is the state of the law in New Jersey."
1986.86-108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,363.332,367.051,So you think... wasn't there an amicus who claimed that that's the rule?
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,367.051,376.509,"I believe that... I'm not sure there was an amicus that claimed that that was the rule in this case, Justice White."
1986.86-108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,387.983,390.183,"Oh, it does specifically?"
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,390.183,391.435,"Yes, it does specifically."
1986.86-108,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,391.435,394.553,That's bail pending appeal of a direct conviction?
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,394.553,395.07,Yes.
1986.86-108,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,399.089,399.539,Collateral.
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,399.539,400.441,--a collateral proceeding.
1986.86-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,407.878,418.669,"Well, why shouldn't we really know that for a certainty before we decide what the rule that the federal court should apply in this case?"
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,438.916,441.201,"Well, I think that there is a reason here."
1986.86-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,450.474,450.874,"No, no."
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,480.576,494.703,"I don't think you have to know to decide this case, because I think that would frustrate a federal interest in the uniform application of the habeas rule, and it would permit perhaps a state to come up with a rule--"
1986.86-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,494.703,496.503,"He hasn't been convicted of a federal crime, right?"
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,497.955,499.871,--That's correct.
1986.86-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,499.871,507.56,"So the only reason he should be held in prison at all is a state reason, it seems to me."
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,507.56,525.022,"Well, I think that the law of New Jersey is rather clear, first of all, that he would... that a court would be permitted to keep him incarcerated pending his state habeas proceeding pursuant to that rule."
1986.86-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,556.326,562.563,"On the other hand, if you take the position that it depends on federal law you're not going to have... it's sort of an Erie question."
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,580.942,597.57,I think the answer is that in this case and in all cases the state courts will have considered the same claims that are being raised on habeas and will already have made the decision that the individual involved is dangerous and should be incarcerated.
1986.86-108,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,601.522,606.157,"Mr. Holl, at least I'm along with Justice Scalia."
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,610.294,610.978,"Sure, Your Honor."
1986.86-108,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,613.663,615.615,"I mean, I would like to know personally."
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,619.067,621.352,"Well, this issue has been researched."
1986.86-108,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,631.641,633.326,I'm talking about the New Jersey law.
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,633.326,634.076,That's correct.
1986.86-108,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,637.695,638.897,Have you researched it?
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,638.897,640.83,"--Yes, we have, Justice Marshall."
1986.86-108,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,640.83,642.765,Where is he now?
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,642.765,647.919,"This man, I don't know, Your Honor, Justice Blackmun, I don't know."
1986.86-108,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,653.371,661.025,"Well, the state did not seek cert in the Carter case, did it?"
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,661.025,665.845,"I don't believe the Carter case is... oh, you mean in the Carter case at issue here?"
1986.86-108,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,669.297,670.63,Do you know why?
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,670.63,675.95,"That case was handled by the Passaic County Prosecutor's Office, which is a separate entity."
1986.86-108,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,679.768,681.52,It was all over the press.
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,683.187,686.089,"Well, that could be the reason why, Justice Marshall."
1986.86-108,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,686.089,702.518,"Mr. Holl, are you suggesting that because of the delicate relationship of the federal habeas procedures to state convictions, there might be a federal interest apart from a state interest in seeing that the man is delivered over if it were reversed on appeal?"
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,702.518,708.005,"I think that there are federal interests here, there's no question about that."
1986.86-108,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,733.739,745.88,"Well, Mr. Holl, do you think that there is some appropriate inquiry in the federal court to try to preserve the status quo pending an appeal?"
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,745.88,747.313,"Yes, I do."
1986.86-108,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,747.313,758.27,"In which the court might consider the likelihood of success on appeal and the fact that the defendant was incarcerated, and so forth?"
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,758.27,761.389,I believe that's a very important interest here.
1986.86-108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,793.611,804.835,"Dangerousness and likelihood of success, and they find this man is very... they think he's very dangerous, but that he's almost sure to win on appeal."
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,807.62,823.98,I think if we have an instance where the state does not have a substantial case on appeal and all we had is a dangerous individual who was being held under an unconstitutional conviction--
1986.86-108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,823.98,825.499,"Well, it hasn't been finally decided."
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,825.499,826.732,--It hasn't been finally decided.
1986.86-108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,826.732,835.188,"But the district court says, somebody says, very good likelihood of success on appeal."
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,835.188,840.258,Likelihood of success on behalf of the prisoner?
1986.86-108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,840.258,841.174,Yes.
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,841.174,849.114,"In that case I think that if the state can't make an issue, a showing that it also has a substantial case--"
1986.86-108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,849.114,850.047,"That's what I mean, yes."
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,850.047,865.207,"--a substantial case on the merits, if we can't make that showing and all we have is a dangerous fellow, I don't think we have been able to... there is a presumption there that he shall be released, and I don't think we've been able to overcome it purely on the grounds of dangerousness."
1986.86-108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,865.207,867.326,So it really turns on the likelihood of success.
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,867.326,871.028,I think likelihood of success is the more significant factor.
1986.86-108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,871.028,873.813,But Carter said you can't consider that at all?
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,873.813,876.098,"No, that's not what Carter said."
1986.86-108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,876.098,876.798,"Oh, it isn't?"
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,876.798,880.399,Carter said that you can't consider dangerousness.
1986.86-108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,884.185,889.822,Has the Court of Appeals said that the only thing you can consider is the likelihood of flight?
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,889.822,891.791,"That is what that... yes, that is correct."
1986.86-108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,891.791,893.393,So that... when did they say that?
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,893.393,896.095,They said that in the decision in Carter.
1986.86-108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,896.095,899.213,"Well, that excludes likelihood of success."
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,899.213,899.713,That's correct.
1986.86-108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,919.524,922.543,"Well, the dangerousness then is a red herring."
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,922.543,923.762,--No.
1986.86-108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,923.762,932.351,"Because if there's a likelihood of success, you're going to... if he's likely to prevail in the appellate court, he's going to get out whether he's dangerous or not."
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,940.374,943.909,We think that it is a weighing process here.
1986.86-108,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,976.647,982.617,"Can I interrupt you for a second and ask you about this particular case, prompted by Justice Blackmun's question."
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,992.056,992.406,--No.
1986.86-108,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,992.406,995.691,"Wasn't the writ, the issuance of the writ affirmed by the Court of Appeals?"
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,995.691,1001.329,"Yes, it was, but then the state made a motion before the Court of Appeals to reconsider."
1986.86-108,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1004.363,1005.43,"Oh, I see."
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1005.43,1010.7,And the prior order which affirmed the district court's decision has been vacated.
1986.86-108,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1013.969,1016.671,Specifically what order are we being asked to review?
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1021.223,1021.573,Yes.
1986.86-108,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1021.573,1027.027,And the reasons for that really are not terribly clear from the order.
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1035.465,1036.133,That's correct.
1986.86-108,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1036.133,1042.618,"So is it not possible that they denied the motion thinking that, since he's going to be at large anyway, that there's no point in granting a stay?"
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1042.618,1051.392,"Well, I don't think that's the reason that they adopted that or they made that decision."
1986.86-108,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1051.392,1058.664,"Could we reverse that now and tell them they must enter a stay at this point, when the man's at large on parole?"
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1058.664,1070.239,"I think that in the courts below there is not a sufficient record, unfortunately, because of the... some factors just simply haven't been considered."
1986.86-108,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1072.758,1078.21,"Well, what relief can you get in this case from this Court now?"
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1078.21,1083.113,I think what we're asking from this Court is a decision on the law that these are--
1986.86-108,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1083.113,1085.731,Totally unrelated to this Petitioner?
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1087.448,1091.652,"--No, because the state went before the district court--"
1986.86-108,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1091.652,1092.002,Right.
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1092.002,1092.569,--and attempted to--
1986.86-108,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1092.569,1093.421,And he didn't give you a stay.
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1093.421,1094.271,--That's right.
1986.86-108,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1094.271,1101.408,"He said... for one thing, he said, he doesn't really look all that dangerous, because you misrepresented his criminal record in the district court."
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1105.745,1111.299,And he also said that he would not take into account the state's chances of success.
1986.86-108,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1111.299,1112.033,He didn't write an opinion.
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1118.037,1119.302,There's a factual--
1986.86-108,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1119.302,1124.856,"So what are we... I mean, what order do you expect this Court to enter now?"
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1124.856,1130.61,--We would ask that the case be remanded all the way back to the district court.
1986.86-108,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1130.61,1132.546,And what should the district court do then?
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1132.546,1138.716,The district court should be instructed to take into account factors such as the Petitioner's--
1986.86-108,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1138.716,1139.266,For what purpose?
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1140.652,1147.889,--The man is at large because he was released under an erroneous standard of law.
1986.86-108,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1147.889,1149.256,I thought he has also been paroled.
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1149.256,1151.274,No.
1986.86-108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1153.46,1155.793,He's been released because of the order of the district court?
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1155.793,1156.412,--Yes.
1986.86-108,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1156.412,1157.895,I misunderstood.
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1162.566,1163.899,"Well, there was a misunderstanding."
1986.86-108,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1181.777,1182.393,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1192.268,1201.024,"--That was a decision, I'm sure there were a number of factors that went into that decision, Justice Blackmun."
1986.86-108,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1213.999,1235.912,"What you're saying, I take it, is in the case where perhaps the state... where the district court orders release on habeas, the state has a plausible case on appeal but not an overwhelming one, there a very dangerous habeas petitioner probably should not be released, one who is not found dangerous probably should be released?"
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1235.912,1236.697,That's correct.
1986.86-108,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1260.812,1265.966,"Well, if he's real dangerous you couldn't keep him more than that six months could you?"
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1265.966,1267.683,"That's correct, that's correct."
1986.86-108,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1267.683,1272.553,"So that's what is before us, six months?"
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1272.553,1277.338,That's correct.
1986.86-108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1277.338,1279.723,I'm reading an amicus brief.
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1292.815,1294.132,"That is correct, Justice White."
1986.86-108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1296.099,1300.553,But you think the rule is different once there's a conviction and there's an appeal?
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1300.553,1301.236,--That's correct.
1986.86-108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1301.236,1302.822,And that there's a specific rule on that?
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1302.822,1303.638,"Yes, there is."
1986.86-108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1303.638,1309.642,And the only issue now that is undecided is about state collateral?
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1309.642,1310.059,That's right.
1986.86-108,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1318.332,1319.115,Thank you.
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1319.115,1337.076,The decision in Carter which estops a federal court from considering these factors does serious damage to comity.
1986.86-108,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1397.831,1400.116,You put yourself in that situation.
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1400.116,1403.485,"Well, we've been put in that situation."
1986.86-108,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1403.485,1406.103,You put yourself in that situation.
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1408.053,1410.222,"Well, we have not put ourselves in that situation."
1986.86-108,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1410.222,1413.174,"Well, you didn't bring the Carter case up here."
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1413.174,1417.91,The Carter case eventually could get here.
1986.86-108,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1430.485,1432.004,You haven't read the newspapers recently?
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1432.004,1432.787,I'm sorry?
1986.86-108,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1432.787,1435.372,You haven't read the newspapers recently?
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1438.408,1445.312,I haven't seen anything in recent days about the Carter case.
1986.86-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1472.728,1474.578,"Well, I don't understand."
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1484.001,1484.836,That's unclear.
1986.86-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1522.875,1525.244,"Only if he can't make bail, I presume."
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1536.469,1542.622,"--The federal court in that case... he remains incarcerated, because the federal court--"
1986.86-108,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1542.622,1543.539,Without bail?
1986.86-108,0,30703,john_g_holl,,1543.539,1549.026,--has not ordered his release.
1986.86-108,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1601.939,1602.908,"Thank you, Mr. Holl."
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,1611.312,1614.716,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1986.86-108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1660.495,1666.582,"Mr. Friedman, before you get into your argument could I ask you one sort of basic question."
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,1685.576,1687.495,To keep him in prison during the conditional writ period?
1986.86-108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1687.495,1687.911,Yes.
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,1687.911,1688.311,Yes.
1986.86-108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1693.899,1694.799,I understand it's quite common.
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,1694.799,1695.449,--simply to give the case--
1986.86-108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1695.449,1696.934,I just want to be sure you do not challenge that.
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,1696.934,1699.053,--We do not challenge the practice of conditional writs.
1986.86-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1717.015,1718.765,Why isn't it just as illogical?
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,1735.642,1739.528,"--Logically, I cannot draw a distinction."
1986.86-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1751.319,1751.586,"Well, wait."
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,1755.806,1760.858,"--After the 30 days expires, it depends on what the state has decided to do during that 30 days."
1986.86-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1794.514,1797.299,I'm not sure you're right about the first part of your answer.
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,1813.558,1814.275,--For the 30 days--
1986.86-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1814.275,1817.027,Without having to comply with any bail requirements.
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,1817.027,1820.546,--I apologize for a verbal mistake.
1986.86-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1846.196,1847.565,Why would he need a bail hearing?
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,1850.267,1858.921,"Because by taking the defendant back to trial, the state has acknowledged that its conviction is no longer of any force or effect."
1986.86-108,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1865.11,1872.014,"--Well now, I understood from the state's representative that that question is not clearly answered--"
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,1872.014,1872.931,"No, Your Honor."
1986.86-108,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1872.931,1875.149,--by New Jersey state law.
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,1885.005,1885.856,"No, Your Honor."
1986.86-108,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1891.844,1893.477,"All right, on state collateral."
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,1893.477,1894.294,--That's right.
1986.86-108,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1904.902,1916.126,Is there clear state case law in the situation of federal habeas collateral relief as to what applies in the state of New Jersey?
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,1916.126,1927.017,"Are you referring to the situation that Justice Scalia, I believe, referred to earlier, where the defendant is taken to trial because the state chooses not to appeal, or the situation where the state chooses to appeal in the federal courts?"
1986.86-108,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1928.583,1929.817,"Well, I want to know both."
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,1929.817,1930.635,I beg your pardon.
1986.86-108,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1931.935,1932.519,All right.
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,1934.087,1944.979,"If the state decides to take the defendant to trial, to abandon its conviction, then he is now a state indictee who--"
1986.86-108,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1944.979,1950.364,Do you have New Jersey Supreme Court authority for that?
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,1952.333,1952.833,"--No, Your Honor."
1986.86-108,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1956.537,1962.691,"Well, you both agree there are no binding decisions, then, of the New Jersey courts on this issue?"
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,1962.691,1968.677,--There is no decision that I'm aware of that expressly addresses the situation of what happens.
1986.86-108,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1968.677,1986.472,"While I have you interrupted, let me ask you about the situation in the federal habeas proceeding when it results in a determination in favor of the prisoner, and if the state decides to appeal that holding."
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2000.982,2024.764,"Your Honor, I believe that applying the likelihood of success or the Rule 8 four factors, as the state request to do, to the release decision would be fundamentally unfair to a defendant and would in a case like this one, particularly a short sentence case, would vitiate the writ itself and its effectiveness."
1986.86-108,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2027.549,2040.957,"Well, doesn't the federal government have an interest in being sure that that initial decision was correctly reached and to try to preserve the status quo pending the further resolution of that in federal courts?"
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2040.957,2051.248,"--The status quo that constantly is being referred to by the Petitioners is actually not the status quo, but the status quo ante, as though the judgment didn't exist."
1986.86-108,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2116.739,2125.511,"What about the standard for granting a stay by the appellate court, where you also have, you know, likelihood of success as a significant factor?"
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2126.878,2133.783,"But as I was indicating, Mr. Chief Justice, the entry of a stay has to be tailored to protect the interests of both parties."
1986.86-108,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2174.408,2177.077,"Well, that's just making the writ conditional."
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2179.729,2185.264,"No, Your Honor, I don't think so, because when the period would end the defendant would still be out through a surety."
1986.86-108,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2195.905,2202.309,"Well, supposing that a district court finds, yes, I'm going to enlarge this petitioner on habeas."
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2217.902,2224.924,I say that the district court does not have the discretion to hold a man because he is dangerous.
1986.86-108,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2224.924,2227.126,"Well, I gave you a hypothesis."
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2233.614,2244.236,"He does not have the discretion to detain that man, or he should not have the discretion to detain that man based primarily on likelihood of success, which is apparently what the Petitioners have shifted their focus to."
1986.86-108,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2245.172,2256.729,"I gave you a hypothesis that he was found to be very dangerous, the district court has granted the habeas, but finds there is a good deal of chance of success on appeal."
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2260.781,2265.918,"--No, I would say he does not, or he should not."
1986.86-108,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2269.787,2276.041,And the Court of Appeals could not issue a stay--
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2276.041,2276.924,The Court of Appeals--
1986.86-108,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2276.924,2285.047,--based on the fact that the state may very well prevail on appeal?
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2285.047,2285.763,"--No, Your Honor."
1986.86-108,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2287.099,2287.649,No what?
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2291.634,2296.771,"--Should not have the power to do that, to hold him for likelihood under Rule 23."
1986.86-108,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2302.674,2313.649,"And likewise, this Court would have no power to stay a particular proceeding pending review here of a habeas?"
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2313.649,2319.97,"--This Court, it would seem to me, would have the power to stay if the judgment resulted in the order releasing him, but not the release."
1986.86-108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2324.374,2329.842,"Well, but if you have power to stay the order ordering release, that would have the effect of staying the release."
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2342.085,2343.385,"Your Honor, if--"
1986.86-108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2343.385,2345.12,It seems to me there are two separate questions here.
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2358.678,2374.021,"--What I'm trying to do to discharge that burden, Justice Stevens, is make a distinction between the release decision and the stay of the underlying order that held that the conviction was obtained unconstitutionally."
1986.86-108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2405.842,2407.361,I don't think there is such a distinction.
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2407.361,2409.028,It's a difficult distinction and it's an unusual one.
1986.86-108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2411.23,2412.246,I think it's a nonexistent distinction.
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2428.357,2429.757,"Well, I don't--"
1986.86-108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2429.757,2433.243,"We review orders, Courts of Appeals review orders entered by district courts."
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2438.93,2453.99,"--Well then, Your Honor, if Your Honors are to hold that they can take into consideration the release decision, I would at least have Your Honors consider the unique posture of a habeas petitioner."
1986.86-108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2481.659,2483.459,"Well, that really isn't correct in this case."
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2486.078,2487.73,"--No, Your Honor, he did not."
1986.86-108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2487.73,2488.863,I guess I'm mixed up.
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2494.2,2500.104,"Yes, Your Honor, where custody is no longer in issue, then this Court has ruled that habeas can reach other things."
1986.86-108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2553.72,2555.672,"No, but you're arguing whether it's a matter of discretion and so forth."
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2572.347,2581.037,Your Honor has to separate the dangerousness component from the likelihood component because they implicate very different interests.
1986.86-108,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2627.934,2637.707,"But that's on the assumption that, having decided the writ should be issued, he is the functional equivalent of the person who is presumed to be innocent, has never been tried."
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2638.659,2654.351,"From the practical and legal sense, we contend that that is true, although we would say that if the Court decides to liken him instead to a defendant on bail pending appeal, the same underlying bottom line holds."
1986.86-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2669.178,2673.297,Why not liken it instead to a defendant who has been released on state habeas?
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2676.265,2695.578,"It depends on whether or not you're talking about state habeas by a defendant who remains convicted, getting back to an earlier question that I believe Justice White asked, or a defendant who has been given, been granted a petition for post-conviction relief, which is what it is called in New Jersey, and the state wishes to appeal."
1986.86-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2712.921,2715.073,I don't care for the moment what the law is.
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2734.369,2736.253,"--Perhaps it is, Your Honor."
1986.86-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2764.488,2778.898,"In the state system, there's a conviction and the defendant appeals, the pretrial rule does not apply there?"
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2778.898,2780.715,"No, because his conviction is valid."
1986.86-108,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2780.715,2781.267,Yes.
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2781.267,2782.184,Under the rule in New Jersey--
1986.86-108,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2782.184,2784.469,He's challenging it on appeal.
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2784.469,2786.469,--He is challenging it on appeal.
1986.86-108,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2786.469,2788.521,And he stays in jail.
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2788.521,2790.54,While his conviction is valid.
1986.86-108,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2790.54,2790.956,Yes.
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2790.956,2794.242,Until an appellate court decides that it is not.
1986.86-108,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2837.151,2841.722,"But here the conviction has been upheld all through the New Jersey courts, hasn't it?"
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2841.722,2842.355,--It has.
1986.86-108,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2842.355,2847.024,It's not as if they have thought there was reversible error in the case.
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2847.024,2874.193,"All that proves, it seems to me, with respect, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the state judgment has gotten all the deference it deserves up to the point at which a federal district court judge, a judge of competent jurisdiction, no matter how much the attorney general's representatives denigrate that judgment, that the state has been given all the deference it deserves by having the state be the first line of defense, if you will, for the vindication of constitutional rights."
1986.86-108,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2892.488,2906.164,But I don't think it follows from that that New Jersey would necessarily insist that he go free on his appeal from the federal district court habeas to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2906.164,2910.282,"Well, Your Honor, again the New Jersey Constitution says what it says."
1986.86-108,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2919.138,2926.208,But the state is here speaking for New Jersey and saying: We think this fellow ought to be held.
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2926.208,2935.898,"I am not entirely certain, Your Honor, that you can say with absolute confidence that the state is speaking for the state of New Jersey on this issue."
1986.86-108,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2939.016,2945.004,We've held in certainly other cases that the attorney general is presumed to speak for the state.
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2945.004,2950.657,"--Your Honor, the attorney general is speaking on behalf of the conviction."
1986.86-108,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2969.452,2998.304,"I don't know that there's any real, anything wrong with saying that on an appeal in the state system from a trial court order giving the defendant collateral relief and the state appealing, I don't know that it's so unreasonable to say that the rule that should apply on enlarging him is the rule that should apply on direct appeal."
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,2998.304,3004.708,"Your Honor, that would not perhaps be an unreasonable decision for state courts or the state legislature to make."
1986.86-108,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3004.708,3009.077,"Well, is it unreasonable for a state attorney general to say that's what the rule ought to be?"
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,3009.077,3014.481,The point is that the attorney general and I both agree that there is no case law either way.
1986.86-108,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3017.1,3030.775,What if there was case law in New Jersey that said the rule on an appeal of a collateral judgment is the rule that applies on direct appeal?
1986.86-108,1,35797,mark_h_friedman,,3033.394,3042.833,"--The federal court should do precisely what it did in Carter anyway, because the fact is the federal court has its own rules to follow."
1986.86-108,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3277.469,3279.552,"Thank you, Mr. Friedman."
1986.86-108,2,30703,john_g_holl,,3281.504,3283.221,"That's all right, Your Honor."
1986.86-108,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3283.221,3285.439,You mean you're waiving your time?
1986.86-108,2,30703,john_g_holl,,3285.439,3285.906,"Yes, thank you."
1986.86-108,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3285.906,3286.689,The case is submitted.
