1963.54,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,31.251,"Number 54, United States, Petitioner, versus Dorothy Anne Stapf and B. T. Ware, Executors."
1963.54,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,33.91,36.402,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1963.54,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,131.613,133.792,Is she -- is she then to like to take under will what was (Inaudible)?
1963.54,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,133.792,144.727,"She would take only her half of the community property and all of his property, his half of the community property plus his separate property would go to a trust for the children."
1963.54,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,144.727,145.426,I think I understand.
1963.54,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,150.944,156.996,She is entitled to one-half of all the community property less one-half of the debts.
1963.54,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,156.996,157.146,That --
1963.54,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,157.146,158.697,"Of the community, yes."
1963.54,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,158.697,159.099,And -- and --
1963.54,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,159.099,162.878,She would have taken -- let me give you the figures.
1963.54,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,174.296,175.719,As result of Texas law?
1963.54,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,175.719,177.477,"As result Texas law, that is correct."
1963.54,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,177.477,179.907,(Inaudible) --
1963.54,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,179.907,181.302,"No, no."
1963.54,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,235.984,238.435,That is -- that is half of the community property?
1963.54,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,238.435,238.87,"Well, she kept --"
1963.54,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,238.87,239.909,26 --
1963.54,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,239.909,241.982,"-- she -- under the will, she kept at 30 of the property--"
1963.54,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,241.982,242.96,Yes.
1963.54,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,242.96,244.706,"-- which is $85,000."
1963.54,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,246.456,246.936,Right.
1963.54,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,246.936,247.146,-- the difference between (Voice Overlap)
1963.54,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,247.146,249.334,-- there's been a third and a half of the community property
1963.54,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,249.334,250.941,"Which is $26,000."
1963.54,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,250.941,254.725,"Well, what happened to the debts?"
1963.54,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,254.725,257.982,The debts really don't enter in to this part of the case.
1963.54,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,319.912,329.112,But the purpose of the election I suppose is to give her a choice of one situation as more advantageous than the other.
1963.54,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,329.112,338.474,"Well, the election really amounts nothing more than offer made in the will, an offer that I will trade you $122,000 worth of separate my property --"
1963.54,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,338.474,342.308,"(Voice Overlap) position that all elections, widow's elections are --"
1963.54,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,342.308,351.401,"No, not an election, not an election that is an election between two alternative ways of receiving property by descent i.e. between dower and a statutory right, knew of dower."
1963.54,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,373.097,375.064,And that's not permissible?
1963.54,0,43923,wayne_g_barnett,,375.064,383.457,It's permissible to do but the consequence cannot be that the estate is entitled to marital deduction.
1963.54,1,46136,w_m_sutton,,1428.778,1455.932,"Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, I think it is a misnomer to characterize the will here as a gift of property upon a condition that Mrs. Stapf permits her property to pass through the trustees."
1963.54,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1513.102,1522.413,"Mr. Sutton, she would've had that election whether or not the will had discussed her election which is a matter of state law and then --"
1963.54,1,46136,w_m_sutton,,1522.413,1522.487,No.
1963.54,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1522.487,1524.557,-- she has the statutory rights?
1963.54,1,46136,w_m_sutton,,1524.557,1539.044,"Under the state law, the husband or the wife, as far as that's concerned, can dispose of only his or her one-half of the community property by will."
1963.54,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1558.871,1559.519,Right.
1963.54,1,46136,w_m_sutton,,1559.519,1577.329,"But it is a recognized principle that by the marital deduction, a husband or wife, either as far as that goes, can dispose of both halves of the community with the consent of the surviving spouse."
1963.54,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1585.425,1588.53,"Well, if she takes against the will if I understand you correctly --"
1963.54,1,46136,w_m_sutton,,1588.53,1588.976,If she takes --
1963.54,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1588.976,1591.646,-- all she gets is her half of this community property --
1963.54,1,46136,w_m_sutton,,1591.646,1592.703,"Correct, sir."
1963.54,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1593.646,1598.219,Which she -- which she would have whether or not there was a will --
1963.54,1,46136,w_m_sutton,,1598.219,1598.832,That is right.
1963.54,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1598.832,1599.802,-- which is always her.
1963.54,1,46136,w_m_sutton,,1599.802,1602.396,"That is her, that's fully vested interest."
1963.54,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1602.396,1603.613,Right.
1963.54,1,46136,w_m_sutton,,1603.613,1624.523,"So, now when she elected under -- to take under the will, she made a gift of her property or of her fully vested portion of the community property to trustees for the benefit of their children."
1963.54,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1742.26,1745.771,We'll recess now Mr. Sutton.
