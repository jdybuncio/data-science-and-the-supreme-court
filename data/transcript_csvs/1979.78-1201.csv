1979.78-1201,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.265,We will hear arguments first this morning in Mobil Oil Corporation v. Commissioner of Taxes of Vermont.
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,12.429,18.667,"Thank you, sir."
1979.78-1201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,141.786,143.308,Mr. Hellerstein --
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,143.308,144.292,"Yes, sir?"
1979.78-1201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,144.292,152.729,How large a tax would Mobil have paid in Vermont under your theory and under the return that it filed?
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,152.729,158.55,"Under the theory we are presenting, something like $4,000 for the three years."
1979.78-1201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,200.16,203.178,"I thought it was a question, rather than an argument that I was making."
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,203.178,204.68,"No, there's no question about it."
1979.78-1201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,230.899,235.905,"Where are those dividends taxed, other than by the Federal Government?"
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,235.905,240.205,"That raises the question, Were those dividends taxed by any other state?"
1979.78-1201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,240.205,241.066,That isn't what I asked.
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,243.005,243.757,Where were they taxed?
1979.78-1201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,243.757,245.055,"Where were they taxed, outside --"
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,245.055,246.294,By no state.
1979.78-1201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,246.294,246.46,In no state.
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,246.46,248.537,Let me explain why.
1979.78-1201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,275.274,278.047,Let me ask another question.
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,287.21,287.591,You're right.
1979.78-1201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,287.591,288.419,-- unfairness?
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,289.488,292.388,"We did, and it was denied."
1979.78-1201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,463.145,465.722,Are you saying that only New York could tax these --
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,465.722,466.525,Sir?
1979.78-1201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,466.525,469.057,Are you saying that only New York could tax --
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,469.057,490.88,"Our contention is this, Your Honor, that given a situation in which all the operations of the company, vis a vis the management of the stocks, the receipt and disposition of the dividends, when all of those take place outside a state, typically it be the commercial domicile, our contention is this."
1979.78-1201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,504.786,507.109,"Well, you are saying, then, that only New York can tax?"
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,507.109,508.177,That is correct.
1979.78-1201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,508.177,532.311,"Well then, doesn't that lead to the same sort of competitiveness in order to get the advantage of corporate presence and activity in a state, like Delaware used to have in corporate charters, that the state with the lowest income tax rate for investment income earned out of the country is going to be a haven for corporate domiciles?"
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,532.311,534.916,"Your Honor, I think there's a fundamental difference."
1979.78-1201,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,577.056,581.124,"Mr. Hellerstein, suppose you didn't have these subsidiaries."
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,581.124,581.926,Right.
1979.78-1201,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,581.926,585.974,"And the income flowed in to the taxpayer, Mobil."
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,585.974,587.134,Right.
1979.78-1201,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,587.134,590.0,Would you be here today?
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,590.0,592.293,We would not be here on this case.
1979.78-1201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,700.197,707.165,But you are objecting here at the very outset of even including in the base this dividend income?
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,707.165,710.529,"What I am saying, Mr. Justice White, is this."
1979.78-1201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,755.5,766.523,Would you make the same -- are you making the same argument or would you with respect to dividend income from the United States subsidiaries?
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,771.139,776.522,We are making the same arguments would apply under our due process contention.
1979.78-1201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,790.24,793.033,"Well, we have a domestic commerce, you know."
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,794.937,795.157,Right.
1979.78-1201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,799.058,801.365,"I know you don't, but some other people --"
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,801.365,802.87,"Suppose we had that case, as Your Honor is asking --"
1979.78-1201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,802.87,803.914,"Well, no."
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,803.914,804.882,Then I am saying --
1979.78-1201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,804.882,808.25,Your argument would certainly apply to domestic subsidiaries.
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,808.25,810.02,"The due process argument, yes."
1979.78-1201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,810.02,812.529,"Well, and why wouldn't the commerce argument be?"
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,812.529,813.533,Because --
1979.78-1201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,813.533,816.492,You have an interstate commerce clause.
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,816.492,831.581,"The due process argument, the reason why we are not arguing that the dividends received, if they were here, that dividends received from domestic subsidiaries could, need not, are not apportionable, is this."
1979.78-1201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,875.158,876.804,But wouldn't this --
1979.78-1201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,876.804,878.186,"I'm sorry, Mr. Justice Rehnquist?"
1979.78-1201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,878.186,894.669,"Just following up Justice White's question, isn't it precisely the same clause of the Constitution that Congress shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several States and with the Indian tribes that you derive your argument from?"
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,900.234,910.223,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, you here have the benefit of a decision of the majority of the Court in Japan Line which says foreign commerce is different."
1979.78-1201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,929.695,930.529,Yes.
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,930.529,932.095,Those are two things it established.
1979.78-1201,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,950.792,970.023,"Is part of your argument here that if Vermont wants to take in these dividend income, it should include in all of the assets owned and the property factor, all of the assets owned by the subsidiaries?"
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,970.023,975.765,"It would have to use a totally different method of taxation, that given this method of taxation --"
1979.78-1201,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,975.765,977.086,They can't have it both ways?
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,977.086,978.755,They can't have it both ways.
1979.78-1201,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,993.914,997.577,And what is your basis for saying New York could tax it all --
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,997.577,998.612,That's right.
1979.78-1201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,998.612,1004.019,But without -- would they have to treat you as a unitary company?
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,1004.019,1004.325,No.
1979.78-1201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1010.513,1022.311,Why wouldn't you make the same argument with respect to New York if they attempted to include the dividends but not all the properties in the factor?
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,1022.311,1025.146,"I'll tell you why we wouldn't make that argument, Your Honor."
1979.78-1201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1095.739,1101.933,And you would say that even if New York just attempted to apply its regular income tax --
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,1101.933,1102.476,I beg your pardon?
1979.78-1201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1104.271,1112.46,You wouldn't object if New York attempted to apply a normal income tax statute to you --
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,1112.46,1113.29,Not at all.
1979.78-1201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1113.29,1115.269,And include the dividend income?
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,1115.269,1117.059,That's correct.
1979.78-1201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1117.059,1122.159,They didn't purport to say this is for the privilege of doing business in New York as an investment company?
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,1122.159,1122.966,That's right.
1979.78-1201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1127.478,1130.808,"Mr. Hellerstein, may I ask you a question that would follow up on a question --"
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,1130.808,1131.62,"Excuse me, sir?"
1979.78-1201,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1131.62,1132.733,"Well, I'll raise my voice."
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,1132.733,1135.339,"May I come over here, Mr. Chief Justice?"
1979.78-1201,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1135.339,1142.944,"Mr. Hellerstein, I want to follow up on a suggestion that was implicit in a question Justice Blackmun asked you."
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,1155.048,1156.583,Entirely separate business?
1979.78-1201,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1156.583,1157.589,From the oil business.
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,1158.928,1159.818,They sell shoes.
1979.78-1201,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1159.818,1170.022,"Or sell shoes or they own an apartment building, derive income that is clearly identifiable with a particular state other than Vermont."
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,1177.549,1180.517,Not only is my submission that no --
1979.78-1201,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1180.517,1184.037,"Mr. Hellerstein, would you like to give your answer into the microphone?"
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,1184.037,1185.552,"Yes, thank you very much."
1979.78-1201,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1187.267,1190.696,"Otherwise you'll not be on the recording, we'll not have your statement."
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,1190.696,1191.368,I am sorry.
1979.78-1201,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1191.368,1193.418,"And furthermore, I won't hear you."
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,1193.418,1194.446,Thank you very much.
1979.78-1201,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1199.891,1200.7,I have no problem.
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,1200.7,1201.897,"Oh, how nice."
1979.78-1201,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1245.341,1245.961,Yes.
1979.78-1201,0,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,1245.961,1247.898,Very good.
1979.78-1201,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1262.045,1263.596,Mr. King.
1979.78-1201,1,39636,richard_johnston_king,,1263.596,1266.902,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1979.78-1201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1377.217,1393.286,"Mr. King, may I just ask you if you would regard as equally frivolous the position that as a matter of constitutional due process, the state would be required to exclude the toy business income, if they had a separate toy business in a different state?"
1979.78-1201,1,39636,richard_johnston_king,,1393.286,1394.262,"Yes, I would, Your Honor."
1979.78-1201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1394.262,1395.216,"You would say that was frivolous, too?"
1979.78-1201,1,39636,richard_johnston_king,,1395.216,1396.588,I would say that was a frivolous question.
1979.78-1201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1406.726,1422.755,"Is he correct in saying that it is customary for states to segregate out, to permit a taxpayer to eliminate income from entirely separate aspects of its business which are allocable to another state, and clearly so?"
1979.78-1201,1,39636,richard_johnston_king,,1422.755,1425.17,"That depends on the state statute, Your Honor."
1979.78-1201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1425.17,1428.158,"I realize that, but he said typically states do permit that."
1979.78-1201,1,39636,richard_johnston_king,,1429.015,1431.265,I think that's probably correct.
1979.78-1201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1431.265,1433.063,And does Vermont do that?
1979.78-1201,1,39636,richard_johnston_king,,1433.063,1442.012,The Vermont statute would include in the apportionable net income all federal taxable income of the corporation.
1979.78-1201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1442.012,1443.664,So that would take a contrary position on that?
1979.78-1201,1,39636,richard_johnston_king,,1443.664,1444.876,Take a contrary position.
1979.78-1201,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1492.078,1500.137,"Well, did Mobil ever claim that if you wanted to include the dividends you must include the underlying assets in the allocation formula?"
1979.78-1201,1,39636,richard_johnston_king,,1500.137,1501.024,Perhaps they claimed it.
1979.78-1201,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1506.558,1518.554,"You're saying that this is an integrated business worldwide, but yet you exclude from the property factor the property that's owned by the subsidiary?"
1979.78-1201,1,39636,richard_johnston_king,,1518.554,1519.92,"There's a very good reason for that, Your Honor."
1979.78-1201,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1542.422,1552.844,"Do you include in the value, in the property factor, the total-- Mobil's total property, the value of the stock, of the subsidiaries?"
1979.78-1201,1,39636,richard_johnston_king,,1552.844,1554.266,"We do not, Your Honor."
1979.78-1201,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1554.266,1555.012,Why not?
1979.78-1201,1,39636,richard_johnston_king,,1555.012,1557.591,Almost no state includes the value of intangibles.
1979.78-1201,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1558.839,1560.863,"Well, that's not a reason."
1979.78-1201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1562.291,1564.188,"But Mr. King, supposing --"
1979.78-1201,1,39636,richard_johnston_king,,1564.188,1565.643,"May I answer that question, sir?"
1979.78-1201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1565.643,1568.44,"Let me just throw this out and you answer it together, because it's very close, really."
1979.78-1201,1,39636,richard_johnston_king,,1576.299,1578.598,"Your Honor, that situation can't come up."
1979.78-1201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1582.187,1582.744,"It would be, wouldn't it?"
1979.78-1201,1,39636,richard_johnston_king,,1582.744,1583.95,"It would be included, yes."
1979.78-1201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1600.37,1605.507,"Why do you include any property, why do you have a property factor?"
1979.78-1201,1,39636,richard_johnston_king,,1609.928,1628.36,"The second point is that historically, and conceptually, intangibles, particularly when they are held by a corporate multi-state business, are attributed to those states in which that corporation does business in the same percentages as the apportionment factors of those states."
1979.78-1201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1642.926,1647.494,But you include all of the dividends from the stock.
1979.78-1201,1,39636,richard_johnston_king,,1647.494,1653.368,Correct.
1979.78-1201,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1653.368,1671.565,"Well, would Vermont treat the same way, I take it your answer to Justice Stevens would indicate yes, that income from Mobil's domestic subsidiaries --"
1979.78-1201,1,39636,richard_johnston_king,,1671.565,1676.525,"Income from domestic subsidiaries, Your Honor, would be consolidated under the federal system."
1979.78-1201,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1679.699,1683.064,Because Mobil has chosen to report that way?
1979.78-1201,1,39636,richard_johnston_king,,1683.064,1694.297,"No, because we tax based on federal taxable income and in federal taxable income, intercorporate dividends from subsidiaries are subtracted, or deducted, excuse me."
1979.78-1201,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1695.35,1698.119,And how about separate businesses?
1979.78-1201,1,39636,richard_johnston_king,,1698.119,1704.86,"If it was a separate business, if Mobil was holding stock in duPont, then no, then it would be included."
1979.78-1201,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2026.863,2033.191,Was the tax imposed in Japan Line an ad valorem property tax?
1979.78-1201,1,39636,richard_johnston_king,,2033.191,2034.327,"Yes, it was, Your Honor."
1979.78-1201,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2034.327,2035.69,Not an income tax?
1979.78-1201,1,39636,richard_johnston_king,,2035.69,2037.538,Absolutely.
1979.78-1201,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2227.297,2228.457,Mr. Dexter.
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2228.457,2232.413,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1979.78-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2442.418,2443.384,Mr. Dexter?
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2443.384,2444.344,Yes?
1979.78-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2444.344,2450.062,"You are emphasizing the intangible point very properly, of course, because that's this kind of case."
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2463.186,2479.556,"Well, Your Honor, basically the position of the states is, and I think in conforming with the decisions of this Court, that all of the unitary income of a unitary business is subject to a reasonable rule of apportionment."
1979.78-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2479.556,2481.974,My hypothesis is that it's not unitary.
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2481.974,2482.615,Okay.
1979.78-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2491.923,2503.661,"Well, I understand that's the practice. My question is, as a matter of constitutional law, would you say that the argument that that is, there is a due process objection to taxing that out-of-state income --"
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2503.661,2507.383,"Well, it seems to me that --"
1979.78-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2507.383,2509.893,You draw distinction in terms of constitutional law.
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2510.848,2512.133,Okay.
1979.78-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2529.863,2532.68,"Well, I don't understand that you've answered my question."
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2532.68,2532.822,Well --
1979.78-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2532.822,2546.126,"My question is, is there a constitutional -- you say there is no constitutional objection to treating intangible income as being earned in Vermont because you can't really place intangibles and it's part of the overall business always."
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2563.533,2565.083,My answer would be yes.
1979.78-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2565.083,2568.067,Then there is a valid.
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2568.067,2571.718,"But here that is not the circumstance, you understand."
1979.78-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2625.601,2632.347,"But Mr. Dexter, how do you answer Mr. Justice White's question that if you want to throw the income?"
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2632.347,2634.184,"Well, okay."
1979.78-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2737.588,2748.922,"Well, would it make a lot of difference in a case like this if the value of the shares was included in the property factor?"
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2748.922,2752.811,The value of the shares?
1979.78-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2754.736,2758.055,Would it make a lot of difference if it was included in the property factor?
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2758.055,2765.875,"Yes, but the question is, if you include it in the property factor, if you're going to include intangibles, what state you attribute it to."
1979.78-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2766.092,2773.476,"Well, you just include it in the property and then apportion it."
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2776.247,2784.644,"No, but you have, Your Honors, each factor you have to give it, you have to locate it for purposes of the numerator of the apportionment factor."
1979.78-1201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2807.216,2820.186,"But you are allocating, you are taking it -- what is the denominator in that, total property?"
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2820.186,2827.02,"The denominator would be total property, tangible property, or tangible property within the state."
1979.78-1201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2827.02,2835.648,Why don't you include in that the value of shares owned?
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2835.648,2849.756,"Well, simply because the three-factor formula is limited to tangible property with the idea that in that intangibles have not fixed cites for the nominator purposes."
1979.78-1201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2849.756,2852.639,"Well, you keep saying that, but I don't understand it."
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2853.558,2857.398,"Well, where do you attribute, the commercial domicile, the legal domicile --"
1979.78-1201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2857.398,2860.163,"Well, the denominator is total property, isn't it?"
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2860.163,2860.797,What?
1979.78-1201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2860.797,2863.734,"The denominator is total property, isn't it?"
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2863.734,2866.443,"No, it's total tangible property."
1979.78-1201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2866.443,2867.084,"Yes, I know."
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2867.084,2869.027,"I mean, that's the way the factors work."
1979.78-1201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2870.106,2881.647,"I know, but I'm just asking you, why not -- if you're talking about the total property, why do you exclude the intangibles from the total property that you use in the --"
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2881.647,2885.841,"I am saying, because you don't know where to put it in the denominator."
1979.78-1201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2887.075,2891.667,"Mr. Dexter, the denominator doesn't have any relevance to where the property is located."
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2892.536,2892.876,"No, no, no."
1979.78-1201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2892.876,2896.364,"The only time you need to know where the property is is in the numerator, isn't it?"
1979.78-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2896.364,2896.85,(Inaudible)
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2896.85,2897.576,Yes.
1979.78-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2903.348,2911.157,"I understand, but the denominator -- you don't know where 99.9 percent of the assets are in Vermont's denominator, do you?"
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2913.166,2913.384,Right.
1979.78-1201,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2913.384,2915.247,So all you need to know is the total figure for their denominator.
1979.78-1201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2915.247,2919.885,"You're just taking, in the numerator, the property that's located in Vermont?"
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2919.885,2920.898,Right.
1979.78-1201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2920.898,2930.886,"And you've said a hundred times already that the intangible isn't located in Vermont, but you do know that Mobil owns it."
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2930.886,2933.428,We do not say that it's not located in Vermont.
1979.78-1201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2939.573,2956.453,"Well, I'll put it to you this way If you included in the denominator the value of the shares that Mobil owns in its subsidiary but didn't take any part of that, didn't assign any part of that to Vermont in the numerator, it would make a difference, wouldn't it?"
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2956.453,2959.245,"Oh, it would make a substantial difference."
1979.78-1201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2959.245,2961.615,And the state wouldn't like it?
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2961.615,2963.463,"No, I doubt it."
1979.78-1201,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2963.463,2964.641,And I doubt if you would.
1979.78-1201,2,44427,william_d_dexter,,2964.641,2970.088,Well.
1979.78-1201,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2970.088,2973.231,"Mr. Hellerstein, you have about -- a little time left."
1979.78-1201,3,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,2973.231,2986.95,"Mr. Chief Justice, one of the cardinal principles, one of the pillars of the argument of the other side in effect is this."
1979.78-1201,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3031.169,3038.153,"Mr. Hellerstein, what about including in the denominator the value of the shares owned in the --"
1979.78-1201,3,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,3038.153,3041.347,"Of course, your answer -- it's a really very simple proposition."
1979.78-1201,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3053.685,3055.197,"Well, they don't do it."
1979.78-1201,3,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,3055.197,3056.454,"No, they don't do it."
1979.78-1201,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3059.39,3061.654,But did they over ask you -- did you ever ask them to --
1979.78-1201,3,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,3061.654,3067.94,"We asked for a modification on the basis of these points, and they denied it."
1979.78-1201,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3081.143,3082.758,"Well, Japan Line was a property --"
1979.78-1201,3,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,3082.758,3083.448,Sir?
1979.78-1201,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3083.448,3088.209,Japan Line was a property tax case and you had no --
1979.78-1201,3,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,3088.209,3091.08,"Japan Line was -- excuse me, sir."
1979.78-1201,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3215.438,3217.325,"When you say ""we,"" Mr. Hellerstein --"
1979.78-1201,3,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,3217.325,3218.027,Sir?
1979.78-1201,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3218.027,3221.592,"When you say "" we,"" are you talking about Mobil or are you talking about --"
1979.78-1201,3,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,3221.592,3229.484,At this point I have associated myself with the scholars and tax people in the field for the last thirty years.
1979.78-1201,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3230.691,3232.223,Court decision?
1979.78-1201,3,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,3232.223,3240.308,"The states developed, the states developed and all of them use, an apportionment method."
1979.78-1201,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3245.487,3250.312,"Well, how about Moorman, where as I recall Iowa used only one factor --"
1979.78-1201,3,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,3250.312,3251.617,The formula.
1979.78-1201,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3326.404,3329.25,But this Court has never held that.
1979.78-1201,3,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,3329.25,3331.779,This Court has never so held.
1979.78-1201,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3340.794,3345.091,"Mr. Hellerstein, what about the problem of the corporate domicile --"
1979.78-1201,3,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,3345.091,3347.641,"What about the -- that's a very interesting question, Your Honor."
1979.78-1201,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3347.641,3348.922,-- Delaware and a commercial domicile in New York --
1979.78-1201,3,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,3348.922,3349.763,Right.
1979.78-1201,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3349.763,3350.58,-- and each tried to --
1979.78-1201,3,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,3350.58,3350.601,That's right.
1979.78-1201,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3350.601,3351.731,-- attach 100 percent.
1979.78-1201,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3351.731,3352.537,What do you do there?
1979.78-1201,3,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,3352.537,3371.315,"Your Honor, the only cases I know of in the history of this Court which have considered that question, the question, I take it, is this Suppose you have a corporation organized in Delaware and it has the usual statutory office in Delaware but it really does business in New York, and New York, is the commercial domicile."
1979.78-1201,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3433.797,3449.194,"What about the case in which there is a valid argument as to whether the commercial domicile is in New York where they hold their directors' meetings and have some safety deposit boxes, or over in New Jersey where they have their principal offices day to day, and so forth."
1979.78-1201,3,30690,jerome_r_hellerstein,,3451.918,3456.186,"Your Honor, I have never heard of a rule of law that doesn't present problems."
