2003.02-1609,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.545,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 02-1609, the City of Littleton v. Z.J. Gifts."
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,9.371,14.655,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1609,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,95.525,105.101,"Mr. Nathan, would you explain to me how this generally operates with adult shops?"
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,143.923,146.152,"--Typically the latter, Your Honor."
2003.02-1609,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,153.377,160.702,"So this is an atypical case where the business was running and the city came in and said, you need a license?"
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,160.702,168.942,This is a case where a business started and filed litigation at the same time as it started against the city in Federal court.
2003.02-1609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,168.942,174.393,I suppose the city could have sought to enjoin the operation of the business until it got the license.
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,176.955,177.615,"The city... yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1609,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,178.813,189.132,"The Freedman case seemed to require prompt judicial determination, didn't it?"
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,189.132,190.618,"Yes, it did, Your Honor."
2003.02-1609,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,190.618,199.618,And it's your position that the subsequent case involving PBS changed that standard?
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,199.618,209.277,"In the licensing context, a requirement of a prompt judicial decision we believe is unnecessary and that's what FW/PBS held."
2003.02-1609,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,209.277,212.954,"Well, that surprises me to hear."
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,214.644,224.138,"Well, the decision mentioned the availability of judicial review as the second Freedman standard."
2003.02-1609,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,224.138,236.648,What... what about the proposal some of the States have made whereby a provisional license could be given pending the eventual judicial determination?
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,236.648,240.363,The problem with the provisional license is twofold.
2003.02-1609,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,259.56,282.595,"Well, if... if there's a danger of delay in litigation that... that both parties fear... and apparently you feared... isn't that all the more reason that before you have a license which restricts the publication of allegedly lawful speech, that you should have a... a system for prompt judicial determination?"
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,282.595,301.375,"But where you have an ordinance, Your Honor, that does not deal directly with speech, has separate objective licensing standards that do not have anything to do with speech, the government does not bear the burden of going to court first."
2003.02-1609,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,336.753,362.404,"Well, I... I... you could... if we're sitting here drafting a model ordinance, which is of course part of the problem that I'm presented with so far as the respondents are concerned, but if you're... if we're trying to envisage a model ordinance, just account for that contingency, saying our prompt judicial determination procedure applies only if there's a First Amendment claim."
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,362.404,370.273,But I guess the question goes back to whether or not the risks justify imposing a mandated judicial deadline.
2003.02-1609,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,370.273,372.297,How serious is the burden?
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,387.862,393.102,"Well, cities have been groping for a solution to that question."
2003.02-1609,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,422.824,440.74,"Do any of the courts which have said that prompt disposition, rather than just access... have they gone on to say that prompt appellate disposition, because presumably you can appeal from the ruling of... of a superior court or a trial court, that that also is required?"
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,440.74,443.358,"I do not believe they have held that, Your Honor."
2003.02-1609,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,447.799,455.889,"Because ordinarily, even if you get a prompt disposition in the trial court, you can wait, you know, a good year before you get a disposition on appeal."
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,455.889,457.458,"Yes, that's true, Your Honor."
2003.02-1609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,457.458,482.267,"Has... has anyone suggested that your... I don't know the... the merits of this separation of powers problem that you raise, but has anyone suggested that the answer to that may simply be not to try to directly control the courts to come down with a decision after X days or weeks or whatnot, but simply have a kind of circuit breaker provision that if they don't, the license will be deemed to be granted?"
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,482.267,491.062,"Well, I... I think that that's in the nature of a provisional license which would be that after--"
2003.02-1609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,491.062,491.805,It could be provision.
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,504.808,514.346,"--But it would also create the secondary risk by having an unqualified applicant, since that is what we're talking about in the standards that we're--"
2003.02-1609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,514.346,515.105,"Well, but we... we don't know."
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,541.383,552.528,--But this Court has always presumed the State courts will honor their obligations to review these types of cases and determine if there are First Amendment issues.
2003.02-1609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,552.528,558.557,"Oh, I'm sure the State courts will, but I've come from a State court and I... I know what... what caseloads are."
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,572.182,584.646,"But that's why in... in Colorado the rule 106 gives the court the ability to in its discretion, determine if accelerating the case is necessary."
2003.02-1609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,586.382,595.875,"In... in which case then, if there were this kind of circuit breaker provision, the... the courts would... would have every procedural basis for honoring it."
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,595.875,613.17,"--But, of course, if the city doesn't bear the burden of going to court and it's the business that goes to court, it would then have every incentive to move as slowly as possible because it would automatically get a license even if it weren't--"
2003.02-1609,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,613.17,615.399,I just didn't... would have every incentive to?
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,616.021,625.968,--Move slowly because it would automatically get a license if a certain period of time went by even if it weren't qualified under the objective standards of the ordinance.
2003.02-1609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,625.968,627.909,But it would have to have filed its appeal.
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,627.909,634.679,"It would have to have filed its appeal, but it would have every incentive not to ask that that--"
2003.02-1609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,634.679,640.457,"Then... then simply have your circuit breaker saying if there's going to be an appeal, file the appeal within X days."
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,640.457,644.051,--And--
2003.02-1609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,644.051,649.623,"I mean, these are simply things that States can provide by... by law, it seems to me, without any great difficulty."
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,649.623,661.884,"--That's true, and I guess the question is... is whether the risks entailed require that they be imposed on the cities who have these types of licensing ordinances."
2003.02-1609,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,664.939,675.342,"Well, if... if you take the position that in fact the State should move promptly here, what is the State going to lose by, in effect, a fail-safe requirement that it must?"
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,689.542,722.07,"--Just that when the plaintiff goes to court, the business goes to court, it would have every incentive to... to try to go as slowly as possible, whereas the incentive should be, if it wants a quick decision, for it to move to expedite, to... to brief quickly and to argue quickly and ask the court for an expedited decision, and if one is not availing, to go up and ask the appellate court, under our rule 21 of the Colorado Appellate Rules, to order the court to rule quickly."
2003.02-1609,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,722.07,745.642,"Mr. Nathan, I gather that a... I gathered from your brief that your... your principal point, or at least a principal point in this case, is your contention that this case is different from censorship cases where the judgment is left to a... a board with... with no standards as to whether a particular movie can be shown or not."
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,779.7,784.901,"Well, there's never been an application for the license in this case."
2003.02-1609,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,784.901,785.151,I see.
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,791.3,803.932,"In point of fact, except for the... its location... it's in an improper zone and it's within 500 feet of a church and day care center... Z.J. probably would have been granted the license, Your Honor."
2003.02-1609,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,803.932,809.216,"But they say they're not an adult business, and that's the preliminary characterization."
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,816.07,827.876,"But, Your Honor, that issue was litigated fully in the district court and the district court held that not only were they an adult business, but that their arguments to the contrary were essentially frivolous."
2003.02-1609,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,854.504,855.99,This is the Federal district court.
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,855.99,856.983,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1609,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,856.983,864.329,"Is... is there no court, municipal level court, in Colorado as there was in Baltimore?"
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,901.77,913.992,"Well, there's a serious question in the issues before the Colorado Supreme Court now as to whether a municipal court can handle a 106 review or whether it has to be a district court from the State."
2003.02-1609,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,939.088,947.733,Do you concede that the second Freedman requirement demands that judicial review... or that... that a judicial determination be concluded?
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,947.733,949.385,"I do not, Your Honor."
2003.02-1609,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,949.385,961.851,"I thought that that's the whole issue here, whether it's enough that you can promptly begin a suit or whether, in fact, what... what Freedman requires is that a suit has to be raced through to termination in these cases."
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,961.851,963.215,"Yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1609,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,978.409,985.634,"But everyone who complains about administrative action, adverse administrative action, has a right to promptly open the door."
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,991.207,1015.911,"--In this case, however, and in many others, when you have clear objective standards, a quick exit from the administrative process, a record of the reasons for the denial, then access to the court is meaningful because a court can readily determine if there's a subterfuge to suppress speech through the licensing mechanism."
2003.02-1609,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1015.911,1025.675,And I suppose that interpreting the second requirement that way does prevent the administrative agency from delaying matters by simply delaying the issuance of its opinion.
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,1025.675,1027.328,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2003.02-1609,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1027.328,1029.185,May I ask this general question?
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,1041.529,1048.959,The... the licensing requirements in this case involve adult businesses.
2003.02-1609,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1048.959,1049.702,Right.
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,1049.702,1052.925,And so I'm not sure what sort of--
2003.02-1609,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1052.925,1063.243,"I know the standards are different to qualify for it, but I'm just wondering if you're denied the... the license, are you treated any differently than if I had applied for... to get into some entirely different business?"
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,1063.243,1064.608,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2003.02-1609,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1064.608,1070.839,There's one curious feature in this and maybe you could explain it to me.
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,1078.847,1098.127,"They didn't apply for a sales tax license until 8 months after they opened, and by that time, because they had initiated litigation in the Federal district court, we had already determined that they were clearly an adult business and therefore they were denied the sales tax license because they were in an improper location, which is the only reason--"
2003.02-1609,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1098.127,1102.668,Can... can a business start up and... a retail business without such a license?
2003.02-1609,0,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,1102.668,1103.29,--No.
2003.02-1609,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1108.507,1109.25,"Very well, Mr. Nathan."
2003.02-1609,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1110.47,1120.13,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1609,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1221.698,1242.57,"I... I suppose that if we're concerned, as I... as I think the courts are concerned, about protecting First Amendment rights, one thing we could do is just say that if there's any apparent delay in determination, the United States district courts under 1983 are free to... are free to intervene at once."
2003.02-1609,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1242.57,1245.437,"And... and, Your Honor, if--"
2003.02-1609,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1245.437,1248.121,I'm not sure if that helps you or if it helps the respondent.
2003.02-1609,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1248.121,1253.694,"--Well, 1983 is, of course, always available as a vehicle for someone that's asserting that their constitutional rights have been violated."
2003.02-1609,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1253.694,1263.065,"Well, except that I... I would think the municipalities and the States would raise questions about deferring to the State courts for determination of State law issues and so forth."
2003.02-1609,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1263.065,1265.666,"Abstention doctrines, Younger abstention, for instance, might come to play."
2003.02-1609,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1286.554,1296.957,"Of course, I guess we'd have to have either a statute, such as the statute that requires Federal district courts to expedite criminal cases."
2003.02-1609,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1311.12,1319.088,"Well, and I guess at... at core, it doesn't matter whether you go to the Federal court under 1983 or to State court."
2003.02-1609,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1343.031,1350.75,But we've also held that Federal courts are... should be very loathe to intervene in ongoing State proceedings.
2003.02-1609,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1354.382,1361.895,"Absolutely, and in the Skokie case, it came up through the State court system and directly into this Court rather than via a district court model."
2003.02-1609,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1376.468,1383.072,What... what does prompt access mean as opposed to relaxed access?
2003.02-1609,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1391.141,1404.123,"Well, you need... under State systems, most State systems have some form of requirement that... that the court knows that the administrative process is over so it knows it doesn't have to defer to the administrative process anymore."
2003.02-1609,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1430.484,1435.435,"Does the local ordinance provide a limit, time limit, for the administrative proceeding?"
2003.02-1609,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1435.435,1436.55,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2003.02-1609,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1436.55,1438.408,What is... what is that?
2003.02-1609,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1438.408,1445.261,"I believe, as it's currently drafted, it is up to about 40 days, but it could be even quicker than that."
2003.02-1609,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1455.086,1463.548,Do you think those administrative requirements are... are mandated under the Constitution when First Amendment issues are... are present?
2003.02-1609,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1463.548,1465.656,"A prompt administrative decision, yes, Your Honor."
2003.02-1609,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1474.572,1479.94,"Well, why would you go that step unless you're being... you just think you're forced to under our decision?"
2003.02-1609,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1489.971,1493.891,"Well, Your Honor, there's been no showing here that there would be a protracted judicial process."
2003.02-1609,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1494.513,1506.523,"No, no, but I... I asked you if... if you concede that there is a requirement of expedition at the administrative process... at... at the administrative level, it then seems to me that it also follows there has to be one at the judicial level."
2003.02-1609,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1506.523,1513.832,"--Well, Your Honor, the... the question before the Court today, though, is what does Littleton's or a town like Littleton's licensing scheme need to provide."
2003.02-1609,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1525.144,1526.464,Do you concede that there are such obligations?
2003.02-1609,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1526.464,1538.518,I concede that... that courts have an obligation under cases like Skokie to be sensitive to the time concerns that are presented by First Amendment issues.
2003.02-1609,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1540.004,1556.312,"Mr. Cole, do you know whether there are any license... city licensing schemes that say if the... in the administrative proceeding it's determined that the license should issue and it is the city that's appealing, that then it has to be expedited?"
2003.02-1609,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1570.18,1573.152,--I'm not aware of any such city ordinances.
2003.02-1609,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1649.664,1653.751,"Well, it is a matter of sorting them to the extent you have to figure out what's an adult business."
2003.02-1609,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1662.008,1663.206,"Well, Your Honor, I--"
2003.02-1609,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1663.206,1664.403,--a sorting type issue?
2003.02-1609,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1669.521,1680.917,"--Well, but if you're not subject to this ordinance, you're not going to be seeking judicial review under this ordinance, and you'll do what... what Z.J. Gifts did here, which is bring a facial challenge under the First Amendment before you've even subjected yourself to the licensing scheme."
2003.02-1609,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1696.52,1704.898,"All of which is true unless the... the city chooses to do, as it did not do here, and that is to enjoin the operation of the business in the absence of the license."
2003.02-1609,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1704.898,1710.925,"Well, and it... if they... if they seek to enjoin the business at that point, then you're right."
2003.02-1609,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1716.415,1717.491,"Thank you, Mr. Cole."
2003.02-1609,1,20687,douglas_r_cole,,1717.491,1718.151,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
2003.02-1609,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1718.151,1720.259,"Mr. Gross, we'll hear from you."
2003.02-1609,2,35885,michael_w_gross,,1720.259,1727.605,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2003.02-1609,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1746.386,1750.184,But Freedman was actual censorship and this is not that.
2003.02-1609,2,35885,michael_w_gross,,1750.184,1752.003,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2003.02-1609,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1761.124,1769.464,"Well, are you saying that the... the claims of the owner here are just as urgent under the First Amendment as in Freedman?"
2003.02-1609,2,35885,michael_w_gross,,1771.732,1776.728,FW/PBS did relax the third Freedman safeguard.
2003.02-1609,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1794.849,1800.401,Has there... has there ever been any proceeding here at all to determine what the issues are?
2003.02-1609,2,35885,michael_w_gross,,1800.401,1805.109,"--There's been a lot of proceedings in this case, Your Honor, as Mr. Nathan indicated."
2003.02-1609,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1805.109,1812.761,But... but they're all on a challenge to the overall constitutionality of the... of the city ordinance?
2003.02-1609,2,35885,michael_w_gross,,1812.761,1814.519,"That's not entirely accurate, Your Honor."
2003.02-1609,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1828.31,1830.705,"Is it... is it operating now, the business?"
2003.02-1609,2,35885,michael_w_gross,,1830.705,1831.532,The... the business is operating now.
2003.02-1609,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1832.125,1833.511,On what basis?
2003.02-1609,2,35885,michael_w_gross,,1833.511,1833.761,--Well--
2003.02-1609,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1833.761,1834.876,"I mean, happened to... to--"
2003.02-1609,2,35885,michael_w_gross,,1834.876,1841.684,"--With regard to that State court case, there was an order enjoining the... the operation of the business entered in September of 2001."
2003.02-1609,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1894.362,1907.449,"--It... it seems to me that it's just much simpler for us to acknowledge, for the system to acknowledge that there's a strong First Amendment interest here, so expedition is important, rather than write some model ordinance."
2003.02-1609,2,35885,michael_w_gross,,1912.112,1919.792,And... and there was a facial challenge filed at the time the business was opened back in August of 1999.
2003.02-1609,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1927.927,1938.534,"I'm just not sure why that isn't adequate if a Federal judge thinks that the... the city... that the State system is delaying matters and that speech is at risk, the Federal court could issue an injunction."
2003.02-1609,2,35885,michael_w_gross,,1940.559,1949.514,"Well, the Federal courts are... I think, as indicated before, there are some issues of abstention, comity, and so forth, and those issues have come up quite a bit, especially if there's pending State court proceedings."
2003.02-1609,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1968.794,1970.53,"Well, but... what... what is the problem in the case?"
2003.02-1609,2,35885,michael_w_gross,,2002.481,2008.341,"Well, I think Freedman said prompt judicial review means prompt judicial determination."
2003.02-1609,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2014.741,2022.254,"Once you say that, the courts have discretion to fashion the remedy, that's the end of it, isn't it?"
2003.02-1609,2,35885,michael_w_gross,,2041.862,2051.893,"--Well, the core policy behind Freedman... it was enunciated in FW/PBS... is that delay could... results in unconstitutional suppression of speech."
2003.02-1609,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2052.469,2053.5,We're all against delay.
2003.02-1609,2,35885,michael_w_gross,,2065.1,2070.755,"--Well, in this case there was an erroneous deprivation of constitutional rights."
2003.02-1609,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2070.922,2074.183,You mean you have not had... you've had unreasonable delay.
2003.02-1609,2,35885,michael_w_gross,,2074.183,2075.176,"--Yes, and--"
2003.02-1609,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2075.176,2077.525,Aren't... isn't your client running his bookstore?
2003.02-1609,2,35885,michael_w_gross,,2077.525,2078.558,--The... the client--
2003.02-1609,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2078.558,2079.551,Then what's the delay?
2003.02-1609,2,35885,michael_w_gross,,2079.551,2084.464,--The client... there... there's no injunction order entered in this case.
2003.02-1609,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2089.293,2090.408,"Oh, that's a different matter."
2003.02-1609,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2100.522,2105.806,"Well, I thought it does say prompt judicial review in the sense of access."
2003.02-1609,3,32164,j_andrew_nathan,,3513.705,3518.822,"Unless there are any questions, I have... I feel no need for rebuttal."
2003.02-1609,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3519.399,3520.885,"Thank you, Mr. Nathan."
