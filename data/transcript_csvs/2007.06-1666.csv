2007.06-1666,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,14.843,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 06-1666, and the consolidated Case 07-394, Munaf versus Geren, Secretary of the Army, and Geren versus Omar."
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,17.043,40.708,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Under this Court's precedents and universal international law norms, the government of Iraq, like all sovereign nations, has a sovereign right and jurisdiction to try and punish individuals, including American citizens, who voluntarily enter its borders, commit crimes in its country, and remain there."
2007.06-1666,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,100.18,113.173,"Isn't the problem with the argument that Hirota did not at any point in the per curiam opinion saying... say, we're coming to the conclusion that we come to of no jurisdiction because there's an international force?"
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,129.616,131.718,"Well, that is the difference, Justice Souter."
2007.06-1666,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,146.727,148.346,"There's another difference, too."
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,169.76,184.536,"That's true, and let me explain why we think that Hirota does govern the circumstances in this case, notwithstanding that this case involves citizens and notwithstanding that the Petitioners in Hirota had been the subject of an international conviction."
2007.06-1666,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,213.871,242.557,"If it is, there's something... the implication of that I think is what is bothersome, because in effect it means, if that rule is applied to this case, it means that the president acting alone can make an agreement for an international force or a cooperative force and that agreement of the executive alone in effect eliminates habeas jurisdiction over an American citizen."
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,251.127,256.031,"--Well, obviously the Court reached that conclusion in Hirota as to aliens."
2007.06-1666,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,278.56,284.348,"No, but in real world terms isn't it the case that they are under United States authority?"
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,309.749,311.499,--If I can make--
2007.06-1666,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,311.499,311.982,Go ahead.
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,311.982,312.967,--two points in response to that.
2007.06-1666,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,335.213,338.748,"Mr. Garre, just to clarify one point."
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,347.921,349.723,There has been a subsequent resolution.
2007.06-1666,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,380.639,383.408,I think... I think you're right.
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,383.408,386.61,--So I don't think that that's a basis for distinguishing Hirota.
2007.06-1666,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,387.143,396.668,"It may be... I mean, Hirota was a literally, I think, a two or three-day per curiam opinion."
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,427.937,437.662,"--Well, again, I think that Hirota... the amount of influence that the United States forces have over the international force isn't a basis for distinguishing Hirota."
2007.06-1666,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,471.599,475.134,So once again you're relying on a concurring opinion by Justice Douglas?
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,475.134,476.701,--Not the concurring opinion.
2007.06-1666,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,502.534,516.211,"Mr. Garre, it is at least equally plausible, I think, because it's the only factor that Hirota mentions more than once, that the Court was going on its lack of power"
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,552.699,554.582,If I can make a couple of points.
2007.06-1666,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,682.981,691.836,"If it's in the materials, then perhaps I should have known, but did the... I take it Munaf was present and was represented by counsel?"
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,691.836,692.602,"--Yes, both."
2007.06-1666,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,692.602,693.619,But how did that work?
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,697.906,704.494,The individuals are detained by the Multinational Force while there are proceedings before the Iraqi court--
2007.06-1666,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,704.494,710.048,So then he just goes every day to the Iraqi court and then he comes back at night to U.S. custody?
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,710.048,710.481,--Yes.
2007.06-1666,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,735.596,736.429,There are--
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,736.429,736.929,"And, again--"
2007.06-1666,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,736.929,744.999,--There are in the U.S. custody a number of non-citizens.
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,756.557,764.596,"--There are 24,000 people currently being held by the Multinational Force, the vast majority of whom obviously are aliens."
2007.06-1666,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,783.558,803.185,"One more... I'd like... on the first question, in reading through this, my impression was that the government... and the green briefs, you know, the dark green briefs against you from the Military Justice Institute and the national security specialists really don't disagree."
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,851.627,853.996,--We say the same is true with respect to the allied forces--
2007.06-1666,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,853.996,854.463,Yes.
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,875.393,876.645,"--There is not, Justice Breyer."
2007.06-1666,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,877.179,877.895,There is not.
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,877.895,879.481,--official has the supreme command--
2007.06-1666,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,879.481,879.947,Yes.
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,903.762,907.714,"--The same was true with respect not only to the tribunal, but the allied forces--"
2007.06-1666,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,907.714,908.364,"Yes, yes."
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,908.364,908.914,--in Hirota.
2007.06-1666,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,908.914,909.48,The same was true.
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,910.416,911.582,That's correct.
2007.06-1666,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,921.688,921.971,Well--
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,921.971,924.89,--whereas the United Nations here ultimately has.
2007.06-1666,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,924.89,935.011,"--But that's because the President, I take it, would follow what the UN says, not because the chain of command would change."
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,935.011,944.367,"Well, I think that that's true, but the point I wanted to make is that the United Nations today could repeal the resolutions authorizing this international force and the specific mission."
2007.06-1666,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,944.367,946.367,"And if that happened, these people would be released?"
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,946.367,951.021,They would be under the authority of the United States.
2007.06-1666,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,958.091,964.531,But the relevance of that is General MacArthur was an agent of several allied powers.
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,964.531,966.747,"--As is, in our view, General Petraeus."
2007.06-1666,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,968.399,988.729,"Then, to me, it's a matter of Hirota at the moment, and the only distinction you haven't addressed is at that time, I think in 1946, the basic habeas rule was that you wouldn't question a judgment of a tribunal, at least not a foreign tribunal."
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1002.804,1006.524,"--I don't think it does, for the reasons that I have already indicated to Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-1666,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1018.248,1026.085,"But the Court certainly listed it as a circumstance; and, as I said before, it's the only thing that's repeated in the opinion."
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1029.888,1030.972,It did.
2007.06-1666,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1034.257,1035.39,May I ask just one question.
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1042.044,1044.127,"--Analytically, it would be the same, Justice Stevens."
2007.06-1666,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1066.742,1074.079,And I suppose if he were... it would make a huge difference whether such an individual were released in the United States as opposed to being released in Iraq.
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1074.079,1074.848,--Absolutely.
2007.06-1666,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1158.584,1160.87,Is there a limit to your proposition?
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1174.094,1180.747,"--I think we would maintain that American citizens, when they go abroad, they have to take what they get."
2007.06-1666,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1181.963,1184.282,"Well, could they be released to a lynch mob?"
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1184.282,1195.757,"--What... I think what this Court said in Neely versus Henkel... and I'm quoting from page 122, and I think it partially answers your question, Justice Kennedy:"
2007.06-1666,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1210.517,1220.056,But habeas corpus is concerned with the safety of the prisoner to the extent that it's controlled by our authorities.
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1229.694,1230.596,No.
2007.06-1666,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1238.834,1241.786,"Of course, this is just a hypothetical question."
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1241.786,1242.169,--Right.
2007.06-1666,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1242.169,1242.719,Of course.
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1242.719,1243.236,Right.
2007.06-1666,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1243.236,1250.892,And do you agree that... do you concede that habeas is concerned with the safety of the individual as opposed to his custody?
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1250.892,1254.594,"Habeas, as this Court has made clear, is concerned with the fact or duration of custody."
2007.06-1666,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1307.292,1309.577,"There's an important distinction, I think."
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1350.868,1354.487,"--Let me make a practical and a legal point on that, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-1666,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1366.026,1369.061,This is a quotation from the deputy justice minister.
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1369.061,1375.567,"--And I don't believe he was pointing to any reports of systematic abuses within the department, the Ministry of Justice."
2007.06-1666,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1395.897,1402.384,Doesn't that... doesn't that issue that you raise at least deserve litigation before the court?
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1402.384,1404.568,"--No, and that was the legal point that I was going to make."
2007.06-1666,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1420.511,1421.378,Why shouldn't they?
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1448.228,1455.667,"--I think because for centuries, Justice Souter, the courts have recognized that these are matters for the executive to assess, because--"
2007.06-1666,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1455.667,1459.802,Then why don't you have... why isn't your answer different in the lynch-mob case?
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1459.802,1462.654,"--Well, I think there we weren't talking about habeas."
2007.06-1666,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1468.991,1477.846,A lynch mob doesn't require investigation by American courts of the internal workings of a foreign government.
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1477.846,1479.282,"Well, that's true, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-1666,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1479.282,1484.65,"No, but I think it would be quite extraordinary to investigate the Government of Iraq."
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1489.221,1489.804,That's--
2007.06-1666,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1489.804,1492.756,But It would be a strange thing for an American court to do.
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1492.756,1498.541,"--That's what the district court, the court of appeals, and maybe this Court would have to do if it were going to entertain allegations of--"
2007.06-1666,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1498.541,1513.218,"In answer to a previous question, I understood you to say that if the individuals here were tried by an Iraqi tribunal they would remain in the custody of the Multinational Force during the course of the trial."
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1523.739,1528.393,"--That's right, and General Garner explained that on page 48 of the appendix."
2007.06-1666,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1529.626,1537.796,"Well, just to follow up on that, at what point during that, during the trial, would there be any potential for torture by Iraqi authorities."
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1537.796,1539.482,"--There would be none, Justice Alito."
2007.06-1666,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1560.126,1568.982,"Sure, but once they're turned over to the prison authorities they're in the situation that the NGO brief describes."
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1572.017,1584.825,"It's not the situation that the NGO brief described, because all of those reports are focused on Ministry of Interior and Defense, where these individuals are not going to... U.S. court, even in the extradition context, don't review these allegations--"
2007.06-1666,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1584.825,1587.694,"Well, I guess that just gets me back to my earlier question."
2007.06-1666,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1595.549,1596.499,--I don't think so.
2007.06-1666,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1621.664,1622.181,"Thank you, Mr. Garre."
2007.06-1666,1,31712,joseph_margulies,,1628.001,1643.279,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: To resolve any confusion about the habeas Petitioners' claims, I'd like to focus on two points this morning."
2007.06-1666,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1667.895,1673.882,Did General MacArthur have effective jurisdiction and control in Japan?
2007.06-1666,1,31712,joseph_margulies,,1673.882,1677.101,"Frankly, Your Honor, the record in that regard is unclear."
2007.06-1666,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1755.665,1761.386,Does your case... does your case depend entirely on the fact that these are American citizens?
2007.06-1666,1,31712,joseph_margulies,,1761.386,1764.687,"It is a sufficient ground, Your Honor, but it does not--"
2007.06-1666,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1764.687,1768.157,"If they were not American citizens, would there be jurisdiction?"
2007.06-1666,1,31712,joseph_margulies,,1768.157,1772.376,"--We believe there would be jurisdiction, Your Honor, but no basis to proceed--"
2007.06-1666,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1772.376,1774.811,So then citizenship is irrelevant on the jurisdictional issue?
2007.06-1666,1,31712,joseph_margulies,,1774.811,1793.439,"--Only vis a vis jurisdiction, Your Honor, but I would stress we disagree very vigorously with Mister... with the government that if jurisdiction were to extend here to foreign nationals, a position on which we take no issue... that it would be--"
2007.06-1666,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1793.439,1795.256,I don't know how you can avoid taking that question.
2007.06-1666,1,31712,joseph_margulies,,1798.677,1813.602,"--Frankly, Your Honor, we are inclined to agree with Justice Scalia's position in... my interpretation of the habeas statute accords with Justice Scalia's view of the interpretation of the statute giving a right to citizens--"
2007.06-1666,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1813.602,1820.506,Are you aware of any cases in which we have held that habeas jurisdiction is available to a citizen where it would be not available to a non-citizen?
2007.06-1666,1,31712,joseph_margulies,,1820.506,1822.875,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1666,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1848.24,1854.327,May I ask this second question: Do you think the place of detention has any relevance to the issue?
2007.06-1666,1,31712,joseph_margulies,,1854.327,1855.429,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1666,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1857.881,1864.952,Do you think whether or not it's a... there are ongoing hostilities would have any relationship to the issue?
2007.06-1666,1,31712,joseph_margulies,,1864.952,1867.904,"--We think that that question is answered in Hamdi, Your Honor."
2007.06-1666,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1876.074,1878.343,But you say that does not exist in Iraq today?
2007.06-1666,1,31712,joseph_margulies,,1878.343,1881.795,"Oh, no, we do accept that it exists in Iraq today, Your Honor."
2007.06-1666,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1898.506,1901.225,But the place of detention has always been Iraq?
2007.06-1666,1,31712,joseph_margulies,,1901.225,1902.341,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2007.06-1666,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1902.341,1905.16,The place of detention has always been Iraq?
2007.06-1666,1,31712,joseph_margulies,,1905.16,1905.977,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-1666,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1913.683,1919.17,Would the legal issue be the same if there were violent ongoing hostilities in Iraq?
2007.06-1666,1,31712,joseph_margulies,,1919.17,1939.583,"Your Honor, we accept that there are violent ongoing hostilities in Iraq, but the United States government takes the position that the Geneva Conventions, with which they are complying here... in this case the conflict is governed by Geneva Convention 4... obligates the United States to move prisoners to a safe location, and they have done that by taking these prisoners to Camp Cropper."
2007.06-1666,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1967.318,1973.304,But I really wanted to get your answer to Justice Stevens's first question straight.
2007.06-1666,1,31712,joseph_margulies,,1976.689,1981.141,"Oh, no, Your Honor, I think it's extraordinarily relevant, and I think that we are entitled--"
2007.06-1666,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1981.141,1984.009,But I thought you were not basing your case on the citizenship?
2007.06-1666,1,31712,joseph_margulies,,1984.009,1984.843,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1666,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1987.695,1988.345,I might have--
2007.06-1666,1,31712,joseph_margulies,,1988.345,1993.199,--but it is only one of the grounds upon which we would distinguish this case from Hirota.
2007.06-1666,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1993.199,2006.375,"Let me ask you about that, because if your basic point is that here is an officer of the United States that has someone in custody--"
2007.06-1666,1,31712,joseph_margulies,,2006.375,2006.992,Yes.
2007.06-1666,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2006.992,2011.927,"--someone who is in jeopardy, among other things, of being tortured--"
2007.06-1666,1,31712,joseph_margulies,,2011.927,2012.362,Yes.
2007.06-1666,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2012.362,2019.516,--that United States official has to safeguard a citizen?
2007.06-1666,1,31712,joseph_margulies,,2019.516,2020.332,Yes.
2007.06-1666,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2020.332,2025.003,But can throw a non-citizen into the lion's den?
2007.06-1666,1,31712,joseph_margulies,,2035.542,2042.946,"Frankly, Your Honor, I do not believe the United States makes that instruction to its uniformed officers."
2007.06-1666,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2042.946,2045.231,But you're making this distinction now.
2007.06-1666,1,31712,joseph_margulies,,2052.467,2053.134,Yes.
2007.06-1666,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2053.134,2059.722,There are thousands of noncitizens that are being held in the very same circumstance.
2007.06-1666,1,31712,joseph_margulies,,2059.722,2085.337,"Your Honor, there are important reasons embedded in the laws of war that authorize the United States in this context to transfer foreign nationals back... in this case the overwhelming number of which are Iraqis... back to the custody of the Iraqi government, that the laws of war do not allow for... with U.S. citizens."
2007.06-1666,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2086.371,2090.741,"Mr. Margulies, the prologue to the Constitution does say"
2007.06-1666,1,31712,joseph_margulies,,2118.574,2124.545,"I take no position on whether it's extravagant, Your Honor, but I certainly take the position that that's not what we argue."
2007.06-1666,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2137.722,2145.828,So a habeas court here has to look at all those different factors and come to a determination of whether it has jurisdiction?
2007.06-1666,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2154.516,2155.033,No.
2007.06-1666,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2157.218,2161.67,So what is the bright line that determines whether there's habeas jurisdiction or not?
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2161.67,2162.52,Control.
2007.06-1666,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2169.776,2178.43,So the control in the middle of a zone of hostilities of a foreign national allows... creates habeas jurisdiction?
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2179.298,2180.365,"--No, I'm sorry, Your Honor."
2007.06-1666,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2198.259,2199.795,"Well, then it's not just control."
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2205.782,2207.365,"Yes, Your Honor, and I apologize."
2007.06-1666,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2222.125,2231.746,Do we have any... any precedent in our cases for saying that that test would apply during an active combat in a zone of hostilities?
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2231.746,2242.452,"Toth v. Quarles, of course, Your Honor, involved a person who was brought from the United States to Korea when there was still hostilities ongoing."
2007.06-1666,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2258.194,2260.063,It's a very different place of detention.
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2260.063,2262.031,"--Oh, absolutely, Your Honor."
2007.06-1666,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2267.169,2269.869,I still don't... I don't understand what you're saying about citizenship.
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2292.618,2294.069,"--Not quite, Your Honor."
2007.06-1666,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2296.502,2298.271,If I could just then finish the question.
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2322.554,2323.756,"--For several reasons, Your Honor."
2007.06-1666,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2375.187,2379.073,But you have only the... the citizenship to stop the floodgate.
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2431.672,2436.04,"--You should definitely not assimilate this case to the latter category, Your Honor."
2007.06-1666,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2440.158,2452.8,"In answering that question, would you go back, please, and clarify something that I'm not too clear on in your answers to comparable questions from Justice Kennedy and Justice Stevens?"
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2476.365,2476.965,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1666,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2501.065,2518.158,"So you're saying within what is technically a zone of hostility, there are places, physical places, I take it, within which the military has a degree of discretion; and that discretion is what makes this situation comparable to an occupation?"
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2522.146,2528.716,"--Your Honor, what we are suggesting is that we recognize that there are hostilities going on inside Iraq."
2007.06-1666,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2535.887,2540.941,So are you saying then that the zone of hostilities does not include all of Iraq?
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2540.941,2541.674,Absolutely.
2007.06-1666,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2542.309,2544.042,So what if we thought otherwise?
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2544.042,2545.125,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2007.06-1666,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2545.125,2546.558,What if we thought otherwise?
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2552.412,2553.648,"We would not, Your Honor."
2007.06-1666,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2566.539,2571.276,Then you've got to say that there is habeas jurisdiction within the zone of hostility.
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2573.243,2573.728,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-1666,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2586.751,2589.07,An abstention kind of doctrine then is what you are getting at?
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2589.07,2589.603,--Yes.
2007.06-1666,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2590.27,2592.622,So that's pretty far removed from the bright line.
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2619.34,2620.807,"--I... we think not, Your Honor."
2007.06-1666,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2662.369,2671.641,"Mr. Margulies, could I ask a few questions about the Multinational Force involved here?"
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2684.615,2685.215,No.
2007.06-1666,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2685.215,2686.067,You do not?
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2686.067,2686.801,We do not.
2007.06-1666,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2730.494,2732.846,Let me try and move you to the merits.
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2732.846,2733.563,Please.
2007.06-1666,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2733.563,2740.083,I had thought that the historic purpose of the Great Writ was to challenge custody.
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2744.671,2747.522,"That is incorrect, Your Honor, and let me make it clear."
2007.06-1666,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2780.077,2780.644,"Well, but in the cases--"
2007.06-1666,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2780.644,2785.796,"You don't want the district court to say you win, you can be released tomorrow at noon."
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2785.796,2786.664,"Yes, we do."
2007.06-1666,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2787.648,2789.515,"Well, I thought you wanted to block the transfer."
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2791.432,2805.692,"--Your Honor, let's say we had... my understanding of the evidence in Munaf leads me to believe that on remand this is where we... this is where the state of play will go: The transfer will be unlawful, and the Iraqi government will not want him."
2007.06-1666,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2810.512,2816.599,--But he... he is still within the Iraqi criminal justice system.
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2823.403,2824.087,--Correct.
2007.06-1666,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2824.087,2837.477,So what's happening in his case is he's undergoing a criminal process in Iraq; and we are holding him during that process.
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2868.596,2872.98,"Your Honor, his petition, like Mr. Omar's petition, seeks his release."
2007.06-1666,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2894.294,2896.246,I don't get up to transfer.
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2899.965,2900.698,--Yes.
2007.06-1666,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2900.698,2904.519,"Now, we... transfer isn't an issue."
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2911.673,2932.252,"Your Honor, you are correct that we do not object to the idea that, while the district court is determining whether it is lawful to detain a U.S. citizen in this circumstances or transfer a U.S. citizen in those circumstances... those two inquiries... it is okay to detain Mr. Munaf for the benefit of the Iraqi government."
2007.06-1666,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2932.252,2937.49,I thought the relief that was awarded by the district court also enjoined prosecution.
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2937.49,2944.56,"It does not, Your Honor, and to the extent that the D.C. Circuit in Omar interprets that, we do not... we disavow that."
2007.06-1666,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2963.971,2970.294,"The question is, look, suppose the government comes in tomorrow, or in the district court, you're back there."
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2980.516,2981.016,Yes.
2007.06-1666,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2981.016,2982.033,Yes?
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,2982.033,2982.452,Yes.
2007.06-1666,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2982.452,2984.152,Okay.
2007.06-1666,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2984.152,2985.054,You want... I'm sorry.
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3000.71,3009.15,There is... there is no question that we do not challenge any right of sovereignance in Iraq to share information.
2007.06-1666,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3022.993,3026.445,"--Well, why didn't you answer Justice Breyer... and we've interrupted you a couple of times."
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3034.801,3040.871,--Because what I understood the hypothetical to mean is that there had not been a prior determination that the transfer would be unlawful.
2007.06-1666,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3048.708,3051.06,"Well, what we're doing--"
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3051.06,3051.593,So you're not--
2007.06-1666,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3051.593,3055.214,--What we're doing is we're testing the authority and the propriety of the district judge to proceed.
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3055.214,3055.964,--Yes.
2007.06-1666,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3055.964,3060.916,"And that's why we are asking if, at the end of the day, the order is a release, is there a problem?"
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3062.368,3062.951,No.
2007.06-1666,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3070.641,3071.157,Who says?
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3079.996,3092.654,"Because, Your Honor, we think that the district court can order, under 28 U.S.C. 2243, as law and justice requires, a release... or rather, relief that gives effect to the contours of the right."
2007.06-1666,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3092.654,3094.737,But... of course it can.
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3094.737,3095.354,Yes.
2007.06-1666,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3095.354,3096.189,"It can, but--"
2007.06-1666,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3096.189,3096.989,What--
2007.06-1666,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3096.989,3102.926,"It seems to me that you're begging... you're begging a question... you're inserting a premise that we have to decide, whether the release is unlawful."
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3116.519,3117.269,"Yes, you can."
2007.06-1666,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3126.625,3127.191,--All right.
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3132.529,3140.366,"--It... we would ask the district court to order precisely what the military already does, which is to remove a person to a safe place."
2007.06-1666,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3144.587,3147.122,"So Releasing at place A, not place B."
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3147.122,3147.955,--That's correct.
2007.06-1666,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3147.955,3151.157,"Don't push him out the gates; take him somewhere else, and then release him."
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3151.573,3152.107,Yes.
2007.06-1666,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3152.107,3152.423,Okay.
2007.06-1666,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3152.423,3153.223,And don't tell--
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3153.223,3153.64,That's the--
2007.06-1666,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3153.64,3156.125,--And don't tell the Iraqis where that's going to be?
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3156.125,3157.894,"--They don't do that now, Your Honor."
2007.06-1666,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3168.733,3170.835,"Well, that's within the executive's discretion."
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3192.298,3197.852,"--If the determination has already been made that the transfer would be unlawful, yes, we think that in law and equity they can do that."
2007.06-1666,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3197.852,3198.388,Okay.
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3227.138,3227.907,Yes.
2007.06-1666,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3237.679,3249.737,"Whether it does or does not, I just question whether habeas is an appropriate remedy in that situation, again because it's not concerned with the legality of transfer; it's concerned with the legality of custody."
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3249.737,3256.474,"Habeas has long been used to test the lawfulness, under the Fifth Amendment, of a proposed transfer."
2007.06-1666,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3256.474,3260.009,How can you say that the United States lacks the power to transfer?
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3269.082,3273.95,It... once the United States has the authority to--
2007.06-1666,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3273.95,3277.068,"A sergeant caught this guy, and he wants to turn him over to the Iraqis."
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3280.187,3283.806,--It may be the Constitution and the habeas statute could combine to prevent that.
2007.06-1666,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3283.806,3287.024,That applies to the sergeant in the city of--
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3287.024,3297.379,"As I said before, Your Honor... as I tried to say, and I apologize if I'm not being clear... there is a zone of military discretion where it may not be appropriate--"
2007.06-1666,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3297.379,3300.065,--Why isn't all of this within the zone of military discretion?
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3300.065,3306.671,--Because we filed this application more than a year after the United States made a decision to continue the detention.
2007.06-1666,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3319.729,3325.383,"So if you had filed it... if you had filed it six months rather than a year after, would there be habeas jurisdiction."
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3325.383,3326.816,"We think in six months, yes."
2007.06-1666,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3326.816,3328.585,You see where I'm going.
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3329.201,3332.137,"There may be some cases that become difficult, Your Honor."
2007.06-1666,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3333.154,3336.523,"The bright line is getting awfully fuzzy, as far as I'm concerned."
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3336.523,3343.843,"--Your Honor, in this case... in both cases, after two months they made the determination to continue to hold them in the MNFI tribunals."
2007.06-1666,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3347.045,3356.501,But it seems to me your statement is wildly overbroad: That there is a due-process restriction on release by the United States Government to another sovereign?
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3356.501,3356.985,Yes.
2007.06-1666,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3356.985,3361.405,"If we have an undercover agent in Japan who finds a drug dealer, he gives him to the Japanese police."
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3361.405,3362.005,Your Honor--
2007.06-1666,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3362.005,3363.341,I don't understand that.
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3365.574,3370.411,"--Your Honor, with all due respect, it has been the law for over a century in this country."
2007.06-1666,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3380.35,3385.17,You're talking about a transfer in what I assume you said was a zone of hostilities.
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3385.17,3386.404,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
2007.06-1666,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3386.404,3391.908,I thought you were talking about a transfer in an area that you say was engaged in active hostilities.
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3391.908,3393.508,"Your Honor, we--"
2007.06-1666,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3393.508,3395.443,Does that affect the decision at all?
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3395.443,3400.228,--It does not affect a citizen's due-process entitlement.
2007.06-1666,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3419.725,3421.258,But you've just said that it's unlawful.
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3432.033,3439.972,"Your Honor, just to finish the answer, the transfer may take place, but it may only take place as authorized by law."
2007.06-1666,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3460.366,3464.504,"Mr. Margulies, let me make sure there are no other questions."
2007.06-1666,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3464.504,3468.789,You need all that to win this case.
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3491.238,3491.838,Correct.
2007.06-1666,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3491.838,3497.308,"Well, you've been arguing for all sorts of things that seem far broader than that."
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3500.527,3505.164,"Your Honor, we... all of these other matters we do not need in order to prevail."
2007.06-1666,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3527.745,3530.53,"--Well, why do you say it has nothing to do with the war, then?"
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3542.337,3547.991,"Your Honor, this is what came up in Hamdi."
2007.06-1666,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3563.268,3564.803,I'm not arguing that.
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3576.843,3585.033,"Your Honor, we think that point is answered by the suggestion in Hamdi that you don't want to create a perverse incentive to keep people there."
2007.06-1666,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3599.959,3615.985,"One distinct difference in Munaf's case: He is undergoing a criminal process in Iraq, and Omar has also... it is alleged that he has committed offenses in Iraq."
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3623.591,3625.558,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
2007.06-1666,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3662.799,3663.933,"Thank you, Mr. Margulies."
2007.06-1666,3,31712,joseph_margulies,,3663.933,3664.568,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2007.06-1666,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3664.568,3667.187,"Mr. Garre, seven 9 minutes."
2007.06-1666,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3667.187,3671.055,"Mr. Garre, would you address this question at some point?"
2007.06-1666,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3696.789,3703.96,I think this court confronted a similar situation in the Padilla case a couple of years ago.
2007.06-1666,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3720.47,3724.005,Do you have a position on the answer to my question?
2007.06-1666,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3724.005,3727.576,--Whether the habeas court could direct that he be brought back to Portland?
2007.06-1666,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3727.576,3728.392,Yes.
2007.06-1666,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3728.392,3729.276,I think the habeas court would--
2007.06-1666,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3729.276,3734.08,"The habeas court says, look, it is not complete relief just to put him out on the street in Portland... in Maine."
2007.06-1666,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3739.883,3742.751,"--I would say probably not, Justice Souter."
2007.06-1666,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3776.223,3778.758,"I didn't see that in the injunction, itself."
2007.06-1666,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3781.21,3790.732,"--What the injunction says... and it is on page 59a... is that it bars... of the petition appendix in the Omar petition, the gray petition, and I am quoting now:"
2007.06-1666,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3823.369,3827.338,If one could go agree... let's say one could agree that was overbroad.
2007.06-1666,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3847.985,3852.02,--That would be a vast improvement over the injunction that was held by the court of appeals.
2007.06-1666,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3852.02,3853.403,But how about the rest of it?
2007.06-1666,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3853.403,3861.708,"And then you are dealt... you are left with the transfer, the injunction on the transfer to the Iraqi authorities in the event that Mr. Omar is convicted."
2007.06-1666,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3881.104,3885.722,"Well, I think it means the same thing that the point of my question was."
2007.06-1666,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3898.482,3910.539,"--Just to underscore the affront to the Iraqi sovereignty on this, his clients acknowledge that they can be arrested by Iraqi officials for crimes they allegedly committed in Iraq if they were released."
2007.06-1666,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3948.681,3950.364,Do you think an eight-hour lead is enough?
2007.06-1666,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3950.981,3951.616,"Well, I--"
2007.06-1666,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3951.616,3953.65,It would make a good movie.
2007.06-1666,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3953.65,3954.235,--Yes.
2007.06-1666,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3956.901,3971.947,"So we have a basic question: Is there habeas jurisdiction; and, as I understand the posture of this case, the Federal courts did not examine the merits of the habeas petition."
2007.06-1666,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3975.314,3976.364,That's true.
2007.06-1666,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4022.475,4030.045,"The the 20,000-plus people being retained, are they all in connection with security threats?"
2007.06-1666,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4033.914,4035.716,I think there are both.
2007.06-1666,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4064.949,4068.353,"Mr. Garre, is it the position of the government that this is a war zone?"
2007.06-1666,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4068.353,4073.722,It's... we don't take the position this is like a battlefield situation.
2007.06-1666,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4075.091,4079.043,Do you think any part of Iraq is like a battlefield situation?
2007.06-1666,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4079.043,4082.095,--Certainly there are active hostilities in parts of Iraq.
2007.06-1666,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4082.095,4084.363,Why isn't it a war zone?
2007.06-1666,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4084.363,4087.399,"Well, the occupation has ended."
2007.06-1666,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4098.707,4100.908,That means you haven't made your strongest argument.
2007.06-1666,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4100.908,4106.292,"--Well, if the Court believes that that's our strongest argument, certainly we don't have any objection to having you address it."
2007.06-1666,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4107.978,4114.566,But am I right to assume the underlying situation to be that of Hirota?
2007.06-1666,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4114.566,4118.018,That's jurisdictional.
2007.06-1666,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4118.018,4119.417,"Yes, but you see what I mean by that?"
2007.06-1666,4,25346,gregory_g_garre,,4147.953,4149.303,"That's correct, Justice Breyer."
2007.06-1666,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4149.303,4149.752,"Okay, thank you."
2007.06-1666,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4149.752,4150.988,"Thank you, Mr. Garre."
