1997.96-871,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.048,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 96-871, State Oil Company v. Barkat U. Khan and Khan & Associates."
1997.96-871,0,29039,john_baumgartner,,13.48,16.803,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-871,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,301.75,306.893,Are there some markets where freedom for the dealers is... is important?
1997.96-871,0,29039,john_baumgartner,,320.76,322.252,"Oh, yes, there are, Your Honor."
1997.96-871,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,322.252,330.768,"Is... is one of those instances so that dealers have the ability to switch to different manufacturers, different suppliers?"
1997.96-871,0,29039,john_baumgartner,,330.768,343.187,"Well, the dealer, until he's committed to a particular supplier or manufacturer, always has the ability to switch suppliers."
1997.96-871,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,343.187,347.979,"And... and is that... is that ability helpful to competition, do you think?"
1997.96-871,0,29039,john_baumgartner,,347.979,350.4,"Oh, yes, I think it is."
1997.96-871,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,356.293,367.711,"Do you suggest that that case, Sylvania, totally rejected any interest in the independence of the dealer, such as, for example, fixing minimum prices?"
1997.96-871,0,29039,john_baumgartner,,369.453,374.797,"I don't believe that minimum price fixing is at stake in this case, Your Honor."
1997.96-871,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,418.247,420.19,It doesn't really apply in this case?
1997.96-871,0,29039,john_baumgartner,,420.19,420.918,It does not apply.
1997.96-871,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,462.345,464.368,But recognized by whom?
1997.96-871,0,29039,john_baumgartner,,467.991,477.054,"--Even in the decision in Albrecht, Your Honor, the Court appears to recognize that there is a difference between maximum prices and minimum prices."
1997.96-871,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,480.707,485.87,I think we can all stipulate that there's a difference between maximum prices and minimum prices.
1997.96-871,0,29039,john_baumgartner,,494.857,497.962,I know of no legal--
1997.96-871,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,497.962,498.059,"That's not what you're saying, though?"
1997.96-871,0,29039,john_baumgartner,,498.059,498.47,--No.
1997.96-871,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,527.418,532.504,Pro... pro-competitive because it precludes exploitation of... of exclusive territories.
1997.96-871,0,29039,john_baumgartner,,535.576,536.207,Yes.
1997.96-871,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,599.877,602.919,That's really your burden.
1997.96-871,0,29039,john_baumgartner,,652.181,653.724,I--
1997.96-871,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,653.724,660.456,"So you... can you persuade us that that's the case, that it's more... it's more likely to be good than bad?"
1997.96-871,0,29039,john_baumgartner,,660.456,662.288,"--I believe I can, Your Honor."
1997.96-871,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,687.413,704.905,"Well, your opponent here... your opponent here claims that one situation is where... where the... the maximum price on... on one line, high octane gas, prevents him from charging a lower price on another line."
1997.96-871,0,29039,john_baumgartner,,728.35,734.016,"Well, it benefits the consumers who buy low octane and hurts the consumers who buy high octane."
1997.96-871,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,773.66,777.393,"Mr. Baumgartner, are you right when you say there's no evidence?"
1997.96-871,0,29039,john_baumgartner,,781.685,791.573,"It was alleged that the receiver increased the price of premium gasoline and reduced the price of regular gasoline, yes."
1997.96-871,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,825.995,840.076,"Although you said you can't think of any example in which a... a supplier's control over the maximum price the... the retailer could sell would ever be anti-competitive, you don't really have to go that far to win."
1997.96-871,0,29039,john_baumgartner,,853.934,855.223,I agree.
1997.96-871,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,861.838,866.673,"But... but your view is that it happens so rarely that you shouldn't have a per se rule... you should have a rule of reasoned approached, rather than per se?"
1997.96-871,0,29039,john_baumgartner,,866.673,872.166,"--There are other situations, but they are illegal under other rules."
1997.96-871,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,884.753,886.165,"Very well, Mr. Baumgartner."
1997.96-871,0,29039,john_baumgartner,,886.165,886.926,Thank you.
1997.96-871,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,886.926,888.959,"Mr. Klein, we'll hear from you."
1997.96-871,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,888.959,901.618,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-871,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1001.232,1011.087,"Mr. Klein, we have a brief here from 33 States and the Territory of Guam, saying don't get rid of Albrecht."
1997.96-871,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1018.423,1019.475,I'd be... I'd be delighted to.
1997.96-871,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1161.706,1162.247,You can't have what?
1997.96-871,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1162.247,1162.727,Waiters.
1997.96-871,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1162.727,1163.598,Waiters?
1997.96-871,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1163.598,1165.389,In a fast-food restaurant.
1997.96-871,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1284.306,1310.894,"Is... is one of the States' concerns that if you change the per se rule, then price, for maximum prices, becomes a legitimate subject of a day-to-day discussion between the manufacturer and his dealers, and that this will create a climate in which minimum pricing and price-fixing of the anti-competitive sort might go on, and that it's more difficult, then, for the States to enforce?"
1997.96-871,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1335.601,1337.531,I don't... I... I don't think it's... it may be the States' concern.
1997.96-871,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1382.191,1386.412,"Mr. Klein, what about the principle of stare decisis here?"
1997.96-871,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1397.71,1399.813,"I think that that's right, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.96-871,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1611.582,1614.755,"Well, but of... of what use is congressional reaction if it doesn't become a law?"
1997.96-871,1,31305,joel_i_klein,,1614.755,1616.776,It... it... it... I only point to it.
1997.96-871,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1654.933,1656.363,"Thank you, Mr. Klein."
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,1658.894,1664.798,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1997.96-871,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1738.408,1750.944,"I guess their answer is that, basically, the only time that a manufacturer would want to do such a thing... not... not 100 percent, but the vast... would be in an instance where interbrand competition was not working perfectly."
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,1761.592,1774.24,"In 30 years, since Albrecht was adopted, what I'm looking for and I don't see in this record or in the literature is any breakdown of interbrand competition controlling retailers."
1997.96-871,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1862.717,1865.441,"Sorry, I thought you were talking about intrabrand."
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,1866.471,1867.102,--Interbrand.
1997.96-871,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1867.102,1871.486,"Oh, well, the reason that they worried is that they have some market power in there, in their product."
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,1879.46,1880.872,Again--
1997.96-871,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1880.872,1883.994,"And that's the basic argument, which I guess you have to deal with in this."
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,1883.994,1884.835,"--No, I understand that, Your Honor."
1997.96-871,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1884.835,1886.256,I'm sorry I misunderstood inter for intra.
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,1886.256,1895.431,"No, what... what I'm saying is that in a situation... the best way of dealing with that market power is to use the... the per se rule, coupled with antitrust injury."
1997.96-871,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1956.6,1958.744,But surely... surely the effect was precisely the same.
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,1971.04,1972.052,"--No, I--"
1997.96-871,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2006.984,2008.877,What... what's... what's the antitrust injury?
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2012.507,2028.749,"The consumer was harmed here because the price which was in fact set, the mechanism... the restraining mechanism... the margin restraint, affected both a maximum price on some products as well as the minimum price on other products."
1997.96-871,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2059.571,2063.199,Why does he ever... why does he ever have an incentive to lower the price?
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2078.9,2084.636,"Your Honor, with all due respect, the receiver behaved exactly that way after Mr. Khan was out."
1997.96-871,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2111.753,2112.224,Excuse me.
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2116.165,2116.535,--No.
1997.96-871,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2117.026,2120.448,--or more regular were... more people came to buy regular?
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2120.448,2126.563,"--Your Honor, with all... with... based on the record we have, all we know is that there was more regular gasoline sold."
1997.96-871,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2126.563,2126.853,Okay.
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2154.53,2155.111,"No, Your Honor."
1997.96-871,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2179.698,2180.068,Right.
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2180.068,2188.733,"--but, at the same token, add to his profit by charging a... what the market allows him to charge as a competitive price on another grade of gasoline."
1997.96-871,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2188.733,2197.138,But he ought to lower the price of his regular no matter what the price of his premium is if lowering the price of the regular will... will increase his profits.
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2207.464,2211.108,"The incentive that any dealer has is to stay in business, Your Honor."
1997.96-871,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2211.108,2213.378,No; it's to make as much money as he can.
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2213.378,2217.742,"And if he... if, by lowering price, he cannot make enough money to stay in business--"
1997.96-871,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2217.742,2218.173,No.
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2232.511,2233.981,"--Your Honor, no, I don't believe it is."
1997.96-871,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2252.434,2258.619,This is intelligent behavior only for somebody whose whole objective in running a gas station is barely to stay in business.
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2273.028,2273.929,And it is also the--
1997.96-871,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2273.929,2275.869,But I don't know anybody who has that objective.
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2276.811,2278.861,"--Your Honor, he must make money."
1997.96-871,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2353.02,2356.352,The 3.25 limit did not apply to premium?
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2356.352,2359.174,--The 3.25 limit applied to all grades of gasoline.
1997.96-871,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2359.174,2361.145,All grades... all grades of gas?
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2361.145,2362.196,All grades of gasoline.
1997.96-871,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2362.196,2362.727,I see.
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2362.727,2364.247,He was restricted with that margin.
1997.96-871,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2369.851,2381.628,"If... if I understand your response to Justice Scalia, it would be that lowering the price of the cheap grade will make him more money, but not for a year or two."
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2393.837,2396.36,That would certainly be rational thinking on their part.
1997.96-871,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2396.36,2396.741,Is that your argument?
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2396.741,2397.4,Yes.
1997.96-871,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2397.76,2398.211,All right.
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2445.532,2458.801,"The argument can always be made by a monopolist with market power that they're... what they're trying to do is shift pricing around so that, at one point, they in fact lower price."
1997.96-871,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2525.256,2527.038,But it apparently doesn't work here.
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2539.638,2549.392,"The answer, Your Honor, is that in the given conditions, the price that was prevailing in the marketplace must have allowed him to make additional margins."
1997.96-871,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2549.392,2552.143,That is to say there was no interbrand competition.
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2552.143,2554.637,"No, I... I disagree with that, Your Honor, with all due respect."
1997.96-871,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2565.864,2575.94,"Well, is it your position that the market for the premium gas allow... generally allowed for a margin of more than 3.25 cents, where it's just 3.25 on the regular?"
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2575.94,2577.402,--Or... or--
1997.96-871,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2577.402,2583.466,"And that... in other words, the difference in product was... should have dictated a difference in margin, and that's what he was trying to take advantage of?"
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2583.466,2584.686,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-871,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2640.642,2650.349,"Well, of course, the consequence of that normally would be that you would get a larger share of the premium sales, if your margin is less, and you... you'd be un... underpricing your competitors on... on premium."
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2650.349,2653.691,--You... you might receive some additional--
1997.96-871,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2653.691,2656.503,"Unless, as you say, all premium buyers are stupid."
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2656.503,2659.364,"--Well, not necessarily stupid; less price elastic."
1997.96-871,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2659.364,2660.105,They don't... they don't... yeah.
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2660.105,2663.639,"Demand being, in that market, a little different, the elasticities of demand being different."
1997.96-871,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2684.682,2690.697,"Well, free market forces are ordinarily reflected in contracts, which your client signed with State Oil."
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2690.697,2697.4,"There was a contract that was... was signed with State Oil, in which he agreed... that's how we actually get in... under Section 1 here, Your Honor."
1997.96-871,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2793.795,2799.668,"Well, I don't see that any of that argument means you couldn't reach the right result under the rule of reason."
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2804.38,2818.221,"--The rule of reason analysis requires proofs of market power, quite honestly, which would exclude almost every single petroleum market case that you're faced with, as well as others."
1997.96-871,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2832.541,2833.332,Excuse me.
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2838.354,2838.975,--No.
1997.96-871,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2847.229,2854.633,"Well, that's a... that's a com... I... I think we've said that... that the antitrust law is not there to protect merchants; it's there to protect consumers."
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2854.633,2855.784,In every ca--
1997.96-871,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2855.784,2859.188,And that's why I keep looking for some consumer who has been hurt by this.
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2882.923,2886.513,--He made some additional volume... he made volume.
1997.96-871,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2892.247,2901.433,"Is there any... anything in the record to the contrary, that... that he did not increase his profitability by selling more of the regular at a lower price?"

1997.96-871,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2902.485,2904.067,Do... do we know that he... he lost money on it?
1997.96-871,2,15802,anthony_s_divincenzo,,2904.067,2904.488,--No.
1997.96-871,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2918.207,2919.699,"Thank you, Mr. DiVincenzo."
1997.96-871,3,37993,pamela_j_harbour,,2923.999,2933.977,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-871,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2978.606,2980.567,"Ms. Harbour, how... how extensive is that experience?"
1997.96-871,3,37993,pamela_j_harbour,,2983.479,2989.563,"--Your Honor, there are... there was a characterization game that was going on here."
1997.96-871,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3006.604,3008.106,So were there prosecutions brought?
1997.96-871,3,37993,pamela_j_harbour,,3022.034,3027.327,"As I said, there are elements of maximum price-fixing in the cases that we brought."
1997.96-871,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3029.758,3030.099,What cases are they?
1997.96-871,3,37993,pamela_j_harbour,,3030.099,3032.452,--The Minolta case.
1997.96-871,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3060.138,3064.182,"You found that they were minimum pricing cases, not maximum pricing cases."
1997.96-871,3,37993,pamela_j_harbour,,3084.486,3085.307,"--Understood, Your Honor."
1997.96-871,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3090.57,3099.204,The... the reason that I think that's awfully important is because what you're basically doing is you're taking the position that consumers should have to pay more money for gasoline.
1997.96-871,3,37993,pamela_j_harbour,,3141.864,3157.242,"--Your Honor, basically, the argument being advanced today by the Petitioners is that manufacturers, like State Oil, should be free to restrain the exercise of monopoly power by their dealers who have been granted exclusive territories."
1997.96-871,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3168.78,3170.162,That's quite a good point.
1997.96-871,3,37993,pamela_j_harbour,,3205.044,3211.399,The rule of reason is not the rule for a price-fixing case or any agreement on price.
1997.96-871,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3294.613,3295.533,"Gee, is that our law?"
1997.96-871,3,37993,pamela_j_harbour,,3315.897,3317.958,As... as the holding--
1997.96-871,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3317.958,3319.057,Just one territory?
1997.96-871,3,37993,pamela_j_harbour,,3319.057,3329.035,--Intrabrand competition... restraints on intrabrand competition will only be tolerated when they stimulated interbrand competition.
1997.96-871,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3329.035,3331.907,Within the particular territory or overall?
1997.96-871,3,37993,pamela_j_harbour,,3347.026,3349.848,When... I'm talking about a... a monopolist.
1997.96-871,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3354.913,3359.566,"I wasn't aware we... we had held that, but you think that's the law?"
1997.96-871,3,37993,pamela_j_harbour,,3359.566,3362.587,"Your Honor, if... if I have mischaracterized that, forgive me."
1997.96-871,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3410.359,3416.494,Then why was it... Dr. Miles was 1911 and Albrecht wasn't until the sixties.
1997.96-871,3,37993,pamela_j_harbour,,3427.092,3428.301,"--Actually, it didn't, Your Honor."
1997.96-871,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3456.331,3460.023,"Well, that may be, but they're arguing for a very basic distinction."
1997.96-871,3,37993,pamela_j_harbour,,3488.02,3488.751,Yes.
1997.96-871,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3509.235,3513.519,Can't you use suggested retail prices for that purpose just as effectively?
1997.96-871,3,37993,pamela_j_harbour,,3513.519,3516.09,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1997.96-871,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3516.09,3520.101,Why can't you use suggested retail prices for that purpose just as effectively?
1997.96-871,3,37993,pamela_j_harbour,,3520.101,3521.183,"Well, in fact, that is--"
1997.96-871,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3521.183,3524.425,"I mean, if... if you're trying to get a de facto minimum."
1997.96-871,3,37993,pamela_j_harbour,,3524.425,3535.141,--I believe that that suggestion by Your Honor is an alternative that can be used instead of the price ceiling.
1997.96-871,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3545.389,3545.709,"Thank you, Ms. Harbour."
1997.96-871,3,37993,pamela_j_harbour,,3546.678,3547.299,You're welcome.
1997.96-871,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3547.299,3549.643,"Mr. Baumgartner, you have 1 minute remaining."
1997.96-871,4,29039,john_baumgartner,,3549.643,3552.725,"We have nothing further, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.96-871,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3552.725,3554.575,"Very well, the case is submitted."
