1958.414,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,10.087,"Number 414, Union Pacific Railroad Company versus L. L. Price."
1958.414,0,33599,james_a_wilcox,,11.151,16.585,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1958.414,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,121.034,122.35,What is a “swing brakeman”?
1958.414,0,33599,james_a_wilcox,,122.35,133.791,"A swing brakeman, sir, is a brakeman that is required we say in the railroad industry unnecessarily but it's required under the state law, the -- the extra brakeman."
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1555.239,1561.11,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1958.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1592.651,1593.221,"Now, let's see."
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1597.547,1598.595,"Yes, Your Honor, that's our position."
1958.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1598.595,1605.897,"If he loses before the Board, he may nevertheless, relitigate the issue of discharge in an action for his --"
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1605.897,1606.622,That's --
1958.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1606.622,1607.398,That's your position.
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1607.398,1608.972,That's our first position.
1958.414,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1702.746,1708.777,That question -- that question maybe in contrast but there are -- there are not --
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1708.777,1710.247,That is true.
1958.414,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1710.247,1714.011,"Mr. Lionel, may I ask you if you please."
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1725.441,1727.901,"Yes, Mr. Justice Whittaker, they are."
1958.414,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1727.901,1734.781,-- there were facts that were cited by Price itself in his claim.
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1734.781,1736.132,Precisely.
1958.414,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1736.132,1742.944,"-- thus showing, actually, that he had been instructed to do one thing but did another."
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1742.944,1746.053,"That, we will dispute, that is so."
1958.414,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1932.388,1940.643,"Before you go into cases, is your theory that in the second sentence of this case, there really was no proceeding for the Board."
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1940.643,1944.481,"No, there was a proceeding but no determination upon the merits."
1958.414,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1944.481,1945.781,"Well, that's --"
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1945.781,1948.622,That there was a complete misconstruction of his submission.
1958.414,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1949.128,1950.866,"That's the second -- that's the second, right."
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1950.866,1953.688,Second -- second yes.
1958.414,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1953.688,1956.485,You start out by saying that there's no doubt about it.
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1961.657,1963.384,Exactly.
1958.414,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1963.384,1969.684,"And you know now narrated again what took place before the Board, didn't you?"
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1969.684,1970.443,"Yes, sir."
1958.414,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1970.443,1982.378,And therefore I ask you whether you claim that in fact there was no legally significant proceeding before the Board and therefore you emphasize Moore's position.
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,1983.007,1983.265,No.
1958.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1996.849,2002.335,"Well, don't you really go this far Mr. Lionel, I thought I understood this from your answer to me earlier."
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2042.711,2063.053,"Except for one thing, Mr. Justice Brennan and that is there could not have been any possible opportunity for a full litigation of the facts in that priority case because under the procedure before the Board, they apparently just had the transcript up there and this particular case -- there was no oral argument of any kind."
1958.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2068.543,2070.489,Well isn't that -- isn't that the usual practice before --
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2070.489,2071.664,That is the usual practice.
1958.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2071.664,2073.578,"In other words, there are no formal hearings about the --"
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2073.578,2073.817,No form --
1958.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2073.817,2075.007,-- Adjustment Board proceedings --
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2075.007,2075.882,-- that's correct.
1958.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2075.882,2079.922,"Well, I'm not it in the sense of the fullest kind of hearing that is --"
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2079.922,2081.447,Available within the purview of the Railway --
1958.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2081.447,2081.989,Yes.
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2081.989,2082.511,-- Labor Act.
1958.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2082.965,2095.539,"And that the determination going against him, having been determined on the merits that he was properly discharged then he may litigate over again in an independent action in the courts."
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2095.539,2097.475,That's my first position.
1958.414,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2113.742,2119.809,But I'd like to know why -- the why of your answer to Justice Brennan.
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2130.905,2140.472,"In substance, I am saying that the relief -- the administrative remedy granted by the Act does not preclude a subsequent court action."
1958.414,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2140.472,2146.537,And this has nothing to do with the fact that he didn't get the kind of a hearing you should have done and --
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2146.537,2154.828,"Well, that is one of the reasons we -- I -- it's my view that he should not be deprived of this common-law remedy because -- I'm sorry --"
1958.414,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2154.828,2159.838,But not -- not the terms of the circumstances in this particular case.
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2167.763,2169.665,"No, not on my first point."
1958.414,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2169.665,2177.112,"It's not on your first point, you stick to that for a moment but you say because those are the kind of things that happened before the Board."
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2179.417,2181.013,Precisely.
1958.414,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2181.013,2191.608,"Now, Mr. Lionel, you say, the search for an administrative remedy does not preclude an action of law."
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2205.621,2206.941,I would say --
1958.414,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2206.941,2210.522,-- damage reputation or something like that?
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2210.522,2211.728,I say yes.
1958.414,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2216.074,2224.368,"So even if he had succeeded in this administrative remedy and the admin -- and the administrative body, the Board had given him all that it could give and all that he asked."
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2228.827,2236.719,"Well, let me say that if it granted him reinstatement and back pay that he accepted that then we certainly would have another question presented that if -- if he --"
1958.414,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2236.719,2237.838,That's not in this case --
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2237.838,2241.886,"-- if he remained an employee, he certainly would not be in the Moore situation."
1958.414,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2244.412,2263.445,"But suppose -- suppose they say yes he can stay with his job, give him a money award that he deems insufficient, the one (Inaudible) and he rejects that."
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2265.879,2266.342,Yes.
1958.414,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2266.342,2268.135,What he deems to be is right.
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2268.135,2272.456,I think it's not at present but I think that may be not necessarily concomitant of my theory.
1958.414,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2272.456,2273.188,Pardon me.
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2273.188,2275.51,I think that would possibly follow.
1958.414,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2275.51,2275.993,Yes.
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2275.993,2278.066,Possibly follow.
1958.414,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2323.609,2335.89,"May I suggest that giving prima facie way to defining the Board, it's inconsistent when saying there's a trial de novo."
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2344.139,2349.144,"Well, it's the old question of what is -- how much -- how loaded is your presumption or findings."
1958.414,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2349.144,2352.503,-- (Voice Overlap) all I'm saying is that it isn't de novo.
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2352.503,2363.346,"We have a case here, the Dober case in the Third Circuit which I quote in my brief here where employees sought seniority rights under their collective agreement."
1958.414,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2482.597,2504.232,"Is there no difference in your mind between starting a proceeding and having action by the Board -- and not starting a proceeding and having action before the Board -- was it a saying, can you take or block out a sentence like that in a situation in which you didn't have in which there was a vital difference and if there is between your case in that field?"
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2504.232,2513.999,"But I -- I think in this Moore case, there was a -- a very close examination made of the legislative intent."
1958.414,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2538.345,2548.793,That was where -- where a common-law right was invoked and not where the machinery of the Board was taught to be utilized and (Inaudible).
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2593.439,2603.261,"Well, that I have -- I -- I incur Mr. Justice Frankfurter with that, but I think here is a case we are talking only about an individual."
1958.414,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2626.591,2634.648,It wasn't taken away from (Voice Overlap) he didn't exercise it until after he didn't get what he wanted from the Board.
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2644.78,2649.749,"Well, Moore said there was not -- that there was nothing in the act even attempting to take it away from the courts --"
1958.414,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2649.749,2650.475,That's right.
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2650.475,2652.009,-- the power from the courts.
1958.414,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2690.3,2696.832,"-- doctrine of the election of remedies doesn't require that a statute should provide for it, does it?"
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2696.832,2728.184,"Well, apparently Congress felt it necessary in that case and that was enacted long before the 1934 amendments came into being but -- and I certainly, in Mr. Justice Black's language in that United States versus the Interstate Commerce Commission, I think it -- this Court there indicated that the administrative finality of a decision by the Board was out of harmony with the general legislative pattern."
1958.414,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2735.309,2739.186,"Now, that -- that opinion and very frankly, I've never read it."
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2748.927,2750.533,That's correct.
1958.414,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2750.533,2754.833,"And as you stated at the very outset, that is not this case, is that right?"
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2754.833,2756.044,That -- that is correct.
1958.414,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2768.162,2779.494,"Well, the question of reviewability of a negative money award by the Adjustment Board is -- is an interesting issue but one certainly is not -- not present in this case, is that true?"
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2779.494,2789.986,Right.
1958.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2830.713,2837.146,"Mr. Lionel, was there in this case any question of interpretation of this clause (Inaudible)"
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2837.146,2837.944,I think not.
1958.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2851.085,2855.435,You mean whether the submission involved a question of interpretation?
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2855.435,2855.881,No.
1958.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2868.659,2874.651,"Well, was a question of interpretation involved in this common-law action?"
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2874.651,2877.958,"Well, actually, no."
1958.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2896.668,2904.872,Didn't that -- didn't that involve a consideration of the meaning of that clause in the collective bargaining agreement?
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2904.872,2909.065,"Well, I -- I can't."
1958.414,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2928.356,2939.235,(Inaudible)
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2939.235,2941.479,That is so.
1958.414,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2945.505,2953.982,(Inaudible)
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2953.982,2954.984,Yes.
1958.414,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2964.981,2993.183,(Inaudible)
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,2993.183,3001.421,The -- the law says that they shall make an award shall have finding -- and may make findings.
1958.414,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3001.421,3002.088,May make.
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,3002.088,3003.998,Yes.
1958.414,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3003.998,3006.974,May I ask you?
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,3021.884,3031.033,"In that case, before the Board, the claim could only be, I believe, for lost wages and also reinstatement."
1958.414,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3039.234,3049.469,"What did you alleged in this complaint that the discharge was based on -- I've just read it, what's the charge?"
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,3049.469,3050.238,In the complaint?
1958.414,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3050.238,3051.397,Yes.
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,3051.397,3058.085,I charge that it was in affecting violation of the agreement I believe.
1958.414,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3058.085,3058.493,All right.
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,3076.123,3078.008,Probably no difference in that point assuming --
1958.414,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3078.008,3087.035,I don't -- that's why I don't quite understand your -- the distinction you've been drawing about a common-law suit and so forth.
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,3087.035,3087.658,Well --
1958.414,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3087.658,3107.928,What would it be for the suit for the wrongful discharge with the right to trial and with the added right on your part to have the benefit of a prima facie proof like a man would have if he's charged -- he's been killed and he said it was an accident and he has a presumption in his favor.
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,3120.248,3123.854,"In evidentiary standpoint, I would say nothing.I would say the same evidence would probably --"
1958.414,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3123.854,3123.942,"Well, what would you have to allege?"
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,3123.942,3125.416,-- admit except that it (Voice Overlap) --
1958.414,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3125.416,3127.6,What would you have to allege?
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,3127.6,3130.71,In the case where I'm trying to enforce the award?
1958.414,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3130.71,3131.523,Yes.
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,3131.523,3138.701,"In that case, I of course would allege the prior procedure before the Board, its findings and --"
1958.414,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3138.701,3140.992,You will do that to get the benefit of your presumption.
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,3140.992,3141.82,"Yes, sir."
1958.414,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3141.82,3146.825,Would -- wouldn't you have to allege if you've been wrongfully discharged?
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,3146.825,3146.95,I --
1958.414,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3146.95,3156.401,"How could you have a lawsuit for being wrongfully discharged without alleging you're wrongfully discharged, even to enforcing that it has given you an award?"
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,3156.401,3161.766,"Well, it would have to be alleged, yes, sir."
1958.414,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3161.766,3163.62,I -- I didn't quite understand that.
1958.414,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3168.135,3171.03,"Now, that enforcement proceeding have been quoted to the District Court, isn't it?"
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,3171.03,3172.007,That's correct sir.
1958.414,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3172.007,3180.081,"Well, would you have to do more than allege that you'd receive an award, this was it, and the railroad had not abated?"
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,3180.081,3191.243,All -- all I know is that the Section 3 of these three first says that you shall bring an action and that the finding shall be prima facie evidence and that there shall be a suit de novo.

1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,3207.797,3209.098,The answer to that is no.
1958.414,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3209.098,3210.398,Are you bound to get less?
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,3215.423,3219.436,I would assume if it's an enforcement suit that you're probably limited by what the --
1958.414,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3219.436,3221.479,Does the Act say that?
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,3221.479,3224.558,"I don't believe so, but as I pointed out a few moment --"
1958.414,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3224.558,3232.782,Gives you an action does it not to enforce something -- enforce something which has been done and what you allege is a wrongful discharge.
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,3232.782,3234.332,That's right.
1958.414,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3234.332,3252.904,And makes certain -- prima facie certain findings -- what else does it do besides that in the Act -- language of the Act so far as that lawsuit is concerned?
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,3252.904,3263.565,"Well, it said the suit shall proceed in all respects as other suits except that on a trial of such suit, the findings in order."
1958.414,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3263.565,3266.998,What do you think it means by other suits?
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,3266.998,3271.091,"Well, that -- that would be say a common-law action for wrongful discharge."
1958.414,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3272.43,3282.613,"You sue him -- you sue him because (Inaudible) because of that, he was wrongfully discharged and they could say in addition to see it exactly as other suits?"
1958.414,1,41666,samuel_s_lionel,,3282.613,3283.135,"Yes, sir."
1958.414,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3283.135,3290.357,Except that you can also certain finding as prima facie evidence as anything else takes away from there.
