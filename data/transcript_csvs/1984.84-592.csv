1984.84-592,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.856,We will hear arguments first this morning in Norman Williams and Susan Levine v. Vermont.
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,16.121,18.072,Thank you.
1984.84-592,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,136.189,154.702,"Mr. Williams, I was going to inquire whether it isn't the case that Illinois and New York laws exempt Vermont residents from payment of the sales tax if they leave Vermont and buy the vehicle in Illinois or New York?"
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,154.702,156.244,"No, they don't."
1984.84-592,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,219.656,231.424,"You say the proper basis for comparison here is not the Vermont resident who stays for two or three weeks in New York or Illinois, but the one who stays for the longer... three, three month or longer period?"
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,231.424,242.03,"Well, the person who stays longer than two or three weeks, just like the Appellants stayed longer than two or three weeks after they bought their cars in Illinois and New York."
1984.84-592,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,242.03,245.743,But are there any... does the record show there are any such Vermont residents?
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,245.743,250.515,There's no record in this case because it comes up on a motion to dismiss.
1984.84-592,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,250.515,257.951,What if the facts were that there were no Vermont residents who ever stayed more than three months in Illinois and also bought a car there?
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,262.145,266.497,"I think we have to assume it, because it's a motion to dismiss."
1984.84-592,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,300.908,307.713,"Mr. Williams, you're the Illinois one, rather than the New York one in this case?"
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,307.713,308.334,That's correct.
1984.84-592,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,308.334,313.998,"Could it be said that your real argument is not with Vermont, but with Illinois?"
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,313.998,315.578,I don't think it could--
1984.84-592,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,315.578,320.821,"Which, after all, doesn't grant you a refund even though you're out there just a short time."
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,331.58,333.279,--I have no problem with Illinois.
1984.84-592,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,364.981,368.982,What do you mean when you say residents of Vermont don't pay Vermont anything?
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,368.982,386.654,"A resident who purchases a car in another state and pays a tax to another state, like me, pays Vermont nothing because that resident gets the credit for the taxes paid in the other state which I do not get."
1984.84-592,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,417.184,424.698,"Mr. Williams, let me try to clarify this thing in my own mind a little bit further."
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,447.745,459.453,--The statute says... the statute plainly says that any Vermont resident who purchases a car in another state and pays a tax in another state is entitled to a credit.
1984.84-592,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,508.844,519.38,"Actually, the discrimination you complain of occurs after you're a resident of Vermont."
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,525.864,527.567,"Well, that's certainly one way to--"
1984.84-592,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,527.567,530.697,"Well, that's your basis for your equal protection argument."
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,530.697,531.338,--Right.
1984.84-592,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,533.759,539.235,But there's no rational basis for differentiating between these two kinds of residents.
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,539.235,540.915,Right.
1984.84-592,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,557.037,562.379,How likely is it that a nonresident would seek to register a car in New York... or in Vermont?
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,562.379,564.1,"Well, I think that it does happen."
1984.84-592,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,580.231,581.731,Rather than in their home state?
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,581.731,582.342,Yes.
1984.84-592,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,583.664,585.154,"Well, that isn't your case, though?"
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,585.154,586.866,--It's not my case at all; no.
1984.84-592,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,601.903,613.864,"Well, Mr. Williams, doesn't each state in which a vehicle is used have a legitimate interest in imposing taxes for the benefit of the roads in the state in which the vehicle is used?"
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,613.864,614.993,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1984.84-592,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,628.762,631.584,"Of course, even if you win, you may not win."
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,640.64,643.621,"Well, that would be one way to cure the equal protection claim."
1984.84-592,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,720.162,729.558,"Well, Mr. Williams, is it your claim that the vehicle that you purchased when you did not live in Vermont was never used outside the State of Vermont?"
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,729.558,730.73,No.
1984.84-592,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,732.89,734.861,So the vehicle was used elsewhere?
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,734.861,735.943,"--Yes, it was."
1984.84-592,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,735.943,743.827,And you think somehow it's wrong that each state can charge taxes for the use of the vehicle while in that state?
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,743.827,744.518,No.
1984.84-592,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,786.325,791.649,"Maybe this is way out in left field, but how many people are in the same position you're in--"
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,791.649,793.822,--I--
1984.84-592,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,793.822,795.372,--would you estimate?
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,795.372,806.067,"--I checked the census, and it appears to me that about 14,000 people are moving to Vermont every year."
1984.84-592,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,907.916,913.549,"Mr. Williams, did you have to pay a sales tax in Illinois when you bought your car?"
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,913.549,913.98,--Yes.
1984.84-592,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,915.98,920.184,Would a Vermont resident buying a car in Illinois have to pay a sales tax?
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,920.184,926.285,"Yes, if that Vermont resident stayed longer than the two or three-week minimum required by--"
1984.84-592,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,926.285,927.647,Suppose he didn't.
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,930.589,932.419,--Then he would have a choice.
1984.84-592,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,932.419,933.26,He would have a what?
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,933.26,937.494,"He would have a choice, I think, about whether to pay Illinois or wait until he got back to Vermont."
1984.84-592,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,937.494,940.236,So he need not pay a sales tax?
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,940.236,945.419,That's right; if he left within two weeks he need not pay a sales tax.
1984.84-592,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,949.553,956.616,Then the differentiation between the Illinois resident and the Vermont resident buying a car in Illinois is not so great after all.
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,956.616,958.917,"Yes, that's right."
1984.84-592,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,989.208,990.95,"Well, suppose he didn't use it in Illinois at all."
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,999.706,1001.486,That's right.
1984.84-592,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1029.084,1031.886,"Well, whatever you were, you were a resident of Illinois."
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,1031.886,1035.098,--I paid a tax to Illinois.
1984.84-592,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1041.761,1044.583,Where did you live for the five years before you moved to Vermont?
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,1044.583,1049.798,"--I lived in Paris, France."
1984.84-592,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1049.798,1050.806,Where?
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,1050.806,1052.008,"I lived in Paris, France."
1984.84-592,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1052.579,1053.06,In where?
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,1053.06,1054.98,In France.
1984.84-592,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1061.736,1063.717,Is this when you worked for Cudare Brothers?
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,1063.717,1065.607,That's right.
1984.84-592,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1065.607,1075.875,What would have happened if the dealer in Illinois had arranged to have some person drive the car to Vermont and deliver it to you there?
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,1077.886,1083.98,If I had lived in Vermont when I ordered the car?
1984.84-592,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1117.432,1120.745,I guess we have no way of finding out.
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,1148.672,1156.827,"Well, as you say it's not... I the record I suggested some examples."
1984.84-592,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1171.976,1176.009,Apparently the legislature thought it happened often enough to provide for the exemption.
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,1176.009,1176.811,Right.
1984.84-592,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1176.811,1177.94,For the deduction.
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,1177.94,1179.462,Right.
1984.84-592,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1179.462,1184.074,Is it that group of people are the only ones who qualify for the exemption?
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,1184.074,1189.2,Any Vermont resident who pays a tax to another state qualifies for the exemption.
1984.84-592,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1189.2,1197.023,"So I mean the legislature apparently, as Justice White says, thought there were enough people in that category to justify creating a special exemption for them."
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,1197.023,1198.265,Exactly.
1984.84-592,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1262.267,1276.976,"Well, but your incentive would perhaps still be to buy the car in Illinois because the Vermont tax is based on the used value rather than the sales value."
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,1297.189,1300.371,I'm not sure I agree with that.
1984.84-592,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1335.015,1346.942,"Well, as long as there's a reciprocal arrangement, then for your commerce clause analysis it seems to me that the only incentive is just to delay the purchase until you've made your move."
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,1346.942,1348.565,"That's right, and move--"
1984.84-592,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1348.565,1353.818,But it has nothing to do with where you make your purchase as long as there's this reciprocal arrangement.
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,1353.818,1361.693,"--Well, that's right, except that it would certainly be convenient, once I had moved to Vermont, to buy in Vermont."
1984.84-592,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1364.815,1387.959,"Mr. Williams, I guess it's 50 years ago now that in Silas Mason, Justice Cardozo said this: A state, for many purposes, is to be reckoned as a self-contained unit which may frame its own system of burdens and exceptions without heeding systems elsewhere."
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,1404.081,1406.952,That's certainly what happened to me.
1984.84-592,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1407.593,1409.224,"Well, I'm just wondering."
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,1413.157,1414.527,Yes.
1984.84-592,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1418.63,1420.952,What's the closest we've come to it?
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,1420.952,1433.169,"--Well, I know that there are members of this Court who feel that Henneford may have even decided that issue, but I don't--"
1984.84-592,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1433.169,1434.752,That's what I was--
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,1434.752,1437.032,--I don't think so at least.
1984.84-592,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1522.418,1533.095,--And that burdens commerce because it discourages buying in Illinois in favor of buying in Vermont?
1984.84-592,0,37341,norman_charles_williams,,1533.095,1533.696,Yes.
1984.84-592,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1587.761,1591.532,Mr. Eschen.
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,1591.532,1603.079,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, in 1978 Susan Levine, one of the Appellants in this case, purchased a brand new 1979 Chrysler Horizon in New York State."
1984.84-592,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1674.015,1679.13,"Mr. Eschen, you refer to the tax as kind of a fee for the use of the roads."
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,1682.072,1683.081,"That's correct, Your--"
1984.84-592,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1683.081,1685.455,It's not like your yearly license renewal.
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,1685.455,1686.844,"--That's right, Your Honor."
1984.84-592,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1704.465,1708.319,But the cars are not taxed as personal property?
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,1708.319,1708.879,"No, Your Honor."
1984.84-592,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1710.822,1734.946,"Mr. Eschen, when you recite the facts on the other Appellant's case, if you just had the same facts with respect to the purchase, the date of the purchase and the period of use and all the rest, but prior thereto she'd been a Vermont resident and she had a temporary job with an advertising agency in New York or something, knowing she'd come back to Vermont later, and she went there, bought the car at the same time, and then brought it back, would she have to pay the use tax?"
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,1734.946,1737.219,"Your Honor, I'm not sure I understand your question."
1984.84-592,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1741.271,1752.079,"Of Vermont, before she bought... at the time she bought the car, but she was temporarily employed in New York for a period of a year or two; she had bought it for the same price, everything else was exactly the same; would she pay the tax?"
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,1752.079,1760.487,"--Your Honor, that brings into question the credit provision found in Section 8911.9 of Title 32 and how that applies."
1984.84-592,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1793.717,1796.06,"What you're saying then is, there really is no discrimination at all."
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,1796.06,1797.65,"--You're absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1984.84-592,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1797.65,1802.403,What's this case... this case is a non-case in your view then.
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,1803.104,1804.175,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.84-592,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1804.175,1806.727,"Now, finish your sentence."
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,1824.176,1833.663,"The only situation, Your Honor, in which the credit is available is when a resident of Vermont purchases the car in a reciprocal state and first registers the car in the State of Vermont."
1984.84-592,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1838.045,1838.776,When it first registers?
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,1840.038,1840.797,--That's correct.
1984.84-592,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1844.47,1849.833,"--The person had to pay a tax in the reciprocal state, but... right?"
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,1852.347,1853.256,--That's true.
1984.84-592,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1872.559,1881.546,"Is this construction that you suggested here of your exemption provision, is that plain enough from the opinion below?"
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,1881.546,1885.168,--I would have to say that it is not.
1984.84-592,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1885.899,1892.534,"As the case comes to us, it sounds to me like the case is as your colleague on the other side describes it."
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,1903.681,1904.913,"--No, Your Honor."
1984.84-592,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1915.028,1916.07,In these same terms?
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,1916.07,1917.099,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.84-592,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1962.009,1964.109,Let me interrupt you if I may.
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,1976.057,1979.73,"Well, Your Honor, even using the examples of purchases out of state, I'd still--"
1984.84-592,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1979.73,1983.483,And isn't that all that the Supreme Court dealt with was purchases out of state?
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,1994.84,1997.262,"--Well, the point I'm trying to make, Your Honor--"
1984.84-592,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1997.262,1997.652,I'm sorry.
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,1998.483,2009.009,"--is that any individual who is registering that same car in Vermont, regardless of where the vehicle may have been purchased, is going to pay $110."
1984.84-592,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2013.333,2021.638,"But Mr. Eschen, the complaint, as I understand it, is that the nonresident of Vermont is paying two taxes."
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2054.99,2056.389,--I realize that.
1984.84-592,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2056.389,2057.741,--and disagrees with you.
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2057.741,2058.33,"I realize that, Your Honor."
1984.84-592,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2058.33,2061.613,"Now, how are we supposed to resolve that?"
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2070.869,2082.878,"Well, Your Honor, I admit that it is a difficulty in this case because the decision of the Vermont Supreme Court does not specifically address the first registration principle that I've discussed."
1984.84-592,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2137.103,2144.279,"Well, there's no argument from the other side that there shouldn't be a... that people who use the roads shouldn't pay."
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2193.13,2194.45,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1984.84-592,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2194.45,2195.361,Why not?
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2195.361,2204.648,"The credit provision, even if the Court were to resume Mr. Williams' application, the credit provision is available to a resident of Vermont."
1984.84-592,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2218.906,2227.291,"Yes, but a newly arrived resident who wasn't a resident when he bought his car doesn't get the credit under his version."
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2227.291,2228.363,--That's correct.
1984.84-592,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2248.366,2253.267,Were both of them residents of the other state when they purchased the car?
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2253.267,2254.559,Were both of them residents?
1984.84-592,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2254.559,2255.36,Yes.
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2255.36,2256.119,"Your Honor, I don't know."
1984.84-592,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2257.792,2271.811,"My problem is that if you pay a tax in a state and then you move to another state and you have a personal property tax, automatically you are subject to that tax."
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2271.811,2274.172,"--Your Honor, this is no personal--"
1984.84-592,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2274.172,2275.013,Is that right or wrong?
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2275.013,2276.924,--This is not a personal property tax.
1984.84-592,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2276.924,2278.216,I know that.
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2282.289,2288.842,That if the item comes to rest in the other state and it becomes a part of the--
1984.84-592,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2288.842,2290.614,"Well, isn't this the same?"
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2295.887,2297.209,--I would think that it would.
1984.84-592,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2298.85,2300.95,Can you think of any reason why it shouldn't be?
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2318.704,2319.733,"That's true, Your Honor."
1984.84-592,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2322.415,2331.571,"But he says that if you were a resident of the state when you bought the car in the other state, then you get a credit."
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2331.571,2344.851,"--Your Honor, if you were a resident of the State of Vermont and you purchased the car in a reciprocal state and did not register the car in that state and brought it back to Vermont and first used it in Vermont, you would get the credit."
1984.84-592,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2347.423,2351.273,The registry is what... the registering is what starts it.
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2351.273,2352.234,--The registration--
1984.84-592,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2352.234,2353.156,What causes it.
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2353.156,2354.505,--Triggers the tax.
1984.84-592,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2354.505,2356.018,To register in another state.
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2359.781,2361.931,No.
1984.84-592,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2364.754,2366.053,All right.
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2380.054,2390.049,--That individual would be liable to the state for a use tax based upon the value of the tax... based upon the value of the vehicle as of the time of registration.
1984.84-592,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2390.049,2393.581,I didn't say they registered it.
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2396.053,2397.234,That's what I'm saying.
1984.84-592,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2398.146,2409.213,"If he kept it in the garage for three months and brought it into Vermont, they'd get the benefit of this tax, if they didn't register."
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2409.213,2411.734,--But they did register it in Vermont.
1984.84-592,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2411.734,2415.377,They didn't register in New York for three months.
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2415.377,2416.028,Right.
1984.84-592,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2416.028,2421.311,"And then they brought it to Vermont and registered it, they would have the benefit of that deduction."
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2421.311,2422.982,"No, they would not, Your Honor."
1984.84-592,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2422.982,2426.274,I thought you said the registering is what triggered it.
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2426.274,2430.257,The registration in Vermont triggers the tax liability in Vermont.
1984.84-592,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2501.983,2503.194,May I interrupt again?
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2513.699,2515.051,"That's right, Your Honor."
1984.84-592,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2515.051,2518.514,But the Supreme Court says the contrary in its opinion.
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2537.795,2543.301,"Your Honor, I--"
1984.84-592,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2543.301,2552.635,Do you agree or disagree with the Vermont Supreme Court statement that I just read?
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2552.635,2556.728,--I'd ask the Court's... an apology--
1984.84-592,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2556.728,2558.038,The statement says:
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2563.394,2564.382,--Right.
1984.84-592,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2564.382,2568.226,"""# and pay a sales or use tax to another state. """
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2568.847,2569.358,Right.
1984.84-592,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2569.358,2572.788,"""# are exempt from paying a use tax to the State of Vermont. """
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2579.874,2581.146,That's... yeah.
1984.84-592,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2588.039,2590.82,"Well, is Vermont... is New York a reciprocal state?"
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2590.82,2591.661,Yes.
1984.84-592,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2592.292,2599.137,"So then it is exempt here, even if it's not registered... there is no reference to registration in the state."
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2599.137,2604.341,"--But, Your Honor, as we argued to the Vermont Supreme Court, section 89--"
1984.84-592,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2604.341,2608.382,Do you agree or disagree that that's a correct statement of the law of Vermont?
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2608.382,2617.577,"--Your Honor, I believe it is a correct statement as far as it goes."
1984.84-592,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2687.355,2695.009,"Well, Mr. Eschen, I asked you some time ago what we could look to know if you're correct on your interpretation."
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2700.822,2701.533,"No, Your Honor."
1984.84-592,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2702.314,2705.895,It's just your version against Mr. Williams' version.
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2705.895,2708.657,"It is... that's correct, Your Honor."
1984.84-592,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2712.359,2719.365,Does the... who enforces this tax?
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2719.365,2722.407,--It is administered by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles.
1984.84-592,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2722.407,2725.369,And are there regulations issued with respect to this?
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2725.369,2727.8,"There are no formal regulations, Your Honor."
1984.84-592,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2735.765,2741.909,"Well, you'd never gather your... I'll say again, you would never gather your interpretation from what you can read in the--"
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2741.909,2743.502,"--I'm not disagreeing with you, Your Honor."
1984.84-592,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2749.025,2755.857,"--You didn't file a response to the... you didn't file a motion to dismiss to the jurisdictional state, did you?"
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2755.857,2760.111,"--That raises another complicated question, and that is--"
1984.84-592,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2760.111,2761.133,You waived it.
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2761.133,2768.797,"--We waived it because this case, Williams, was based upon the decision of the Vermont Supreme Court in Leverson."
1984.84-592,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2918.303,2932.475,"Anybody who is... any Vermont resident who is entitled to the credit, whatever that condition might be, doesn't pay for the use of the Vermont roads."
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2932.475,2934.385,"--Well, Your Honor, he does."
1984.84-592,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2934.385,2940.51,"Well, you mean because he's paid it to the other state and the state is a reciprocal state?"
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2940.51,2941.779,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.84-592,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2941.779,2943.652,"Well, it doesn't help him much."
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2949.516,2954.208,"Well, that's right, Your Honor, but there's a reason why Mr. Williams should not get the credit."
1984.84-592,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2967.266,2978.684,"Well, you're saying because of reciprocity, the Vermont resident who gets the credit is really paying for the use of the roads, of the Vermont roads, because he paid some money to New York."
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2978.684,2985.349,"--Because, for the same reasoning, the New Yorker who buys a car in Vermont and goes back to New York."
1984.84-592,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2987.77,2990.222,"So why doesn't that apply to him, too?"
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2990.222,2991.504,"Well, because, Your Honor--"
1984.84-592,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2991.504,2992.343,I don't follow that.
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,2992.343,2999.217,"--Well, Your Honor, the Appellant purchased his car, presumably, while he was a resident of that state."
1984.84-592,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3006.073,3017.28,"Your other hypothetical, we have this woman who goes to New York and lives for a year and works for an advertising agency, wants to work there for a year in New York, but she doesn't have to pay the tax, if I understand your--"
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,3017.28,3020.072,--She would if she registered the vehicle in New York.

1984.84-592,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3045.808,3051.601,"--Well, how are we supposed to resolve this question of what the law... should we certify a question to the Vermont Supreme Court and say did you really mean what you said?"
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,3054.873,3058.055,"--Well, Your Honor, I--"
1984.84-592,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3058.055,3065.452,"I never have seen one like this before where the opinion is perfectly clear, and then the Attorney General of the state comes up and says the Supreme Court of the state didn't know what it was talking about."
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,3065.452,3073.947,"--Well, Your Honor, the facts of the case were presented to the Vermont Supreme Court and the Vermont Supreme Court concluded that there was no discrimination."
1984.84-592,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3086.653,3087.785,To say the least.
1984.84-592,1,15892,andrew_m_eschen,,3087.785,3098.592,"But I submit that the decision has been made by the court, and that under Vermont law the Commissioner's interpretation has been accepted."

1984.84-592,2,37341,norman_charles_williams,,3274.078,3277.751,"--If the Court has no questions, I have nothing further."
1984.84-592,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3277.751,3278.442,Very well.
