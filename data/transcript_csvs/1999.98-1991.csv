1999.98-1991,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.711,"We'll hear argument next in Number 98-1991, Public Lands Council v. Bruce Babbitt."
1999.98-1991,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,14.655,24.892,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1991,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,36.78,66.956,"Mr. Bishop, I think you've described, and I think perhaps your opponents have described, the proceeding you've brought here as a, quote, facial attack, end quote, on the Secretary's regulations that are challenged, and your opponents say, well, you... except in a First Amendment case you can't bring a facial challenge, and are you using the term, facial challenge, in the same sense we're use it in the First Amendment jurisprudence?"
1999.98-1991,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,74.675,86.192,"If, in all applications, the regulation is unlawful because it is not authorized by the statute, then it is facially invalid, and our position is--"
1999.98-1991,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,86.192,88.504,And it affects you adversely automatically.
1999.98-1991,0,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,88.504,91.022,"--And it affects you adversely automatically, that's right."
1999.98-1991,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,109.309,110.424,But--
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1556.108,1559.99,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1991,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1594.17,1611.715,"If you're right on the first clause of your sentence that if it can be shown that this is permissible in any conceivable situation, then you don't even have to get to the other parts of your sentence."
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1617.697,1618.523,--Right.
1999.98-1991,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1618.523,1629.669,"So do you take the position that all you have to show is that perhaps in at least one or two instances, that this does not respond to the challenge, therefore that's good enough?"
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1629.669,1630.412,Yes.
1999.98-1991,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1648.7,1655.387,"If you're right on your first point, a Court opinion would never get to the others."
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1655.387,1661.582,"--No, that... of course, the Court could write the opinion as it chose, and I suppose--"
1999.98-1991,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1661.582,1662.325,It could put it in Roman numerals.
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1662.325,1663.001,--Right.
1999.98-1991,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1663.561,1666.123,Could I just ask about your first point?
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1674.213,1674.706,Right.
1999.98-1991,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1674.706,1679.991,"--which involves facial attacks on statutes, often under the Constitution."
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1686.223,1687.96,"Yes, but I think that is essentially--"
1999.98-1991,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1687.96,1696.876,Have we said that the Salerno rule applies to APA challenges to the regulations that do not properly implement a statute?
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1696.876,1697.498,--No.
1999.98-1991,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1702.122,1705.26,Have we said that in a decision of this Court?
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1705.26,1705.549,--No.
1999.98-1991,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1738.78,1740.555,"No, I though his challenge was very, very specific."
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1805.411,1808.793,"Right, and that is simply not true, and I would like to refer the Court--"
1999.98-1991,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1808.793,1810.529,What is not true?
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1810.529,1811.477,--That the--
1999.98-1991,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1811.477,1813.129,That they're not challenging--
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1813.129,1821.674,"--No, no, excuse me... that the new regulations do not provide for an apportionment if there is an increase in grazing, and that's the example the petitioner--"
1999.98-1991,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1821.674,1823.903,"--No, he doesn't say it doesn't provide for an apportionment."
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1829.681,1830.424,--It--
1999.98-1991,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1830.424,1837.362,--and it isn't clear that the old apportionment... the new apportionment is done in precisely the same proportions.
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1837.362,1838.226,--Okay.
1999.98-1991,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1844.542,1844.913,That's correct.
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1844.913,1849.166,"So to the extent that they are claiming some inconsistency with the statute, that's not this claim."
1999.98-1991,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1849.166,1849.788,That's correct.
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1849.788,1860.933,"This... and with respect to the new grazer coming in, those regulations are, as were pointed, out in regulation 4110.3-1."
1999.98-1991,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1860.933,1863.284,These are the '94 regulations?
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1863.284,1865.307,"They are essentially unchanged, and that's the point I wanted to make."
1999.98-1991,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1896.477,1897.47,We're on 125a?
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1897.47,1899.411,123a of the petition appendix.
1999.98-1991,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1899.411,1900.154,"123, thank you."
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1900.154,1911.011,"And if you put them side-by-side, there is actually essentially no change in the allocation of additional forage as it becomes available, and the same is correspondingly true with respect to a decrease in forage."
1999.98-1991,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1933.302,1954.646,"I understood the basic argument was that none of this need to come about because the land use program that the Secretary provided for could negate it, and I thought I read the Tenth Circuit opinion which upheld the program as reading that way, too."
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1963.601,1986.635,"Well, with... I think the Tenth Circuit may have had that sense, but I think it is important to look at the fact that existing... people holding existing permits under the priorities for apportioning this, they will first be... if additional forage becomes available, any historical suspended use that was referred to here will be given to the ranchers who already have suspended use."
1999.98-1991,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1986.635,1990.6,But not former adjudicated use.
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1990.6,2005.954,"No, it is... that is essentially what it is, because the current permits carry forward the amount of, the number of AUM's that a person has been able to graze under a permit, and the new permitted use regulation requires that the number of AUM's be specified in the permit."
1999.98-1991,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2006.697,2018.297,And you insist that henceforth the permits that are given will still reflect the original adjudicated [= AUM's]?
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2018.297,2024.696,"Yes, unless they are changed, because what... and this comes about as... essentially as a matter of the way the administrative process works."
1999.98-1991,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2061.848,2066.762,"You can also reduce the suspended use, you can't you, if you want to?"
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2066.762,2067.216,Yes.
1999.98-1991,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2067.216,2068.991,Only on renewal?
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2068.991,2070.271,No.
1999.98-1991,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2080.879,2083.58,"No, but I mean under the old system, never mind under the current--"
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2083.58,2084.473,--No.
1999.98-1991,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2100.281,2102.139,--But the regulations would not?
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2102.139,2102.799,No.
1999.98-1991,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2136.607,2137.312,Well--
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2137.312,2159.064,"And it's better to have the system reflect the present-day reality of what the active grazing... and lenders will know what the active... the permitted use under the permit is, the rancher will know what the permitted use under the permit is, those involved in the land use planning and BLM and the public will know, not paper cows put into a suspended use account, but what is actually going on on the range."
1999.98-1991,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2159.064,2159.603,"--Well, but that's their objection."
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2188.248,2188.87,"Yes, it does."
1999.98-1991,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2188.87,2191.303,Which I took it as saying they're right about that change.
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2207.983,2208.976,Well--
1999.98-1991,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2208.976,2229.16,"--and therefore they won't give us... you may say this is all going to work out fine, but we go to the bank, and we discover that we can't borrow the money, and the reason we can't borrow the money is that whereas previously we had certainty about what would happen to me if, suddenly, for some reason the amount that was going to be foraged went up, there's no longer that certainty."
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2239.728,2244.575,"--I think you're right about what they're saying, but they're wrong, and I'd like to respond in two points."
1999.98-1991,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2304.54,2331.289,"Well, of course, you can understand how that explanation causes concern, because the Taylor Grazing Act did contemplate that the original adjudication would allocate grazing permits based on the land base and the water rights of the applicants for grazing, and that that would be adequately safeguarded, that privilege would be adequately safeguarded."
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2345.324,2346.067,Okay.
1999.98-1991,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2346.726,2350.275,"I mean, they can be just, you know, off for other purposes."
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2350.275,2351.268,--Okay.
1999.98-1991,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2362.868,2369.677,"Well, it does, but it also contained a clause that indicated that the Taylor Grazing Act was not to be superseded."
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2369.677,2379.625,"Right, but the essential point about the land use planning under FLPMA is that it is a way of carrying out authority that the Secretary had under the Taylor Grazing Act to begin with."
1999.98-1991,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2425.838,2440.343,"Yes, but section 3 did say preference shall be given in the issuance of grazing permits to those who are landowners engaged in the livestock business, necessary to permit the proper use of lands, water rights owned--"
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2440.343,2441.07,Right--
1999.98-1991,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2441.07,2445.279,"--occupied and used by them, and that that will be adequately safeguarded."
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2449.077,2450.358,"--Yes, and--"
1999.98-1991,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2450.358,2466.993,"And this subsequent Federal Land Policy and Management Act, in its contemplation and requirement of land use plans, may not be in accord with that Taylor Grazing Act provision."
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2466.993,2473.104,"--Well, petitioners have said that they understand that the Secretary can alter preference rights."
1999.98-1991,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2473.104,2473.68,Yes.
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2473.68,2484.288,"So whatever the initial adjudication was... and even in the early years it changed from year to year, so the initial preference rights that were established are an implementation of very broad language."
1999.98-1991,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2501.644,2502.371,Yes.
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2502.371,2516.489,"It's in terms of whatever grazing is made available, how does it get apportioned among people based... and there were complicated questions of somebody who was using the public rangeland before 1934, and how much grazing were they doing."
1999.98-1991,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2555.681,2562.574,"Your response is that they should go talk to their banks and they should say, look, these paper cows never meant that much."
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2568.601,2569.427,--And--
1999.98-1991,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2569.427,2577.229,And today they promised in this commentary that if there's a major change in reality they're going to try to do something about it.
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2580.657,2583.462,"--If it's a major change for improvement in increased grazing or decreased grazing, but--"
1999.98-1991,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2583.462,2585.979,--But am I right in thinking about how to look at this?
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2585.979,2593.66,"--Well, yes, because the regulations do provide for changes according to the land use plan and, of course, lenders are on notice of that."
1999.98-1991,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2616.899,2649.675,"Mr. Kneedler, about a sentence after the language that you quoted to us about the discretion of the Secretary, in fact it's the next sentence, it says during periods of range depletion due to severe drought or other national... natural causes, or in case of a general epidemic of disease during the life of the permit, the Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized in his discretion to remit, reduce, or refund in whole or in part or authorize postponement of payment of grazing fees."
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2655.702,2669.449,"--Right, I do, because this has to do with the reduction of fees, not the direction to reduce grazing, and if you look at the preceding sentence, I only got to the clause that talked about renewal of permits in the discretion of the Secretary."
1999.98-1991,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2688.024,2696.569,"But do you think it suggests that the Secretary could simply suspend in gross, rather than case-by-case?"
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2696.569,2699.337,I think it did.
1999.98-1991,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2782.019,2786.849,"Well, there also are limitations on the denial of renewal of a permit--"
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2786.849,2787.963,--Yes.
1999.98-1991,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2787.963,2791.845,--to a permittee who's obeying the rules of the Secretary.
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2791.845,2812.529,"Right, and this sentence, by the way, it's not clear that it was intended to do anything more than to suggest to the Secretary that in the initial apportionment of the domain in 1934 the Secretary should give weight to what had gone before, but to the extent it has any continuing force it has the one I mentioned."
1999.98-1991,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2828.215,2860.249,"Would you explain to me what section 302 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act means when it says the Secretary shall manage the public lands under principles of multiple use and sustained yield in accordance with the land use plans, except that where a tract of such public land has been dedicated to specific uses, according to any other provisions of law, it will be managed in accordance with such law?"
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2865.45,2866.193,--There could be... there could be--
1999.98-1991,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2866.193,2867.102,Could that be for grazing?
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2867.102,2868.301,"--No, I think it could not be."
1999.98-1991,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2870.242,2870.863,Why not?
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2870.863,2876.453,"--I think the principal reason is, for example, the provision of FLPMA that deals with permits."
1999.98-1991,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2886.755,2894.845,"Well, then, that... is grazing a specific use in another law, specifically Taylor Grazing Act?"
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2897.279,2921.428,"--Well, it is clear that Congress intended to bring grazing under the multiple use requirements of FLPMA, and the regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior in 1978, right after FLPMA, the same set of regulations that petitioners wish we would go back to, made clear the Secretary's understanding that FLPMA required grazing to be regulated."
1999.98-1991,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2997.301,3009.911,"Mr. Kneedler, what has the Secretary actually done with respect to land use plans following the enactment of this law, or has it been in suspense because of the litigation?"
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3009.911,3010.47,No.
1999.98-1991,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3135.013,3165.971,"Is there anything in the new regulations, though, that links permitted use by grazers to either the grazing preference or any other measure of numbers needed by the permit-holders to support an economically viable grazing unit in combination with their own base properties and water, which is what the Taylor Grazing Act contemplated?"
1999.98-1991,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3165.971,3171.627,"--Well, the current... I'm sorry, the... was there anything in the current regulations that ties it to preference?"
1999.98-1991,2,42423,timothy_s_bishop,,3363.596,3371.548,I just don't see the broad discretion in the TGA that Mr. Kneedler does.
1999.98-1991,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3411.262,3420.756,"But I thought you conceded that, as far as the active use is concerned, there's no different situation today than there was under the prior regulations that--"
