2005.04-1144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.452,We'll hear argument next in Ayotte versus Planned Parenthood of Northern New England.
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,6.57,10.122,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--
2005.04-1144,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,68.16,70.527,May I interrupt you at this point?
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,197.874,224.125,"Justice Souter, in that instance, we did not say that it was an independent constitutional requirement that there be a health exception, but certainly reading this Court's cases, we should apply our act in a manner to protect if that rare case arises where an emergency abortion would come forward."
2005.04-1144,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,243.288,243.972,"And if he said,"
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,251.609,270.889,"I may not because New Hampshire's act may not be applied in a manner to ensure that if a minor in that rare circumstance needs an immediate abortion, that she receives that immediate medical care in those circumstances."
2005.04-1144,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,270.889,275.241,Doesn't that mean because there is a required health exception?
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,276.543,292.353,"Justice Souter, not that there is an express requirement of a health exception but that the law cannot be implied in a manner to infringe on the minor's health if that rare emergency case arises."
2005.04-1144,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,292.353,302.142,Your first answer to Justice Souter was that the physician would say you can't be prosecuted under our law.
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,313.266,325.157,"Justice Kennedy, in that limited circumstance, we do not believe that the physician would be prosecuted under our parental notification act, given that there is a mechanism--"
2005.04-1144,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,325.157,335.513,Because of the text of the act or because of some policy that the attorney general would follow in order just to decline to prosecute?
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,341.084,375.321,"--Justice Kennedy, with respect to the act itself, assuming it were a life... excuse me, a health emergency short of a life threatening emergency, where a minor did not want to notify her parents and assuming those situations came forward and someone was unable to reach a judge, the act itself provides a mechanism in it that anticipates providing a judge where necessary, and so that would be the ability of a minor in those circumstances to seek a judge."
2005.04-1144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,392.1,393.967,Let's just imagine a real circumstance.
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,441.7,449.019,"Justice Breyer, the physician in those instances could perform the immediate abortion."
2005.04-1144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,449.019,450.721,It doesn't say that in the statute.
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,484.491,498.583,"Your Honor, his lawyer would advise him, in those circumstances, that the competing harms defense would protect his actions because he needs to act urgently necessary... in an urgently necessary circumstance."
2005.04-1144,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,498.583,502.801,Would it protect him from a civil damages action as well as prosecution in a criminal case?
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,502.801,510.105,"Justice O'Connor, by the plain language of the competing harms defense, it also precludes civil liability."
2005.04-1144,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,526.281,526.781,How do we know?
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,571.742,588.104,"Justice Breyer, because the harm that is being weighed here is the harm of urgently providing care to this minor who needs it, as opposed to the harm that the act is trying to get at, which is notification of parents."
2005.04-1144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,608.598,613.152,"But, your opinion... that's the real problem here for the doctor who is on the line."
2005.04-1144,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,620.055,621.221,Competing harm.
2005.04-1144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,621.221,629.327,"--Competing harms, a defense... I think that a lawyer who cares about his client would say, defense is not what we want."
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,646.873,661.715,"Justice Ginsburg, in the Simopoulos case considered by this Court, one of the issues that was raised was a medical... the physician was prosecuted for performing an abortion outside the parameters of the Virginia act."
2005.04-1144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,675.708,682.396,"General, may I just point this... suppose the lawyer or the doctor are aware of the legislative history and say, well, generally that's true."
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,692.687,703.542,"--Justice Stevens, the legislative history... there certainly was some indication that the legislature did not want a general health exception."
2005.04-1144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,713.6,721.021,"But if they discussed the issue on the floor of the legislature, why wouldn't they have drafted the precise protection they thought appropriate?"
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,721.021,737.799,"Your Honor, when they discussed the history on the floor of the House and Senate, they felt that it protected for emergencies and there was no discussion of this narrow category of cases short of death."
2005.04-1144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,737.799,743.786,"And you have another point here, don't you, about how general this statute is."
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,755.511,757.694,"Justice Scalia, no."
2005.04-1144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,772.52,773.036,In the first amendment.
2005.04-1144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,773.036,785.863,"Am I right in reading your briefs that you don't object to a preenforcement challenge to the bypass procedure itself brought by physicians, for example?"
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,785.863,791.767,"Mr. Chief Justice, no, we do not object in that sense."
2005.04-1144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,801.038,812.68,And I gather that the debate on the evidence and the circumstances that might arise in that case would be quite similar to the debate in the present context.
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,828.272,835.526,"--Mr. Chief Justice, it would, but it would be much more narrowly focused in terms of bringing it as an as applied challenge, this was brought--"
2005.04-1144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,835.526,837.711,How would it be as applied?
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,910.807,923.048,"--Justice Ginsburg, the lawsuit would be a preenforcement as applied challenge and the physician would bring the claim and would say, as applied to me, I perform abortions, I also perform abortions on minors."
2005.04-1144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,934.237,936.006,Could you do that as a class action?
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,936.006,939.708,"Depending on the circumstance, he may be able to."
2005.04-1144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,939.708,940.808,What is the circumstance?
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,951.33,954.798,Justice... I'm sorry.
2005.04-1144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,954.798,955.982,Why isn't that this case?
2005.04-1144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,957.015,958.067,"Yes, exactly."
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,958.067,963.685,"Justice Stevens, this is not this case because this case was brought as a facial challenge."
2005.04-1144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,967.006,971.458,You mean he has to bring the as applied challenge when he has the patient in his office?
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,974.093,974.843,"--No, he doesn't."
2005.04-1144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,990.119,996.272,"We're talking about a lawsuit which asks for declaration, not that the entire statute is invalid."
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,1005.428,1007.064,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2005.04-1144,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1007.064,1008.714,Quite a different lawsuit from this one.
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,1008.714,1021.99,"That's quite a different lawsuit and a lawsuit that would be certainly, from the State's perspective, would allow the overwhelming number of applications of this statute where there is no dispute that it works well, to go forward."
2005.04-1144,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1021.99,1028.394,"But in Justice Scalia's case, would not the reason for that relief have to be a finding that the statute is unconstitutional?"
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,1031.613,1039.785,"Justice Stevens, it would be only in the context of that one particular application as applied to that physician, which would have stare decisis--"
2005.04-1144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1039.785,1047.789,It would be a finding that the bypass procedure is inadequate which doesn't necessarily implicate the general notification provisions.
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,1047.789,1050.407,"--Mr. Chief Justice, that would be the case."
2005.04-1144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1064.401,1091.234,"Then I think what you're saying essentially is that the First Circuit was concerned with this category, wanted to give preenforcement relief to the physician, so what they did was write except that they should have said this statute is not enforceable where there is a risk to the woman's health and it cannot be applied in any such cases."
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,1095.122,1103.276,"Justice Ginsburg, the First Circuit went well beyond because it focused on a general health exception, they've now focusing it on an emergency exception."
2005.04-1144,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1109.965,1117.351,Did you ask that the relief ordered below be more restrictive?
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,1121.855,1123.789,Justice--
2005.04-1144,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1123.789,1131.061,"Did the Court below have a chance to consider tailoring it more narrowly, as you suggest today?"
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,1131.061,1147.821,"--Justice O'Connor, we did raise the application of the severance clause below, although the court, both at the district court level and the First Circuit appeared to look at the... the lack of a general health exception as a per se constitutional problem that rendered the statute as a whole invalid."
2005.04-1144,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1147.821,1161.397,I just am not clear to what extent you really raised the possibility with the court below of carrying its judgment more narrowly as you're suggesting today should be done.
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,1161.397,1165.432,"Your Honor, we certainly raised the severance issue in the district court."
2005.04-1144,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1165.432,1171.336,You've used this word severance now twice.
2005.04-1144,0,33760,kelly_a_ayotte,,1190.048,1192.5,"Your Honor, you're correct."
2005.04-1144,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1206.157,1207.425,"Thank you, General."
2005.04-1144,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1211.394,1221.519,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court--
