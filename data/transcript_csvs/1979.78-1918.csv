1979.78-1918,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,42.362,"Ms. Walsh, you may proceed whenever you are ready."
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,42.362,45.401,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1918,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,108.763,111.826,"That is to the exclusion of District Courts, your position is."
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,111.826,113.464,"Yes, Your Honor; right."
1979.78-1918,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,118.61,131.817,"Does the legislative history reveal whether the authors of that amendment, all others, had any idea of the scope of its impact?"
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,131.817,139.311,To some extent admittedly the legislative history on section 307(b)(1) in --
1979.78-1918,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,139.311,141.248,"It isn't very helpful, is it?"
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,141.248,145.808,"It is not extremely helpful but it is not unhelpful either, Your Honor."
1979.78-1918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,448.539,456.639,"Ms. Walsh, do you agree with the characterization of the Fifth Circuit that the record in this case was skeletal?"
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,456.639,457.26,"No, Your Honor."
1979.78-1918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,479.171,489.68,Isn't the real question though not whether it was sufficient for EPA to make the determination but whether it was sufficient for the Fifth Circuit to determine whether the EPA had acted correctly?
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,489.68,496.03,"Well, that analysis of the record goes both ways."
1979.78-1918,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,526.873,539.349,"In your view, if the record is one which is sufficient to satisfy the agency, is it automatically sufficient for appellate review in the Court of Appeals?"
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,545.267,558.438,"Not necessarily, in that if there is a record, and the Administrator's decision must be based on a record to be sustainable, certainly."
1979.78-1918,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,602.563,617.715,"Let's assume that in a particular case the agency considers the record adequate but the Court of Appeals asked to review it and concludes that it is inadequate, just assume that."
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,619.869,620.288,Yes.
1979.78-1918,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,620.288,622.941,As it did here now.
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,637.8,645.046,"Well, I believe that I would assume that option would be available to the Court of Appeals."
1979.78-1918,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,667.882,669.739,"It is an obvious alternative, isn't it?"
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,669.739,670.129,Yes.
1979.78-1918,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,670.129,670.754,Always.
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,670.754,671.521,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,671.521,680.202,Yet one of your arguments is that you want to speed up the process of review so people will know what is expected of them under the EPA.
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,686.671,698.168,But what we are concerned with is speeding up -- certainly speeding up the application and determining the finality of the Administrator's actions.
1979.78-1918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,733.126,758.574,"Well, I had read the Fifth Circuit's opinion and its use of the word ""skeletal"" not as meaning that it was less than 20 pages or less than 15 pages, but skeletal in a sense that it was simply correspondence largely between the private party and the EPA; and it was skeletal for purposes of review."
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,758.574,766.053,"Well, on the basis that it -- certainly there is that indication in the Fifth Circuit's opinion."
1979.78-1918,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,858.395,870.19,"Well, can I ask you a question about the final -- I must confess -- I know the parties don't argue this, but I have some question about the finality of the June 8 letter itself."
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,893.567,899.519,"I would say that, yes, it would be -- it could have been considered final agency action, because that certainly is --"
1979.78-1918,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,899.519,901.402,It is just as final as the June 8 letter was?
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,901.402,901.843,Yes.
1979.78-1918,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,921.38,928.357,"Well, but it was still open to PPG after the June 8 letter to ask further questions, because they had further correspondence."
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,940.871,947.905,"Yes, I believe so."
1979.78-1918,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,972.044,979.715,"Couldn't PPG today write another letter and say, ""We have got another idea, we will only use 90 percent oil and 10 percent gas,"" or something like this."
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,987.223,1003.039,"In the sense that they could now file another petition for review on that basis, no, because it would be the same -- is the same determination that is involved and we are already involved with a petition for review on the particular --"
1979.78-1918,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1003.039,1007.312,"Does it effect, to file a petition for review; is that the reason?"
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,1007.312,1011.438,"Yes, but there has been no change in the particular agency action involved."
1979.78-1918,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1012.426,1016.134,"But there was none between '77 and '76 either, was there?"
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,1016.134,1026.195,"No, not between -- not between June and the subsequent June letter which reaffirmed the October decision."
1979.78-1918,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1041.205,1043.482,All right.
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,1043.482,1051.963,Congress specified because of problems that had previously been encountered in the Act as to what the proper filing time was.
1979.78-1918,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1107.04,1122.379,"Would the October 5 determination -- say there had been a criminal proceeding or something like that later on and if there is a failure to seek review of a final action which is subject to review in the Court of Appeals, as I remember the statute, you cannot attack the determination."
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,1136.146,1148.071,"Yes, they could have, because there was -- the opportunity for review remains open if that Federal notice has never been published."
1979.78-1918,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1192.967,1204.024,"Of course if we held that these actions, these letters back and forth were not final actions within the meaning of the Act, then the company would always be free in an enforcement proceeding to challenge them."
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,1204.024,1207.64,If because they would not have been reviewable under 307(b)(1).
1979.78-1918,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1219.396,1227.837,Is there any statute or regulation that would preclude EPA from changing its position on any of these anytime it changed its mind?
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,1227.837,1229.4,"Having once made -- in other words, going back --"
1979.78-1918,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1229.4,1236.853,"On anyone of these letters, could they 30 days later have said, ""Oh, we have reexamined it and we think we have got a little different approach now and we are going to take a different position."""
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,1239.516,1241.041,No.
1979.78-1918,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1241.041,1245.962,"Under a court proceeding, for example, after a certain number of days goes by the judge can't change his mind."
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,1249.234,1252.839,"Well, assuming that it is always acting in accordance with the statute --"
1979.78-1918,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1252.839,1257.239,"I understand, the law and the material before it and all the rest, But these are complicate matters."
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,1257.239,1257.997,Exactly.
1979.78-1918,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1257.997,1265.285,"They have been asked to reexamine by additional letters and additional data, when the actual facility was built and all this sort of thing."
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,1265.285,1270.536,"And if that would happen, then the affected party would have the opportunity to --"
1979.78-1918,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1270.536,1275.51,And the agency could change its rule at any time -- it has no time limit when it can change its ruling.
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,1275.51,1277.819,"No, the agency is not precluded from --"
1979.78-1918,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1277.819,1278.375,It is nevertheless --
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,1278.375,1280.016,-- changing the regulations.
1979.78-1918,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1280.016,1282.893,Nevertheless it is the final action within the meaning of the statute.
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,1282.893,1294.828,Because it -- it -- that particular action -- and this goes more to the merits of the actions that are involved -- determined that the new source performance standards would be applicable to the facility at that point.
1979.78-1918,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1295.192,1297.625,Unless we change our mind.
1979.78-1918,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1297.625,1321.747,"What you are saying is the agency does not lose jurisdiction after it has taken a purported final action and an appeal has been filed in the Court of Appeals, unlike a District Court, for example, would have lost jurisdiction and could not, except by leave of the Court of Appeals, modify findings or a decree."
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,1322.22,1322.455,That's right.
1979.78-1918,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1322.455,1328.452,-- say the agency does not lose jurisdiction even after it has pronounced a final action in the cases in the Court of Appeals.
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,1328.452,1330.544,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1918,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1358.015,1374.474,"Well, in your brief you concede that under our former cases even if the action of the EPA is final action and therefore subject to appellate review, it may not be ripe for appellate review."
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,1376.515,1379.007,"Yes, Your Honor; right."
1979.78-1918,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1380.38,1394.907,"Then if they remand it, if the Court of Appeals would simply say this is not ripe for judicial review, appellate review, then that would be subject presumably to examination here to see whether we agreed that it was not ripe."
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,1397.201,1409.057,"That would be subject to examination here or the Court of Appeals would have the option of remanding to the agency for completion of the administrative proceedings or further administrative hearings, whatever is involved."
1979.78-1918,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1447.507,1460.526,"I suppose if the Court of Appeals had said in this case, ""This is not ripe for review,"" EPA could then have proceeded to expand the record."
1979.78-1918,0,36924,maryann_walsh,,1466.691,1477.711,"No, they said that it -- they said it was not -- they had no jurisdiction, because it was not -- it was not a reviewable record under 307(b)(1) for Courts of Appeal purposes."
1979.78-1918,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1550.273,1554.024,Very well.
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,1556.266,1559.191,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1918,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2080.612,2086.001,"Well, your alternative would burden the District Courts rather than the Courts of Appeals."
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2086.001,2090.301,"No, it wouldn't necessarily, Justice Rehnquist, for two reasons."
1979.78-1918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2119.632,2124.179,Why wouldn't that be equally true with respect to the District Courts?
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2124.179,2143.928,Because if you were in the District Court you would be outside the reach of section 307(b)(1) and section 307(b)(1) in the judicial review provisions and section 307(b)(2) in the review preclusion provisions have a juxtaposed scope.
1979.78-1918,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2155.635,2156.414,I see.
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2156.414,2175.45,"And the second reason, though, as this Court has pointed out in the Overton Park case, a District Court can use discovery means, it has those procedures available to prove out the non-record aspect of the agency action."
1979.78-1918,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2185.166,2196.036,"But under the Government's reading of the statute where it concedes the Court of Appeals can remand, couldn't the Court of Appeals remand for similar supplementation of the agency record?"
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2196.036,2224.263,"Your Honor, it could but as Justice Marshall's opinion in the Overton Park case where the Court points out, I think it is at page 420, anytime you remand to the agency, when you have got a circumstance like that, you are going to risk post hoc rationalization and the opinion in the Overton Park case warns that you don't give deference, or the Court doesn't give deference to what results from the remand, because of that danger."
1979.78-1918,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2225.731,2229.523,Didn't the opinion leave open the right of a District Court to send it back?
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2229.523,2231.766,"Yes, it did; it definitely did that, yes."
1979.78-1918,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2234.229,2235.704,I warned -- the Court did.
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2235.704,2236.962,Yes.
1979.78-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2244.43,2248.352,What is wrong with a little post rationalization?
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2252.59,2253.57,"Well, Your Honor, we tried --"
1979.78-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2253.57,2259.484,"We send them back and say, ""Look, it is fine if you want to reach this result if you just give some reasons."
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2263.994,2282.443,"We would have liked to have had some readings for the application of the new source standards in this particular case that focus on the particular requirements that were placed on the waste heat boilers, because as the Court knows from looking at the briefs and the record, these are not your standard every-day boilers."
1979.78-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2344.893,2350.578,"Well, if you weren't you might have gotten to it."
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2350.578,2351.621,"I beg your pardon, Your Honor?"
1979.78-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2351.621,2355.355,You might have gotten to the merits if you weren't fighting about jurisdiction.
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2355.355,2380.907,"Well, at the time we filed, and this goes back to the timing of the particular letters where you have to realize that we had a letter on August 3 that basically said the requirements applied only at the time we were operating -- or PPG was operating those boilers with 100-percent fossil fuel, no input from the -- or no waste heat from the turbines at all."
1979.78-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2403.713,2411.899,Even the Government perhaps have different views of what the universe of reviewable matters would contain.
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2423.546,2424.968,"No, Your Honor, I wouldn't think so."
1979.78-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2428.657,2433.476,"Well, I know a lot of them, but I take it you must think that an awful lot of them wouldn't have enough."
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2433.476,2437.628,In this particular case the agency could have had an adequate record for review.
1979.78-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2488.155,2495.045,So you think that if EPA really does its work they probably can have an adequate record in almost any case?
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2495.045,2495.714,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2495.714,2499.074,Even if it is informal adjudication.
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2511.629,2512.604,"No, Your Honor."
1979.78-1918,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2610.531,2625.334,You don't think the special review proceeding depends on -- going to the Court of Appeals depends on an ad hoc evaluation of the record but that the likelihood of a skeletal record is why you apply the ejusdem generis construction.
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2625.334,2626.566,Precisely.
1979.78-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2629.642,2633.626,The likelihood of somebody having made a mistake.
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2633.626,2658.811,"Well, we -- Justice White, we agree with the agency completely, the union of bright line jurisdiction rule, you mean something that you can tell on the face of the statute before you even go into one of these proceedings whether or not you are going to be subject to at the end, exclusive and preclusive review in the Courts of Appeals or whether you are not, and you can raise defenses in enforcement cases or go to the District Court for review if you want to."
1979.78-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2658.811,2672.817,"Well, if you predicted only about one out of a thousand final actions might have an insufficient record because somebody made a mistake, it certainly isn't much of an argument for your construction."
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2672.817,2689.493,"But Justice White, the application of EPA's rule would mean that you would have everything from, oh, I think of EPA's decision to black list a company from Federal contracts, it is informal adjudication; it doesn't have a record attached to it."
1979.78-1918,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2710.599,2721.389,"I want to be sure I understand what you think the phrase ""any other final action"" in the present 307(b)(1) means."
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2731.823,2733.616,"Yes, that is precisely right."
1979.78-1918,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2734.215,2747.133,"And because those would -- could be expected to have adequate records to provide intelligent review, informed review on the part of the Court of Appeals; is that it?"
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2747.133,2748.205,That is precisely it.
1979.78-1918,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2750.444,2752.361,Not whether in this case there is an adequate record.
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2752.361,2752.779,No.
1979.78-1918,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2752.779,2755.903,Not whether in any particular case there is an adequate record.
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2755.903,2757.726,"No, not at all; that is precisely right."
1979.78-1918,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2772.715,2775.971,And that ejusdem would then include what?
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2775.971,2783.374,"It would include rule-making, because the actions both in the first and second sentences do include some rule-making."
1979.78-1918,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2783.374,2784.915,It would include all rule-making.
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2784.915,2792.706,"That is right, because they are either subject to 553 of the APA or the special provisions of section 307(d)."
1979.78-1918,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2792.706,2793.291,Yes.
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2793.291,2806.651,"And it would include also those adjudications which EPA has to take which are subject to statutorily the right of an affected party to request a hearing, to provide the opportunity for a hearing."
1979.78-1918,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2810.812,2812.504,And there would be a hearing record.
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2812.504,2813.021,That is right.
1979.78-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2892.968,2895.03,You are not saying we have to conduct a hearing?
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2895.03,2895.297,No.
1979.78-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2895.297,2902.634,"It posted a notice and nobody showed up at the time for a hearing, if that guy doesn't have to sit there for three hours and twiddle his thumbs."
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,2902.634,2904.05,"No, that is precisely right."
1979.78-1918,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3008.208,3022.776,"Mr. Lettow, with respect to this precise issue now before us, this may all be in your brief and I have read them some time ago and it is not in my mind, have the Courts of Appeals -- have any other Courts of Appeals besides this one addressed this issue?"
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,3022.776,3024.878,Not this precise issue.
1979.78-1918,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3034.83,3036.592,"Yes, that is in the District of Columbia Court."
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,3036.592,3037.653,That is right.
1979.78-1918,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3060.563,3063.857,On this precise issue there is no other Court of Appeals decision.
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,3063.857,3065.718,"No, but as I am about to point out --"
1979.78-1918,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3065.718,3075.685,But you say on the general generic question there are other Courts of Appeals decisions which are not in conflict but rather are consistent.
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,3075.685,3077.085,That is precisely right.
1979.78-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3297.832,3298.449,I don't follow.
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,3304.677,3311.858,When EPA sets the standard it doesn't necessarily set it at the precise numerical level.
1979.78-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3316.388,3318.735,And the company would seek review.
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,3319.845,3322.519,You could have an environmental group coming in and saying --
1979.78-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3322.519,3325.12,What facts are there that there be such review?
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,3325.12,3331.661,"The possibility that just because the statute does not fix the standard, it allows discretion."
1979.78-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3333.507,3338.674,"What you are saying is, if there is to be review on behalf of an environmental group that will have so be in the District Court."
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,3338.674,3338.925,Yes.
1979.78-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3338.925,3340.785,There is no such review provided in the Court of Appeals.
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,3340.785,3341.921,That is exactly right.
1979.78-1918,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3356.911,3362.448,"Why couldn't that review be regional rather than national, the second half of the section?"
1979.78-1918,1,19453,charles_f_lettow,,3362.448,3366.685,"Well, because the action obviously would have national impact."
1979.78-1918,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3423.302,3427.116,"Ms. Walsh, do you have anything further?"
1979.78-1918,2,36924,maryann_walsh,,3427.116,3432.865,I would like to try and show some of the shadows on PPG's bright line of ejusdem generis.
1979.78-1918,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3581.134,3590.519,"It makes quite a bit of difference if you are dividing the possible work up among them, a hundred districts, as compared with 11 Courts of Appeals."
1979.78-1918,2,36924,maryann_walsh,,3590.519,3591.095,First of all --
1979.78-1918,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3591.095,3615.261,"And let us suppose that there were 20,000 final judgments, final orders every year of EPA, let us just assume that a lot of the Courts, some of the Courts of Appeals are pretty heavy, pretty deep under water; and more so perhaps than a hundred District Courts."
1979.78-1918,2,36924,maryann_walsh,,3615.261,3621.702,We certainly recognize that and that is why we are looking for an interpretation of the statute that would not overly burden the courts.
1979.78-1918,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3621.702,3626.157,But each decision under the EPA by the District Court is appealable to the Court.
1979.78-1918,2,36924,maryann_walsh,,3626.157,3631.701,"Certainly, that is just what I was going to point out, that that decision in and of itself would be appealable."
1979.78-1918,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3631.701,3632.416,But they aren't.
1979.78-1918,2,36924,maryann_walsh,,3636.08,3637.097,I can't give you a definite --
1979.78-1918,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3637.097,3639.311,"Well, you won't tell me that all of them are."
1979.78-1918,2,36924,maryann_walsh,,3639.311,3640.162,"No, I would not indicate that."
1979.78-1918,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3640.162,3641.615,A large percentage of them.
1979.78-1918,2,36924,maryann_walsh,,3641.615,3644.354,Certainly the possibility is there for a large percentage.
1979.78-1918,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3646.443,3649.057,"Well, possibly all of them would be."
1979.78-1918,2,36924,maryann_walsh,,3649.799,3652.678,"No, they are not."
1979.78-1918,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3652.678,3654.634,Not even half of them.
1979.78-1918,2,36924,maryann_walsh,,3654.634,3663.302,"I am not sure as to that amount but they -- the possibility is there for reference to one, if not two, courts."
1979.78-1918,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3674.005,3680.635,"Of course, if we held that the action was not final, then it wouldn't have to burden either court."
1979.78-1918,2,36924,maryann_walsh,,3680.635,3687.053,That possibility is there anytime you have administrative action the possibility of it being non-pliable and no burden is there --
1979.78-1918,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3687.053,3692.444,"In this case, nor did the Court of Appeals find there was any question about finality."
1979.78-1918,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3692.444,3693.651,I would like to know what --
1979.78-1918,2,36924,maryann_walsh,,3693.651,3693.701,No -- right --
1979.78-1918,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3693.701,3701.77,"what this case you know of to holding finality in an order like this, the cases you cite aren't very close."
1979.78-1918,2,36924,maryann_walsh,,3701.77,3703.822,But on the basis of where our records --
1979.78-1918,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3703.822,3707.121,What kind of order as being a final order.
1979.78-1918,2,36924,maryann_walsh,,3707.121,3710.826,Do you mean as to the application of the regulations or this particular --
1979.78-1918,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3710.826,3713.735,"The letter of June 8, 1977."
1979.78-1918,2,36924,maryann_walsh,,3717.404,3731.195,It would seem to me that Camp v. Pitts where the record was based on a request for a determination by the Comptroller the determination was made on the exchange of correspondence would be the most similar.
1979.78-1918,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3731.195,3732.288,Camp v. Pitts.
1979.78-1918,2,36924,maryann_walsh,,3732.288,3732.662,Yes.
1979.78-1918,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3732.662,3737.129,"Well, this has been litigated --"
1979.78-1918,2,36924,maryann_walsh,,3737.129,3739.877,It is --
1979.78-1918,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3739.877,3743.254,"Since everybody agrees with it, you --"
1979.78-1918,2,36924,maryann_walsh,,3743.254,3745.758,"We are concerned with jurisdiction, which we believe is --"
1979.78-1918,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3745.758,3750.878,"Since it is jurisdiction, of course we have an independent duty to satisfy ourselves."
1979.78-1918,2,36924,maryann_walsh,,3750.878,3752.38,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1918,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3754.954,3755.681,"Thank you, Ms. Walsh."
