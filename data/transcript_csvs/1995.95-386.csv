1995.95-386,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.296,"We'll hear argument now in Number 95-386, Jason Richards v. Jefferson County."
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,8.856,12.549,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1995.95-386,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,91.95,117.468,"Well, Mr. Baxley, there... your opponents cite a string of cases, many of them State cases, in which some kind of claim preclusion doctrine, or res judicata, if you will, has been applied despite a change in the identity of the plaintiff taxpayer in suits by citizens challenging tax laws in State court."
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,124.292,135.781,"--All of those cases that they cited in that footnote, only two or three of them do I think really have application that they should have to be arguable."
1995.95-386,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,154.552,162.879,"Well, you take the position that there is no doctrine of claim preclusion in these citizen taxpayer suits in State court?"
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,162.879,176.278,"--I think the position that we would take is... was enunciated in your dissent, in Justice O'Connor's dissent in the Harper v. Virginia case which is--"
1995.95-386,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,176.278,177.697,"But remember, that was a dissent."
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,177.697,179.941,"--But it did not conflict with the majority, either--"
1995.95-386,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,179.941,180.669,It didn't carry the day.
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,180.669,200.734,"--and you quoted United States v. L.A. Tucker Trucking Company and Webster v. Fall, and I think your quote there was something to the effect that questions which are merely lurk in the record have no basis of precedent in--"
1995.95-386,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,200.734,211.521,"Well, what if the court in the Bedingfield case here had actually decided the issue that you're raising now, would you be here?"
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,211.521,213.041,--It would be a closer question.
1995.95-386,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,214.122,215.852,And what is your answer?
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,221.197,242.89,"--I think you could make a good argument that you would not, because of nonprivity under the law as set out by this Court, but I think that... certainly I think that candidly the respondent would have a stronger case, because here this argument, a major constitutional right, has never, ever been decided by any court at any time."
1995.95-386,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,255.919,277.564,"Mr. Baxley, just to be clear on what's at issue, if, in fact, the matter had been decided in the prior suit, raised, litigated, and decided, then really it wouldn't be too significant whether you put a preclusion, it wouldn't be a plain preclusion, an issue preclusion label on it, because you'd have precedent from the highest court in your State."
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,293.784,296.065,"I think common sensewise, yes."
1995.95-386,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,307.601,308.693,But how about stare decisis?
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,308.693,315.298,"Stare decisis I think would be... would be enough to where it would make your burden almost unable... you couldn't overcome it, but I... we don't have that--"
1995.95-386,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,315.298,319.77,So your case really depends on this issue not having been fully litigated and decided.
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,319.77,326.265,"--Not having been litigated in any way, and I think that's the law from this Court, repeatedly."
1995.95-386,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,326.265,340.955,"Well, what if the State of Alabama decides to authorize taxpayer suits not in the sense of people who are being subject to a tax, but in the sense of challenging expenditure of public money?"
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,350.571,353.052,"No, sir, I don't think they have to--"
1995.95-386,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,353.052,357.266,Where there really isn't any personal property interest at stake.
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,357.266,370.434,"--I think my answer there would be that you pretty well hit it on the head in Martin v. Wilks in your opinion, where you said it's really, the burden is on the parties, on the parties that are litigating it to determine what the issues are going to be."
1995.95-386,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,383.764,387.397,That... I don't believe that's responsive to my question.
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,436.497,440.809,"--I think for the same reason, the principle of stare decisis that Justice Ginsburg--"
1995.95-386,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,440.809,442.512,I'm not talking about stare decisis.
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,454.199,470.681,"--I don't think they could and get by a due process test if they preclude... now, if... in your... and what... your example, if somebody came back and raised... you gave the First Amendment, raised the First Amendment, it had already been decided, yes, I think a statute that set that out would preclude others from doing it."
1995.95-386,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,479.556,493.766,"What if the law of Alabama is that anything that was... might have... was raised in the first taxpayer's action might have been raised is just, it's all over, there isn't going to be another suit, does that violate some provision of the Federal Constitution?"
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,493.766,494.036,--Yes.
1995.95-386,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,495.027,496.658,Why?
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,496.658,501.252,"Because this Court has held basically that and the Alabama supreme court has held that over and over, repeatedly."
1995.95-386,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,501.252,504.642,"Well, held... are you talking... you say, held that."
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,512.88,534.252,"If you deny someone the right to fully and totally litigate a constitutional issue, however you cut him off, whether by case law or by a statute, then it would not meet the test of this Court, that this Court says the due process rights transcend and, so to speak, would overcome... whether it be case law at the State level or a State statute--"
1995.95-386,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,534.252,547.352,"Mr. Baxley, but in many of these instances, these so called taxpayer suits, you wouldn't even have any right at all to be in court were it not for the grace of the State that allows you to be kind of a private Attorney General."
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,560.598,562.901,"--Well, I think--"
1995.95-386,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,562.901,569.624,"Do you have any due process right to bring a case that, if you were in the Federal court, they'd probably say you don't even have standing?"
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,569.624,578.37,--I think that you always have standing if you've got a major constitutional right that you say is being infringed upon.
1995.95-386,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,578.37,580.063,That's not... certainly not true.
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,633.659,641.952,"I think the best answer there is a case of this Court of Waters v. St. Louis, and it's so parallel to the situation we have here."
1995.95-386,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,675.985,681.999,But you very carefully and quite appropriately pick a case in which there would have been standing in Federal courts.
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,736.356,744.84,"--I think that the State does not have the right to, by statute or any other way, cut off someone's right to litigate a constitutional issue--"
1995.95-386,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,744.84,759.6,"But if you have no right to begin with under the Federal Constitution... you have a taxpayer, an actual taxpayer who doesn't want to pay tax out of his pocket."
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,780.453,781.384,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-386,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,781.384,785.969,"But we are talking about real taxpayers, and that's a little different, isn't it?"
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,785.969,795.145,"We're talking about real taxpayers, and in the Hansberry v. Lee, this Court said that the State is free to call these actions whatever they want to."
1995.95-386,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,808.064,818.851,"Wait, do you say that a State can't even authorize a class action and have the result of that class action binding on members of the class?"
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,818.851,834.091,"--I think they absolutely can, but I also think you go back to the decision of this Court 3 weeks ago, roughly, in the Matsushita case, where... and your dissent, you say... I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg dissent says that a State... you can have these class actions."
1995.95-386,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,852.413,854.955,"What was the name of your Missouri case, Mr. Baxley?"
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,854.955,856.875,"Waters v. St. Louis, and there's--"
1995.95-386,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,856.875,860.639,Where is it... I don't see it in the index to your brief.
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,860.639,874.667,"--Your Honor, it's in our... I know that it's in our... oh, the amicus... the amicus found this case for us, the amicus of the counties found that case and had that in their green brief, and then we, I think, cited it in our reply brief."
1995.95-386,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,874.667,874.967,Thank you.
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,874.967,919.016,"But that was Water v. St. Louis, and there is a concurring opinion, two sentences, one paragraph, by Justice Douglas, joined in by Justice Black, where Justice Douglas says that I'll go with the rest of the Court on the reading that the Missouri supreme court has not considered this scheme right now so it's not right, but when it comes up again and is considered, this case... but I bow to their reading of the record, saving for a future day the serious and substantial question on the Equal Protection Clause raised by the regulations which grant employers deductions for taxes paid the Federal Government, yet do not allow employees a deduction for the same tax."
1995.95-386,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,921.37,929.904,"Well, that sounds like a case in which the employees and the employers all had some property interest that was being taken away from them by the tax."
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,933.137,935.127,"--That's what we have here, Your Honor."
1995.95-386,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,935.127,964.937,"I know it is, but the questions we have been propounding to you are... which you simply haven't responded to, at least so far as I can tell, are the other situations, where, as Justice Ginsburg puts it, you have a taxpayer's action where the taxpayer is really a private Attorney General saying, we don't like... we think this money is being spent in violation of the Constitution, even though they suffer no particularized injury, and the question is whether that kind of a case isn't perhaps different."
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,964.937,966.139,I think it is different.
1995.95-386,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,967.519,980.856,"Well then, in order to agree with you, we don't have to go as far as you initially urged us, to say that in every case where a State allows suit it has to allow that a later plaintiff can bring the same suit."
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,992.927,1000.451,"I think at the time of the first action our client didn't have any standing, period, because the scheme had not gone into effect yet."
1995.95-386,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1000.451,1005.223,"No, but let's assume this scheme is in effect and it's a Federal scheme rather than a State or county scheme."
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1010.906,1012.989,Yes.
1995.95-386,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1013.778,1032.101,"Well, it seems to me that that's the only point you need sustain, that in the type of a lawsuit where there would be standing under the Federal law of standing, in that type of lawsuit, at least, you cannot preclude a plaintiff who was not actually bound by the first judgment."
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1032.101,1033.483,I agree.
1995.95-386,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1033.483,1039.387,Can I agree with that more limited proposition and perhaps find for you on that basis?
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1039.387,1041.738,"Your Honor, you can find for us on any basis."
1995.95-386,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1177.034,1183.078,"But here... isn't it true that in this case, although it wasn't litigated, it was raised in the complaint, wasn't it, in the earlier case?"
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1183.078,1185.98,It was raised... it was alluded to in the complaint--
1995.95-386,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1185.98,1190.384,"Well, they quote... the allegation is that the statute violates the equal Protection Clause."
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1192.265,1193.196,--It was alleged--
1995.95-386,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1193.196,1194.886,--But not passed on by the--
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1194.886,1198.079,"--It was not passed on by any court, and I would cite there--"
1995.95-386,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1198.079,1200.871,--But it is clear that it could have been raised in that case--
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1200.871,1201.221,--Yes.
1995.95-386,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1201.221,1202.433,--because it was before the court.
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1202.433,1203.431,"In fact, I think--"
1995.95-386,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1203.431,1206.603,What if they had... what if they had actually litigated it?
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1222.215,1228.369,"--I don't think that our position would... we might take that position, but I don't think our... we would succeed."
1995.95-386,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1228.369,1231.632,"--Well, wouldn't you still claim that there was no privity?"
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1231.632,1232.631,Yes.
1995.95-386,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1232.631,1233.072,So on that--
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1234.864,1235.405,Not privity.
1995.95-386,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1235.405,1235.765,No.
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1235.765,1242.018,"We've got... if you look at what... issue preclusion, or collateral estoppel doesn't apply here."
1995.95-386,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1259.197,1262.57,"Well, it lurked in the complaint... it didn't lurk, it was there in plain English."
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1277.32,1277.971,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-386,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1277.971,1278.952,The absence of privity.
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1278.952,1280.062,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-386,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1280.062,1280.453,Yes.
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1280.453,1290.039,"The absence of privity is certainly one of our strong arguments, and in every... almost every case that's cited in their briefs that in any way is contrary to us is... where you did have--"
1995.95-386,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1290.039,1292.36,But I... but the... Justice O'Connor raised it earlier.
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1302.657,1304.079,"--I'm sure there are, but this is not--"
1995.95-386,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1304.079,1305.56,But they're all unconstitutional?
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1305.56,1306.221,--what we're talking about here.
1995.95-386,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1307.713,1311.617,"Typically it would be a statute allowing a challenge to the issue of municipal bonds, or something--"
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1316.659,1318.732,A validation suit.
1995.95-386,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1318.732,1318.993,Yes.
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1318.993,1320.456,Bond validation type suits.
1995.95-386,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1336.297,1337.96,"--That's not alleged here, is it?"
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1338.709,1338.959,No.
1995.95-386,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1338.959,1339.34,You're not--
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1343.623,1343.944,That's right.
1995.95-386,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1343.944,1346.395,"--and that's what you've got, and you're claiming that in those cases--"
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1346.395,1346.846,That's right.
1995.95-386,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1346.846,1350.599,--you've got to have some privity for a... issue or claim preclusion.
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1350.599,1350.859,"Yes, sir."
1995.95-386,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1350.859,1364.167,"And we just finished discussing that whole taxpayer suit category, and now we're into taxpayer who says, I got this tax bill and I've paid it and I want a refund, or the situation that you're in."
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1406.956,1418.524,"Because the... I don't think you can cut off someone's right to litigate a constitutional issue that's affecting them, and... but we don't have that situation here."
1995.95-386,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1471.909,1473.509,I don't understand that at all.
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1484.926,1487.277,--Nobody had been collecting it from them yet.
1995.95-386,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1487.277,1489.931,"Yes, but they... that's true of the whole case, wasn't it?"
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1489.931,1490.318,Yes.
1995.95-386,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1490.318,1494.633,And the court nevertheless went ahead and adjudicated the merits of the issues that it thought important.
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1494.633,1495.822,"Yes, sir."
1995.95-386,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1495.822,1498.126,I don't understand your prematurity argument.
1995.95-386,0,44022,william_j_baxley,,1498.126,1504.19,"That was just mentioned in the St. Louis case, and the exemption scheme was definitely never even attacked."
1995.95-386,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1506.781,1508.572,"Very well, Mr. Baxley."
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,1510.743,1516.058,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-386,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1538.15,1541.483,"Well, he claims that he's not attacking class actions."
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,1541.483,1571.943,"Justice Souter, I believe that by trying to rest this case on the authority, among others, of Martin v. Wilks, totally ignoring footnote number 2, in which the Chief Justice reserved from the implications of that case the whole panoply of representational suits, first of all as typified by Hansberry v. Lee, and also the second cite in the footnote was Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure--"
1995.95-386,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1571.943,1578.498,But I think his point is that there is no legitimate sense in which this can be called a representational suit.
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,1578.498,1579.857,"--Well, I think he--"
1995.95-386,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1579.857,1584.291,He is claiming that his clients want to sue simply as taxpayers.
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,1602.343,1606.765,"--That may be his argument, but it is both historically and factually incorrect."
1995.95-386,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1618.365,1619.625,But that is not... we've just been all around that.
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,1665.455,1675.199,"--Well, class actions under (b)(1) and (b)(2), which he is trying to certify in the petitioners' case, is exactly that kind of case."
1995.95-386,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1684.036,1685.738,That's usually an injunction case.
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,1685.738,1685.998,--No.
1995.95-386,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1690.721,1698.067,"Give me an example of a money relief case, a case involving money, where people can be cut out without any notice."
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,1698.067,1702.689,(b)(1) is an appropriate vehicle--
1995.95-386,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1702.689,1703.781,(b)(1) of what?
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,1705.17,1711.455,"--Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as well as Rule 23 of the Alabama Rules of Civil Procedure, which are exactly identical."
1995.95-386,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1731.077,1733.53,"Well, Bedingfield was not a class action, was it?"
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,1733.53,1734.479,"--Yes, it was."
1995.95-386,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1734.479,1736.272,I thought it was brought by--
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,1736.272,1736.72,It was--
1995.95-386,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1736.72,1741.585,--It was two actions brought by individuals in the City of Birmingham.
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,1741.585,1745.776,"--That is the important distinction here, Your Honor, if I may make that."
1995.95-386,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1760.675,1763.277,"Bedingfield was not... let's clarify this, if we may."
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,1763.277,1763.908,--But it was a class action.
1995.95-386,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1763.908,1764.579,Was it brought--
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,1764.579,1765.41,In the name--
1995.95-386,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1765.41,1767.921,--expressly as a class action--
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,1767.921,1768.272,--No.
1995.95-386,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1768.272,1769.634,--and allowed as such?
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,1769.634,1776.347,"No, but it did not need to be in order to be so treated for due process purposes, and that's the precise point."
1995.95-386,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1779.779,1806.257,"Mr. Slaughter, how does your argument stand against an important precedent in this Court, a case called Mullane v. Hanover Bank, where the Court explained if someone's interest is being affected there has to be an effort to tell that person, not the best service that money could buy, but some notice?"
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,1806.257,1818.626,"--The distinction between due process and Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank is that the holders of the trust, common trust interest in that case were not represented by anybody."
1995.95-386,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1821.788,1826.01,Why weren't they represented by the people who were there?
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,1829.102,1838.176,--And that element to some degree was used by the court as a justification for not requiring a stricter standard of notice.
1995.95-386,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1851.286,1864.016,"Why, if... assuming that... I mean, you may... I think you may be right that (b)(2) is implicated here, but I thought there's a mistake the State court seemed to have made."
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,1923.344,1929.138,"Justice Breyer, neither under (b)(1) or (b)(2) of Rule 23 is notice required."
1995.95-386,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1929.138,1931.239,I know it does not say that in the rule.
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,1958.708,1967.033,The explanation of that is to be found in the history of Rule 23 and the version that existed from 1938 to 1966.
1995.95-386,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1995.523,1996.064,Did they bind?
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,1997.033,1997.804,And it was binding.
1995.95-386,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1997.804,2012.553,"--Why, because normally you'd think, in a situation where you're proceeding against an injunction, for example, for a nuisance, you would have thought the first person to sue is going to win or lose, and then stare decisis will take care of the rest."
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2041.282,2045.545,The notice provisions of current Federal Rule 23 and all of the--

1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2048.397,2049.647,--Neither to (b)--
1995.95-386,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2049.647,2050.308,--and I'm asking why.
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2050.308,2051.86,--Neither to (b)(1) nor (b)(2).
1995.95-386,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2053.282,2055.733,"Mr. Slaughter, that's not quite right, is it?"
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2095.621,2120.555,"--I think that provision of the rule is a very useful admonition and a very cautionary one, and a very valuable tool in the management of class actions, but I do not think it is mandatory for due process analysis where you have plaintiffs, representative parties who truly represent the class in a public and impersonal question of the kind implicated in this case, namely, just the constitutional validity of this tax."
1995.95-386,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2120.555,2127.931,"--Well, why isn't that... why isn't that not a (b)(1) or (b)(2) kind of suit, but, rather, a (b)(3) suit?"
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2140.498,2156.489,"I submit, Justice Scalia, and I believe the historical precedent for this kind of suit is on my side, that in this kind of case there is really only a pure public question in a purely legal sense."
1995.95-386,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2170.07,2173.17,"--Well, why isn't... why isn't this a property right here?"
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2173.17,2174.922,--I beg your pardon?
1995.95-386,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2174.922,2193.582,"Why isn't there a property right here being asserted by the plaintiffs in the present action, a right of action created by section 1983 authorizing individuals to sue for violation of their individual, equal protection rights?"
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2197.435,2199.506,"Well, the fact--"
1995.95-386,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2199.506,2199.986,Isn't it?
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2199.986,2203.69,"--Well, I agree, Your Honor, it is a kind of--"
1995.95-386,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2203.69,2227.646,"And in order for a prior suit to somehow take away that property right and that cause of action, wouldn't we think due process would require some kind of notice, and wouldn't we also think it would require some kind of adequate representation of these plaintiffs in the prior suit?"
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2227.646,2229.126,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1995.95-386,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2229.126,2236.732,Has there been any determination of adequate representation in Bedingfield of these plaintiffs and their suit?
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2236.732,2250.45,"You have put your finger on the essential due process issue in this whole case, and the one that we would submit, if it is due for remand, that would be the first question that would be appropriate for the Court to determine, namely the adequacy of the representation in Bedingfield."
1995.95-386,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2252.113,2264.89,"So long as the Court satisfies itself that counsel is an adequate counsel, other people who don't want to be represented by this counsel must be held to whatever he achieves, is that the principle you're urging for?"
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2265.721,2266.302,--Yes--
1995.95-386,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2266.302,2274.977,"--I thought if I had a cause of action, even if it involves a legal issue that's common to causes of action that other people have, I'm entitled to hire my own counsel and go litigate that myself."
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2287.345,2294.271,"--To a limited extent in this kind of case, Your Honor, and--"
1995.95-386,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2294.271,2294.849,What kind of case is that?
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2295.69,2295.93,--And--
1995.95-386,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2295.93,2297.441,--about this kind of case from the cases that--
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2297.441,2298.272,--The litigation--
1995.95-386,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2298.272,2299.193,--Justice Breyer was asking about?
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2299.193,2308.119,--The litigation of purely public questions that are necessary to the operation of State and local government with some degree of reliability and finality.
1995.95-386,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2309.018,2311.83,"What is the purely public question, in your view?"
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2311.83,2314.973,"--Many, Your Honor."
1995.95-386,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2326.293,2327.585,The validity of any State statute?
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2327.585,2330.887,"Many, but--"
1995.95-386,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2330.887,2331.528,Well--
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2331.528,2341.354,"--more so with regard to those that govern the nature of State and local government, and I can't give you an ironclad rule to sort them out, but--"
1995.95-386,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2341.354,2345.217,"--Well, why does a county occupation tax govern the nature of government?"
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2345.217,2351.2,"--It does not govern the nature of government, Your Honor."
1995.95-386,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2374.595,2375.376,When you say historic--
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2400.313,2402.545,"No, that's... absolutely not."
1995.95-386,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2402.545,2403.824,Why is that any different?
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2404.826,2422.227,"Because of the nature of the representational suit, whether it be formally, structurally certified as a class so that the representative proceeds under those rules, or whether it proceeds in the manner represented by Hansberry v. Lee, and which was prior to the adoption of State rules--"
1995.95-386,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2422.227,2424.799,"Mr. Slaughter, why do we bother having class actions at all?"
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2454.759,2464.635,"--Those who verge on the... on legal anarchy I think would advocate that, and there is a strong--"
1995.95-386,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2464.635,2472.429,But you are... are you saying that there are... sometimes you do need a class action with the court to certify the class and notice to the members.
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2480.123,2510.504,"--I cannot distinguish all, but I can tell you that the very class of case that we're talking about today, cases which need to determine with some degree of finality and reliability State and local government issues do need the possibility of class adjudication, whether it be in the traditional form which I say the Bedingfield case was, or certified as a (b)(1) or (b)(2) class, as the petitioners seek to do in this case."
1995.95-386,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2532.089,2541.016,"But isn't it true that in the governmental context, normally the government feels comfortable proceeding with all the risks, reliance on the doctrine of stare decisis?"
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2558.716,2565.739,"Well, as I mentioned in our brief, Justice Stevens, we are not going to insist on claim preclusion in this case."
1995.95-386,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2611.451,2612.092,Mr. Slaughter--
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2637.416,2640.809,"--With all due respect, Your Honor, I think it is present in this case."
1995.95-386,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2662.585,2664.275,But that only goes to res judicata.
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2683.509,2710.286,"Your Honor, what I am trying to say in that argument, and for that purpose we cited Grubb v. Public Service Commission of Ohio, was that as a rule of decision, not... having nothing to do with res judicata, just what first of all was decided, before we get to whether or not that decision precluded anything, the proper rule is that the equal protection question was decided in the case."
1995.95-386,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2720.154,2723.616,"Right, and that's the reason for Justice Ginsburg's question and my question."
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2742.948,2744.378,You're absolutely--
1995.95-386,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2744.378,2748.271,"It may have cut off the parties to the first case, but it is not going to cut off anyone else."
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2748.271,2750.592,"--On that point, you are correct, Your Honor."
1995.95-386,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2776.0,2784.275,"Well, on that, could you go back to Justice Stevens' and Justice O'Connor's question for just a second, because it seemed to me that on... there are two equal protection claims, I think, that were raised."
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2862.345,2881.509,"No, I did not, Your Honor, and that is precisely the reason why in the brief I said that perhaps the Alabama supreme court painted too broadly with the claim preclusion brush for purposes of due process, and that it might be more... a kinder and gentler due process application if, in fact, it were limited to issue preclusion."
1995.95-386,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2881.509,2886.84,"And if that were so, then I guess it wasn't just that there was no finding that the representation was adequate."
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2890.543,2936.613,"Well, Your Honor, with regard to this notice, I can answer nothing, other than usage that has been sanctioned for many years as a settled practice meets the requirements of due process, because in fact, if you examine the history of this kind of representational suit in equity, the precursor of Rule 23 between 1938 and 1966 and its present operation with regard to (b)(1) and (b)(2) classes, which are the suitable vehicle for this kind of public issue, notice is not required in order to establish a class that is binding on all of the members of that class, provided that there has been fair and adequate representation of the class interest."
1995.95-386,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2942.718,2971.097,"Mr. Slaughter, you mentioned that you case is a little shaky on the claim preclusion part, but you say it's solid on issue preclusion, and since you do have a decision of the highest court of your State, is there, in fact, any difference between stare decisis and issue preclusion with respect to these issues, the ones that were actually litigated and decided all the way up the line in Alabama?"
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,2975.288,2994.673,"--Just the necessity of going through the relitigation of this particular case again, Your Honor, and the fact that if someone doesn't like the opinion of the Alabama supreme court in that case, yet another plaintiff may bring the public law equivalent of a strike suit."
1995.95-386,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2994.673,3006.251,"But you can always bring a suit, and in both cases it seems to me the other side would move for summary judgment and one case would say, issue preclusion, and the other case would say, stare decisis."
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,3006.251,3023.01,"But, Your Honor, I think you would acknowledge that there is always a little bit more of a chink to get through the opening provided by stare decisis than there is with res judicata, because the law evolves, and that is taken into account with stare decisis."
1995.95-386,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3023.01,3025.321,There's a little more wriggle room.
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,3025.321,3026.834,"More wriggle room, because you have more cases."

1995.95-386,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3058.403,3061.685,"I'm saying no... not class action, because Bedingfield was not a class action."
1995.95-386,1,46220,william_m_slaughter,,3061.685,3063.275,"Well, the most--"
1995.95-386,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3063.275,3064.868,Can you give me a case that--

1995.95-386,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3304.569,3306.459,"Of course, that was a Fifth Circuit case, wasn't it?"
