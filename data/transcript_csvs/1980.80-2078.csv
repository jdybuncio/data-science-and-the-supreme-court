1980.80-2078,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.824,"We will hear arguments this morning in No. 80-2078, Dames & Moore v. The Secretary of the Treasury."
1980.80-2078,0,19162,c_stephen_howard,,20.853,23.88,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.80-2078,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,96.306,98.789,"What was the basis of the federal district court jurisdiction, Mr. Howard?"
1980.80-2078,0,19162,c_stephen_howard,,98.789,118.155,"--The federal district court jurisdiction was premised on 28 USC Section 1330, and the provisions of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, in particular Section 1605, the section that deals with whether or not certain states are immune from suit and sets out the grounds therein."
1980.80-2078,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,131.963,135.431,So that it is not based upon diversity of citizenship?
1980.80-2078,0,19162,c_stephen_howard,,135.431,135.993,It was not.
1980.80-2078,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,150.112,157.311,"Mr. Howard, your lawsuit was not commenced until after the seizure of the hostages by Iran, was it?"
1980.80-2078,0,19162,c_stephen_howard,,157.311,158.405,"That is correct, that is correct."
1980.80-2078,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,177.007,178.991,Was that after the blocking order?
1980.80-2078,0,19162,c_stephen_howard,,178.991,181.24,It was after the blocking order; yes.
1980.80-2078,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,334.193,343.768,"Is that the one that the Government has said it would urge, and urge the American petitioners before the tribunal to urge that there has been such a change of affairs that--"
1980.80-2078,0,19162,c_stephen_howard,,343.768,350.686,"As I understand the Government's position, in its way, in its brief, it's very careful, I notice, on this."
1980.80-2078,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,420.33,424.032,"--And who picks the neutral members, the so-called neutral members?"
1980.80-2078,0,19162,c_stephen_howard,,424.032,425.688,"As I understand it, they have to be mutually selected."
1980.80-2078,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,425.688,428.234,By the other members of the court?
1980.80-2078,0,19162,c_stephen_howard,,428.234,428.654,By the two adversary--
1980.80-2078,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,428.654,430.107,Haven't they been selected?
1980.80-2078,0,19162,c_stephen_howard,,430.107,438.088,"--The Government's brief advises us... none of this is in the record, but the Government's brief states that three arbitrators have been picked."
1980.80-2078,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,440.9,442.665,Three United States arbitrators?
1980.80-2078,0,19162,c_stephen_howard,,442.665,445.289,"And three neutrals, according to the Government's brief."
1980.80-2078,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,445.289,448.132,"But the other six haven't been picked, have they?"
1980.80-2078,0,19162,c_stephen_howard,,448.132,458.128,"Again according to the Government's brief, the Iranians have named their three, the United States have named their three, and the other three have been selected although nothing has happened yet."
1980.80-2078,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,479.712,484.569,Is there any suggestion that we have to decide whether they can or cannot... whether you can or cannot go?
1980.80-2078,0,19162,c_stephen_howard,,484.569,489.553,"No, I don't think that's a question that... first of all, the Court couldn't dispositively resolve that in any event."
1980.80-2078,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,518.306,525.194,"Mr. Howard, before you leave the forum selection clause, has the district court in this case decided the effect of that clause on federal jurisdiction yet?"
1980.80-2078,0,19162,c_stephen_howard,,525.194,525.849,--No.
1980.80-2078,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,550.121,555.025,"Was that perfectly clear, or does Iran possibly take the position that the clause means what it says?"
1980.80-2078,0,19162,c_stephen_howard,,555.025,558.117,I am confident Iran takes the position that the clause means what it says.
1980.80-2078,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,558.117,560.383,But has the district court passed on that contention of Iran?
1980.80-2078,0,19162,c_stephen_howard,,560.383,560.648,No.
1980.80-2078,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,587.528,588.794,"No, I'm not sure I made my question clear."
1980.80-2078,0,19162,c_stephen_howard,,590.65,591.135,Right.
1980.80-2078,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,591.135,598.835,"--They might argue that instead of... say there was no tribunal, would they agree that they'd have to litigate in a United States court as opposed to an Iranian court?"
1980.80-2078,0,19162,c_stephen_howard,,598.835,599.397,"Oh, no."
1980.80-2078,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,611.284,614.001,And the federal district court has not decided one way or the other on it?
1980.80-2078,0,19162,c_stephen_howard,,614.001,623.466,"--Did not decide that question, although that particular question was not contested in the hearing that took place on our judgment."
1980.80-2078,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,623.466,634.103,"But, in any event, Mr. Howard, the form of your clause requires preliminary conciliation or arbitration by the three-member group?"
1980.80-2078,0,19162,c_stephen_howard,,634.103,635.477,In Iran.
1980.80-2078,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,635.477,639.398,"Before the clause, at least, requires you to go to the courts of Iran?"
1980.80-2078,0,19162,c_stephen_howard,,639.398,640.944,That is correct.
1980.80-2078,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,744.387,754.461,Do you regard the later executive order signed by President Reagan as going further than the executive order signed by President Carter?
1980.80-2078,0,19162,c_stephen_howard,,754.461,773.781,"In logic I think the answer to that is yes, because one of the issues before the Court is whether or not the Executive has the unfettered discretion to settle in his own whim, or for good reason, as he sees it, the claims of Americans against foreign states."
1980.80-2078,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,876.757,880.645,Do you think the district court ruled on your takings clause claim?
1980.80-2078,0,19162,c_stephen_howard,,880.645,884.268,You mean on the forum selection clause?
1980.80-2078,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,884.268,887.033,"No, on your Fifth Amendment--"
1980.80-2078,0,19162,c_stephen_howard,,887.033,889.048,We presented that argument to the district court.
1980.80-2078,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,903.995,913.991,"Incidentally, Mr. Howard, your attachments were obtained based on licenses that you secured under the regulations?"
1980.80-2078,0,19162,c_stephen_howard,,913.991,916.88,"Well, we didn't actually go secure them in the sense of making an application."
1980.80-2078,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2472.901,2475.29,Mr. Chief Justice; may it please the Court:
1980.80-2078,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2589.916,2591.244,"2,500 claims?"
1980.80-2078,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2591.244,2593.072,--That is correct; that is correct.
1980.80-2078,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2600.178,2605.317,How would that be enforced if the Government of Iran?
1980.80-2078,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2605.317,2609.691,Traditional ways that international obligations are enforced.
1980.80-2078,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2616.343,2624.403,"Well, those traditional forces didn't seem to prevail in the seizure of the hostages themselves, did they?"
1980.80-2078,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2624.403,2642.036,"There is another available remedy because of this settlement, Justice Stewart, that was also not available prior to the agreement itself, and that is that any of the tribunal's awards are enforceable in the courts of any country in the world."
1980.80-2078,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2642.036,2644.519,But that doesn't answer the Chief Justice's question.
1980.80-2078,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2644.519,2653.781,"No, it does not, and of course this Court cannot know and no one can know to what extent any country may conform with its international obligations."
1980.80-2078,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2653.781,2657.279,"And the more you read the newspapers, the more doubts you have."
1980.80-2078,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2657.279,2670.494,"Yes, and yet, Justice Rehnquist, I think that it would be improper for an American court to base a judgment on the assumption that a foreign nation will or will not conform to its obligations."
1980.80-2078,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2670.494,2672.056,We're not dealing here with an assumption.
1980.80-2078,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2673.603,2683.676,"Historical fact also includes the fact that in addition to the settlement fund in the initial amount of $1 billion, which is more than they had in the first place--"
1980.80-2078,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2683.676,2684.067,Yes?
1980.80-2078,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2684.067,2704.089,"--they do also have the right to go into the courts of any country in the world and when you take into account the fact that we're dealing here with a country that is very active in commercial oil international transactions, the likelihood that there will be assets available in many countries of the world is rather high."
1980.80-2078,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2704.932,2708.573,Unless Iran isolates itself totally from the rest of the world and?
1980.80-2078,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2708.573,2712.413,"--From the rest of the world, and it would be paying a very high price if it did that, of course."
1980.80-2078,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2712.413,2715.288,"Mr. Lee, how much are we really talking--"
1980.80-2078,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2717.163,2736.078,"Well, all I'm saying is, Justice Stevens, that while it is true, as this Court said in United States v. Pink, that this kind of authority in the President has a much broader use than just the assurance of the rights of American claimants."
1980.80-2078,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2758.38,2763.55,"That goes to whether it was a good deal or not, it doesn't go to whether the President had the power to make the deal."
1980.80-2078,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2763.55,2764.55,--That is correct.
1980.80-2078,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2764.55,2768.844,"Well, but so far in your argument, you're just telling us what a good deal it was."
1980.80-2078,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2768.844,2782.98,"Well, all I am saying is, Justice Stewart, that the proposition that this was used solely as a bargaining chip for the release of the hostages does not tell the entire story."
1980.80-2078,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2786.836,2792.303,"Thus far your entire argument has just been directed to what a favorable, how much all these claimants have been helped."
1980.80-2078,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2792.303,2795.099,"--Well, so far I've only been going for five minutes and I do intend to get to--"
1980.80-2078,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2795.099,2795.63,I know.
1980.80-2078,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2795.63,2801.487,--This was solely a matter of flushing out the facts.
1980.80-2078,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2873.131,2876.707,"Mr. Lee, is this independent of any compensation clause question?"
1980.80-2078,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2876.707,2879.362,"That is correct, and I hope to get to the compensation--"
1980.80-2078,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2879.362,2881.361,What is the Government position on that?
1980.80-2078,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2881.361,2890.905,"--The Government's position on compensation is this, Justice Rehnquist, that the Petitioner's claims for compensation are premature at this time."
1980.80-2078,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2902.508,2914.113,So the Government doesn't concede they would have any remedy under the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment if in fact they do suffer loss?
1980.80-2078,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2914.113,2932.028,"Well, I find it difficult to take the position that the exception that Judge Duffy found in the Tucker Act jurisdiction under the treaty exception could be applicable."
1980.80-2078,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2948.084,2963.281,"So, am I to conclude that you suggest it would not be inappropriate in this case, or that the issue of the remedy in the Court of Claims may be decided?"
1980.80-2078,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2963.281,2966.858,"Well, I think--"
1980.80-2078,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2966.858,2971.544,I thought the Government's position up to now had been that that issue was premature also.
1980.80-2078,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2971.544,2983.758,"--Well, I think it is premature and the reason that it's premature is because of the fact that we don't know as of this point in time whether or not any damage has been suffered or will be suffered by these claimants."
1980.80-2078,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2983.758,2986.303,You mean that's because of the availability of other fora?
1980.80-2078,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2986.303,2986.788,That is correct.
1980.80-2078,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2986.788,2992.738,"The arbitration commission is one and what, the courts of Iran are another?"
1980.80-2078,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2992.738,2995.456,"Well, principally what the--"
1980.80-2078,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2995.456,3000.547,"And as for this Petitioner, there is, I gather, also this intermediate--"
1980.80-2078,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,3000.547,3001.719,--Conciliation effort.
1980.80-2078,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3001.719,3002.031,--Yes.
1980.80-2078,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,3002.031,3021.476,"Because, under President Reagan's February 24 order, all that happens to these federal claims is that they are suspended, they are not terminated, and in the event that the tribunal determines that it does not have jurisdiction, then that suspension itself is terminated and they can proceed with their claims."
1980.80-2078,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3021.476,3033.878,"Well, then, do I understand, the Government does not take the position that the mere availability of another forum or fora, merely that, answers the taking claim?"
1980.80-2078,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,3033.878,3036.206,"Well, it makes it--"
1980.80-2078,2,43361,thomas_g_shack_jr,,4804.157,4807.202,Mr. Chief Justice; may it please the Court:
1980.80-2078,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4891.621,4901.93,"Well, Mr. Shack, what if that agreement had included a provision sending Justice Stewart to Teheran indefinitely?"
1980.80-2078,2,43361,thomas_g_shack_jr,,4911.192,4936.947,"Well, I think that Justice Stewart would probably have to pack a bag and... the short answer is, to whatever extent such an agreement would infringe upon the constitutional rights of a citizen and was struck down as being unconstitutional, it would not be binding as a matter of domestic law, and I doubt that anyone would try to put Justice Stewart on a plane."
1980.80-2078,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4949.598,4953.705,"But that isn't the question that we're facing here, is it?"
1980.80-2078,2,43361,thomas_g_shack_jr,,4953.705,4957.923,"No, that is not the question that we are faced with here today."
1980.80-2078,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5032.689,5040.92,What if part of the agreement had provided that for one year no one should criticize the Ayatollah in this country?
1980.80-2078,2,43361,thomas_g_shack_jr,,5047.933,5067.284,"Well, again, despite the inconsistency with domestic law, the United States would be obligated by virtue of its good faith commitment to attempt to accomplish the objectives of the agreement."
1980.80-2078,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5078.108,5088.23,But you're saying that under international law they are bound to carry out an agreement if such an Executive would have done so.
1980.80-2078,2,43361,thomas_g_shack_jr,,5088.23,5091.134,"Yes, I would suggest that that is true."
1980.80-2078,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5236.529,5237.105,May I ask a question on that point?
1980.80-2078,2,43361,thomas_g_shack_jr,,5246.289,5250.742,"--Mr. Justice Stevens, what is my understanding of the obligation of the?"
1980.80-2078,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5250.742,5251.929,The United States.
1980.80-2078,2,43361,thomas_g_shack_jr,,5255.552,5260.473,"Yes, the clear language of the agreement seems to require that."
1980.80-2078,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5260.473,5273.013,"No, I'm not... I didn't say that it would require, is that satisfaction of the American obligation under the treaties, to have the claims suspended, merely suspended subject to reinstatement if the arbitration tribunal refuses jurisdiction?"
1980.80-2078,2,43361,thomas_g_shack_jr,,5273.013,5285.711,"Well, the tribunal itself will probably be the ultimate judge of that since it has jurisdiction on such matters, but the clear language requires termination rather than suspension."
1980.80-2078,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5301.392,5304.173,"No, I'm talking about cases in which the tribunal declines jurisdiction."
1980.80-2078,2,43361,thomas_g_shack_jr,,5310.327,5325.758,--The agreement provides that where there is a specific forum clause containing specific language with respect to Iran's jurisdiction that those cases will not go to the jurisdiction of the tribunal; yes.
1980.80-2078,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5325.758,5334.286,"And does it satisfy the United States' obligation under the treaty, merely to suspend those claims pending the decision of whether the tribunal takes jurisdiction?"
1980.80-2078,2,43361,thomas_g_shack_jr,,5334.286,5336.113,Yes.
1980.80-2078,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5336.113,5341.845,Is it fair to ask you a more technical question?
1980.80-2078,2,43361,thomas_g_shack_jr,,5351.623,5352.355,Yes.
1980.80-2078,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5352.355,5377.472,"If the President had not vested the assets in that case, there had been no vesting order, just the freeze followed by an attachment, would the Trading with the Enemy Act have allowed the President to unfreeze the assets and return the assets to the foreign nation free of the attachment?"
1980.80-2078,2,43361,thomas_g_shack_jr,,5377.472,5382.453,I believe that it would.
1980.80-2078,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5382.453,5387.311,"Well, Orvis said that the attachment was good against the foreign country."
1980.80-2078,2,43361,thomas_g_shack_jr,,5399.306,5426.653,"Well, I believe the... I believe that the power of the Executive... or the power of the Congress to attach the assets of the foreign sovereign is, when it's specifically enunciated, prevails."
1980.80-2078,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5426.653,5431.917,Your time has expired.
1980.80-2078,2,43361,thomas_g_shack_jr,,5431.917,5433.949,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.80-2078,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5450.097,5458.532,Mr. Lieberman.
1980.80-2078,3,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,5458.532,5461.063,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.80-2078,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5546.793,5551.697,Are you saying this power exists in the President without any congressional delegation?
1980.80-2078,3,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,5551.697,5552.931,Absolutely.
1980.80-2078,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5553.852,5559.865,What if Congress said that the President shall not in the future settle any foreign claims?
1980.80-2078,3,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,5559.865,5566.708,--That would raise substantial constitutional questions.
1980.80-2078,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5566.708,5568.55,And the President signed the bill?
1980.80-2078,3,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,5568.55,5584.825,The President... that President may have signed the bill but the question is whether constitutionally that Congress and that President can limit the power of the Presidency as an institution.
1980.80-2078,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5710.523,5713.022,"Well, under your theory they didn't really need to enact the Act, did they?"
1980.80-2078,3,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,5713.022,5716.521,I'm not sure I understand the question.
1980.80-2078,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5716.521,5724.346,"Well, on what you've been saying up to now, with the broad general powers of the President, they didn't need the Act, did they?"
1980.80-2078,3,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,5724.346,5724.799,The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act?
1980.80-2078,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5724.799,5725.408,Yes.
1980.80-2078,3,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,5726.565,5731.109,The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act did not deal with the claims settlement power.
1980.80-2078,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5892.777,5896.073,"Well, then, you're not relying just on the President acting all by himself."
1980.80-2078,3,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,5899.869,5901.197,"Oh, absolutely."
1980.80-2078,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5943.757,5949.224,"Mr. Lieberman, does your... this is a political question... argument go also to the taking issue?"
1980.80-2078,3,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,5949.224,5952.956,"In a sense, yes, Mr. Justice Brennan, but--"
1980.80-2078,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5952.956,5956.189,In that the whole works should be dismissed out of the courts?
1980.80-2078,3,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,5956.189,5958.579,"--Well, the question of compensation."
1980.80-2078,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6016.213,6020.054,A Court of Claims remedy doesn't solve the takings question.
1980.80-2078,3,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,6022.6,6024.178,"Oh, I'm not saying there was a taking."
1980.80-2078,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6024.178,6024.803,"Well, you were."
1980.80-2078,3,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,6024.803,6027.099,"Then, I'll correct myself."
1980.80-2078,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6033.611,6035.907,Whether there was a taking still remains to be decided.
1980.80-2078,3,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,6035.907,6036.376,That's right.
1980.80-2078,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6037.452,6038.202,But that's a remedy there.
1980.80-2078,3,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,6046.105,6046.73,--That's correct.
1980.80-2078,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6047.996,6055.211,"My problem on your political question argument is going to suggest that we couldn't, it's none of our business to decide whether there was a taking or not."
1980.80-2078,3,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,6055.211,6057.602,"--Well, I don't think--"
1980.80-2078,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6057.602,6058.789,You don't go that far?
1980.80-2078,3,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,6058.789,6062.615,--I don't think the question is before this Court.
1980.80-2078,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6062.615,6063.787,That's not my question.
1980.80-2078,3,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,6073.485,6083.513,"I think to the extent that the Court addresses the taking issue, it should hold that there is a Tucker Act remedy."
1980.80-2078,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6083.513,6084.841,All right.
1980.80-2078,3,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,6086.761,6087.183,Yeah.
1980.80-2078,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6089.479,6099.225,"The claim is that there has been a taking right now, and that the taking question is not premature, so it is at least... something that is before us."
1980.80-2078,3,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,6099.225,6102.802,"I agree with the position of the Government, the attachment issue is--"
1980.80-2078,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6102.802,6103.379,Of course you do.
1980.80-2078,3,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,6103.879,6118.482,"--there is no taking by the attachment issue because, for the very reason stated by the Government, the attachment of the Petitioner came secondarily to the Government's assertion of a paramount federal interest over these assets."
1980.80-2078,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6118.482,6120.951,--But one of the issues in this case is whether there's been a taking like--
1980.80-2078,3,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,6120.951,6124.074,"Yes, and clearly there has not been a taking at this time."
1980.80-2078,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6124.074,6125.106,"--Well, that's your submission; yes."
1980.80-2078,3,22680,eric_m_lieberman,,6125.903,6128.23,I think this means my time is up.
1980.80-2078,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6128.23,6129.745,"Your time has expired now, Mr. Lieberman."
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6196.639,6200.434,"I'd like to start immediately with that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.80-2078,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6252.538,6263.064,"Meanwhile, in the situation we have here, the hostages wait until Congress acts, or some delicate negotiations with the People's Republic of China, for example, must mark time?"
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6263.064,6265.252,"--First, there's a systematic matter."
1980.80-2078,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6350.359,6352.592,Who would raise this duress defense?
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6352.592,6353.342,The United States.
1980.80-2078,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6354.607,6355.467,Surely not Iran?
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6355.467,6355.903,No.
1980.80-2078,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6356.778,6357.356,Yes.
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6357.356,6366.634,"But if the Administration believes that it's in its interest, in its foreign policy interest to go through with this agreement, it can do it."
1980.80-2078,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6366.634,6381.205,"But realistically, when a great sovereign has negotiated an agreement, even under duress or pressure, but having reached an agreement, can the sovereign then question it on that kind of a ground?"
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6381.205,6384.845,"That, I think, is a question for neither the Court nor for me."
1980.80-2078,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6390.202,6391.421,Are you talking about Congress or the President?
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6393.748,6402.151,"--If we are correct that some of the things that the President agreed to do are outside of his power acting alone, then he needs the Congress."
1980.80-2078,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,6419.424,6420.893,Are you saying you'd have no case if he had done that?
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6420.893,6425.563,"--That's right, I believe that, unfortunately, fortunately or unfortunately, either one is quite clear."
1980.80-2078,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6438.089,6441.416,"Not the Bill of Rights, can't be overridden like--"
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6441.416,6443.104,"--No, I'm not talking about the taking of it."
1980.80-2078,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6473.528,6496.519,"--Mr. Howard, I'm not sure I asked you when you were first up, but the question I asked one of your colleagues, in Orvis if there had been no vesting, the lien, the attachment, would always have been good against the foreign sovereign?"
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6496.519,6498.535,Even an unlicensed attachment.
1980.80-2078,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6500.923,6506.592,"Yes, and doesn't... the President could, your position is, could not have transferred those assets free of that attachment?"
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6506.592,6507.577,That is correct.
1980.80-2078,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6507.577,6512.106,And that's what... and Orvis did say that the attachment was good against the--
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6512.106,6514.042,That's absolutely correct.
1980.80-2078,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6514.042,6516.885,"Now, do you have any further argument about that?"
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6523.008,6524.368,"Well, that's the Government's best case."
1980.80-2078,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6528.148,6533.427,"Well, I know, but Orvis... but Orvis said that the lien was good against a foreign sovereign."
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6533.427,6535.3,"That's right, that's right."
1980.80-2078,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6536.612,6539.19,"Williams said it wasn't good against the President, once he had vested."
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6539.19,6545.718,"--Under the Trading with the Enemy Act, and this gets back to some of the questions that Mr. Justice Stevens was asking."
1980.80-2078,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6562.383,6570.848,"Your argument about the Trading with the Enemy Act is no stronger than it is under the IEEPA, is it?"
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6572.427,6574.722,It's the freezing--
1980.80-2078,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6574.722,6575.784,Except for the vesting?
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6575.784,6577.002,--The freezing language is the same.
1980.80-2078,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6578.549,6582.108,"What authority, do you say, what authority?"
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6594.042,6594.557,I would say two things.
1980.80-2078,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6619.314,6620.75,"Well, that's just your argument in this respect."
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6628.387,6635.447,"No, I say that since he couldn't do it under Trading with the Enemy Act, because that would have made the statute crazy."
1980.80-2078,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,6635.447,6636.728,"Well, wait a minute."
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6643.803,6644.96,"No, no."
1980.80-2078,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,6645.71,6646.866,There are many other purposes.
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6646.866,6651.707,"--First, was to thwart the enemy, and to make sure the enemy couldn't get access to its own property."
1980.80-2078,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,6651.707,6653.362,"And support the war effort in various different ways, too."
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6653.362,6653.753,That's right.
1980.80-2078,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,6655.644,6660.485,"It may have nothing to do with American creditors, and that could be true of freezes as well as vesting orders."
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6660.485,6674.322,"--Although once he vested he had to... yeah, there was a whole claims procedure set up to satisfy even unsecured creditors, people who didn't have property at all but who had a claim against that particular nation."
1980.80-2078,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6674.322,6703.389,"Well, Mr. Howard, don't you think there's something to Professor Henkin's statement in his treatise on international law, or international agreements, in 1972, that the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit adopted, that these things really don't fit neatly into black and white fields, and that it's kind of a skewed situation."
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6745.325,6746.965,I'm sorry.
1980.80-2078,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6748.745,6751.245,That was just a tag end.
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6751.245,6756.993,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I couldn't agree more with the fundamental proposition."
1980.80-2078,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6801.333,6802.224,The new law here is the plaintiff loses.
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6802.224,6806.536,"--No, the Government won't concede that."
1980.80-2078,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6811.393,6813.376,"Well, the rule of law is you lose in this case."
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6813.376,6815.438,--But it's not a substantive rule of law.
1980.80-2078,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,6819.544,6822.918,"No, but you're arguing with Schooner Peggy now, saying that's not a substantive rule of law."
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6822.918,6824.184,"No, no."
1980.80-2078,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,6826.526,6828.212,"That's right, if you lose."
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6839.381,6846.924,"No, I'm saying, the President is saying, I'm not going to decide whether you win or lose but I'm going to make you go to a different court than the one the Congress put you in."
1980.80-2078,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6846.924,6849.658,"Well, if the Government also, though, defends the dismissal?"
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6853.733,6857.076,I believe that is their position.
1980.80-2078,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6857.076,6859.576,Which means that there's a new rule of law.
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6864.09,6874.211,"The Government's position is that our judgment, our final judgment, which surmounted all these alleged difficulties that we've been relieved of, has been annulled."
1980.80-2078,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,6877.521,6882.706,"--Well, they say it's converted into a claim, which is what was in the Schooner Peggy case too."
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6887.831,6895.952,"I think perhaps that it was a mistake for me to engage in dialogue about whether it's a new rule of law or not, because it does obscure the most important point."
1980.80-2078,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6921.472,6923.16,"It might be a taking, but they--"
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6923.16,6925.816,It would still be a taking; you would still have to pay for it.
1980.80-2078,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6940.215,6943.042,"--Let me go back to my original hypothetical, somewhat."
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,6979.152,6994.35,"If the Court were to rule for the Petitioner, and there are future negotiations going on in which the other power wants to achieve some results in courts, I'd say the President had better go to the Congress first and get that authority."
1980.80-2078,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6994.35,6999.847,"I'm putting you in the negotiation, and the foreign sovereign doesn't say, go to Congress."
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,7012.279,7019.557,"I think if the Court were to rule our way, that it would be rather clear, then, that the President couldn't do that, and that's not something that he could bargain with."
1980.80-2078,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7019.557,7025.992,And you suggest that would not impair the President's power to conduct foreign relations and national defense problems?
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,7025.992,7037.645,"The President's inability to compromise or give away claims pending in court would of course be... if he couldn't do that, that's one less thing that he can't do... it's one more thing that he can't do."

1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,7044.626,7045.157,There are a lot of them.
1980.80-2078,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,7045.516,7049.639,He can't raise and support armies.
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,7051.326,7051.763,That's right.
1980.80-2078,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7058.776,7062.009,"And of course, one of your arguments is that he's been forbidden to do this."
1980.80-2078,4,19162,c_stephen_howard,,7062.009,7064.431,"Forbidden, I think, is too strong a word."
1980.80-2078,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7064.773,7068.616,"All right, it's been, that it's inconsistent with the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act."
