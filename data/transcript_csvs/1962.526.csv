1962.526,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,25.353,"Number 526, Adell H. Sherbert, petitioner or appellant, versus Charles V. Verner, et al., as members of South Carolina Employment Security Commission, and Spartan Mills."
1962.526,0,44489,william_d_donnelly,,26.779,28.738,May it please the Court.
1962.526,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,278.078,291.479,[Inaudible]
1962.526,0,44489,william_d_donnelly,,291.479,292.436,That is correct.
1962.526,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,292.436,298.222,[Inaudible]
1962.526,0,44489,william_d_donnelly,,298.222,302.944,"Connected with her work, that’s right, Your Honor."
1962.526,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,440.693,447.445,Is there any dispute at all between the litigants here as to the good faith of her religious beliefs?
1962.526,0,44489,william_d_donnelly,,447.445,451.858,"None whatsoever, Your Honor as I understand it."
1962.526,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,532.483,535.524,What would have been [Inaudible]
1962.526,0,44489,william_d_donnelly,,535.524,554.513,"That appears in the middle of page 4 of my gray brief, and it quotes, “In determining whether or not any work is suitable for an individual, the Commission shall consider the degree of risk involved to his health, safety and morals.”"
1962.526,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,554.513,560.101,What would be the rule [Inaudible] that is applied for the Commission to [Inaudible] --
1962.526,0,44489,william_d_donnelly,,560.101,563.095,"Oh no, no, no, that is a -- this is a negative statement."
1962.526,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,564.017,569.033,[Inaudible]
1962.526,0,44489,william_d_donnelly,,569.033,569.809,That's right.
1962.526,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,571.687,585.747,"The theory – the theory behind that is, is it not, that if the she accepts this as suitable work, I mean, suitable work that she hasn't been trained and experience and any [Inaudible], isn't that correct?"
1962.526,0,44489,william_d_donnelly,,585.747,589.124,"I think that's carried through in the general thinking in the application of this line, sir."
1962.526,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,589.124,596.739,Do you consider the court below in [Inaudible].
1962.526,0,44489,william_d_donnelly,,596.739,600.848,"No, they did not consider as such."
1962.526,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,884.032,898.801,"The difficulty with your argument so far as I'm concerned, Mr. Donnelly is that if the State had done anything other than what it did in this case, it would have violated the Establishment Clause because it would have favored one religion."
1962.526,0,44489,william_d_donnelly,,898.801,914.012,"Well, I think that the -- to say that that's a violation of the Establishment Clause is to give undue weight to the state -- statement that there is a wall of separation between church and state."
1962.526,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,914.012,919.423,I wholeheartedly agree with you but I'm talking about the Establishment Clause that has been construed by this Court.
1962.526,0,44489,william_d_donnelly,,919.423,938.399,I -- I'm not aware of any case that says that to give effect to any person's religious belief is to -- and permit that person to exercise his religious belief is a violation of the Establishment Clause.
1962.526,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,938.399,944.921,The Everson -- the Everson case says that any state which favors one religion violates the Establishment Clause.
1962.526,0,44489,william_d_donnelly,,944.921,946.444,And the Everson --
1962.526,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,946.444,956.638,And so the Act -- the -- the -- if the State took the action which you say should have taken here would have favored the Seventh-day Adventist and therefore would have violated the Establishment Clause.
1962.526,0,44489,william_d_donnelly,,956.638,980.478,"And the Everson case also said, “Neither the State nor the federal government can force or influence a person to go to or to remain away from church against his will or force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion.”"
1962.526,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,983.128,989.647,That -- that's -- that's the -- that touches only Free Exercise Clause of which you are relying on.
1962.526,0,44489,william_d_donnelly,,989.647,991.498,"Well, they're both parts of the same Constitution."
1962.526,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,991.498,991.982,"No, they're not."
1962.526,0,44489,william_d_donnelly,,993.301,994.698,Of the same --
1962.526,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,994.698,995.104,They're both --
1962.526,0,44489,william_d_donnelly,,995.104,996.497,-- amendment and of the same Constitution under which we operate --
1962.526,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,996.497,998.46,Yes.
1962.526,0,44489,william_d_donnelly,,998.46,1000.967,-- that is correct.
1962.526,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1060.796,1066.441,The State must not aid all religions or -- and must not aid any one religion under the Establishment Clause --
1962.526,0,44489,william_d_donnelly,,1066.441,1067.104,This is correct.
1962.526,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1067.104,1068.438,-- as construed by this Court.
1962.526,0,44489,william_d_donnelly,,1068.438,1077.812,I submit that it aids no religion in permitting an individual to practice her or his religion.
1962.526,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1097.072,1102.193,"Well, I agree with you but I'm just suggesting that these statutes are vague."
1962.526,0,44489,william_d_donnelly,,1102.193,1135.646,"Now, continuing, this Court has of course recognized that in the welfare state, the sanctions that maybe imposed by withholding the numerous so-called privileges of compensation for unemployment and public housing and in most recently in the Spicer case, the tax exemption for veterans tantamount to sanctions equivalent to a penalty and I believe, it equate -- with those, equate with a prohibition of law."
1962.526,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1249.275,1257.707,"Does the record show where these other -- what is it, a 150 members of the Jehovah's Witnesses based in Spartanburg, where they -- where they employed?"
1962.526,0,44489,william_d_donnelly,,1257.707,1289.351,"No, it does not, Your Honor, and I think there's something in this record and the appellee nurtures it in a certain extent of the idea that this is a mill town but Spartanburg as this Court may traditionally notice has a population of 47,000 and it has a surrounding county that is build up in a total area or the immediate surroundings are probably approximately 150,000, so that we're not dealing with the one industry town."
1962.526,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1294.647,1296.568,"Excuse me, I meant the Seventh-day Adventist."
1962.526,0,44489,william_d_donnelly,,1296.568,1296.986,Pardon me.
1962.526,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1296.986,1298.323,Yes.
1962.526,0,44489,william_d_donnelly,,1298.323,1318.728,"This Court also said that if the State regulates conduct by enacting a general law within its power, the purpose and effect of which is to advance the State's secular goals, the statute is valid despite its indirect burden on religious observance unless the State may accomplish its purpose by means which do not impose such a burden."
1962.526,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1382.331,1386.131,[Inaudible]
1962.526,0,44489,william_d_donnelly,,1386.131,1396.498,"Practically, all of these laws provide for a hearing before a referee at which I believe there's no limitation on what can be done into it."
1962.526,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1396.498,1398.108,[Inaudible]
1962.526,0,44489,william_d_donnelly,,1398.108,1398.911,Yes.
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1404.31,1405.398,Mr. Chief Justice --
1962.526,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1405.398,1407.134,Attorney General McLeod.
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1407.134,1410.104,-- and members of the Court.
1962.526,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1423.305,1431.558,No question either that her bona fide religious belief does require her to observe the Sabbath on Saturday.
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1431.558,1436.68,"Exactly, no question about that, Your Honor."
1962.526,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1578.763,1594.713,"General, may I ask you a question relating to the operation of the unemployment [Inaudible]"
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1594.713,1595.946,I do not --
1962.526,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1595.946,1602.929,[Inaudible]
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1602.929,1606.218,Neither have an issue.
1962.526,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1606.218,1608.173,You have Sunday law.
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1608.173,1608.537,"Yes, sir."
1962.526,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1608.537,1611.549,[Inaudible]
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1611.549,1611.885,"Yes, sir."
1962.526,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1611.885,1646.82,[Inaudible]
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1646.82,1647.191,No --
1962.526,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1647.191,1650.771,[Inaudible]
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1650.771,1651.027,Well --
1962.526,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1651.027,1651.66,[Inaudible]
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1651.66,1652.175,-- if I --
1962.526,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1652.175,1653.083,[Inaudible]
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1653.083,1660.859,"If I may interrupt the – Mr. Justice, this is not a part in the first place of the unemployment compensation law."
1962.526,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1660.859,1661.926,It's part of what?
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1661.926,1663.281,The Sabbath Observance law.
1962.526,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1663.281,1663.84,A law?
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1663.84,1666.085,An entirely different title.
1962.526,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1666.085,1668.09,"Pardon, a different title for it?"
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1668.09,1668.789,That's right.
1962.526,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1668.789,1669.163,[Inaudible]
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1669.163,1671.126,They're unrelated from that standpoint.
1962.526,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1671.126,1691.518,"Let me ask you about the application, whether unemployment has [Inaudible], is that correct?"
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1691.518,1692.645,In certain industries.
1962.526,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1692.645,1693.832,The effects of that as well?
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1693.832,1696.701,"In certain circumstances, national emergency and so forth."
1962.526,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1696.701,1704.182,"Now, if that is true, the [Inaudible] unemployment compensation."
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1704.182,1705.837,I would think that would be correct.
1962.526,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1705.837,1710.55,"Now, [Inaudible]"
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1710.55,1712.995,The -- the -- that's -- this --
1962.526,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1712.995,1713.793,[Inaudible]
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1713.793,1716.37,"It does, Mr. Justice, yes sir."
1962.526,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1716.37,1737.452,"Well, [Inaudible] on the application of the Unemployment Compensation Act, [Inaudible]"
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1737.452,1738.309,My answer to that --
1962.526,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1738.309,1740.968,[Inaudible]
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1740.968,1742.922,"My answer to that, Mr. Justice, is this."
1962.526,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1756.346,1767.39,"But what does he get on the application of the Unemployment Compensation Act concerning the availability, [Inaudible]"
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1767.39,1768.129,In the --
1962.526,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1768.129,1792.941,[Inaudible]
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1792.941,1794.393,My answer to that is this.
1962.526,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1824.693,1831.302,The limitations are not [Inaudible] to the general application of the statute.
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1835.841,1862.824,"In those particular industries which allow the breaching of the Sunday rest day, I feel that the distinction is this, that the Sunday is a day of rest day, stand in a category by themselves, and that if there's an exemption as was in the Massachusetts statute in a very detailed manner, so much so that the Circuit Court of Appeals said that it rendered the statute in veritable hodge-podge."
1962.526,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1913.69,1924.468,"Well, how would this operate, Mr. Attorney General, if this petitioner were employed in an industry which had one of the national emergency exceptions?"
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1937.416,1937.832,That's true.
1962.526,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1940.098,1940.91,Or is it --
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1940.91,1941.304,This --
1962.526,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1941.304,1954.286,Or is it that the person who refused to work on Sunday does -- does the refusal has to be based upon her -- her chance of objection religious --
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1954.286,1954.509,It does.
1962.526,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1954.509,1957.118,"-- religiously given, is that true?"
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1957.118,1958.791,That's true initially.
1962.526,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1959.453,1961.621,But says conscientious or physical objections --
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1961.621,1963.39,"Conscientious, now I wanted to make this point --"
1962.526,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1963.39,1966.551,"-- whatever that might be, whatever that means -- physical objection."
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,1966.551,1968.311,I think it means just this.
1962.526,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2007.326,2014.105,"Well, isn't that the sense in which it's usually used, religious conviction."
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2014.105,2015.039,"Oh yes, correct."
1962.526,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2015.551,2028.937,You don't -- you don't usually say in the statute that if you -- if you feel that it's -- you're in jeopardy of your health that it's a conscientious objection?
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2028.937,2029.297,Exactly.
1962.526,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2034.631,2035.63,Attitudes too –-
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2035.63,2037.925,-- attitude that would be taken.
1962.526,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2037.925,2039.458,Use all the alternative objections.
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2046.019,2052.3,"I construe those to mean as I say, I think they're used interchangeably in the same sense."
1962.526,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2052.75,2054.858,It -- they do not (Voice Overlap) in the dictionary?
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2054.858,2057.577,"Well, I would -- maybe."
1962.526,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2064.159,2066.302,"Well, and the bar not [Inaudible]"
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2066.302,2066.958,Yes sir.

1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2084.096,2084.668,Normally --
1962.526,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2084.668,2090.572,"[Inaudible], is that correct?"
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2090.572,2090.956,"Yes, sir."
1962.526,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2090.956,2092.706,[Inaudible]
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2092.706,2101.564,I should think it would.
1962.526,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2145.309,2155.331,"May I ask you that the -- the state now, does it get any part of their funds from the federal government or if it's all collected as a state tax?"
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2155.331,2158.443,"It's collected from both, Mr. Justice Black."
1962.526,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2160.145,2161.178,What extent?
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2161.178,2200.138,"There is a 3% that's been increased in recent weeks or months but slightly more than that, the federal tax is laid upon the employer for the purpose of creating a fund. Now the federal government credits the employer up to the amount of two and seven tenth percent of that tax if they pay it in to distinct and it is collected by the State of South Carolina, so that three-tenths of 1% is federal, 2.7% is state."
1962.526,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2204.058,2215.073,Does the federal statute have any strings attached to it in anyway or any conditions with which the states have to comply in connection to getting the money?
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2215.073,2217.9,None that I'm aware that they touch on this matter here.
1962.526,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2217.9,2219.658,On any matter.
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2221.322,2222.033,Well --
1962.526,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2222.033,2227.961,-- if this is a matter in which the federal government would be sufficiently interested why they should be present.
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2227.961,2248.144,"I'm not aware -- I am not aware of any of the -- there are a number of requirements that, of course, must meet such as creating unemployment service, and maintaining certain standards and must have a merit system for employees, certain salaries must be met, and things of that nature, but I'm not aware of any --"
1962.526,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2248.144,2251.441,"Suppose they are not met, what happens?"
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2251.441,2262.746,Those particular items and I presume that there would be means of withdrawing any federal participation in the scheme of unemployment.
1962.526,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2262.746,2268.416,"The federal government does have an actual interest in the way these funds are administered, does it not?"
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2268.416,2283.755,"My understanding and I'm not quite confident to answer it -- to the Justice's question -- is that the manner in which -- matters such as this would be determined, will be at the state level and that will be accepted by the State -- by the federal government."
1962.526,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2293.55,2293.722,I asked --
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2293.722,2296.521,I think whenever --
1962.526,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2296.521,2300.508,"Excuse me, I ask because I saw no reference to the federal laws in either brief --"
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2300.508,2300.78,No.
1962.526,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2300.78,2307.73,-- and I had an idea that they might be -- might be applied to these --
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2307.73,2308.034,On this --
1962.526,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2308.034,2310.428,So that they know what interest the federal government had in it.
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2310.428,2313.177,"On this phase, I can see none."
1962.526,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2313.512,2321.74,"Now, well Mr. Attorney General, isn't there -- isn't there federal supervision of the state administration of the unemployment compensation law?"
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2321.74,2324.455,"From an accounting standpoint, from the establishment --"
1962.526,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2324.455,2328.328,"Or rather a comprehensive federal supervision, is there none?"
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2328.328,2330.4,It's primarily a state function as I --
1962.526,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2330.4,2331.316,I understand that.
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2335.576,2337.316,Undoubtedly.
1962.526,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2338.283,2341.213,"And they would be interested in this, I should think."
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2341.213,2342.839,I shouldn't -- perhaps so.
1962.526,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2377.666,2422.878,[Inaudible]
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2422.878,2430.493,I think that's true and I have information that the benefits come from that point that's created by the employer.
1962.526,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2430.493,2451.206,"Well, that argument [Inaudible]"
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2451.206,2474.5,"One point that I think is of vital significance is the thing that not only that we think benefits were that -- the worker is unemployed, but the statute requires that employment be secured for these unemployed as far as possible so that they maybe placed back in the working force."
1962.526,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2619.465,2634.505,"Suppose we were to hold, suppose the Court should hold your state law in this respect violates the Federal Constitution, what effect would that have on the federal statute for unemployed insurance?"
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2634.505,2635.142,And I'm unable --
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2635.142,2637.267,I'm asking you this question for this reason.
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2663.402,2666.944,"Mr. Justice Black, I can't -- I have not given thought to that thing sir."
1962.526,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2666.944,2672.748,"I can appreciate that because frankly, I didn't think about it until I looked for the federal statute, it doesn't seem that it's --"
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2672.748,2676.192,I do not -- I do not -- I'm unable to state.
1962.526,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2680.576,2693.729,"Well, there wouldn't be any federal involvement if we were to hold if one of the state security system in which they are end of the [Inaudible] as I recall it, certain standards have to be followed."
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2701.392,2703.856,I presume so.
1962.526,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2703.856,2710.639,"General, do all of the -- all of the mills in Spartanburg work six days a week?"
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2710.639,2712.047,"In Spartanburg area, it is true, Mr. Justice."
1962.526,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2712.047,2715.459,"In this -- in this area, all of them, not most of them."
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2715.459,2717.775,"All of them, all of them do."
1962.526,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2817.821,2818.945,I don't understand that argument.
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2818.945,2828.342,"I feel that if one person's faith may require him to work on three days of the week, for instance, the Muslims as I understand it, requires a religious holiday on Friday."
1962.526,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2834.062,2834.34,Yes.
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2834.34,2840.488,Then we must find somebody -- some person employment in an industry that works three days per week.
1962.526,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2844.284,2848.078,"Now you're talking about a private employer, right?"
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2852.929,2856.948,"That's true, but the employer is involved in this."
1962.526,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2856.948,2857.672,How?
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2857.672,2862.5,The employer is one who creates the fund from which these benefits are paid.
1962.526,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2868.482,2870.478,"Yes, hiring anybody."
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2870.478,2871.032,"Well, the appellant in this case --"
1962.526,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2871.032,2872.15,Hiring its employees.
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2872.15,2873.562,-- was working there.
1962.526,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2898.765,2899.984,I still don't follow that.
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2909.077,2909.47,Yes sir.
1962.526,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2909.47,2926.473,"Now an employer, I suppose, a private employer in a private factory, at least we may hypothesize, that he's free to hire or not hire anybody he wants for any reason he wants, the absence of some nondiscrimination statute in the state."
1962.526,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2937.366,2939.375,Do you have a credit rating in your State.
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2939.375,2940.328,Have what?
1962.526,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2940.328,2942.124,Credit rating.
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2942.124,2943.023,Credit rating.
1962.526,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2943.023,2945.798,"Yes, of the employers for -- for --"
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2945.798,2946.119,Yes.
1962.526,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2946.119,2949.23,So the more people they have unemployed --
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2949.23,2949.546,Yes sir.
1962.526,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2950.623,2954.232,"-- the more they have to pay, is that what you're referring to?"
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2954.232,2955.271,The experience rate.
1962.526,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2955.271,2956.196,That's experience rate.
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2956.196,2956.494,Yes sir.
1962.526,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2956.494,2956.853,Yes.
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2958.142,2967.524,"Mr. Justice Stewart, I was attempting to show that there's an overriding state interest in this matter, and that we have a balanced secular statute."
1962.526,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2967.524,2975.024,"The record shows, as I understand it, that all the -- that 150 other members of the -- of this church are employed in the State, in this town --"
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,2975.024,2978.958,"Employees -- well, it's a negative conclusion."
1962.526,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3007.61,3012.411,"Well, doesn't she have to apply and show that she's applying in order to be eligible for compensation?"
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,3012.411,3021.674,"She has applied in the other remaining plants in the Spartanburg area, and all of them are working on a six-day schedule."

1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,3059.788,3061.004,Of the area?
1962.526,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3061.004,3062.03,Yes.
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,3062.03,3064.241,"Mr. Chief Justice, I do not have those figures."
1962.526,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3075.143,3075.93,In the State.
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,3075.93,3076.079,Yes sir.
1962.526,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3076.079,3079.213,How man people are employed in that area in all respects?

1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,3085.064,3089.106,I do have the Spartanburg area textile employment.
1962.526,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3089.106,3089.463,How many?
1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,3089.463,3090.92,"I know it was 18,000."
1962.526,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3090.92,3099.038,"18,000 and did I understand the counsel say there are about 150,000 people in the area?"

1962.526,1,21242,daniel_r_mcleod,,3106.631,3108.059,I should think so.
1962.526,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3108.059,3120.09,"Well, that is a very large percentage of employees, why wouldn't she be available for employment in some other industry or business?"

1962.526,2,44489,william_d_donnelly,,3472.271,3485.596,"I believe it will found that the federal statute requires that those provisions be in the state statute and if the state statute does not contain those provisions, it will be deemed not to comply with the exemption granted in the federal statute."

1962.526,2,44489,william_d_donnelly,,3557.445,3564.587,Well I think -- I think that the federal statute would be unaffected if this statute were construed to be valid.
1962.526,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3564.587,3564.673,Yes.
1962.526,2,44489,william_d_donnelly,,3564.673,3572.434,I still -- I still do not believe that the federal statute would be affected.
1962.526,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3572.434,3572.944,Thank you.
1962.526,2,44489,william_d_donnelly,,3572.944,3575.955,There's only one other point that I wanted to mention.
