1968.548,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,46.315,"Number 548, Roderick Jenkins versus John Julien McKeithen et al."
1968.548,0,33169,j_minos_simon,,46.315,47.053,Yes.
1968.548,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,47.053,48.306,Very well.
1968.548,0,33169,j_minos_simon,,50.949,56.404,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.548,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,530.135,553.816,"But I take it in the long run, as far as filing of charges is concerned that the action of the Commission is only a recommendation and they can't themselves effectively file a -- they can file a complaint with the law enforcement officer I suppose like any citizen can but they can officially launch a criminal action."
1968.548,0,33169,j_minos_simon,,553.816,556.551,The case is not in the technical sense of the word.
1968.548,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,556.551,564.976,You mean the law enforcement officer still has to make his decisions whether actually to file a charge than is it to the criminal proceeding?
1968.548,0,33169,j_minos_simon,,564.976,565.894,That's correct Your Honor.
1968.548,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,579.786,588.138,"Well, the Commission has arrived that it's opinion of the matter I take it but it certainly doesn't bind the law enforcement official I take it."
1968.548,0,33169,j_minos_simon,,588.138,592.488,I'm sure it doesn't bind the law enforcement official technically.
1968.548,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,592.488,595.267,It doesn't even bind him to file a charge.
1968.548,0,33169,j_minos_simon,,595.267,610.976,It doesn't even bind him to file a charge but I'm sure that in the ordinary affairs of public government where that same district attorney by virtue of the provisions of the statute himself is impressed cooperatively as a member of this Commission.
1968.548,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,621.149,623.117,Does Louisiana use a grand jury?
1968.548,0,33169,j_minos_simon,,623.117,624.18,"Yes, sir, Louisiana does."
1968.548,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,624.18,631.445,I suppose there are some crimes that require an indictment by a grand jury?
1968.548,0,33169,j_minos_simon,,631.445,632.948,Murder is one of them.
1968.548,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,641.681,651.053,"Well, I suppose then that the grand jury might reject indicting someone even though the Commission had recommended it."
1968.548,0,33169,j_minos_simon,,651.053,653.547,"I'm sure that's a possibility, Your Honor."
1968.548,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,663.857,672.703,"Do you suggest that as a practical matter, no prosecutor could afford to reject one of these recommendations in so far as filing the complaints?"
1968.548,0,33169,j_minos_simon,,672.703,677.578,It would be my judgment but it would be hazardous position for him to assume.
1968.548,1,17002,ashton_l_stewart,,2073.155,2073.672,Mr. Chief Justice --
1968.548,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2073.672,2074.17,Mr. Stewart.
1968.548,1,17002,ashton_l_stewart,,2074.17,2074.969,"Yes, sir."
1968.548,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2127.234,2134.062,My interpretation to (Inaudible)
1968.548,1,17002,ashton_l_stewart,,2134.062,2135.709,A legal adjudication.
1968.548,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2137.143,2138.961,But they can't (Inaudible).
1968.548,1,17002,ashton_l_stewart,,2138.961,2139.729,No sir.
1968.548,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2139.729,2147.658,(Inaudible)
1968.548,1,17002,ashton_l_stewart,,2147.658,2152.917,They have no authority to accuse anyone just as in the Civil Rights Commission.
