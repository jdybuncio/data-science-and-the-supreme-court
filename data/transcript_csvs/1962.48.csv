1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,0.0,19.479,This case is here on certiorari to the Fifth Circuit involves an order of the Federal Power Commission entered in a Section 4 rate proceeding under the Natural Gas Act.
1962.48,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,216.284,217.736,What page is that?
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,217.736,222.521,"I'm looking now at the middle of page 49, Your Honor."
1962.48,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,394.921,400.532,"Mr. Spritzer, may I ask what happened to those first two steps?"
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,400.532,415.245,"They are still in administrative proceedings, Your Honor, and I'm going to refer during the argument to the chronology of these various cases because they do bear some relationship."
1962.48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,914.949,921.4,"The effect of this was the seller agent, both have ordered refund to this --"
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,921.4,921.78,Yes.
1962.48,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,935.405,951.793,"Mr. Spritzer, may I ask you, do you have the allocation that the commission used (Inaudible)"
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,951.793,952.503,Yes.
1962.48,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,965.795,974.986,How about the imposed rates in the first case imposed by Tennessee in the net allocation between those rate cases?
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,974.986,975.29,Yes.
1962.48,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1078.032,1080.855,Have they bothered to pay the said amount?
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1080.855,1091.522,"Tennessee refunded the amount which had been collected in excess of the interim rates prior to the date of the interim rate order, some $7 million, it has done so."
1962.48,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1111.732,1112.973,Did you say $11 million?
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1112.973,1115.301,"$11 million a year less, yes Your Honor."
1962.48,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1115.301,1123.466,(Inaudible)
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1123.466,1135.07,Tennessee claims that it should be permitted to go back and to charge the disallowed rates and if the Commission's order should be set aside.
1962.48,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1146.838,1154.946,(Inaudible)
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1154.946,1156.487,That's right.
1962.48,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1156.487,1165.391,(Inaudible)
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1165.391,1185.281,"Tennessee claims that there is an important relationship between the amount it is allowed to collect and the ultimate disposition that the allocation issue and that the effect of reducing its collections at this point, may prejudice it later when the allocation issue is decided."
1962.48,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1190.703,1200.321,(Inaudible)
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1200.321,1200.936,That is so.
1962.48,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1200.936,1209.111,(Inaudible)
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1209.111,1219.589,"Well, Tennessee is of the view that if the Commission's order should be set aside that it could go back and collect what it has refunded."
1962.48,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1219.589,1220.979,From the consumer?
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1220.979,1224.599,"From the consumer companies, yes."
1962.48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1224.599,1231.952,"Mr. Spritzer, may I ask, presently, the old rate before the increase is something in between?"
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1231.952,1235.597,The present rate is something in between.
1962.48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1264.003,1268.922,"Well, so that am I understanding hypothetically if the first place (Voice Overlap) --"
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1268.922,1269.375,Was what sir?
1962.48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1269.375,1271.469,If the basic rate was 10 cents --
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1271.469,1271.611,Yes.
1962.48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1271.611,1283.716,"-- and it went to 12 cents and still undetermined firstly in this proceeding, then the 14 and still undetermined second rate increase then went to 16 on the third --"
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1283.716,1284.16,Right.
1962.48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1284.16,1287.472,"-- what's the reduction from the 16 to the present rate, between 14 (Voice Overlap) --"
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1287.472,1288.631,Since the last?
1962.48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1314.554,1331.08,"Mr. Spritzer, just so I'm clear about it, is it within the Commission's discretion would allow the increase rate is going to effect to condition it upon a requirement that a refund takes place?"
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1331.08,1331.944,Yes sir.
1962.48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1331.944,1335.542,They can either amount to go into effect one way or --
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1335.542,1344.103,"No, the statute requires when the Commission has suspended the rate that the company undertake to make refund at any amount unless they found excesses."
1962.48,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1344.103,1354.911,"You mean, pending within the suspension runs out and the rates want to go into effect, the Commission may or it must require them to undertake --"
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1354.911,1366.001,"If the statute contemplates an undertaking, and that was required here and there is a bond, definitely will make refund of any amount ultimately found to be constitutional."
1962.48,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1366.001,1377.902,"How would they refute those amounts, you say they -- if you hear to them the practical issue then they want to refute these refunds, is that correct?"
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1377.902,1386.68,"Well, if the Commission's order were set aside then the now, disallowed rates would be reinstated."
1962.48,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1386.68,1389.999,Can they go against the distributing company?
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1389.999,1394.518,"Yes, the distributing companies are the persons from whom they collect under their tax."
1962.48,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1394.518,1397.45,From distributing companies against the consumer?
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1397.45,1399.448,"They pass it on to the consumer, yes."
1962.48,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1399.448,1402.754,But they are never paying consumers though.
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1402.754,1403.714,"No, you might not."
1962.48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1431.864,1439.389,"Was this possible Mr. Spritzer that the increases in the first or second or both might be disallowed, in those event --"
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1439.389,1439.712,Both --
1962.48,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1439.712,1450.907,-- that would be the refund obligation on the part of Tennessee and not anything coming back to them with the (Inaudible)
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1450.907,1451.429,"Oh, yes."
1962.48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1464.556,1465.233,"Mr. Spritzer, excuse me."
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1465.233,1465.836,Yes sir.
1962.48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1465.836,1478.502,"You lost me somewhere in your development of facts, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit with Chief Judge Tatel dissenting, held that whether that the 6 1/8% rate of return was correct."
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1493.009,1496.501,That is right because the Court of Appeals states its mandate.
1962.48,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1496.501,1499.649,"For that reason, I see."
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1499.649,1511.219,"Now, our -- the Commission's legal position on the merits of this interim order procedure I think may be very briefly stated."
1962.48,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1511.219,1513.354,"Mr. Spritzer before that, may I ask you --"
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1513.354,1513.805,Certainly.
1962.48,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1513.805,1526.338,(Inaudible) is that correct?
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1526.338,1533.175,"Yes, the Commission has decided that the allocation principles that has not yet translated them into newly prescribed rates."
1962.48,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1533.175,1539.947,"Now, with that I would assume that that came (Inaudible) solved in Commission's decision."
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1539.947,1540.596,"Oh, yes."
1962.48,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1556.241,1560.294,And the remaining --
1962.48,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1560.294,1567.717,(Inaudible)
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1567.717,1568.516,Until --
1962.48,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1568.516,1574.774,(Inaudible)
1962.48,0,40542,ralph_s_spritzer,,1574.774,1587.296,"Well, it's -- since we don't know how many months it will be before this case is finally disposed of at the administrative level, it's certainly clear that the case is not moot."
1962.48,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,3173.657,3174.804,Mr. Chief Justice --
1962.48,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3174.804,3175.722,Mr. Rhyne.
1962.48,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,3175.722,3177.554,-- may it please the Court.
1962.48,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3248.193,3249.276,All pipelines?
1962.48,1,19960,charles_s_rhyne,,3249.276,3250.316,All pipelines.
1962.48,2,27473,horry_s_littman,,3941.002,3946.506,May it please the Court.
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,6784.341,6789.23,"Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Associate Justices."
1962.48,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6889.329,6894.432,"Who should the refunds be made to, the distributor or to the customers?"
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,6894.432,6910.335,The -- in all of the Columbia company cases that we have before the state Commission to see we are regulated by our seven state commissions as well as the Federal Power Commission.
1962.48,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6951.547,6951.877,Why?
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,6957.686,6966.085,"Well, because Mr. Chief Justice, I don't believe that anyone has ever ran a statistic on how many people do move from their homes."
1962.48,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6988.48,7000.538,I happen to know that over -- over the last 25 years in my own state we have 1000 new comers every day who come from other parts of the country.
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,7006.887,7021.847,"Well, if they happen to occupy -- they happen to occupy the residence that was occupied by a consumer who was overcharged why they will get credit and they pass through."
1962.48,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7041.403,7052.801,All of which might tend to the conclusion that reimbursement is not the very adequate remedy.
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,7052.801,7064.716,"Oh no, the -- whatever is due, the state commissions takes charge and in our case is particularly they see to it that some adjustment is made."
1962.48,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7217.175,7224.899,"Did I understand Mr. Rhyne to say that you were just a conduit or a stakeholder, or did he say that?"
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,7224.899,7234.033,He did say that and that I think ties it up with Mr. Chief Justice's viewpoint to put who gets the refund.
1962.48,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7266.501,7267.127,You're --
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,7267.127,7270.217,There's more to it than just being a conduit for refund.
1962.48,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7270.217,7272.198,Your companies or distributing companies?
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,7272.198,7276.218,"Both, they distribute and they sell at wholesale."
1962.48,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7276.218,7279.884,And you're regulated I suppose by now only by state but by cities in some case.
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,7279.884,7281.503,"That's correct, if Your Honor please."
1962.48,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7281.503,7286.08,"And when your cost go up you can't always really pass them along, can you?"
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,7286.08,7287.755,That's right.
1962.48,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7287.755,7292.01,When did Columbia first raise the question about the unfairness of this allocation?
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,7292.01,7298.39,That's what I was going to next develop Mr. Justice.
1962.48,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7544.139,7554.542,I would think that would make your interest more identical with say the City of Pittsburgh than it would with the pipeline company.
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,7554.542,7560.368,That's true and that's why it puzzles me to see the City of Pittsburgh taking an opposite view.
1962.48,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7560.368,7563.517,But have you been on their side of the case?
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,7563.517,7564.074,Pardon me?
1962.48,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7564.074,7566.181,Have you been on their side in this proceeding?
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,7566.181,7569.059,"Well, it's not in this proceeding."
1962.48,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,7650.812,7660.394,Doesn't your argument (Inaudible)
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,7660.394,7674.446,"Well, if Your Honor please, the question of whether New England is undercharged or not must depend upon how the cost are allocated to the zones."
1962.48,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,7674.446,7675.414,On the allocation?
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,7675.414,7676.303,On the allocation.
1962.48,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,7676.303,7680.608,For the reduction of rates (Inaudible)
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,7680.608,7680.944,That's right.
1962.48,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,7728.988,7738.919,"(Inaudible) order, issued order and reduce these rates with this order."
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,7738.919,7755.168,"We -- the order the reduced the rate only covered two items, the rate of return which we took no part, we did not object to the Commission's determination that 6 1/8% return was a just and reasonable rate of return."
1962.48,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,7780.319,7781.879,"That you're litigating, are you not?"
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,7781.879,7783.121,That -- that we're litigating.
1962.48,3,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,7783.121,7785.021,The cost allocation.
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,7785.021,7799.417,That's right but it permeates the underlying case whatever happens in that cost allocation case it's still not final must be applied to the underlying case.
1962.48,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7804.049,7810.769,"May I ask you, you said, what was the law in Ohio about where this money went?"
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,7812.953,7834.742,"Well, I do know that, for example, in Pennsylvania, the refunds that were made to Columbia from Tennessee in the past are now being given credit on the future bills to the retail customers of Pennsylvania."
1962.48,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7834.742,7837.956,Why does the Manufacturer of Light and Heat Company to do business?
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,7837.956,7842.998,They do business in the States of Pennsylvania and West Virginia.
1962.48,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7842.998,7844.665,That's your client?
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,7844.665,7845.641,"Yes, Your Honor."
1962.48,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7845.641,7847.071,Then the Ohio (Voice Overlap) --
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,7847.071,7848.437,Ohio fuel.
1962.48,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7848.437,7850.39,-- are they subsidiaries of the Manufacturer?
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,7850.39,7853.0,"No, they are subsidiaries of the Columbia Gas System in Columbia."
1962.48,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7853.0,7854.418,Columbia Gas System?
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,7854.418,7855.271,Yes sir.
1962.48,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7855.271,7860.244,Are any of these other companies in the Northeast and so forth subsidiaries of Columbia?
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,7860.244,7877.098,"No, just the Columbia companies comprise the seven state, Mid-Atlantic area, Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, parts of New York and parts of the District of Columbia by whole through wholesale."
1962.48,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7879.201,7882.244,And Kentucky Gas is a quite a different company?
1962.48,3,18012,brooks_e_smith,,7882.244,7884.1,Quite a different company.
