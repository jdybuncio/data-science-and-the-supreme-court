1995.95-129,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.378,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 95-129, Exxon Company v. Sofec, Inc.--"
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,9.74,11.71,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1995.95-129,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,55.769,64.763,"You take the district court to task for having considered causation first and damages second, although it never got to damages."
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,86.461,112.367,"Not suffices but, but for that issue, you'd never reach the question whether there's any superseding cause, because superseding cause, if it applies at all in admiralty since Reliable Transfer, necessarily assumes, as the district court concluded, that there had been actual cause, or you'd never reach superseding cause."
1995.95-129,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,119.333,132.472,"Well, but you must have, before you proceed to the question of damages, that legal cause, that cause which admiralty courts will recognize as sufficient to impose liability on the tortfeasor--"
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,132.472,134.233,Of course.
1995.95-129,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,134.233,142.508,"--And I'm asking how you define that, other than but-for causation, because I take it it's something more."
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,142.508,152.204,"In admiralty, as in common law, you have to have but-for causation and legal cause."
1995.95-129,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,199.275,200.276,But Ms.--
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,232.068,243.107,"Yes, because the Captain was reacting to a series of hazards that were created prior to the time the equipment failed."
1995.95-129,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,281.352,290.11,"Ms. Hufstedler, I don't read your... the questions presented in your petitioner to raise any question about the ordering of the trial."
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,290.11,290.778,"Oh, of course not."
1995.95-129,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,290.778,293.002,It raises just questions of law--
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,293.002,293.19,Sure.
1995.95-129,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,293.19,294.752,--about what governs admiralty.
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,294.752,295.303,That's correct.
1995.95-129,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,295.303,311.642,"Ms. Hufstedler, as I understand the district court's findings, the findings were that, at a certain point, I think about 90 minutes after the difficulties began, the tanker reached a point of safety."
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,349.629,361.617,"Justice Souter, the response is that the Court's conclusions of law cannot be reconciled with its other findings of fact."
1995.95-129,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,362.957,367.251,"Well, I'm asking just a question of... well I asked whether there was an error of law."
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,379.82,380.411,--Yes.
1995.95-129,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,380.411,381.082,Okay.
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,389.369,424.311,"I say there's no evidentiary basis because the facts as found by the court on uncontradicted evidence was that the trailing hose caused the crane to collapse after the point at which the vessel was supposed to be safe, that the hose and the collapse of the crane caused the boom of the crane to sweep the decks, which threatened the vessel's life by explosion and threatened the lives of all the deck crew."
1995.95-129,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,437.25,458.545,"I think I know the train you're following, but I take it, then, in order to rule your way we would have to find that the... I guess the second of the conclusions of law is simply unsupportable, and that's the conclusion that such conduct... that is, of your captain... was a superseding cause, and the sole proximate cause of the stranding."
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,466.793,495.61,"--Yes, and I think the Court, unless it is going to retreat from decisions long embedded in the law, would have to say that that's incorrect, because you cannot decide, even under common law, whether there has been a superseding cause unless you have had an opportunity to know whether or not what actually happened was within the risks that were caused by the breaches of--"
1995.95-129,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,495.61,497.1,Or you could simply assume that--
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,497.1,497.751,"--Yes, you--"
1995.95-129,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,497.751,500.182,"--and say, on that assumption, nonetheless, superseding cause."
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,513.054,515.726,"--I don't suggest you reexamine it, Your Honor."
1995.95-129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,535.76,537.152,"Ms. Hufstedler, my problem is this."
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,572.481,580.485,You only reach the question you have suggested I presented if you get past the first point.
1995.95-129,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,595.335,616.709,"Ms. Hufstedler, on that point, it was pointed out by the respondent that many States, in fact most, now have comparative negligence systems, and in none of those has the supervening cause doctrine been declared incompatible."
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,637.443,638.645,I am unaware of any.
1995.95-129,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,638.645,643.627,How could it be that there wouldn't be a supervening cause doctrine?
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,653.514,656.406,But Justice Breyer--
1995.95-129,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,656.406,664.501,"--I mean, suppose the most fantastic coincidence, struck by lightning, suppose that... I mean, we can imagine any bizarre set of circumstance we want."
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,692.04,702.616,"--Justice Breyer, surely the admiralty defendant would not be responsible for whatever the results were in your illustration--"
1995.95-129,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,702.616,704.228,"Well, if that's so, how--"
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,704.228,721.74,"--However, there is no reason why the admiralty defendant that has breached a duty and created a risk of some kind of harm should not be responsible for whatever portion of that damage was attributable to the acts before."
1995.95-129,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,721.74,734.415,"--But then the judge says zero portion, because there was a supervening cause, just like the submarine which would have torpedoed the ship or the submarine that would have led to evasive action and an eventual stranding of the ship."
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,759.754,770.82,"Well, as I read your own authorities, both with... and we're now talking only about the tort claims."
1995.95-129,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,824.856,839.075,"So when you use superseding cause here, and you say it should not be recognized, are you talking about superseding cause as a cause attributed to the plaintiff, as distinct from the third party?"
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,841.967,842.187,Yes.
1995.95-129,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,842.187,852.485,"--because 442, which you quote, says superseding cause by definition is only that which is set in play by a third party or a third force, and I take it we don't have that here."
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,852.485,852.946,That's exactly right.
1995.95-129,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,852.946,853.196,Okay.
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,853.196,860.862,"That's why the doctrine doesn't apply at all, even if you assume that common-law superseding cause survived the adoption of the--"
1995.95-129,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,860.862,861.052,All right.
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,867.875,868.106,--Yes.
1995.95-129,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,868.106,868.877,We don't have that here.
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,868.877,869.077,That's right.
1995.95-129,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,869.077,894.686,"However, it is findable in any comparative negligence case, I suppose, that a point is reached at which the defendant's original causation should no longer be recognized by the law, because it has become attenuated and so on, and in place of it the plaintiff's negligence is so overwhelmingly the cause that we should recognize that as proximate cause only."
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,903.491,911.606,It is not that it can never happen where there has been a third person that has intervened.
1995.95-129,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,911.606,915.95,"Well, no, let's assume there's no third person, as, indeed--"
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,915.95,916.18,Yes.
1995.95-129,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,916.18,917.901,"--is true here, no third party."
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,945.86,950.533,It is consistent with comparative negligence if--
1995.95-129,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,950.533,950.793,Well--
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,950.793,962.631,--you assume that... and I believe the close question does assume... that the risk that was run by the wrongful conduct did not encompass what happened.
1995.95-129,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,963.302,971.338,"--In other words, if the defendant had foreseen that the plaintiff was going to do all the stupid things that he says he later did, then that is still within the risk--"
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,971.338,972.687,--I... to put--
1995.95-129,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,972.687,974.488,--and you would still leave the defendant in there.
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,975.74,980.053,"--To put it differently, the risk that was run was the risk of stranding."
1995.95-129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,989.549,990.27,"Well, but that just--"
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,1024.814,1037.193,"--I would say no, because stranding, no matter how it's stranded, was within the exact risks that were created by the respondent's torts."
1995.95-129,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1037.193,1054.513,"But my problem, Mrs. Hufstedler, is that your answers to Justice Breyer, Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, Justice Scalia, all are discussions within the regime of comparative negligence, and I think you concede that there's supervening cause."
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,1075.82,1111.935,"There... what I'm... I guess I have to say that while it's possible to take the view that superseding cause, criminal superseding cause survived comparative fault, nevertheless, it should not be applied in admiralty when to apply it violates the admiralty policies which this Court has repeatedly said are going to dominate what kind of law is going to be applied, and the admiralty policies are to place the risk of loss on those persons who are in the best situation to prevent--"
1995.95-129,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1111.935,1116.816,"Well, then we're just talking about what is and what is not an appropriate supervening cause."
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,1118.208,1123.601,--It is with respect to... it is with respect to the negligence charge.
1995.95-129,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1175.196,1177.589,But there's still a proximate cause requirement.
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,1195.975,1225.374,"The question is, is the concept which is built on legal policy of superseding cause one that should be applied to a breach of an admiralty warranty, and my response to that is, no, it should not, because that again is the question of what should be the policy of admiralty, as distinguished from the policy of common law in tort cases."
1995.95-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1225.374,1227.157,But may I ask this question on that point.
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,1245.599,1253.025,"Well, I would make the same response, Your Honor, as I would to the question that was raised in Italia Societa."
1995.95-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1257.75,1264.335,"No, my question is directed at the merits of your suggestion we apply a different test to the contract claim than the tort claim."
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,1264.335,1282.575,"--I have not seen a case in which the common-law doctrine of superseding cause has been applied to relieve a defendant in an admiralty case, or, indeed, another, of liability for breach of warranty, although, of course, it does go to the question of how much damages should be allowed."
1995.95-129,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1282.575,1293.413,"Well, if you're talking about basically a contract action, you've got the idea of contemplated damages that has the same sort of limiting principles, doesn't it, as the idea of supervening cause?"
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,1293.413,1295.043,It does.
1995.95-129,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1324.623,1326.125,Hundreds of miles away?
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,1326.125,1332.079,"It is not that far away, Your Honor, looking at the findings and giving them full credence from the court."
1995.95-129,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1332.079,1336.242,"Why is... I mean, not any stranding."
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,1342.425,1342.645,Not any--
1995.95-129,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1342.645,1357.685,"Not a stranding 15 years later in some foreign place, so why is it that this stranding is within the contemplation, given the enormously negligent, grossly negligent, or however we call it, activity of the Captain."
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,1362.73,1383.681,"--There's no question whatever that the vessel would have been nowhere near the reef upon which she stranded but for the undisputed fact, as found by the district court, that this vessel was burdened with this enormous cargo hose that continued to be a danger to that vessel until 12 minutes before the turn."
1995.95-129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1383.681,1403.977,"But that's a factual... I mean, I think you may have a good point there, but that goes to the apparent inconsistency between the finding that the negligence had terminated and that finding that the hose, up until half-an-hour before the grounding was still giving difficulty."
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,1424.872,1430.706,"And I would, and I do take the position that it should not apply."
1995.95-129,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1446.869,1456.913,"Let's examine in principle why... I don't want to use up... I know you want to reserve some time, but why in principle should shifting to comparative negligence make any difference?"
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,1476.137,1489.925,Because I think it goes to who should bear what kind of risks for what kinds of losses in order to achieve the policies that this Court has said it wishes to achieve in admiralty law.
1995.95-129,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1489.925,1491.776,The--
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,1509.249,1542.0,"The only reason I would respond it is not appropriate, Justice Ginsburg, is that common law, superseding cause included, is made in 50 States by multiple courts that do not agree with each other, and this Court has said that one of the very reasons for reaching different conclusions is to strive for uniformity, and there can be none if the law with respect to what will be applied in admiralty is going to be made by multiple courts in 50 States."
1995.95-129,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1542.0,1553.948,"But you answered before that there is uniformity, at least so far on this point, that there is no State that has said supervening cause is inconsistent, incompatible with comparative negligence."
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,1553.948,1566.678,"What I've said, Justice Ginsburg, is that I'm not aware of such a case, but what that conceals is how differently different courts have perceived how superseding cause applies."
1995.95-129,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1566.678,1586.041,"Ms. Hufstedler, if we accepted your rationale, which I guess is the ultimate admiralty policy should be to place the responsibility where... damage responsibility on the party with the best chance of avoiding the harm, I suppose we wouldn't even have a comparative fault rule at all."
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,1592.556,1598.651,"I would suggest, Justice Souter, that that would not be your conclusion."
1995.95-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1630.963,1632.826,May I ask one question on that point?
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,1635.708,1636.018,--Yes.
1995.95-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1636.018,1641.332,--contains the statement that the negligence of the Captain was the sole proximate cause of the stranding.
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,1641.332,1641.712,Mm-hmm.
1995.95-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1641.712,1644.414,And do you accept that?
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,1649.379,1653.86,"I contend, Justice Stevens, that it is a conclusion of law."
1995.95-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1664.969,1666.378,"Let me push you one step further, then."
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,1672.533,1673.925,--Yes.
1995.95-129,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1673.925,1679.008,"But you say that's not a finding of fact, so we may do that."
1995.95-129,0,41480,shirley_m_hufstedler,,1679.008,1679.929,That's exactly right.
1995.95-129,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1682.51,1683.452,"Very well, Ms. Hufstedler."
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,1684.673,1688.146,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1699.79,1701.021,Which ones are correct?
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,1704.033,1706.246,"--Oh, I think they all favor me, Justice Scalia."
1995.95-129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1706.246,1708.647,They tend to contradict each other is the problem.
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,1708.647,1720.267,"Well, I think you... Justice Scalia, you tried... you focused in on the presence of this hose that remained aboard the vessel until a few... 12 minutes before that final fatal turn occurred."
1995.95-129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1776.275,1785.832,"But the Captain had this loose boom that was swinging across the deck, causing risk of injury to seamen and also causing a risk of explosion, as I understand it, isn't that right?"
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,1785.832,1788.585,"Whatever risk it was, Justice Scalia, he had--"
1995.95-129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1788.585,1794.848,And you wanted him to sit down calmly at his maps and chart at what point in the ocean he was at this time.
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,1794.848,1798.873,"--If not he, then someone else on his bridge that should have been there to do so."
1995.95-129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1819.035,1823.91,"Well, I think the two findings are hard to reconcile, but... all right."
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,1823.91,1828.292,"I would differ with the Justice, but I will accept that's your opinion."
1995.95-129,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1836.358,1844.152,"Well, let me ask you this, is it possible to have a so-called superseding cause if it's not caused by a third party?"
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,1844.152,1844.623,Yes.
1995.95-129,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1844.623,1848.764,If it's caused by the plaintiff itself?
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,1848.764,1849.696,Certainly.
1995.95-129,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1850.397,1857.68,I don't see why that wouldn't be just a matter of comparable negligence rather than superseding cause.
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,1857.68,1858.572,"--Well, certainly--"
1995.95-129,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1858.572,1862.996,"What is... under the Restatement, does it contemplate a third party?"
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,1862.996,1875.132,"--The key part of the Restatement, section 442, actually contemplates an intervention to bring about a harm different in kind than that which would otherwise have resulted."
1995.95-129,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1875.132,1877.355,"But it's a third party intervention, isn't it?"
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,1886.042,1886.773,I disagree.
1995.95-129,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1892.938,1896.181,"Well, let me just read from 442(b)."
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,1924.101,1925.953,"Well, third... yes, it does, Justice--"
1995.95-129,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1925.953,1930.826,"Okay, so if we're going to take the Restatement view, we're going to look for a third party and we don't have one here, right?"
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,1930.826,1933.808,"--I believe the acts of the Captain are the third party, but--"
1995.95-129,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1933.808,1935.549,I thought the Captain was working for Exxon.
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,1935.549,1944.655,"--Well, he was with his acts, and the gross negligence of the operation of the vessel subsequent were in fact found by Judge Fong to be that supervening--"
1995.95-129,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1944.655,1948.679,"Well, but maybe he was just engaging in a terminological mistake."
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,1965.012,1966.164,--Yes.
1995.95-129,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1966.705,1966.885,Okay.
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,1966.885,1968.314,--I think it was specifically found by the--
1995.95-129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1968.314,1968.515,All right.
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,1990.48,1990.99,--It wouldn't make any--
1995.95-129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1990.99,1992.122,So don't use the Restatement.
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,1992.122,1992.302,"--No, but--"
1995.95-129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1992.302,1994.423,Why don't you use these other commentators instead?
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2008.805,2009.172,"--Yes, Justice."
1995.95-129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2009.172,2009.383,Okay.
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2009.383,2009.823,Yes.
1995.95-129,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2009.823,2027.485,"Is it true, I don't know... I didn't notice this in the brief particularly, but is it true in the case of a corporate defendant where there are many different individuals involved and they're all the plaintiffs, sorry, corporate plaintiff, the third person in the Restatement was not meant to refer to employees of the same plaintiff?"
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2029.879,2030.269,It's--
1995.95-129,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2030.269,2032.709,"I did notice now that, since it's pointed out--"
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2032.709,2032.879,--Yes.
1995.95-129,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2032.879,2038.465,"--that it does say third person, and I don't know how that was meant to apply in the... nobody seems to argue that at length."
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2039.587,2040.959,I don't believe anybody did.
1995.95-129,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2040.959,2045.331,"--do we know how that word, third person, was meant by the Restatement drafters to apply--"
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2045.331,2045.861,I don't.
1995.95-129,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2045.861,2047.884,--in the case of the corporate plaintiff with many employees?
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2047.884,2049.574,"Justice Breyer, I don't know."
1995.95-129,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2069.819,2070.04,May--
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2070.04,2077.596,"--you have suggested there may come a logical time at some point when, in fact, an act ceases to act, and in this particular--"
1995.95-129,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2077.596,2101.443,"--Well, what I'm actually thinking is that if the employee, if the plaintiff company happens also to employ my submarine captain, it would make no sense not to apply the doctrine of supervening cause, but if the employee happens to be the person who himself, let's say, was physically injured in a tort case, then it would seem more likely and reasonable to apply the comparative negligence."
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2109.209,2114.394,--I wouldn't be as quite concerned with the semantics as when we're looking at the doctrine.
1995.95-129,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2132.777,2141.322,"Well, could Exxon say, did it ever say here that the tort was concluded when the ship parted from the mooring?"
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2150.549,2152.151,"Well, I think Judge Fong--"
1995.95-129,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2152.151,2159.835,Because I don't see some independent tort coming from what the Captain did.
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2159.835,2179.697,"--Justice Kennedy, I would respectfully disagree, because I think what you found and what you saw here in the application by Judge Fong was, in fact, independent fault in the faulty navigation of the vessel of making a wrong turn without knowing where he was, violating the Louisiana--"
1995.95-129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2179.697,2180.288,May I interrupt--
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2210.023,2213.894,"--Let me then perhaps argue from a different perspective, Justice Kennedy."
1995.95-129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2243.496,2245.888,"Yes, but Mr. Playdon, let me interrupt you with a question."
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2251.991,2252.552,--Yes.
1995.95-129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2252.552,2257.765,"Now, supposing the trial judge said well, why did he make these navigational errors?"
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2282.512,2287.687,"Well, now, Justice Stevens, what you're doing is you're going in and we're sort of changing the fact pattern a bit."
1995.95-129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2287.687,2289.788,I'm just assuming if there had been such a finding.
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2289.788,2290.269,Absolutely.
1995.95-129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2292.522,2294.993,And instead we're saying he was just dumb.
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2298.446,2300.887,"--I think both of those things, Justice Stevens."
1995.95-129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2300.887,2307.042,And it's inconceivable that the condition of the ship with the trailing on it had any bearing on his navigational errors.
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2307.042,2309.012,"Well, it wasn't found by the court below."
1995.95-129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2309.012,2309.193,I understand.
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2309.193,2310.154,It certainly wasn't.
1995.95-129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2311.903,2317.808,But isn't the conclusion of law based on an assumption that such a finding could not have been made?
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2317.808,2318.338,--That's correct.
1995.95-129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2320.929,2322.912,"Could not have been made, or was not made?"
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2322.912,2324.132,--Probably both.
1995.95-129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2324.132,2325.104,Could not have been made?
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2335.763,2336.794,"No, I don't believe so."
1995.95-129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2336.794,2337.794,I didn't think you meant that.
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2339.116,2346.292,"I meant that given the facts as they are below, and they are not challenged in this Court, that such a finding--"
1995.95-129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2346.292,2349.294,"Given the facts as they are below, or given the findings below?"
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2349.294,2366.496,"--Well, remember that Judge Fong, he sort of gave us a safety valve when he said look, if I've made findings of fact that are really conclusions, they should be held to be conclusions, and if I made conclusions that are really findings, then they should be deemed by findings, and that's what we're saying."
1995.95-129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2371.671,2375.703,And you're saying we should treat Conclusion of Law 44 as a finding of fact?
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2375.703,2376.083,--Certainly.
1995.95-129,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2376.083,2376.544,Yes.
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2387.082,2387.431,Absolutely.
1995.95-129,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2387.431,2387.941,It's mixed.
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2387.941,2405.782,"Yes, Justice Souter, it is, and insofar as it contains the factual determination that in fact Captain Coyne was the sole proximate cause, that is a factfinding that this Court, I think under the two-court rule referred to by Justice... Chief Justice Rehnquist is one that they're bound to adhere to."
1995.95-129,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2405.782,2413.048,"It may be a mixed question, but it is the kind of question if you had a judge-jury you would give it to a jury."
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2413.048,2419.713,"Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg, and in this particular case Judge Fong was both the judge and the jury in this case."
1995.95-129,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2419.713,2427.33,"But going back to Justice Stevens' question, doesn't that underscore the impropriety of splitting this trial?"
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2439.036,2443.268,"I would respectfully disagree, Justice Ginsburg."
1995.95-129,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2544.838,2558.068,"I take it... I just noticed out of interest that in one of your... the red briefs they've cited cases from Scotland, Australia, Canada, England, and I guess a number of other places."
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2570.395,2572.597,"No, I can't... one doesn't come to mind, Justice Breyer."
1995.95-129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2609.885,2613.348,--I'm not sure that you need a doctrine of supervening cause.
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2617.501,2617.782,Well--
1995.95-129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2617.782,2622.334,"--when you say, you know, that the negligence, the causality, they had long since terminated."
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2628.591,2630.383,--I smiled.
1995.95-129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2631.655,2631.996,Yes.
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2631.996,2633.816,--that I would have the opportunity of standing before you--
1995.95-129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2633.816,2634.597,"Of arguing Pfalzgraf, right."
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2634.597,2634.777,--of arguing Pfalzgraf.
1995.95-129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2668.432,2675.197,"But I mean, I could say that whenever it's beyond the scope of the risk under Pfalzgraf I could say, no, you were not the cause of it."
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2680.319,2680.55,Sure.
1995.95-129,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2680.55,2685.955,"And I can call that other cause, if I want, a supervening cause, and I guess that makes everything sound nicer, but I don't know that it's any different."
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2685.955,2686.775,It probably may not.
1995.95-129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2719.288,2722.831,"Mr. Playdon, can you tell me one fact that really puzzles me?"
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2727.656,2728.908,I guess we'd have to ask the Coast Guard.
1995.95-129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2769.706,2771.927,"If you've got a minute or two extra, let me ask one other question."
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2771.927,2774.599,"--Oh, absolutely, Justice... I was looking out at a--"
1995.95-129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2774.599,2774.78,Yes.
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2785.976,2787.198,--I don't really think so.
1995.95-129,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2818.16,2818.41,Right.
1995.95-129,1,25882,george_w_playdon,,2818.41,2827.036,"In summation, we just believe that there is no causal nexus to any of the breakout, and I want to thank the Court."
1995.95-129,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2827.036,2828.839,Very well.
