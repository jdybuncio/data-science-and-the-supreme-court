1955.150,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,663.942,672.745,Is there anything in the record to shows what are most of the dome cars of this kind do have such running boards?
1955.150,0,42817,truman_m_hobbs,,672.745,680.714,There's -- I think the only thing in the record on that point is that some cars do not have this running board near the dome.
1955.150,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,689.739,692.794,But I meant this particular kind of a car.

1955.150,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,771.818,778.706,Does that mean that -- it is the compulsory under the statute to provide the board in controversy?

1955.150,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,789.698,794.78,You mean the standardizing applies to -- you'd have to have the same kind.
1955.150,0,42817,truman_m_hobbs,,794.78,795.067,Yes sir.
1955.150,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,795.067,797.259,That doesn't exclude that you have to have some kind.
1955.150,0,42817,truman_m_hobbs,,801.006,801.396,"No, sir."

1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,1912.994,1913.986,"Fragments of it, sir."
1955.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1925.117,1927.581,What caused it to break?
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,1927.581,1930.293,The defective condition of the board.
1955.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1930.293,1930.904,"Oh, I see."
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,1930.904,1931.225,Yes sir.
1955.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1935.045,1938.012,It wasn't overloading by two people that caused it to --
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,1938.012,1944.819,"Well, if -- if it hadn't have the rotten place, I take it that the two of them might have been able to stand upon it."
1955.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2001.167,2014.829,"Well, is it true that the railroad company itself has, on many cases, many instances in connection with this case referred to this in the ordinary course of businesses or running boards?"
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2014.829,2015.233,"Yes, sir."
1955.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2040.263,2043.227,Do you know the superintendents of the railroad?
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2043.227,2043.473,Yes.
1955.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2067.463,2069.641,"Why, because it is a running board?"
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2069.641,2071.429,Sir? [Laughter]
1955.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2076.531,2076.853,No --
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2076.853,2077.275,-- might thought of that.
1955.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2077.275,2082.755,"I said, would you -- would you collapse because it is a running board?"
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2082.755,2083.065,"No, sir."
1955.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2103.38,2105.181,Would you describe the board please?
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2107.215,2108.823,"In a very limited distance, sir."
1955.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2110.36,2110.869,Yes.
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2110.869,2113.119,It has no connection at either end.
1955.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2113.119,2113.435,Yes.
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2113.435,2119.521,There is a short ladder up to the handrail so that the industry can use.
1955.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2132.682,2153.063,"Well, I understood the yardmaster of 25 years experience that testified that it was used in the operation of the car that occasionally -- occasionally they went up there, stood on -- on that to fix the dome cap or other similar things."
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2153.063,2158.789,"He said that, sir, but there -- but he says it this way, “I have seen you.”"
1955.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2175.647,2177.274,How would they go beyond on that?
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2177.274,2178.726,Toward the end sir.
1955.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2182.731,2185.889,(Voice Overlap) would he -- how would he get up to the dome?
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2185.889,2189.665,"Well, we -- we don't understand he hasn't any duty in connection with the dome, sir."
1955.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2189.684,2193.664,-- I'm talking about this testimony of your yardmaster.
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2212.583,2219.705,"Well, sir, if the car was standing still, he could have done so by going up to the end walking across, but it was in movement, there was no other way for him to do it."
1955.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2219.705,2220.808,There's no other way for him to do it.
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2220.808,2221.169,"No, sir."
1955.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2222.754,2225.116,"Then, is this a safety device?"
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2225.116,2225.425,"No, sir."
1955.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2228.013,2240.527,"Suppose during the movement of the train, the dome cap did become loose and started to -- started to come off and you're losing some of your oil."
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2244.866,2244.904,(Voice Overlap) --
1955.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2244.904,2247.574,Would you expect them to fix -- make that fast?
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2247.574,2256.666,"If Your Honor please, it could not lose the oil because they -- they don't merely fix it over to the valve under the dome that has to be turned and that is why this man was up there."
1955.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2258.956,2265.32,Then let's take something else it might happen up there to cause the same condition but how would he get up there?
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2265.32,2269.436,"If the train was in motion, sir, it would be very dangerous for him to go any other way."
1955.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2269.436,2270.136,Then that --
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2270.136,2271.363,But assuming however --
1955.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2271.363,2273.369,Would you call that a safety device then?
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2273.369,2280.219,"No, sir, because the same thing could have happened on the many cars that roll on the railroads that have no dome step board --"
1955.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2280.219,2280.512,Well --
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2280.512,2282.321,We don't have any at all.
1955.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2285.436,2293.377,"Isn't the fact that the railroad company put that there, some evidence that there was a safety factor involved?"
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2293.377,2298.827,"Well, sir, I don't know, sir, but the railroad company didn't put that there."
1955.150,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2301.653,2302.773,For whom?
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2302.773,2308.269,For the use of the people in the petroleum industry and they are leased and are rented.
1955.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2326.307,2334.215,"Suppose you had look at it and discovered that this was rotten, do you mean that you would have to take that car?"
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2334.215,2334.524,"Yes, sir."
1955.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2337.497,2337.903,Because --
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2337.903,2338.934,-- but that goes to the common law account --
1955.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2338.934,2347.656,Did the -- did the I.C.C. required railroads to take cars with rotten things like that on it?
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2347.656,2347.808,"No, sir."
1955.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2347.808,2347.958,I think (Voice Overlap) --
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2347.958,2349.767,I believe they could have made an exception to it.
1955.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2349.767,2350.181,-- therefore --
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2350.181,2355.046,"I think we could have made an exception to it, but not because it was a safety appliance."
1955.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2361.25,2361.573,Assuming --
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2361.573,2363.176,-- but not because it was a safety appliance.
1955.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2363.176,2369.686,"Assuming that it is, I understand your argument that it's not, assuming that it is a running board --"
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2369.686,2370.638,"Yes, sir."
1955.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2370.638,2372.99,-- that's what it is.
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2399.156,2413.074,"I would call Your Honors attention to the very language, I think it is significant that the language of Section 11 says, all cars must be equipped or secures to the old (Inaudible) and efficient handbrakes."
1955.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2417.68,2419.817,What does requiring means?
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2419.817,2421.599,It means that the I.C.C. shall require.
1955.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2421.599,2423.363,Why does it mean the I.C.C.?
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2423.825,2425.021,Because it's turned the administration (Voice Overlap) --
1955.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2425.021,2442.848,"-- the I.C.C. requires to have running board, suppose the company requires running boards, could the I.C.C., by its ipse dixit, relieve the company from liability for running boards which it dismissed required to be put there?"
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2442.848,2448.293,"The business of operating the railroad, may it please the Court, or had in the car did not require it to be put there."
1955.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2450.105,2452.648,"That's a question, I know whether it's a running board."
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2453.99,2455.163,Yes.
1955.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2489.175,2489.624,"Well, assuming --"
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2489.624,2490.368,-- not this dome step board.
1955.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2490.368,2522.81,"Assuming that the business requires it and it's a running board is secured here that because the I.C.C. chooses not to standardize it at that place, that it can thereby leave Section 11 which requires running boards, it requires to be secured that the I.C.C. can by its failure to standardize this particular one or relieve the burden which the laws puts on."
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2522.81,2523.164,"Yes, sir."
1955.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2527.499,2527.565,Suppose --
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2527.565,2528.174,-- and that Congress said --
1955.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2528.174,2530.601,-- suppose I decided it didn't need any.
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2531.669,2532.224,"Yes, sir."

1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2535.357,2535.811,-- this dome step board.
1955.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2535.811,2538.173,Suppose -- suppose they decided it didn't need anywhere.
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2540.196,2541.094,"Of course it's possible, sir."
1955.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2541.273,2541.78,"Well, suppose they did --"
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2541.78,2544.918,-- made many decisions through the years as to what they do require.
1955.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2544.918,2549.759,"Suppose they did, would that relieve them -- the railroad from the Safety Appliance Act?"
1955.150,1,37310,norman_c_shepard,,2549.759,2550.756,"No, sir."
1955.150,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2552.867,2553.671,"Well, they must have a --"
