1956.5,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,8.793,"Number 5, Raphael Konigsberg versus The State Bar of California and The Committee of Bar Examiners of the State Bar of California."
1956.5,0,22800,edward_mosk,,8.793,10.842,"I'm ready for the petition, Your Honor."
1956.5,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,10.842,11.608,Mr. Mosk.
1956.5,0,22800,edward_mosk,,11.608,12.75,Yes.
1956.5,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,12.75,14.048,You may proceed.
1956.5,0,22800,edward_mosk,,14.048,16.869,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1956.5,1,23669,frank_b_belcher,,3060.677,3063.647,May it please the Court.
1956.5,2,22800,edward_mosk,,6210.502,6213.08,"If I have -- I think I have just a few minutes, Your Honor."
1956.5,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6213.08,6214.231,"Yes, you may."
1956.5,2,22800,edward_mosk,,6214.231,6217.507,I'd like to address myself just to few little points.
1956.5,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6278.849,6280.341,May I ask you Mr. Mosk?
1956.5,2,22800,edward_mosk,,6280.341,6281.146,Yes.
1956.5,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6281.146,6284.677,(Inaudible)
1956.5,2,22800,edward_mosk,,6284.677,6285.72,"Yes, it is, sir."
1956.5,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6291.665,6293.229,Are they printed in the record?
1956.5,2,22800,edward_mosk,,6293.229,6295.681,They're not printed in the record but the actual briefs.
1956.5,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6295.681,6298.439,(Inaudible)
1956.5,2,22800,edward_mosk,,6298.439,6300.382,There may be more but at least one is here.
1956.5,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6306.79,6308.061,Before you get on to the merits --
1956.5,2,22800,edward_mosk,,6308.061,6308.502,"Yes, sir."
1956.5,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6308.502,6312.852,-- I read the Johnson case and the reference it was made.
1956.5,2,22800,edward_mosk,,6339.209,6339.409,"Yes, sir."
1956.5,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6339.409,6344.496,I must be rather surprised (Inaudible) just say the question is vague and raise them.
1956.5,2,22800,edward_mosk,,6347.165,6349.347,"Well, let -- I think, Your Honor, I have --"
1956.5,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6349.347,6353.092,He doesn't raise the question as to which I'm wholly uninformed.
1956.5,2,22800,edward_mosk,,6360.053,6360.276,Yes.
1956.5,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6365.446,6370.875,"Yes, but what is covered, what is relevant is that it decides to declare of a proceeding."
1956.5,2,22800,edward_mosk,,6370.875,6371.475,Right.
1956.5,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6393.749,6396.074,What should be heard in question here?
1956.5,3,23669,frank_b_belcher,,6396.074,6397.564,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1956.5,4,22800,edward_mosk,,6399.885,6407.453,"As a matter of fact, if Your Honor will read our brief, I do not think that the brief cited really very many cases on any point."
1956.5,4,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,6413.813,6415.023,That's probably the beauty of it.
1956.5,4,22800,edward_mosk,,6418.254,6419.225,That might have been an answer.
1956.5,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6541.943,6543.949,Did they all omit it?
1956.5,4,22800,edward_mosk,,6543.949,6553.496,That was one that seemed to have been omitted in their original offer which we subsequently in order to make the file clear did offer.
