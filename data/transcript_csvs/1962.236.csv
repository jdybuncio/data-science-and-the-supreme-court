1962.236,0,22191,edward_j_davis,,34.205,38.939,Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1962.236,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,637.462,641.738,Was the issue of entrapment raised at the trail?
1962.236,0,22191,edward_j_davis,,641.738,650.209,And because in my argument I brought it up and the Judge charged on the Law of Entrapment.
1962.236,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,650.209,658.483,"Well, when the evidence was introduced, was there any objection on the grounds of entrapment?"
1962.236,0,22191,edward_j_davis,,658.483,675.925,"No, not as such, not until the time of the argument and of course, my argument here is, on the facts as established by the government's case, with the government's evidence, having been raised with the argument and the Judge having charged on it, we are properly here on that issue."
1962.236,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,678.035,682.269,"Yes you may, yes certainly."
1962.236,0,22191,edward_j_davis,,682.269,682.917,The offense --
1962.236,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,682.917,684.719,"The issue was submitted to the jury, was not?"
1962.236,0,22191,edward_j_davis,,684.719,686.079,It was submitted to the jury.
1962.236,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,686.079,687.497,Improper instructions?

1962.236,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,698.629,700.828,"Well, is the answer then no, you did not request instructions?"
1962.236,0,22191,edward_j_davis,,700.828,702.591,The answer is no.
1962.236,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,702.591,704.536,And did you object to the instructions given?
1962.236,0,22191,edward_j_davis,,704.536,707.166,"No, I did not."
1962.236,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,752.562,755.221,Did the defendant testify in the case?

1962.236,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,770.613,772.151,He didn't know it was being taken on the Minifon?

1962.236,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,774.469,782.149,"Well, did he say he was entrapped into giving this money?"
1962.236,0,22191,edward_j_davis,,782.149,800.191,"My only answer is that, he testified as to the second meeting of October 24 in effect that there were a lot of claims and charges and he in effect didn't realize the whole part of it and he couldn't testify too much on it."
1962.236,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,803.207,805.052,And he knew he was an agent?
1962.236,0,22191,edward_j_davis,,805.052,805.588,What's that?
1962.236,0,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,805.588,807.414,And he knew he was an agent?

1962.236,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1069.103,1075.722,[Inaudible]
1962.236,0,22191,edward_j_davis,,1075.722,1079.853,I am coming down to that Your Honor please in my second question.
1962.236,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1204.723,1220.121,"Before you leave that, do you know [Inaudible]"
1962.236,0,22191,edward_j_davis,,1220.121,1222.105,"My answer, Your Honor, is two-fold."
1962.236,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1346.585,1349.316,Were there any exceptions to this exemption?
1962.236,0,22191,edward_j_davis,,1349.316,1350.244,No there not Your Honor.
1962.236,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1350.244,1353.192,Did you offer instructions on this Court and they refused?
1962.236,0,22191,edward_j_davis,,1353.192,1355.745,No I did not.
1962.236,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1506.742,1514.521,[Inaudible]
1962.236,0,22191,edward_j_davis,,1514.521,1515.288,"Yes, Your Honor."
1962.236,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1515.288,1524.548,[Inaudible]
1962.236,0,22191,edward_j_davis,,1524.548,1533.041,"Well, I think I can move into it directly by saying and I base it what I have set forth in my brief."
1962.236,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1564.28,1578.734,[Inaudible]
1962.236,0,22191,edward_j_davis,,1578.734,1584.9,"I think the trouble with that Your Honor is that he didn't allocate proof, and if so, it wasn't allocated exactly on the charge."
1962.236,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1584.9,1592.95,[Inaudible]
1962.236,0,22191,edward_j_davis,,1592.95,1594.184,That's right.
1962.236,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1696.647,1699.834,"Mr. Davis, this Minifon, is that a trade name?"
1962.236,0,22191,edward_j_davis,,1699.834,1715.957,"Yes, it's an electronic device that is attached to the person, the agent in this case and it records waves and it could be transferred outside, but it records -- it is a two-fold affair."
1962.236,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1719.492,1720.925,On a tape or something?
1962.236,0,22191,edward_j_davis,,1720.925,1723.215,On a wired recorder.
1962.236,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1723.215,1724.943,And it is a trade name?
1962.236,0,22191,edward_j_davis,,1724.943,1727.194,It's a trade name.
1962.236,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1733.026,1733.718,You may.
1962.236,0,22191,edward_j_davis,,1733.718,1738.343,Thank you very much.
1962.236,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1846.956,1850.922,You may take two minutes more.

1962.236,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1911.011,1912.126,"All right, finish it up."
1962.236,0,22191,edward_j_davis,,1912.126,1916.776,"The government relies on, On Lee versus United States, 343 Untied States."
1962.236,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1916.776,1919.767,Are you reading from your brief?
1962.236,0,22191,edward_j_davis,,1919.767,1923.219,"Not from my brief, from notes."
1962.236,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1979.245,1980.572,Mr. Claiborne.
1962.236,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,1980.572,1984.239,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1962.236,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2080.806,2091.21,"Before you get to that Mr. Claiborne, what was the defendant's explanation as to the October 21st payment of 400 and some dollars?"
1962.236,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2091.21,2100.791,He says he was paying that amount to the agent in order that the agent on his own time prepare returns for the petitioner.
1962.236,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2146.112,2147.841,Petitioner's testimony.
1962.236,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2147.841,2152.596,Petitioner's testimony thought in answer to his own counsel's questions.
1962.236,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2212.438,2214.252,This is on October 21st?
1962.236,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2214.252,2217.096,This is on October 21st.
1962.236,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2224.844,2233.648,[Inaudible]
1962.236,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2233.648,2262.769,"I think Your Honor's question to Petitioner's counsel resolved that point, however, the acquittal as to October 21st in view of the Judge's instructions merely shows that the jury did not believe that the money was given for the purpose of preventing the agent from examining the books, but it did not show that the money may not have been given for another purpose such as suppressing the tax liability regardless of the books."
1962.236,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2518.759,2541.55,"Is there any difference to the opinion as to whether the agent actually fabricated a claim of taxes against this man and that it was purely fictitious, it didn't exist at all except in the mind of the Agent?"
1962.236,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2541.55,2553.492,"Your Honor, the testimony of the agent is very clear that on two prior occasions he had observed that [Inaudible] which just --"
1962.236,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2553.492,2555.196,I can't quite hear you Mr. Claiborne.
1962.236,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2555.196,2555.773,I'm sorry.
1962.236,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2555.773,2558.003,Would you speak little louder?
1962.236,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2558.003,2580.186,"The Agent's testimony is very clear that he had on two previous occasions, October the 31st at noon and in evening August 31st, at noon and the evening and again on October the 21st, witnessed dancing in the premises, which would subject the Petitioner to cabaret tax."
1962.236,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2625.73,2631.894,How far back did the agent attempt to trace that?
1962.236,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2634.218,2645.69,"The claim was made for 1959, 1960 and 1961 all of which is occurring in the fall of 1961."
1962.236,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2652.106,2669.686,"Is there anything in the record at all to show that in 1959 or 1960 that he was acting, he was running a cabaret, in the sense that he'd have to be taxed for it?"
1962.236,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2669.686,2693.838,"Well, there is this, Your Honor that when the agent is making these computations to the petitioner, all this is attested by the recording, the Petitioner does not disclaim a liability for prior years, he might say -- as he now says, all this dancing only started recently, I didn't have it back in 1959, but he says no such thing."
1962.236,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2713.659,2728.776,"So it's a position where the government that it cannot be truthfully said, that this agent fabricated a false claim of tax liability against the petitioner?"
1962.236,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2728.776,2733.153,That is correct Your Honor that is the government's position.
1962.236,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2752.088,2763.06,"When you say he did not defend on the basis of entrapment, what precisely do you mean, this is not something that you have to allege in your -- it's on the original pleadings like this, not covered by a pleading of not guilty, isn't it?"
1962.236,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2763.06,2772.746,"I understand that Your Honor, but his own testimony did take the stand always was “I didn't do it."
1962.236,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,2790.185,2791.165,Through his own testimony.
1962.236,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,2791.165,2792.794,Through his own testimony.
1962.236,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3084.208,3098.224,[Inaudible]
1962.236,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3098.224,3112.137,"But Your Honor, I would have to admit that the problem of proof is facilitated by the use of the machine, but --"
1962.236,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3112.137,3114.766,[Inaudible]
1962.236,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3114.766,3125.56,"From the point of view has been -- from the point of view of invasion of privacy, I don't think the machine changes the situation."
1962.236,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3159.748,3199.408,Is there a constant reaction to [Inaudible]
1962.236,1,34216,louis_f_claiborne,,3199.408,3212.053,"Your Honor, I refer to the Chief Justice's opinion in Rathbun, it is part of the risk that in case of a telephone someone will be on the extension."
