1976.75-6521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.73,We'll hear arguments first this morning in Number 75-6521 Abney and others against the United States.
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,22.292,25.843,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.75-6521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,132.776,136.243,Is there an issue of appealability in here?
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,136.243,139.103,"Your Honor, we will get to that shortly."
1976.75-6521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,139.103,142.977,"Well, isn't that the threshold issue of a jurisdiction?"
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,142.977,147.941,The -- the petitioners appealed their --
1976.75-6521,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,147.941,153.576,"Well, isn't it -- isn't the special issue usually the jurisdictional question?"
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,153.576,167.834,"In this case the -- the Third Circuit Court of Appeals properly, we believe, took jurisdiction of the appeal from their motions to dismiss the indictment."
1976.75-6521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,167.872,169.597,Do you have some authority for that one?
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,169.597,179.947,"In -- in this Court, the Government has raised the question of jurisdiction and I would direct myself to that question."
1976.75-6521,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,234.416,236.536,Which you understand as a criminal case?
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,236.536,238.309,"That was a criminal case, Your Honor."
1976.75-6521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,238.309,251.624,"In that case, the State appellate system had permitted appellate review of the dismissal order and isn't that really the question here whether the federal appellate system permits review at all?"
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,251.624,260.795,The case is not similar because the federal appellate system permits a review only by a writ of prohibition in the intermediate state court.
1976.75-6521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,273.977,292.578,"Well, but if there's a policy against piecemeal appeals in the federal system, that policy may or may not be followed by the States and if they'd choose or chosen to allow their process to be interrupted by appellate review of this kind of an issue, that's up to them."
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,298.412,322.415,"Well, I think that the -- the discussion by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in the Cobbledick case is particularly appropriate here where he noted that the right to statutory appeal must not be interpreted in such a way as to deny all opportunity for appeal under -- contemplated by the statutes."
1976.75-6521,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,373.1,376.837,"Mr. Samuel, are you just abandoning the language of the Fifth Amendment?"
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,384.701,386.407,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I -- I agree --"
1976.75-6521,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,386.407,387.337,Are you going to get to that?
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,387.337,405.85,"-- with that that the -- the nature to protection again is based on the Fifth Amendment, which bars a second trial, and this Court has so held it in a long line cases from Ex parte Lange through United States versus Ball and most recently, in United States versus Dinitz."
1976.75-6521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,591.61,598.253,Have you -- have you calculated the amount of delay that was involved in those 10 cases for before they went to trial?
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,598.253,607.358,"Mr. Chief Justice, I have not sat down with a calculator and attempted to see the amount of delay involved in those cases."
1976.75-6521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,643.086,650.919,"But if you can reduce it to statistics, then what happened to these 10 cases that went up on the interlocutory appeal?"
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,650.919,655.139,"In most of them, the Courts of Appeals found against some on the merits."
1976.75-6521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,655.139,656.935,Most of them or all of them?
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,656.935,662.969,I -- I believe there is one in which they -- they found for the petitioners on the merits.
1976.75-6521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,712.752,718.952,What do you -- what do you argue from Judge Friendly's opinion?
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,718.952,720.069,Well --
1976.75-6521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,720.069,723.028,That it's appealable or that it isn't?
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,723.028,729.612,That -- that Judge Friendly's opinion in a Leslie is appealable to this Court or --
1976.75-6521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,729.612,735.631,What do you -- what do you argue from Judge Friendly's opinion as to the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals in this case?
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,735.631,742.187,I think that the jurisdiction of the Court in -- unless he did have jurisdiction to hear the appeal.
1976.75-6521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,758.603,771.397,"Well, I take it also that even if there is jurisdiction to review the double jeopardy issue in the Court of Appeals, it doesn't necessarily mean that the duplicity issue would piggy back on that."
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,771.397,784.623,"Well, Mr. Justice White, the -- the duplicity issue I -- I think is -- well, the duplicity issue and the double jeopardy issue are really one and the same."
1976.75-6521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,784.623,794.155,"Because if they weren't, if the -- the double jeopardy question weren't there, you certainly wouldn't argue the duplicity -- the duplicity issue was appealable by itself."
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,794.155,796.843,"In this case, the Third Circuit found that there was --"
1976.75-6521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,796.843,798.476,But would you or not?
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,798.476,806.262,"Well, I -- I believe that the -- the pending issue here is the failure of the indictment to state an offense."
1976.75-6521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,806.262,806.677,All right.
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,807.922,808.401,All right.
1976.75-6521,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,808.401,813.581,"Well, how about the denial of that, of the motion to dismiss an indictment for failure to state an offense?"
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,816.464,834.958,"This -- that is not an appealable issue by itself, but this Court has held in a series of cases that where a pending issue is raised with a properly raised appealable issue, that the Court -- if -- if decision of that pending issue will have the effect of terminating a litigation, that the Court will reach that issue."
1976.75-6521,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,881.183,888.896,"What if luckily if -- if we decide that there's no double jeopardy point here, we then move to the other one?"
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,888.896,911.672,"Mr. Justice Marshall, I believe that the decisions of the Court support the idea that even though the -- the properly raised issue is decided against on the merits or the Court feels that it not sufficient on the merits, they can -- they can still reach the pending issue."
1976.75-6521,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,911.672,920.062,"So that now anytime you fail to get an indictment dismissed, you say double jeopardy and automatically it's appealable."
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,920.062,930.269,"I -- I think that -- that there -- the question, as I said before, there's a division in the question between whether or not the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction and -- and we say that if it does."
1976.75-6521,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,930.269,933.702,Would they ever have jurisdiction in that case?
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,933.702,939.299,"They would certainly have jurisdiction, we argue, to review any double jeopardy claim."
1976.75-6521,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,940.396,943.739,And then they find that there was no double jeopardy claim?
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,943.739,944.436,That's right.
1976.75-6521,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,944.436,946.485,Then they go to the other one?
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,946.485,949.262,The -- the Court has the discretion to do so.
1976.75-6521,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,951.548,953.922,"Now, where does it get that discretion?"
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,953.922,955.151,The -- this Court has --
1976.75-6521,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,955.151,958.403,From the fact that you alleged double jeopardy.
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,958.403,959.27,That's right.
1976.75-6521,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,959.27,960.492,And no more?
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,960.492,961.445,That's right.
1976.75-6521,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,961.445,962.802,"Well, that's part of the law."
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,962.802,964.693,"But nevertheless, Mr. Justice Marshall --"
1976.75-6521,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,964.693,966.96,"You have anything to back you up on that, do you?"
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,966.96,970.605,The -- the discretion does not have to be followed.
1976.75-6521,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,977.168,991.123,"I thought that this case raised the question, the important question of whether or not you could appeal the denial of the double jeopardy point, without getting involved with the rest of it."
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,993.466,996.018,"Mr. Justice Marshall, the petition --"
1976.75-6521,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,996.018,1004.174,"If -- If we give you relief on the double jeopardy, what do you need the other one for?"
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,1004.174,1007.057,"In the petition, we raised both issues.We raised both issues."
1976.75-6521,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1007.057,1008.683,Why do you need them?
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,1008.683,1016.938,"We -- it is -- it is true that if we have relief from the Double Jeopardy Clause, we do not need relief on the pending issue."
1976.75-6521,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1038.506,1044.163,"Well, suppose you have a grand jury indictment with two grand jurors in it."
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,1056.434,1058.161,The finality -- I believe that you would.
1976.75-6521,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1093.291,1100.233,You have to raise the question of denial or motion for a bill of particulars or something like that?
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,1100.233,1101.41,I don't think so.
1976.75-6521,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1166.825,1169.751,"But Mr. Samuel, here, the Court of Appeals did not do that?"
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,1169.751,1171.831,"That's correct, it did not."
1976.75-6521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1223.463,1233.049,Wouldn't that involve a judgment on our part as to how the Third Circuit should have exercised its discretionary power to grant or deny mandamus?
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,1233.049,1253.744,"The -- the cases, the circuit court cases that deal with this involve questions where there is a patently obvious issue which is available for mandamus review."
1976.75-6521,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1269.833,1284.443,"Well, but the Court -- you're referring to Courts of Appeals' cases where the same court in which the appeal was filed says, “No, we don't have appellate jurisdiction but we choose to treat is as a petition for mandamus and exercise our jurisdiction to allow it."
1976.75-6521,0,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,1301.584,1304.46,I don't deny that's the case.
1976.75-6521,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1591.038,1597.347,Very well.
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,1599.858,1604.796,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.75-6521,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1666.914,1677.615,"Mr. Thornburgh, is it not correct that the District Court has made a final decision on the question whether the defendant must stand trial?"
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,1677.615,1689.479,"I think in the colloquial sense, final decisions are made by the District Court in a whole panoply of matters in the course of hearing a trial."
1976.75-6521,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1723.96,1730.441,"How do you remedy the fact that the man was put in jeopardy, which is the language in the Fifth Amendment?"
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,1730.441,1730.971,I would submit --
1976.75-6521,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1730.971,1739.794,How do you prevent a court from violating an expressed provision of the Constitution?
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,1739.794,1754.646,"Well, I think, Mr. Justice Marshall, what we are talking about here and it's -- and it's important, I think, to state, is not a denial of a right of appeal but the timing of that appeal, whether that appeal is to be permitted to interrupt the flow of the criminal justice process."
1976.75-6521,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1756.184,1759.855,"The Constitution says, “You shall not start that process.”"
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,1759.855,1768.659,And the Constitution says indeed that no legally obtained evidence shall be used against a defendant that he shall not be brought --
1976.75-6521,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1768.659,1773.25,Does that say jeopardy and where do you see that in the Constitution?
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,1773.25,1773.314,Where do I --
1976.75-6521,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1773.314,1777.218,I'm talking about language expressly in the Constitution.
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,1777.218,1777.764,"Well, that is --"
1976.75-6521,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1777.764,1780.714,The rules of evidence are not in the Constitution.
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,1780.714,1783.407,"No, they have interpreted to -- have been interpreted by this Court."
1976.75-6521,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1783.407,1786.266,"But this, we don't have to interpret jeopardy, do we?"
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,1788.166,1793.873,"We know where jeopardy is, we know that jeopardy attaches when the trial takes place."
1976.75-6521,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1793.873,1798.209,And Congress -- and the Constitution says no jeopardy.
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,1798.209,1798.808,But the right of appeal --
1976.75-6521,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1798.808,1807.451,"And the Court says, “We will put this man in jeopardy and there's no way of stopping that.”"
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,1807.451,1808.65,There is a right.
1976.75-6521,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1808.65,1812.83,Is the speedy -- is the right to a speedy trial explicit in the Constitution?
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,1812.83,1814.762,"Yes it is, Mr. Chief Justice."
1976.75-6521,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1814.762,1830.191,If it denies a motion to dismiss for wanting a speedy trial is that in the same sense final in its judgment as the double jeopardy is final?
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,1830.191,1841.231,The Fourth Circuit has so held in that case is of great concern to the Government with regard to the finality doctrine.
1976.75-6521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1966.182,1975.243,"Mr. Thornburgh, just before you go on it, why won't the right not to be tried a second time be irrevocably lost if it's not predicted right at this very point?"
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,1977.457,1977.931,"Well, I think --"
1976.75-6521,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1977.931,1989.101,"In other words, why doesn't Cohen fit this case like a glove if one can say that Cohen's theory applies to the criminal side?"
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,1989.101,1996.582,Because I don't think the -- the double jeopardy issue is separable from and collateral to the rights to assert in the action.
1976.75-6521,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2027.317,2033.963,"Of course, Hickey did not involve a right based in the Constitution, did it?"
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,2033.963,2057.23,"Well, I would submit that at that time, it might well have been thought to encompass such a right because it -- the statute was a substitute for the Fifth Amendment right, which prohibits the use of testimony in an incriminating sense."
1976.75-6521,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2358.29,2371.885,"Well, Mr. -- it is a painful obligation of citizenship perhaps to be tried once, but the Constitution makes very clear that it's not a painful obligation to be tried the second time after you've been convicted or acquitted the first time."
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,2376.766,2377.096,That is --
1976.75-6521,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2377.096,2384.725,They've all been tried twice and that's what the Constitution makes very clear is not a painful obligation of citizenship.
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,2387.148,2401.744,"Indeed, it does but the question remains as to whether there is a statutory right to vindicate that constitutional right before the trial has taken place."
1976.75-6521,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2434.29,2451.501,"Mr. Thornburgh, supposing that a motion similar to the one made in this case was made in the District Court and the District Judge, rather than denying it simply said, “I'm going to take it under advisement but I think it's fairly debatable,” and kept it under advisement until the end of the trial."
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,2461.411,2468.233,"I think, in all probability, that the judge would have the power to that."
1976.75-6521,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2486.772,2493.528,"But are you saying there would be no power to issue an extraordinary writ pursuant to this at Section 1291, the all writ sec?"
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,2493.528,2509.182,"Well, I -- I think there -- there certainly would be the power to do so, in the -- in the egregious case but it would -- it would not reach the question of the power of the District Court to defer consideration of such a motion until the end of the trial."
1976.75-6521,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2509.182,2522.023,"Mr. Thornburgh, assuming not uncommon 18-month trials that a double jeopardy claim is made, and in if its appeal, would it not only save the defendant?"
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,2528.915,2540.738,"I suppose that such a prospect could result, but I would submit that that's something that the Congress could well take into consideration?"
1976.75-6521,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2540.738,2545.138,I didn't ask a thing about Congress or the statutes at all.
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,2571.515,2581.547,"Well, I think this Court so held in Roche against Evaporated Milk Association where that very point was -- was raised in an antitrust case."
1976.75-6521,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2581.547,2586.531,"Well, I think Evaporated Milk has got more money than the average defendant."
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,2586.531,2589.121,"I think that's right, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1976.75-6521,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2617.747,2618.218,But what is --
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,2618.218,2619.25,-- on double jeopardy grounds that are --
1976.75-6521,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2619.25,2620.594,But what is the --
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,2620.594,2621.219,-- frivolous.
1976.75-6521,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2621.219,2626.621,-- none -- you don't have any non-legal ground for supporting your argument like saving money or anything like that.
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,2626.621,2631.673,I have -- I have a great many non-legal grounds I think your -- if -- if --
1976.75-6521,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2631.673,2634.751,If you're not to say anything about them.
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,2634.751,2636.283,I should not assert them?
1976.75-6521,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2636.283,2637.584,I say are you?
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,2637.584,2639.144,"I -- I will assert them, yes."
1976.75-6521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2687.954,2694.574,"Mr. Thornburgh, couldn't we take care all of those by writing a narrow opinion, making it clear we're not deciding that?"
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,2704.367,2713.83,"Well, I would obviously urge that this Court not open this Pandora's Box because --"
1976.75-6521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2713.83,2714.067,What's the reason --
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,2714.067,2714.695,-- I think these are --
1976.75-6521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2714.695,2721.643,What is -- what is your reason to its -- what is your basic explanation why the Cohen case does not apply?
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,2721.643,2735.631,"I think the -- the real difference between this and Cohen is that Cohen involved, as did the -- the Bailey case, a kind of a turn style phenomenon."
1976.75-6521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2743.079,2748.921,"Well, is it your -- is it your theory that the case can go on without deciding that issue?It doesn't interrupt the proceeding?"
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,2750.744,2751.218,"Well, it would --"
1976.75-6521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2751.218,2756.293,"Which would be true on the Bailey situation, but I don't think it would really be true in the Cohen situation."
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,2763.965,2767.76,"Well, that was looking it as a practical matter?"
1976.75-6521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2767.76,2768.917,Yes.
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,2769.177,2769.356,That may well be so.
1976.75-6521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2769.356,2775.877,"-- the same situation here that if you allow the order to stand, the defendant losses his right not to be tried a second time."
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,2778.276,2794.296,"Well, I think that again I -- I get back to the point of the easy equivalency of the existence of the double jeopardy right in the Constitution and the right to pre-trial appeal."
1976.75-6521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2810.588,2816.97,But you've already agreed that none of those involves a depredation cause by the trial itself.
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,2819.442,2819.661,Well --
1976.75-6521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2819.661,2820.762,-- constitutional rights.
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,2820.762,2831.167,-- I would -- I would urge that if we are to look at the practical aspects of the case in Cohen that we should also look at the practical aspects of the case in a criminal case.
1976.75-6521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2902.687,2904.151,Can I just ask one other question?
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,2923.099,2930.217,It's -- it's been so held and I think that's the second thread that has lead the Circuit Courts in -- in these cases in the Order --
1976.75-6521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2930.217,2940.432,Do you think there's a greater that the requirement of finality is – that it poses a stricter standard on federal and the federal review than it does on review of State Court decisions?
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,2940.432,2944.021,"Well, they are, if I might say, apples and oranges."
1976.75-6521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2962.138,2974.524,Would you suggest the state decision would not be final within that document cases if there lurked the possibility of a search and seizure issue on the case or a Fifth Amendment or some other Federal constitutional issue relating to the merits?
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,2974.524,2977.307,"Well, in having run its course and reach --"
1976.75-6521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2977.307,2978.474,We're still at pre-trial.
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,2987.887,3014.696,"Well, I think again what we get back to is -- is the difference between the two systems that if the State has countenance stay threshold arrival of this issue, this federal issue at its highest court level that this Court is in entitled to determine that that is final for state purposes and therefore, appropriate under 1257 for appeal in this Court."
1976.75-6521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3017.157,3018.829,"Well, just to be sure I had your answer."
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,3025.631,3025.71,Well --
1976.75-6521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3025.71,3029.586,It's rather that the State is willing to allow an appeal so we might as well do the same thing.
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,3029.586,3036.389,That -- that -- I think that the -- the former issue has been present in every case that this Court has decided on that issue.
1976.75-6521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3036.389,3041.279,"Well then, I may ask you, does -- is that critical to those decisions in your view?"
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,3043.001,3046.426,I -- I was -- I was going to say that but I -- I – (Voice overlap)
1976.75-6521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3046.426,3048.146,"It doesn't really make much sense, does it?"
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,3056.227,3063.554,One could conceive of a state equivalent of 2255 or other types of things that might raise constitutional issues to be sure.
1976.75-6521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3080.799,3088.549,"Literally the language of the federal statute is a little more favorable for appeal because it talks about final decisions and the underlying statute talks about final judgments, doesn't it?"
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,3088.549,3089.161,Yeah.
1976.75-6521,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3115.205,3129.918,"Mr. Thornburgh, in your parade of anticipated horribles, if you lose on the double jeopardy issue, would you also include an issue having to do with the speech and debate clause?"
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,3129.918,3135.65,That was the reference suggested by Judge Friendly.
1976.75-6521,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3140.715,3148.953,I suppose you do conceive that the -- the lynchpin of this case is the nature of double jeopardy.
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,3148.953,3161.195,I think that what the Courts of Appeals have found to be the lynchpin for deviating from the finality rule in criminal cases has been the nature of double jeopardy.
1976.75-6521,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3185.721,3201.421,"Would you take the same position, General Thornburgh, if the double jeopardy issue was that this that the -- not that he was subjected to another trial but that he was being subjected to a second conviction for the same crime?"
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,3201.421,3205.877,"I think that the -- let's say, distinction without a difference in -- in my view."
1976.75-6521,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3205.877,3208.483,Pardon me?
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,3223.432,3227.897,"Well, that could only be determined after the second conviction had been obtained and that was --"
1976.75-6521,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3227.897,3229.195,That was -- that was I said.
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,3229.805,3230.391,I'm sorry.
1976.75-6521,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3230.391,3231.266,I think the same --
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,3231.266,3231.979,Then it -- no.
1976.75-6521,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3236.405,3239.309,"I understand that, but at -- at -- before the trial."
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,3254.375,3264.39,That I must revert to seeing a -- a distinction without difference because the claim is anticipatory until the trial plays itself out.
1976.75-6521,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3276.692,3289.66,"But Mr. Thornburgh if the question of appealability should go against you, you have only a minute or two, I noticed.Are you to say anything the merits?"
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,3289.66,3295.544,"I would like to take my remaining time to address the merits, briefly."
1976.75-6521,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3450.539,3457.682,"And I take it your position is though, that even if the -- even if the double jeopardy issue is appealable, the others aren't?"
1976.75-6521,1,40598,richard_l_thornburgh,,3457.682,3466.081,Absolutely not.
1976.75-6521,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3466.081,3468.929,"Mr. Samuel, you have about five minutes left."
1976.75-6521,2,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,3468.929,3473.395,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.75-6521,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3751.409,3768.145,"Wouldn't it all, sometimes be true, at least sometimes, Mr. Samuel, that whether or not the bar against double jeopardy where it's applicable would not clearly appear until at least the start of the second prosecution."
1976.75-6521,2,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,3774.07,3780.212,"I'm not sure that -- that I understand the question exactly, but the -- the --"
1976.75-6521,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3780.212,3783.557,I'm thinking of a collateral estoppel kind of a case.
1976.75-6521,2,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,3783.557,3784.217,Where --
1976.75-6521,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3784.217,3788.556,Where it might not be clear until the --
1976.75-6521,2,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,3788.556,3789.181,It's certainly clear --
1976.75-6521,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3789.181,3793.0,At least the prosecution began by putting it on this case?
1976.75-6521,2,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,3793.0,3797.593,It's certainly clear where the Government seeks to retrial on the same indictment.
1976.75-6521,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3797.593,3798.807,Yes.
1976.75-6521,2,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,3798.807,3816.974,"Where there is a -- a question of collateral estoppel, it seems to me that the -- if the indictment is properly framed so as to adequately advise the defendant of the charge against him that it can be -- that the defendant at that point can make the double jeopardy claim."
1976.75-6521,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3817.132,3821.006,"He can make it, but no court can very intelligently decide it."
1976.75-6521,2,40508,ralph_david_samuel,,3827.159,3839.629,"I -- I'm not sure that I have that much familiarity with the potential possibilities here to -- to discuss that, but that's not the case here."
1976.75-6521,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3852.288,3853.041,Thank you gentlemen.
