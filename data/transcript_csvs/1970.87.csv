1970.87,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.707,"-- in United States against District Court of Eagle County, Colorado."
1970.87,0,45187,walter_kiechel_jr,,11.274,15.834,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.87,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,1857.922,1862.57,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1934.608,1946.427,I wonder it would be -- (Inaudible) if you can state at least in the amount of capsule form what you conceive to be the issue?
1970.87,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,1946.427,1961.544,I view the main and principle issue in this case Your Honor to be whether or not the state courts in state adjudicating -- adjudicatory procedures have jurisdiction over the United States if they comply with the service requirements of the McCarran Amendment.
1970.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1961.544,1962.908,Question of jurisdiction?
1970.87,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,1962.908,1979.32,"Yes sir, which we deem was granted by the McCarran Amendment over the United States upon compliance with that Act as to whether you have to break this out and I do not believe you do until a distinction between the classes of rights to the United States says it claims."
1970.87,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2001.726,2004.985,Your claim rests on the McCarran Amendment?
1970.87,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2004.985,2009.731,"Claim with jurisdiction does, yes sir."
1970.87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2192.773,2198.839,Was there a general adjudication prior to this proceeding on Eagle River or Water District 37?
1970.87,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2198.839,2199.716,"Yes sir, there was."
1970.87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2199.716,2202.383,When was it?
1970.87,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2202.383,2211.558,"I drafted the petition I should know, but my guess would be as early as 1885 and there were probably 10 or 12 supplementals after that."
1970.87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2211.558,2215.597,I see and has the United States been a party to any of those?
1970.87,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2215.597,2219.122,Not in Water District 37 to my knowledge Your Honor.
1970.87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2219.122,2224.355,Although it had appropriative rights surely before this supplemental proceeding?
1970.87,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2224.355,2231.034,"Yes it did, but I doubt that they go back prior to the 1900."
1970.87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2231.034,2242.647,But they were -- why wouldn't they have been enjoined in some of the supplementals?
1970.87,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2242.647,2250.689,"Some of the supplemental proceedings that were after the passage of the McCarran Amendment, well it wasn't until as we view, at least as I--"
1970.87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2250.689,2251.567,In your way --
1970.87,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2251.567,2251.856,Sir?
1970.87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2251.856,2255.619,You said 10 or 12 supplementals in this proceeding since 1885?
1970.87,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2255.619,2257.623,"Yes or more, I'm not even sure of that."
1970.87,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2257.623,2260.446,Why was not the United States joined in any event?
1970.87,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2260.446,2264.724,Till 1952 they could not rejoin because they had not raised sovereign immunity.
1970.87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2264.724,2266.493,And how about after 1952?
1970.87,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2266.493,2277.438,I don't believe the people of the -- most of the western states that were initiating and starting this kind of a proceeding were particularly concerned about this so called reserved right problem until this Court it's decision --
1970.87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2277.438,2279.508,"Well, how about -- how about appropriative rights?"
1970.87,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2285.702,2286.662,That is correct Your Honor.
1970.87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2286.662,2296.677,"Well, that's -- there have been some adjudications since 1952 in the state courts, why wasn't the United States joined in those proceedings?"
1970.87,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2296.677,2309.381,"Well, under the Colorado system, primarily the -- in person or the applicant who opens the adjudication proceeding might not even be conscious of the McCarran Amendment or have any concern about the rights of the federal government."
1970.87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2332.009,2339.004,I take it that in a supplemental proceeding after 1952 brought some person to establish his right which I take it is what happened?
1970.87,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2339.004,2340.985,Yes sir.
1970.87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2340.985,2348.931,If people -- other people -- people who weren't served are not bound or not?
1970.87,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2348.931,2351.0,"Yes, they are bound."
1970.87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2355.31,2372.517,And -- but if you win this case would the United States be bound by all of the supplemental adjudications since 1952?
1970.87,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2372.517,2377.257,"I would say, if Your Honor is asking me to make a strict guess out of that, I would say no."
1970.87,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2378.597,2379.379,Well why not?
1970.87,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2379.379,2392.806,"This problem is raised by the United States itself and not by anyone else and citing the previous Arizona versus California case to Supreme Court of Colorado, they said we have never been a part in the action."
1970.87,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2573.739,2598.812,"Mr. Balcomb, I don't believe I heard either counsel as yet speak specifically of the language of the McCarran Amendment and I have in mind a language reading water rights by appropriation under state law by purchase, by exchange or otherwise."
1970.87,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2606.177,2622.335,"I believe at the time Your Honor that this particular Act was passed, this question about, I mean, utilization of the word ?reserved? in the connection of the water rights was not in too common parlance, not even by the government itself."
1970.87,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2653.175,2659.564,So that you do feel the words or otherwise have significance in the present context?
1970.87,1,33774,kenneth_balcomb,,2659.564,2685.639,"Yes sir and they certainly did at the time in the mind of the Department of Interior witnesses who testified as well as the Department of Justice who testified and pointed out that this language that you're using is a general waiver and if we are brought into the Court, we'll have to prove up on all of our rights, our Indian rights, our military rights, things of this nature and they then did not call them reserved rights, they were specific by naming those rights."
