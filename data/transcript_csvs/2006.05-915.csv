2006.05-915,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.837,"We'll hear argument next in 05-915, Meredith versus Jefferson County Board of Education."
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,8.054,10.372,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,44.707,47.742,Was that because she applied 4 months late?
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,54.143,61.897,"Well, of course, Justice Ginsburg, she moved into the system in August."
2006.05-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,79.653,82.272,Where was she living before?
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,82.272,86.74,"I think she was living in Florida, and she moved into Kentucky."
2006.05-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,86.74,91.794,So she... that was... August was the first opportunity she had to apply?
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,91.794,92.078,Yes.
2006.05-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,124.913,138.407,"But she, she could have... if she had been there at the deadline, the child would have been admitted to... if she had been there in March instead of August?"
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,138.407,148.028,--But the deadline applies to that school which presumably is closest to one's residence.
2006.05-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,152.496,153.932,"Well, we're past that."
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,158.984,159.234,Sure.
2006.05-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,159.234,162.086,--did she appeal that?
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,162.086,164.269,She filed a transfer.
2006.05-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,175.51,176.846,How about for first grade?
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,178.829,180.495,My understanding is that she did.
2006.05-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,183.53,186.482,"And that's in the record, that she made an application for the first grade?"
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,186.482,188.165,--I believe it is.
2006.05-915,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,221.37,223.822,Do you have a claim for damages as well.
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,223.822,224.405,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-915,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,224.405,227.624,With respect to this plaintiff?
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,227.624,228.29,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,291.947,301.322,"How does it compare with the system that was in effect from, what was it, 1975 until 2000?"
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,301.322,303.005,--I'm sorry.
2006.05-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,313.944,333.024,"Do you think that there's something of an anomaly there, that you have a system that is forced on the school, that it doesn't want it, works for 25 years, and then the school board doesn't have to keep it any more, but it decides it's worked rather well, so we'll keep it."
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,340.411,342.761,"Well, I take issue that it worked very well."
2006.05-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,343.511,351.331,"The board decided it liked the way things were going, so it kept it or something close to it."
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,351.331,356.152,"--Well, of course Brown versus Topeka Board of Education was time applicable."
2006.05-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,359.937,365.607,"I'm talking about the plan that they've had for 25 years, and they decided to keep it."
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,365.607,372.363,"--And in the Hampton case, which I won, all right, they didn't go to any race-neutral alternatives at all."
2006.05-915,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,375.731,432.318,"Mr. Gordon, in responding to Justice Ginsburg's question, don't you have to deal with the fact that this Court said in the second Swann case that the... that a school district, particularly a school district like Swann which had been in violation, had been found in violation, had the same interest after unitary status had been attained in maintaining the unitary status as it had in reaching unitary status beforehand; that if those interests are identical why doesn't it follow that the means to achieve those two interests, unitary status from segregation in one case, preservation of unitary status in the other, are reasonable if they are identical?"
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,432.318,440.988,"Well, Justice Souter, this Court over and over again has said once a remedial plan is accepted there should be race-neutral alternatives under the narrow and tailored requirement."
2006.05-915,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,443.338,446.456,Race-neutral alternatives for what?
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,447.539,449.372,To accomplish the same means.
2006.05-915,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,457.145,472.82,"Mr. Gordon, isn't it the case that once you've achieved unitary status, which means that the effects of past intentional discrimination have been eliminated, the only way you can lose unitary status is to discriminate intentionally?"
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,474.136,474.62,Certainly.
2006.05-915,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,476.455,481.49,And isn't there a distinction between unitary status and unitary condition?
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,503.672,504.189,--Certainly.
2006.05-915,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,504.189,512.611,And is the preservation of a unitary condition a legitimate or indeed a compelling governmental objective?
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,512.611,520.634,"In Hampton, this... our Court found that it was unitary status as opposed to unitary condition."
2006.05-915,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,520.634,520.9,Uh-huh.
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,520.9,526.705,"If you want to go with unitary condition, then I still think you go back to Brown and you say has it worked."
2006.05-915,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,528.871,530.821,"What do you mean, it doesn't work?"
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,530.904,531.954,--It hasn't worked.
2006.05-915,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,535.371,538.006,I don't understand what it is that hasn't worked.
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,538.006,542.291,--Why do we have to choose between diversity and educational outcome?
2006.05-915,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,552.231,554.799,I think that's what your friends on the other side are arguing.
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,554.799,555.668,--No.
2006.05-915,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,564.69,569.408,"Not an improvement exactly, but maybe from the Constitution's point of view."
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,644.226,673.828,"My response is that you have those series of cases that say once you've achieved the unitary status, you know longer get to carve out that exemption to the Fourteenth Amendment, and if we're going to carve out these exemptions to the Fourteenth Amendment, if we're going to say we're going to not apply Gratz where it's a quota system and we are solely, without any type of individual holistic review applied to these kids, then there should be some improvement in--"
2006.05-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,673.828,677.697,How would you apply a holistic review to a kindergartner?
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,677.697,680.482,"--Well, of course this system didn't apply to kindergarten anyhow."
2006.05-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,684.784,696.742,I can understand an approach to an applicant for an elite school and so you judge it on all these merit factors and other factors.
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,710.167,712.684,That it would violate your ruling in Gratz--
2006.05-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,712.684,720.79,"I want to know... you said that there are alternate, alternative means, so I'm asking what they are."
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,720.79,725.86,"--Out of Hampton, there was no race-neutral... race alternative means used."
2006.05-915,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,758.896,765.55,And it's not that white children and black children are no longer sitting together on the same school benches?
2006.05-915,0,42750,teddy_b_gordon,,765.55,769.002,Then let's make sure they go to the better schools.
2006.05-915,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,793.681,794.533,"Thank you, counsel."
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,801.937,807.358,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-915,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,817.213,821.265,"General Clement, can I ask you a question that's prompted really by your argument in the last case."
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,851.684,853.719,Justice Stevens--
2006.05-915,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,853.719,858.021,"And then order that, hire teachers to do that?"
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,858.021,860.556,"--I think I'd have to... I mean, I think it would depend--"
2006.05-915,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,860.556,862.325,The only purpose is racial integration.
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,862.325,878.351,"--I think if you build into the hypo that the only purpose was race and then it was done in a way that made it express that the teachers were going to be moved, that you were basically going to have five and five, you were going to have a quota at the two schools on the basis of race, I would say that that would be unconstitutional."
2006.05-915,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,891.475,903.3,"I understand, and I'm just wondering whether in your view that independent value could ever be trumped by the obvious countervailing value of having some African Americans see some white teachers and vice versa?"
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,903.3,911.97,"Oh, but I think that's the point, which is that is an important objective, but I have little doubt that that can be accomplished without the kind of five by five quotas."
2006.05-915,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,911.97,914.189,You have doubt... you have little doubt.
2006.05-915,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,951.745,952.947,Whatever it takes.
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,952.947,963.486,"Justice Breyer, if I could be clear, though, what I was saying in response to Justice Stevens' question was really focused not on the broader problem, but specifically with respect to faculties."
2006.05-915,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,978.895,981.028,Just say some.
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,993.405,999.724,"Well, Justice Stevens, let me tell you what I certainly think they could do, which is to say, look, you know, we don't have any balance in these two faculties."
2006.05-915,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1007.378,1013.515,My example is 100 percent motive to avoid 100 percent segregation.
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1013.515,1021.303,"And I think if what they end up doing at the end is not only a hundred percent motive, but a racial classification, then I think runs afoul of the Constitution."
2006.05-915,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1021.303,1027.021,"Just some, any without violating the Constitution."
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1027.021,1034.194,"Just to be clear, our answer to the hypothetical a hundred percent motivation, no racial classification, is that it is still okay."
2006.05-915,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1056.339,1064.862,"General Clement, do you know how Joshua would have been assigned prior to the establishment of unitary status in this case?"
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1064.862,1070.749,"He would clearly have been assigned to one school, and one set of schools on the basis of his race."
2006.05-915,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1070.749,1076.653,You don't know whether that would have been the magnet or the so-called resides school or somewhere else?
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1076.653,1077.986,"No, I guess I don't."
2006.05-915,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1111.173,1118.028,"May I ask you this, and I think this applies to the case we have got, as well as to Justice Stevens' hypothetical."
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1183.904,1186.087,"Well, Justice Souter, there are several responses."
2006.05-915,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1192.408,1204.567,And it has developed that concern in cases in which the obvious use of race was to hurt or to stigmatize.
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1222.878,1233.151,"Well, Justice Souter, you may have developed that jurisprudence in cases where it was clear there was stigma going on, but you have extended it in Croson and in Adarand across the board."
2006.05-915,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1233.984,1240.055,We have extended it in cases in which benefits were being denied.
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1249.761,1251.511,--I think--
2006.05-915,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1251.511,1253.313,Nothing was being rationed.
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1253.313,1255.413,"--Well, I think choices were being denied."
2006.05-915,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1261.833,1278.443,"But that is simply another way... when you say it is the choice that's being denied, and that has to be the focus of the analysis, that is simply another way of saying you may never use the means of race-conscious distribution to achieve the educational objective."
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1280.461,1282.361,"--That may be, Justice Souter."
2006.05-915,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1304.01,1314.968,"In Gratz, the characteristics of individuals that could be considered were arguably relevant to a distribution decision."
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1340.682,1351.705,"Because I think, Justice Souter, if you think it is an important value to have a degree of integration in the schools, well, I think you can take race neutral means that will get you a degree of integration in the schools."
2006.05-915,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1354.389,1360.293,But you may use those race neutral means only for the purpose of achieving that mixture.
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1363.162,1363.762,--That's right.
2006.05-915,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1363.762,1366.481,The objective is fine.
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1369.083,1379.205,"But if you decide that candor is an affirmative good in the use... in the race area, I think what you get is necessarily what you have here, which is strict racial bands."
2006.05-915,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1387.145,1391.512,Why is... I'm trying to find out... I understand what you think of Gratz.
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1452.951,1455.903,"--Well, I understand that, Justice Breyer."
2006.05-915,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1467.359,1474.447,"Are you prepared to just say, all right, they can do it some, just be careful about it?"
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1478.065,1481.101,I think everybody concedes that strict scrutiny is going to apply here.
2006.05-915,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1481.101,1481.284,All right.
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1483.969,1487.754,"No, we would... you know, I think we would have to look at the details of the plan."
2006.05-915,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1510.683,1514.985,Judge Kozinski thought the real problem here was we should not deify strict scrutiny.
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1516.753,1520.871,"And Justice Stevens, he probably could have cited two of your opinions for that proposition."
2006.05-915,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1524.907,1531.144,It is often true that sometimes doctrines do have unintended consequences when you push the logical extremes.
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1532.077,1534.846,"--There's no doubt about that, but the rest of us do have to work with this Court's precedents--"
2006.05-915,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1534.846,1537.548,And they also have unintended consequences when this Court ignores them.
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1537.548,1538.815,--Absolutely.
2006.05-915,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1553.974,1560.211,"Well, it isn't that we've made a judgment, the local school board has made a judgment which has a lot of experience under both systems."
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1560.211,1563.663,"There's a lot of experience in Brown, too, and those were local school boards, too."
2006.05-915,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1565.096,1567.465,Do we know the race of the school board here?
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1574.102,1576.72,"--I missed that in the joint stipulation, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-915,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1590.36,1595.181,Was that how it worked under the plan that was forced on the school district?
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1597.664,1599.633,"--It was, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-915,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1637.424,1650.398,Am I right in thinking that the government in 2000 opposed terminating this... the compulsory plan?
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1650.398,1652.414,You mean the United States government?
2006.05-915,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1652.414,1652.664,Yes.
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1652.664,1653.097,Or the school board?
2006.05-915,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1665.038,1666.738,I thought it was the United States?
2006.05-915,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1666.738,1671.809,"--Yeah, we had some specific objections in which we thought that two of the green factors were not satisfied."
2006.05-915,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1709.113,1710.246,"Thank you, General Clement."
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,1713.665,1716.467,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-915,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1758.526,1761.728,Does this case present the story where the meaning of Brown versus Board of--
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,1764.763,1768.815,"I think, Your Honor, that Brown is very much distinguishable."
2006.05-915,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1790.526,1791.493,And this doesn't?
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,1806.753,1810.705,"The plan, Your Honor, is not based solely on that supposition."
2006.05-915,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1837.205,1839.871,"You're talking about white flight, you're not talking about black flight."
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,1862.319,1869.491,--This plan... and the Federal courts have held for years school districts do have an interest in avoiding white flight.
2006.05-915,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1906.164,1908.283,"I, I think that's probably true."
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,1948.19,1958.446,"I don't think that's what is involved in this case, Your Honor, because the District Court found that the board's motives were indeed legitimate and that there was no basis--"
2006.05-915,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1958.446,1959.798,I'm conceding that.
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,1969.988,1980.295,"--I don't think that would be proper for the courts to do that, Your Honor, but the other issue that's presented by these cases is whether the use of race is narrowly tailored."
2006.05-915,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1993.436,1997.071,"But it, but it presents the principle that this Court is confronted with."
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2016.902,2020.187,"--You've never said it, Your Honor and the question has never been presented."
2006.05-915,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2031.077,2038.998,In the university cases this Court ran as far away as it could from using racial quotas.
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2056.527,2060.431,"--That's not this case, Your Honor, because our board asserts a different compelling interest."
2006.05-915,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2085.129,2090.449,"Once again, once again, one of the rationales for the law school cases was a First Amendment rationale."
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2100.222,2115.998,"I don't think it's completely inapplicable, Your Honor, because this case presents the same basic doctrinal question that was presented in Grutter, whether a Government agency can use race as a classification with a compelling interest with narrow tailoring."
2006.05-915,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2129.841,2134.912,"Mr. Mellen, here is a question I should have asked friends on the other side."
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2169.149,2170.918,"I think it could be, Your Honor."
2006.05-915,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2171.701,2174.97,"And what... give me some, or give me or an example."
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2174.97,2182.526,"--Your Honor, I'm not sure I can think of one because I come from a community with a long history of, of not doing that."
2006.05-915,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2182.526,2183.193,Easy.
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2235.108,2240.245,"There might be, Your Honor, under those circumstances a compelling interest in doing that."
2006.05-915,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2242.728,2245.982,I don't think there's a compelling interest in doing it at all.
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2262.075,2263.008,--No.
2006.05-915,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2265.443,2276.233,Do you think the school board in that case would use the clumsy means of racial integrational mixing as opposed simply to devoting more money to the black schools?
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2276.233,2281.303,"I would certainly think, Your Honor, that a wise school board would use other methods to achieve that result."
2006.05-915,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2281.62,2282.738,"I would think so, too."
2006.05-915,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2282.738,2285.94,"Why did you say... in truth, maybe I missed it."
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2304.485,2304.652,"I, I--"
2006.05-915,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2304.652,2307.937,"I thought that, that Justice Powell explicitly said it."
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2341.777,2343.443,"--Well, I agree, Justice Breyer."
2006.05-915,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2355.767,2358.45,"Well, I think... I think we were communicating."
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2366.356,2368.325,"It is indeed a different case, Your Honor."
2006.05-915,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2368.625,2371.241,"And it's, and it's a troubling case."
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2371.241,2378.481,"--We do not contend, Your Honor, that the purpose of this plan is to remediate past discrimination against black students."
2006.05-915,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2382.449,2387.003,So your arguments do not depend in any way on the prior de jure segregation?
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2387.003,2388.57,"They do not, Your Honor."
2006.05-915,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2405.214,2406.714,What about the other part?
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2433.614,2438.333,"--We think it is, Your Honor, for the very reasons that the District Court held it is."
2006.05-915,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2471.037,2495.272,"If it were to become relevant, would this record show... this is the school district... and this would be in the regime of the Court-ordered desegregation plan, because you are just recently emerged from that... that the school district has tried means other than race conscious, of race classification in order to obtain the diversity benefits you seek?"
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2495.272,2497.172,"The school district has, Your Honor."
2006.05-915,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2498.974,2500.007,And were those magnet schools?
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2501.423,2503.042,"--Magnet schools, Your Honor."
2006.05-915,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2564.18,2575.921,"But your starting place was the plan that was compulsory, that was forced on the school district in 1975?"
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2577.773,2582.909,"Well, Your Honor, I would say that the starting point was that plan."
2006.05-915,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2639.395,2643.114,What would happen if you couldn't use this system?
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2643.114,2649.25,"And that would depend, Your Honor, on what this Court said we could not use."
2006.05-915,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2699.314,2709.704,Do any of those study the possibilities of the system in which you elect to go into a system where race counts?
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2709.704,2714.173,"Some of those scenarios, Your Honor, did have some degree of choice."
2006.05-915,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2714.173,2717.125,Are they written out anywhere we can see them?
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2718.875,2722.26,"They are not in the record in this case, Your Honor."
2006.05-915,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2733.301,2744.358,"If you say your plan has the overwhelming support of the community, does ""community"" mean those parent who have children in the schools?"
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2744.358,2745.892,Some of the--
2006.05-915,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2745.892,2751.779,It seems to me that ought to be the really... the people who are the objects of this experiment.
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2754.131,2756.047,"--They do indeed, Your Honor."
2006.05-915,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2761.968,2769.391,--And did the parents' satisfaction with it break out along racial lines?
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2772.093,2774.443,"It was fairly evenly divided, Your Honor."
2006.05-915,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2788.602,2789.804,Where is that?

2006.05-915,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2796.208,2798.291,And he's talking about the parents of students in the school?
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2798.291,2799.693,"--That's correct, Your Honor."

2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2903.525,2907.076,"--I don't think exactly, Your Honor."
2006.05-915,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2920.05,2925.188,I'm not sure how to ask the question: Is it used fairly evenly across the board when it is the tiebreaker?
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2925.188,2928.223,"We don't used the word ""tiebreaker"", Your Honor."
2006.05-915,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2930.508,2932.044,"To tip the tipping point, whatever."

2006.05-915,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2941.066,2944.118,That means... that leads to the question of why do they need it?
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2944.118,2947.903,"I think they need it, Your Honor, because it sets a boundary."
2006.05-915,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2956.409,2960.111,So it's symbolic that race counts?
2006.05-915,2,24377,francis_j_mellen_jr,,2960.111,2961.563,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
