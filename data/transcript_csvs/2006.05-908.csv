2006.05-908,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.404,"We'll hear argument first today in 05-908, Parents Involved in Community Schools versus Seattle School District Number 1."
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,9.606,11.974,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2006.05-908,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,71.678,72.478,Mr. Korrell--
2006.05-908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,72.478,74.811,Do you disagree in general with the Solicitor General's brief?
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,82.1,88.004,"Justice Kennedy, we... we agree mostly with the Solicitor General's brief."
2006.05-908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,99.978,100.311,"Well, I can--"
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,100.311,102.444,But that's not an issue the court needs to reach in this case.
2006.05-908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,102.444,109.084,"--Well, it, it is a point that I, I'd like both him and you to discuss at some point during your argument."
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,132.799,138.769,"Justice Kennedy, I think the answer turns on the reason that the schools have the racial compositions that they do."
2006.05-908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,138.769,148.725,"It... there's... well, we can have all kinds of different hypotheticals, but there's residential housing segregation, and it wants, it wants, the board wants to have diversity."
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,148.725,156.648,"Your Honor, our position is that if, if the resulting... if the racial composition of those schools is not the result of past de jure segregation--"
2006.05-908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,156.648,156.981,No.
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,158.931,165.503,"--In that case, Your Honor, Parents' position is that the Government can't be in the position of deciding what the right racial mix is."
2006.05-908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,165.503,172.09,"So it'd have to take the three sites, all of them in the hypothetical, all of them equal, and just flip a coin, because otherwise it would be using a--"
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,172.09,178.394,"Your Honor, obviously it is not the facts of the Seattle case."
2006.05-908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,191.904,192.721,"--No, no."
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,202.574,209.378,"--Your Honor, school districts can do many, many things through race neutral means that they could not do with race discrimination."
2006.05-908,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,209.378,215.716,--But can they have a race conscious objective?
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,234.779,240.349,"Justice Ginsburg, our position is that that is prohibited by the Constitution absent past discrimination."
2006.05-908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,240.349,243.385,"You would object, then, to magnet schools?"
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,261.928,266.583,"Justice Scalia, our objection to the Seattle program is that it is not a race neutral means."
2006.05-908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,266.583,267.066,"No, I understand."
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,301.188,307.66,"Your Honor, we object to the... if that's the sole goal of a school district absent past discrimination, we object."
2006.05-908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,312.779,313.481,I understand.
2006.05-908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,313.481,317.933,"Well, it may not be necessary for you but it might be necessary for us when we write the case."
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,350.17,365.68,"Your Honor, it is certainly difficult if race... if racial balance can be a goal of government, then it is more difficult to defend a racial balancing plan as unconstitutional, or to attack one as constitutional."
2006.05-908,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,365.68,366.782,That is true.
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,366.782,371.234,And this Court has said repeatedly that racial balancing is unconstitutional.
2006.05-908,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,371.234,375.822,"Well, we have said it repeatedly in contexts different from this."
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,413.578,421.917,"Justice Souter, we disagree that the analysis in the Grutter and Gratz cases is entirely different from the analysis in this case."
2006.05-908,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,421.917,432.724,But you have to agree that those cases left someone out of the picture entirely so we were talking about a selection of one person or another?
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,456.422,461.041,"Your Honor, I agree that this Court has not had a case like this before."
2006.05-908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,491.411,493.996,Why do you agree that this is not an affirmative action case?
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,520.53,523.548,"If that's what affirmative action is, Your Honor, then--"
2006.05-908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,523.548,524.9,"Well, I don't know what else it is."
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,533.773,536.291,"--Your Honor, perhaps I misspoke."
2006.05-908,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,539.326,543.628,Let me help you out by taking you back to my question.
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,569.263,571.146,"--I'm not sure that's exactly right, Your Honor."
2006.05-908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,583.855,589.592,"I thought there was a criterion here, and that is, you can go to whatever school you want."
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,596.346,597.512,"Justice Scalia, you're right."
2006.05-908,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,599.381,615.324,"Well, when you state Justice Scalia is right, you are assuming, I think as your brief assumes, that the definition of the benefit to be received here is the active choice, not the provision of an education."
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,636.621,638.423,"--Your Honor, they are both benefits."
2006.05-908,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,649.647,659.436,"But I think that the point that Justice Souter is trying to make, as I understand it, is of course there is a similarity with Gratz, people choose, but there's a big difference."
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,735.367,737.019,"Your Honor, we have several responses."
2006.05-908,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,758.166,758.899,Of course they're not.
2006.05-908,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,763.736,765.855,I didn't say that they were.
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,804.497,807.682,I agree with Your Honor that there's not a merit selection system in--
2006.05-908,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,807.682,808.332,Fine.
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,824.561,834.767,"--Your Honor, because I think that the fundamental command of the Equal Protection Clause is that government treats citizens as individuals, not as members of a racial group."
2006.05-908,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,854.496,863.186,"Mr. Korrell, before your time runs out, I did want to clarify something about the standing of the plaintiffs here."
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,880.647,882.747,"Your Honor, that is mostly correct."
2006.05-908,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,892.871,896.157,"But the lawsuit was originally brought by a corporate entity, correct?"
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,896.157,897.523,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2006.05-908,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,897.523,898.959,Not by individual parents.
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,898.959,899.925,That's correct.
2006.05-908,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,899.925,910.167,"But you don't dispute that membership, for standing purposes, the membership is what counts, not the association but the members?"
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,910.167,919.272,"Your Honor, my understanding of the Court's jurisprudence on associational standing is as long as a member of the association has standing, then the association has it."
2006.05-908,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,924.49,940.269,"Well, if it is a member, jurisdictional questions generally, don't we go by what the membership was when the complaint was filed and not what it has become in the course of the litigation?"
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,940.269,941.852,"--I don't think that's right, Your Honor."
2006.05-908,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,948.875,952.327,"Yes, but the transaction case situation is different."
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,952.327,954.996,"--You're right, Your Honor, none of those were class action cases."
2006.05-908,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,962.199,964.634,May I ask this one brief question if I could.
2006.05-908,0,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,971.705,973.49,"It does, Justice Stevens."
2006.05-908,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,985.965,988.25,"Thank you, counsel."
2006.05-908,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,992.118,999.539,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2006.05-908,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1084.295,1096.135,"Counsel, if I could get back to Justice Kennedy's question earlier, how do you distinguish decisions like citing magnet schools, clustering, from the consideration of race in this case?"
2006.05-908,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1096.135,1105.157,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think that those decisions are different primarily because the resulting decision is not a racial classification."
2006.05-908,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1127.754,1133.574,"Well, what would you do with strategic site selection in order to create racial diversity?"
2006.05-908,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1133.574,1135.343,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I think--"
2006.05-908,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1135.343,1140.497,"I mean, that's the expressed and principal purpose."
2006.05-908,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1141.797,1142.23,--Okay.
2006.05-908,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1166.845,1171.647,Are you suggesting there was no consideration of overall educational benefits in this plan?
2006.05-908,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1171.647,1173.515,"No, Justice Stevens."
2006.05-908,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1203.335,1227.134,"Suppose it was faculty, and the school district makes a deliberate effort to have members of the white race and members of other races represented in... on the faculty of every school, so you won't have one school with all white teachers, so that you'll have a mix, and that's quite explicit."
2006.05-908,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1237.025,1242.327,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think if what they wanted to do is have an mix of teachers that might be okay."
2006.05-908,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1251.099,1252.117,"Well, what would be okay?"
2006.05-908,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1289.826,1303.567,"Well, with respect, Justice Ginsburg, I think there's a fundamental difference between how the same intent with two programs, there's a fundamental difference if one of them necessarily classifies people on the basis of their skin color and the other does not."
2006.05-908,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1303.567,1326.849,"General Clement, is there anything unconstitutional about desiring a mingling of the races and establishing policies which achieve that result but which do not single out individuals and disqualify them for certain things because of their race?"
2006.05-908,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1331.153,1340.592,"Justice Scalia, we would take the position that there's not and that there's a fundamental difference between whether or not the policy manages to avoid classifying people on the basis of their race."
2006.05-908,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1340.592,1342.359,At page 7 of your brief you say
2006.05-908,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1392.375,1400.214,"I think that's ultimately the answer, Justice Kennedy, which is there's a fundamental difference between classifying people and having the real world effect."
2006.05-908,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1416.073,1420.961,And what is the answer to my strategic site selection hypothetical?
2006.05-908,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1420.961,1422.663,We would say that's fine.
2006.05-908,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1449.378,1453.497,My question is really Judge Boudin's question.
2006.05-908,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1478.147,1493.307,"With respect, Justice Souter, first of all I think the kind of interests we're talking about, avoiding racial isolation and the like, do not lend themselves to absolutely targeted, it has to be 15 percent, it has to be 50, it has to be 25, it has to be 45."
2006.05-908,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1496.676,1499.061,That isn't what they said here.
2006.05-908,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1512.803,1514.62,"Well, I mean, in the second stage--"
2006.05-908,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1514.62,1516.705,That's what they do when they site the school.
2006.05-908,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1520.641,1527.211,"--Well, I think in the second case you'll see that, you know, the same logic that leads to this leads itself to stricter bands."
2006.05-908,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1548.31,1552.345,"While you're talking about the way, let me ask a practical question."
2006.05-908,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1608.365,1611.051,"You can answer in this case, General."
2006.05-908,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1611.484,1616.455,"My question, of course, is simply this."
2006.05-908,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1635.999,1636.784,General?
2006.05-908,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1636.784,1649.009,"--If I could answer the question, I think that the fact that you point to the specific language of Swann is helpful, because the Court there in dictum... I think everybody would agree that was dictum... said that you could achieve a prescribed ratio."
2006.05-908,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1675.759,1676.426,"Thank you, General."
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,1682.063,1698.875,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court When Seattle was last before this Court you struck down a State law that prevented bussing for integration purposes because that law prevented the school board from seeking to provide the educational benefits of integrated schools.
2006.05-908,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1713.266,1717.686,"Mr. Madden, that's certainly an admirable goal."
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,1781.779,1786.565,Providing funding for street festivals?
2006.05-908,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1786.565,1787.417,About the objective?
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,1791.535,1797.455,I think that in the context that you've described it that would be constitutionally very problematic.
2006.05-908,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1797.455,1799.307,--Fine... it would be problematic?
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,1799.307,1799.89,Yes.
2006.05-908,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1799.89,1801.474,Why?
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,1801.474,1816.686,"Because I can conceive that it's not... unlike education, where the goal is to educate the entire community and to help to prepare the community, the students to live in that community, it's not a traditional role of government--"
2006.05-908,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1816.686,1818.652,"Well then, let me change Justice--"
2006.05-908,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1818.652,1820.904,Please let me finish the line of questioning.
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,1849.823,1850.657,--I would agree with you.
2006.05-908,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1850.657,1856.977,"So it would appear that even if the objective is okay, you cannot achieve it by any means whatever."
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,1873.205,1888.115,I would submit that there's a fundamental difference between the circumstances you've described and a school system which takes all comers and is tasked to educate them by preparing them to live in a pluralistic society.
2006.05-908,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1888.115,1896.388,"--Well, my slight modification of Justice Scalia's hypothetical... and it proceeds on the same theory... is suppose there's a huge demand for housing."
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,1914.765,1919.817,"I would say not, because housing decisions are inherently private, unlike public education."
2006.05-908,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1929.775,1935.263,"Well, your system is the one that gives a choice to the individuals."
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,1935.263,1941.083,"It does, and when there are more choices than there are seats available."
2006.05-908,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1941.083,1942.533,Does that make a difference?
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,1953.14,1953.64,"Well, I think--"
2006.05-908,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1953.64,1955.175,Would that be unconstitutional?
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,1955.175,1956.342,"--Excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-908,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1964.615,1977.523,"The same... the facts are otherwise the same, except you conclude that private choice contributes to further division rather than integration and so the assignments are made on a 60-40 basis."
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,1977.523,1985.612,"I think that is roughly the circumstance that existed in the first Seattle case, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-908,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2002.907,2004.74,I still don't have your answer.
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,2010.494,2018.917,"I... I would want to know more about the system because I think strictly if there's nothing else and there's no flexibility, I think it presents narrow tailoring problems."
2006.05-908,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2018.917,2033.343,"And how does this not present narrow tailoring problems if... if the... when you get to the fact of choice, the sole criteria at that level is the same as would be the case in a 60-40 assignment."
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,2033.343,2039.513,"Well, we have accommodated choice to the extent there are seats available."
2006.05-908,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2062.946,2070.016,"One of the, one of the factors our prior cases looked to was whether the plan has a logical end point."
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,2073.135,2088.395,"Well, the board actually at every turn reflected in the record discussed whether it was necessary to continue the use of race, whether to narrow it, and eventually to end it."
2006.05-908,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2118.347,2126.77,"But in Grutter we said, to shorten it just a little bit, at page 329-330 of the--"
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,2142.963,2149.934,I think that the term racial balancing has two significant meanings.
2006.05-908,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2185.706,2200.382,"The problem is that unlike strategic siting, magnet schools, special resources, special programs in some schools, you're characterizing each student by reason of the color of his or her skin."
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,2206.888,2235.605,"The board here was trying to distribute, sort out seats that were available at these popular schools; and so it devised a system whereby every student had the opportunity to be assigned to at least one of those popular schools; and as far as the record shows in plaintiffs' briefing, there's no material differences between those... those popular schools."
2006.05-908,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2235.605,2242.894,"Do you have quotas for, for racial hiring of your faculty in these schools?"
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,2242.894,2243.494,No.
2006.05-908,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2243.494,2244.561,Why not?
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,2244.561,2250.415,"I don't think the board has ever found that necessary to, to achieve diversity in the faculty."
2006.05-908,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2250.415,2255.202,"Justice Kennedy's question, I think, was is this basically a kind of last resort?"
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,2270.662,2272.362,"What happened is that, that it--"
2006.05-908,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2272.362,2274.281,"Well, what is the history basically?"
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,2275.264,2291.592,--The history is that the board had both narrowed the use of the integration tie breaker in '99 and 2000 and then continued it for the 2001 school year.
2006.05-908,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2311.137,2312.539,But that's not what I'm thinking.
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,2312.539,2313.322,--I'm sorry.
2006.05-908,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2313.322,2321.511,"I mean I'm thinking that, I thought as I read this, and you have to correct me because you have a better knowledge, originally the schools were highly segregated in fact."
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,2346.893,2353.732,"When, when this plan has... this... the description is yes, basically right."
2006.05-908,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2394.893,2398.678,"Do you think your, do you think your schools as they are operated now are segregated?"
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,2398.678,2407.616,"--We have some change of conditions, but the basic conditions remain, the trend has not been positive."
2006.05-908,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2410.585,2415.17,"To say segregated, segregated... you refer to some of the schools as segregated."
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,2417.806,2419.008,"--Not, not in the sense--"
2006.05-908,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2419.008,2427.614,"I mean, you know, if you belong to a country club that, that... that has 15 percent black members, I would not consider that a segregated country club."
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,2436.22,2441.338,--We are not complaining about segregation resulting from purposeful discrimination.
2006.05-908,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2441.755,2443.207,That's the only meaning of segregation.
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,2443.207,2443.874,--I--
2006.05-908,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2443.874,2446.176,You're talking about racial balance.
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,2446.176,2450.528,--Talking about schools that are on the one end racially isolated.
2006.05-908,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2462.001,2462.787,"Well, I think you're also--"
2006.05-908,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2462.787,2470.541,Justice Alito and Justice Breyer and I myself am interested Can you tell us what has happened since the plan's been enjoined?
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,2470.541,2471.291,Yes.
2006.05-908,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2471.291,2473.309,"I mean, have you gone back to square one?"
2006.05-908,2,36364,michael_f_madden,,2485.801,2492.89,"It, it may mean the board confronted with the circumstances might well make that decision independent of this litigation."
2006.05-908,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2568.937,2579.945,"How do, how do you square your objective of achieving racial balance with your disinterest in the situation at Cleveland and Rainier Beach?"
2006.05-908,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2588.634,2601.525,"Well, they are affected by the plan in this in this way, that in the past the district had used mandatory measures, busing students across town, to try to integrate those schools."
2006.05-908,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2624.89,2631.144,Are the students who are attending those schools getting the benefits of attending a school that's racially balanced?
2006.05-908,4,36364,michael_f_madden,,2637.365,2642.869,"--We, we are concerned about improving the quality of education in all the schools."
2006.05-908,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2650.356,2651.125,Why?
2006.05-908,4,36364,michael_f_madden,,2651.125,2663.783,"Because it, it's important to the credibility and functionality of the school system to have a system that is accepted by the public, by our constituents."
2006.05-908,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2688.831,2692.285,May I go back to the Cleveland school that Justice Alito mentioned?
2006.05-908,4,36364,michael_f_madden,,2700.808,2710.413,Cleveland is now about 8 percent.
2006.05-908,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2710.413,2713.715,And it was... about half as many whites as there were under the plan.
2006.05-908,4,36364,michael_f_madden,,2713.715,2717.667,"I don't remember the precise number in 2000, but that sounds about right."
2006.05-908,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2717.667,2730.443,"Mr. Madden, there was a question raised about your categories, that is, you have white and then everything else."
2006.05-908,4,36364,michael_f_madden,,2748.038,2761.179,"Well, the... the problem that the board was addressing was principally a, a problem of the distribution of white and nonwhite students."
2006.05-908,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2774.689,2776.022,Why is that a problem?
2006.05-908,4,36364,michael_f_madden,,2795.269,2805.258,"--I would say if that circumstance occurred, that that would be something that the board would have to pay attention to and consider."
2006.05-908,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2807.077,2809.577,"Nothing under the plan requires that, does it?"
2006.05-908,4,36364,michael_f_madden,,2809.577,2823.187,"--No, because the numbers in terms of the distribution of ethnic groups, separate ethnic groups and the benefits or impacts of the plan were spread proportionately--"
2006.05-908,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2823.187,2824.789,And what is the theory behind that?
2006.05-908,4,36364,michael_f_madden,,2846.368,2861.878,"--I may, I may have confused the answer to the hypothetical with the, with rationale on the ground, which was that we did not have that kind of single minority ethnic group disparity existing in any school."
2006.05-908,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2899.686,2906.09,"--What criteria of race does the school, just out of curiosity, does the school district use?"
2006.05-908,4,36364,michael_f_madden,,2919.415,2921.6,"I would say... well, the answer is--"
2006.05-908,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2921.6,2923.386,"I mean, there must be some criterion."
2006.05-908,4,36364,michael_f_madden,,2926.504,2929.722,--The district has no criteria itself.
2006.05-908,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2937.259,2938.995,It allows parents to say--
2006.05-908,4,36364,michael_f_madden,,2940.597,2950.619,"That allows the parents to self identify, and the record in this case through the testimony of petitioner's president is they were aware of no abuse of that."
2006.05-908,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2950.619,2952.236,Seems like a big loophole.
2006.05-908,4,36364,michael_f_madden,,2952.236,2957.54,"It seems like one but according to the record, it's not an issue."
2006.05-908,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2959.642,2969.331,"You don't defend the choice policy on the basis that the schools offer education to everyone of the same quality, do you?"
2006.05-908,4,36364,michael_f_madden,,2969.331,2971.299,"--Oh, yes."
2006.05-908,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2982.424,2985.459,How is that different from the separate but equal argument?
2006.05-908,4,36364,michael_f_madden,,2991.863,2994.915,"Well, because the schools are not racially separate."
2006.05-908,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3007.59,3016.911,"Even though in the individual cases the students, including minority students, and I gather 89 to 100 of the cases are being denied admission on the basis of their race?"
2006.05-908,4,36364,michael_f_madden,,3016.911,3019.763,They're not being denied admission.
2006.05-908,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3024.517,3027.386,They are being denied admission to the school of their choice?
2006.05-908,4,36364,michael_f_madden,,3027.386,3028.019,--Yes.
2006.05-908,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3052.319,3070.063,"If we look at the things that Parents are concerned about when they're considering where their children are going to high school, we look at things like SAT scores, for example, or performance on statewide tests, would we see that, the oversubscribed schools and the undersubscribed schools have similar test scores?"
2006.05-908,4,36364,michael_f_madden,,3070.063,3075.534,"It depends on what school you're talking about, Justice Alito."
2006.05-908,4,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3088.944,3091.978,"Well, if we looked at Garfield and Cleveland, what would we find?"
2006.05-908,4,36364,michael_f_madden,,3091.978,3101.084,"You would find a reasonable basis to perceive a quality difference between those two schools, but this plan didn't assign any students to Cleveland."
2006.05-908,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3192.343,3206.368,But the reason that our prior tests have focused on individual determination is that the purpose of the Equal Protection Clause is to ensure that people are treated as individuals rather than based on the color of their skin.
2006.05-908,4,36364,michael_f_madden,,3217.643,3229.75,"--Mr. Chief Justice, in Grutter you said specifically that individualized review was required in the context of university admissions."
2006.05-908,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3246.745,3254.168,You're saying that individual treatment makes no sense in terms of the objective here.
2006.05-908,4,36364,michael_f_madden,,3257.62,3259.202,"Justice Ginsburg, that is correct."
2006.05-908,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3275.681,3287.905,"But the emphasis on the fact that everybody gets into a school, it seems to me is misplaced, but the question is whether or not you can get into the school that you really prefer."
2006.05-908,4,36364,michael_f_madden,,3299.28,3311.587,"Well, like the Michigan cases, sometimes students in the end of the day have an assignment determined by race."
2006.05-908,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3322.312,3330.566,"Well, you're saying every... I mean, everyone got a seat in Brown as well; but because they were assigned to those seats on the basis of race, it violated equal protection."
2006.05-908,4,36364,michael_f_madden,,3335.92,3338.186,Because segregation is harmful.
2006.05-908,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3346.775,3350.929,"Well, it seems to me you're saying you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs."
2006.05-908,4,36364,michael_f_madden,,3382.965,3389.887,"--There are many areas of the law, certainly in the First Amendment and the Fourth Amendment, that have considerable flexibility."
2006.05-908,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3389.887,3391.354,But what about the Fourteenth?
2006.05-908,4,36364,michael_f_madden,,3410.051,3422.325,"I think that in Grutter and Gratz, this Court rejected the absolute and instead described strict scrutiny, which we feel we need, and which is why we are not urging an absolute position."
2006.05-908,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3430.229,3452.51,"And the question of integration, whether there was any use of a racial criterion, whether integration, using racial integration is the same as segregation, it seems to me is pretty far from the kind of headlines that attended the Brown decision."
2006.05-908,4,36364,michael_f_madden,,3465.985,3469.12,"We certainly agree, Justice Ginsburg."
2006.05-908,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3476.626,3481.364,There's no effort here on the part of the school to separate students on the basis of race.
2006.05-908,4,36364,michael_f_madden,,3483.43,3490.552,And it is in effect to bring students together in a mix that is not too far from their community.
2006.05-908,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3492.452,3494.171,"Thank you, Mr. Madden."
2006.05-908,5,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,3496.723,3498.673,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-908,5,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3536.998,3546.972,"This is the... as I gather, the plan where race is used, has to do only with the ninth grade."
2006.05-908,5,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,3571.521,3577.591,"--They are, Your Honor, but they're about the whole school after four years of operating without the race preference."
2006.05-908,5,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3625.306,3632.043,"The numbers I have here, Franklin went from 25 percent white to 12.7 percent."
2006.05-908,5,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,3645.652,3653.325,"Your Honor, I think the numbers that you're reading are from the difference between the 2000 and... '99 and the 2000 enrollments."
2006.05-908,5,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3653.325,3654.291,Okay.
2006.05-908,5,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,3654.291,3668.251,"The numbers I was trying to bring to the Court's attention were the difference between the enrollment under the race based plan and the enrollment in 2005 and 2006, which shows significant and continued racial diversity in Seattle's high schools."
2006.05-908,5,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3697.235,3706.793,Was the board simultaneously trying to introduce similar programs or attractive programs in the undersubscribed schools?
2006.05-908,5,27421,harry_jf_korrell,,3706.793,3710.261,"Your Honor, I'm perhaps not the best person to answer that."
2006.05-908,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3734.46,3735.826,"Thank you, counsel."
