1979.79-383,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,84.666,We will hear arguments next in Standefer against the United States.
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,87.755,91.344,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-383,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,101.025,102.531,"What was the page, 76?"
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,102.531,104.518,1076.
1979.79-383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,183.156,210.229,"Well, Mr. Gondelman, after having read your 113-page brief on petition for writ of certiorari, I notice that nowhere do you cite Dunn v. The United States, which is Justice Holmes' old opinion saying that inconsistent verdicts in juries are perfectly permissible under the Constitution and the Federal law."
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,214.391,230.851,"I think so, Your Honor, and I will address myself directly to that, because in order to start in this case you must start by leading the indictment against Mr. Standefer and, unfortunately, no court has yet got to the indictment that I thought I was trying."
1979.79-383,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,334.359,346.081,"Well, what if Mr. Niederberger had dropped dead even before he was indicted do you think that would preclude indictment and conviction of Standefer?"
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,346.081,353.081,"Mr. Chief Justice, we are long past the need to try the principal or convict the principal."
1979.79-383,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,381.674,384.09,They indicted the principal and tried him and he was innocent.
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,384.09,388.6,And he was found not guilty on three counts.
1979.79-383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,388.6,393.162,Dunn says he can be found not guilty and your client can be found guilty.
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,393.162,409.614,"But, Justice Rehnquist, in every case that is decided and every circuit that is reported, and interestingly enough you ask why I didn't comment on U.S. v. Dunn, why didn't the Government talk about one case cited on page 9 of my brief where if you try the principal and the aider and abettor --"
1979.79-383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,409.614,412.932,"This isn't the Court of Appeals, this is the Supreme Court of the United States."
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,412.932,414.839,I understand that.
1979.79-383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,419.577,422.233,Are these United States Supreme Court cases you are referring to?
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,422.233,432.111,"There are cases in the Supreme Court of the United States where if you try two conspirators and only two conspirators and one is found not guilty, there can be no conspiracy."
1979.79-383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,486.288,494.408,In the eight years I have been sitting here Black's law dictionary has never been thought of as a substitute for the U.S. Reports.
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,494.408,495.358,"Well, it may not."
1979.79-383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,522.481,526.665,"Well, it was found in this case that he did."
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,526.665,527.33,"No, sir."
1979.79-383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,540.074,544.665,He found that he aided and abetted somebody doing an unlawful act.
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,544.665,563.975,"Now, when the aider and abettor goes to trial, Justice White, I suggest to you that contrary to the judge's charge to the jury in which he said you do not have to find an agreement between Standefer and Niederberger, it is sufficient if he received as the large case auditor of Gulf Oil --"
1979.79-383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,563.975,567.575,"The jury had to find that the principal committed an illegal act, --"
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,567.575,570.006,And I suggest --
1979.79-383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,570.006,570.372,-- didn't it?
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,574.174,574.714,"Yes, sir."
1979.79-383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,574.714,576.655,And it did.
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,576.655,578.907,"It found as to all counts, yes."
1979.79-383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,578.907,585.567,It found that he committed an illegal act and that in certain respects your client aided and abetted.
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,591.739,595.572,The principal was found guilty at a retrial by the same Government.
1979.79-383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,595.572,596.271,That is correct.
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,596.271,603.327,"But then I get to the next point, Mr. Justice White, and that is that under the instructions this jury was a very intelligent jury."
1979.79-383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,717.716,726.838,This obviously is a different argument than whether or not you can convict one as an aider and abettor if the principal has been acquitted.
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,726.838,728.192,"That is right, sir."
1979.79-383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,728.192,730.636,How about the -- are you through arguing that?
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,730.636,731.543,No.
1979.79-383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,743.205,752.765,"The Government should not have more than one chance to prove the principal guilty if he has been found innocent, that is the end of it?"
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,752.765,753.774,I would hope --
1979.79-383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,753.774,754.918,Aider and abettor too?
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,754.918,755.138,Yes.
1979.79-383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,761.68,769.214,"But you don't cite Dunn, which is to the contrary and you don't urge that in your brief?"
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,769.214,770.352,I urge in my brief.
1979.79-383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,794.75,798.213,Your argument of course would be far broader than aiders and abettors.
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,825.488,836.173,"I would say, sir, that if the identical facts were presented to a jury in this country and a jury has found against one Government of the United States, the Government of the United States is barred just like any other litigant."
1979.79-383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,836.173,841.188,"Your argument is even weaker than Dunn, it seems to me, because Dunn was the same trial."
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,843.698,855.616,"But I am also talking, Justice Rehnquist, about a narrow issue that does not -- was not presenting Dunn and is not present in all the hypothetical cases that we can conjure up to show why it doesn't apply."
1979.79-383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,857.655,862.15,A narrow issue in your case that was not present in Dunn.
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,862.15,869.964,"There can only be one recipient and guilty principal in Standefer, and that is Mr. Niederberger."
1979.79-383,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,892.502,897.339,I take it you are just making a statutory construction.
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,908.325,914.662,"If Congress ever passes the new penal code, it will have to reach the constitutional argument."
1979.79-383,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,915.251,916.385,"Well, what is your position?"
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,919.239,938.388,"Right now I am making a statutory construction argument because the model penal code and the one now pending before Congress would indicate that it its legislative intent when it passed the 1951 and 1909 aiding and abetting statutes was that an acquitted principal would bar the trial of the aider and abettor, because --"
1979.79-383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,938.388,941.747,These were in effect when your client was tried.
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,941.747,943.185,"Which, sir?"
1979.79-383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,943.185,947.047,"The two that you are referring to, the model penal code and the revised --"
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,947.047,949.472,Congress has not yet passed what it is considering.
1979.79-383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,971.976,973.891,"Well, they haven't changed the law."
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,973.891,984.392,"Therefore, having indicated they would like to do it, sir, I think it indicates congressional intent was to the contrary in 1951 when they passed the aider and abettor amendment."
1979.79-383,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,984.392,986.66,Except that there are two different Congresses.
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,986.66,987.238,"Pardon me, sir?"
1979.79-383,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,987.238,989.666,I said that there are two different Congresses.
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,989.666,993.367,"Well, that is the trouble to looking to legislative intent and I think, Your Honor, in U.S. versus --"
1979.79-383,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,993.367,1000.484,"Well, you can say that the original jury all it did was acquit the man."
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1006.467,1009.04,"I think in this country it has to be that, sir."
1979.79-383,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1009.587,1013.715,All it said was acquitted.
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1013.715,1014.776,As I understand --
1979.79-383,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1014.776,1020.869,"They didn't say this man is not guilty, they just thought that he wasn't properly identified."
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1020.869,1023.182,And also --
1979.79-383,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1023.182,1027.627,Or he could have been in China when it was committed.
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1027.627,1031.256,"Of course then he couldn't have been aided and abetted, you see."
1979.79-383,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1042.362,1051.027,Under what constitutional rule can you say this young man cannot be tried?
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1051.027,1059.288,"Well, the constitutional rule that I would apply is the application of nonmutual collateral estoppel that was discussed in Ashe v. Swenson."
1979.79-383,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1059.288,1062.269,Where is that in the Constitution?
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1062.269,1074.533,"Well, I think Justice Stewart went through nonmutual collateral estoppel as a principle established by this Court, applicable to criminal cases as well as civil cases."
1979.79-383,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1074.533,1081.545,"Of course Ashe v. Swenson involved the double jeopardy clause, a guarantee against being twice put in jeopardy."
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1083.712,1085.194,There is no double jeopardy in this case.
1979.79-383,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1089.531,1102.814,Does not your argument mean the inconsistent verdict and the idea of a compromise verdict would be washed out.
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1110.93,1115.325,"Well, of course anything is possible, Mr. Chief Justice but I think that --"
1979.79-383,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1115.325,1119.252,Isn't that what Justice Holmes had in mind when he wrote in Dunn?
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1119.252,1120.804,In Dunn he said that.
1979.79-383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1176.478,1182.489,He was found guilty of the other charges in the only trial to which he was subjected.
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1182.489,1183.54,That is correct.
1979.79-383,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1221.081,1224.97,Is it possible that he did receive it?
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1224.97,1230.793,"Justice Marshall, what I am talking about now is a factual condition to be presented to a jury."
1979.79-383,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1230.793,1232.151,But wasn't it presented to a jury?
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1232.151,1233.248,"No, sir."
1979.79-383,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1233.248,1234.563,It wasn't presented in this case?
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1234.563,1238.01,"In this case, absolutely not, because --"
1979.79-383,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1238.01,1238.921,It was not?
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1238.921,1239.133,No.
1979.79-383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1272.679,1276.286,"But your client was charged as a principal, was he not?"
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1276.286,1280.049,He is charged as a principal but you still have to have a substantive offense.
1979.79-383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1301.539,1308.928,"Well, in your jury, the jury concluded all the issues against your client."
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1308.928,1310.608,"No, it concluded --"
1979.79-383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1310.608,1312.986,It returned a verdict of guilty again him.
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1312.986,1320.632,But I respectfully suggest to Your Honor that what I am saying to you is that the jury could only pass upon what a judge charged that they could pass upon.
1979.79-383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1379.951,1383.891,Are you saying your client was not properly chargeable as a principal?
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1383.891,1385.255,I am saying that the judge did not --
1979.79-383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1385.255,1388.309,"That could be answered ""yes"" or ""no."""
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1388.309,1392.8,He was not properly charged as a principal for the three counts of which Niederberger was acquitted.
1979.79-383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1433.134,1442.482,Except that evidence can come in during the course of a trial and if it is unobjected to the indictment need not be formally amended under the rules.
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1442.482,1448.259,"That is correct but you still have to charge a jury properly, I think, so that they might consider."
1979.79-383,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1484.568,1485.889,May I ask you one question.
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1485.889,1486.614,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.79-383,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1486.614,1489.076,You are trying to go back to the beginning all the time.
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1501.049,1502.585,"Yes, Your Honor, and every case --"
1979.79-383,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1502.585,1505.629,You don't rely on the fact that there are separate trials?
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1505.629,1506.222,"No, sir."
1979.79-383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1537.734,1552.693,"You say that if we affirm that it necessarily means that a jury could come out with different results in the same trial between the principal and the aider and abettor, they could acquit the principal and convict the aider and abettor?"
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1552.693,1554.716,"That is correct, sir."
1979.79-383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1560.54,1561.459,I am puzzled.
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1565.869,1576.004,"In Dunn, as I recall it, and all the cases that I have read in connection with inconsistent verdicts say, well, one jury could -- for example, the conspiracy cases."
1979.79-383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1584.081,1585.92,What is the leading case for that proposition?
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1585.92,1588.429,I have it in my brief and I do have it cited.
1979.79-383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1643.325,1644.014,Morrison v. California?
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1644.014,1644.435,Pardon me?
1979.79-383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1644.435,1645.872,Morrison v. California?
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1645.872,1650.163,"Morrison v. California, 291 U.S. 82, 92, Your Honor."
1979.79-383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1650.163,1651.7,You don't list that in your --
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1651.7,1655.9,"Yes, I do, at page 56 of my brief, Your Honor, I have it."
1979.79-383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1655.9,1658.432,But you didn't get it in your table of citations.
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1658.432,1672.127,"Yes, 291 U.S. 82 at page 92. Hartzel v. United States, 322 U.S. 680. Bates v. United States, 323 U.S. 15. U.S. v. Fox, 130 F.2d and so forth, and so on."
1979.79-383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1712.579,1715.396,"Well, what if you tried the aider and abettor first?"
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1715.396,1717.031,"There are cases on that too, Your Honor."
1979.79-383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1736.835,1739.103,Was Dunn a conspiracy case?
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1739.103,1740.869,"I am sorry, Your Honor, I don't recall."
1979.79-383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1741.519,1743.277,I don't believe it was.
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1743.277,1753.059,"But again, the difference between them is there are cases that can -- there are crimes that can be committed by innocent dupes."
1979.79-383,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1874.037,1884.293,"What difference does it make, Mr. Gondelman, whether you paid in advance, cash on delivery, or 30 or 60 days later, which is the way doctors and lawyers send their bills?"
1979.79-383,0,27063,harold_gondelman,,1884.293,1891.403,"Because in this case, Mr. Chief Justice, the judge said, ""Oh, you mean because the bribe didn't take."""
1979.79-383,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1929.371,1932.015,Mr. Alsup.
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,1932.015,1938.457,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.79-383,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2112.529,2122.394,"Mr. Alsup, just as a matter of curiosity, is that term ""nonmutual collateral estoppel"" used once in the other brief, the opposing brief?"
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2122.394,2127.604,I think it actually is.
1979.79-383,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2133.198,2144.089,That the collateral estoppel argument is fairly embraced by the questions presented in the petition for certiorari?
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2144.089,2153.957,"Looking strictly at the questions presented in the petition itself, there is some doubt as to whether or not the collateral estoppel issue itself was raised."
1979.79-383,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2165.626,2168.714,"I take it you are willing to assume it is here, anyway."
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2168.714,2177.231,We are willing to assume that is here and we have briefed it on the assumption that this Court would consider deciding it.
1979.79-383,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2210.294,2214.215,Can I interrupt to clarify one thing that I am not sure about.
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2220.958,2228.06,"If the two cases had been tried together, it would have been absolutely permissible for the jury to reach inconsistent --"
1979.79-383,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2228.06,2230.508,You would rely on Dunn in that situation?
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2230.508,2231.016,That is correct.
1979.79-383,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2231.016,2235.514,Yes.
1979.79-383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2235.514,2237.315,Didn't Dunn just involve one person?
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2237.315,2238.444,That is correct.
1979.79-383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2238.444,2242.153,And it was just a question of inconsistent verdicts between two counts?
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2242.153,2243.681,That is correct.
1979.79-383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2243.681,2245.817,It didn't involve two people.
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2245.817,2247.344,But the principle that was announced --
1979.79-383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2247.344,2254.465,Have you got any cases in this Court that says that sustains an inconsistent verdict?
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2254.465,2256.58,"Well, let me respond to that point."
1979.79-383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2256.58,2258.012,Where there is more than one defendant involved?
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2258.012,2262.139,"Yes, the Dotterweich case did involve two different defendants."
1979.79-383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2312.933,2318.296,"Well, you are just talking about one jury there, and we are talking about two different juries here."
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2318.296,2320.272,But this Court extended that reasoning in --
1979.79-383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2320.272,2320.779,In Dotterweich.
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2320.779,2323.553,-- in Dotterweich.
1979.79-383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2323.553,2329.418,"But the Court has never extended the reasoning of Dunn to successive trials, to two different juries."
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2329.418,2346.948,"Well, that is because there never was any thought up until possibly the time of Blonder-Tongue and Parklane that the idea of nonmutual collateral estoppel was just unheard of at the time Dotterweich and Dunn were decided."
1979.79-383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2346.948,2347.334,That is right.
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2354.095,2354.979,Right.
1979.79-383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2354.979,2367.967,"And one of the questions we have to decide is whether the reasoning that applies in the civil context, and I assume you agree that there would be a nonmutual collateral estoppel here if it were a civil case, does that reasoning apply to a criminal case?"
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2367.967,2381.481,"Well, we are not -- I agree with your general statement of the issue and I am not quite sure we would agree with an aspect of that that had these been civil cases we would necessarily agree that the Government would be collaterally stopped."
1979.79-383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2381.481,2383.162,What possible argument do you have against that?
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2383.162,2384.628,"Well, it would depend."
1979.79-383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2389.613,2392.199,"Their opportunity to litigate, the same issues and --"
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2392.199,2392.954,"Well, more than that."
1979.79-383,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2411.949,2422.403,"Conspiracy cases, where you indict Mr. A for conspiring with Mr. B and he is acquitted."
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2426.48,2436.215,"Well, our position there, once again, and we think this is sustained by the cases in the Court, is that there can be inconsistency there, too."
1979.79-383,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2436.825,2438.593,What if you tried them both in one trial?
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2438.593,2440.433,Absolutely the same result there.
1979.79-383,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2452.903,2458.207,"The cases that your colleague relies on, Morrison v. California, you don't put much into that?"
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2458.207,2462.834,"Well, we distinguish all those in our brief but let me take -- I can give you one example."
1979.79-383,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2777.911,2782.321,"Mr. Alsup, before you get into this argument, I just want to raise on question."
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2799.912,2814.299,"Well, since 1948, I believe it was the Bernhard v. Bank of America case in the California Supreme Court, not a Federal case at all, was the first time that a major court in this country adopted it."
1979.79-383,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2816.898,2819.399,As defensive collateral estoppel?
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2819.399,2822.14,I believe that was defensive in that case.
1979.79-383,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2822.14,2823.627,And that is the first case it applied that to?
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2823.627,2826.197,"Well, it was the first major case, it is the leading case."
1979.79-383,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2828.97,2830.147,"That was what, 1948?"
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2830.147,2835.992,1948.
1979.79-383,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2877.411,2879.567,Was the same evidence used in both?
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2879.567,2881.131,Actually there was overlapping evidence.
1979.79-383,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2905.983,2912.375,Was there anything show in the way of a pattern of conduct in terms of Standefer's case?
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2912.375,2935.282,"Well, one of the theories that went to the jury in this case was that each of these five vacations, these were not just vacations to the local golfing club but these involved Pebble Beach, Los Vegas, Miami, Absecon, New Jersey and Pompano Beach, Florida, all at the expense of Gulf Oil Company and lasting on the average of four days apiece."
1979.79-383,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2950.793,2964.799,Could there have been an indictment for conspiring to violate the statute between these two men?
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2964.799,2976.982,"That is a question that no one has raised so far and I -- off the top of my head I would say ""yes,"" but I am not -- there might be problems with that rule -- I believe it is called Wharton's rule."
1979.79-383,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2984.565,2991.365,"But if there could, you would take the position that one conspirator can be acquitted and the other one convicted?"
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2991.365,2991.806,That is correct.
1979.79-383,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2991.806,2992.843,At separate trials?
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2992.843,2993.388,That is correct.
1979.79-383,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2993.388,2995.23,Or even at the same trial?
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,2995.23,2998.458,That is correct.
1979.79-383,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3074.633,3080.879,"That is an interesting question, whether to a try a defendant separately."
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,3080.879,3082.527,I am not quite sure I follow you.
1979.79-383,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3082.527,3094.343,"Well, the net result of this is that the only time the Government could ever convict A, they would have to convict them all at once or not at all."
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,3094.343,3097.534,"Well, unless --"
1979.79-383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3097.534,3102.184,Say they indicted ten people at the same time and they all moved for separate trials.
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,3102.184,3107.173,"Well, that is right, there could be some horrendous results if No. A -- if No. 1 defendant was acquitted --"
1979.79-383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3107.173,3108.379,"Was acquitted, yes."
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,3108.379,3113.442,-- then the rest of them -- at least if there were a common factual issue --
1979.79-383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3113.442,3119.595,What if they were all charged with exactly the same crime?
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,3119.595,3120.382,"Well, that is correct."
1979.79-383,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3167.054,3168.001,For conspiracy.
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,3168.001,3169.348,For conspiracy.
1979.79-383,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3169.348,3174.148,"But that is a pretty well settled rule in the Federal courts, isn't it?"
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,3174.148,3175.174,Not in this Court.
1979.79-383,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3175.174,3176.245,In the Federal courts?
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,3176.245,3182.863,"I don't believe that actually even -- there are courts I will say, there are courts of appeals who have held exactly that."
1979.79-383,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3183.611,3186.781,The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit did so when I was a member of it.
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,3186.781,3187.978,That is correct.
1979.79-383,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3198.815,3215.284,"What worries me is that you are asking us to take into our consideration the possibility that a jury might ""exercise compassion"" and turn a man loose."
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,3217.944,3218.65,"Well, Mr. Justice --"
1979.79-383,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3218.65,3221.197,Don't we take a jury verdict as it is?
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,3221.197,3222.054,"No, we don't."
1979.79-383,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3237.567,3239.799,And that we should do something about it.
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,3239.799,3240.369,No.
1979.79-383,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3240.369,3242.354,That is what you were saying just a minute ago.
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,3242.354,3243.272,"No, what I was saying --"
1979.79-383,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3243.272,3246.753,You were saying that because of that we should allow you to take two bites of the cherry.
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,3246.753,3253.515,"No, I am saying because the Court has recognized that kind of compromise --"
1979.79-383,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3253.515,3255.571,What about double jeopardy?
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,3255.571,3256.487,Well --
1979.79-383,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3256.487,3261.406,"If we find that a jury had compassion, then we give you another trial."
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,3261.406,3262.443,In the case of --
1979.79-383,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3262.443,3264.709,You don't need that argument and why don't --
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,3264.709,3270.341,"Well, we feel some obligation to make all the arguments we feel have merit."
1979.79-383,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3277.742,3283.826,That jury could have turned that first man loose because they thought it was in China.
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,3287.192,3287.558,Well --
1979.79-383,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3287.558,3292.074,They could have turned that jury loose because the Government didn't prove its case.
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,3298.613,3302.921,"Mr. Justice, would you feel the same way if there was overwhelming proof of guilt in that case?"
1979.79-383,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3302.921,3306.885,I am not here to answer your questions.
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,3306.885,3312.309,Our point is that we don't feel that way when there is overwhelming proof of guilt.
1979.79-383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3458.086,3472.627,"I don't think you argue -- maybe I missed it in your brief -- that there might well be situations in which there would be evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment rights of the first defendant, would not be admissible against him."
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,3479.084,3479.964,"Well, we did."
1979.79-383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3583.257,3600.164,"Going back to the example -- the type of examples in your Footnote 29, why isn't that problem adequately handled by in the second trial the Government simply advising the trial court that there were these valid objections to its case and therefore the rule shouldn't apply in this particular case."
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,3602.86,3619.794,"Well, theoretically you could make an inquiry into exactly what evidence was excluded at the first trial, what evidence wasn't even offered because they knew it would be subject to constitutional problems."
1979.79-383,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3680.491,3686.492,"If you rely on the inability to call Standefer, that would be a circumstance always present, wouldn't it?"
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,3697.041,3704.269,That is correct and that might be a reason why in most cases the judges in the second case would rule in favor of the Government.
1979.79-383,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3704.269,3706.279,"Well, you would be able to call on him."
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,3715.402,3715.795,That is right.
1979.79-383,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3724.503,3726.168,What case holds that?
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,3726.168,3730.352,I think that is just in trial courts commonly understood.
1979.79-383,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3730.352,3731.712,Has it ever been held here?
1979.79-383,1,43774,william_h_alsup,,3731.712,3732.952,I don't think so.
