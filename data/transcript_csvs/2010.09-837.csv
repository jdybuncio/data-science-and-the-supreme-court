2010.09-837,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.104,"We will hear argument next in Case 09-837, Mayo Foundation For Medical Education and Research v. The United States."
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,10.775,13.898,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-837,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,59.342,66.997,"Mr. Olson, are all institutions that employ residents schools?"
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,66.997,89.161,"I don't know whether all -- as I understand, the resident program, which is accredited by the Accreditation Council For Graduate Medical Education, does involve an accreditation program which would probably fit -- where it's taking place would probably fit the definition of schools."
2010.09-837,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,94.769,114.618,"But it might be relevant, because it would be unseemly, perhaps, to have residents who are not working at, quote, FICA tax, and other residents whose training is approximately the same escape the tax."
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,114.618,117.305,"--Well, that was a judgment that Congress made."
2010.09-837,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,126.722,130.613,But you can't give me the reality there.
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,146.075,150.571,"The only reason I'm hesitating, Justice Ginsberg, is I don't know the entire universe out there."
2010.09-837,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,214.905,222.793,"Mr. Olson, are residents supervised their entire employ, the 80 hours?"
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,228.464,230.679,"Well, there's two parts of that question."
2010.09-837,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,255.718,271.663,What I -- how I look at this case is: How do you draw the line between a student who is working and a worker who is studying?
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,308.571,322.001,"There is -- well, various courts have considered this, have found the statutory provision that Congress has spoken to the subject, it has provided an exemption for students and it has provided its own limitations."
2010.09-837,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,324.236,339.431,"Why isn't the general counsel who is going to, let's assume, either three classes a week or six hours of classes is working 40 hours as general counsel, and he's regularly enrolled in classes."
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,341.603,347.352,--The Internal Revenue Service imposes a predominance requirement with respect to this.
2010.09-837,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,359.593,375.166,"--So why wouldn't common sense lead you to the conclusion that if someone is working 40 unsupervised hours without an attending physician at their side, taking care of patients, that that's really not a student?"
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,376.944,379.35,"Well, that is what the Treasury Department is saying."
2010.09-837,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,383.741,393.158,"You don't think receiving $50,000 or $60,000 a year is enough to make you an employee of someone?"
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,393.158,393.58,No.
2010.09-837,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,434.716,441.322,Why isn't that -- assume it's not the general counsel of the university but a lawyer working in the general counsel's office.
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,441.322,441.759,--Well--
2010.09-837,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,441.759,449.537,"He's being supervised by the general counsel, his work's being reviewed, and he's attending classes at night."
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,449.537,451.846,"--In the first place, that is a different case."
2010.09-837,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,493.582,499.658,"Well, what they want to achieve is a higher long-term pay, but they can go out and work as doctors."
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,499.658,501.124,"--They could -- well, very little."
2010.09-837,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,510.277,515.666,I understood that 15 percent of the physicians were not board certified.
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,515.666,534.644,"--And -- and many of them may be in the military or in circumstances, but the -- but the record is examined by the various courts that have considered it, said for all intents and purposes in the modern world, that physicians that are going to be treating you and me in the vast majority of cases will be board certified."
2010.09-837,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,536.391,543.531,So how about the architect residents who are working in universities?
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,547.887,548.323,"--Well, they may be."
2010.09-837,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,565.599,584.012,"Mr. Olson, why not read that provision -- now we are going to the statute -- if such service is performed by a student, et cetera, as saying: Well, this student status and the service is distinct from the student status?"
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,624.244,630.147,"--Well, the services are performed for the purpose of receiving an education."
2010.09-837,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,646.108,655.899,"But wouldn't -- wouldn't this fit the work/study student who is studying philosophy and then he's working in the, say, speech department?"
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,655.899,659.443,--I didn't hear that last word.
2010.09-837,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,659.443,674.531,"The -- it seems to me that what came into my mind when I read these words was a work/study program, where the student is studying and that -- the status is student."
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,712.954,716.357,"Well, this -- absolutely, that is true in this case."
2010.09-837,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,743.284,745.362,"No, I have in mind the typical work/study program."
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,778.395,783.316,"--Well, the government's got various categories of examples."
2010.09-837,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,821.828,824.203,"Well, you keep focusing, Mr. Olson, on -- on this case."
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,843.646,844.052,--Well--
2010.09-837,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,844.052,858.812,"It goes back -- both of you go back and forth with hypotheticals, each of which sort of supports, but this basically a very familiar situation of an apprentice who is both an employee and both a student, and to try to draw the line in some categorical way doesn't make sense."
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,865.293,871.7,"--I know we are in the Supreme Court, but five courts of appeals that considered this said that the language is clear."
2010.09-837,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,879.101,884.475,"Well, those five courts did it before -- most of those opinions were rendered before the new regulation."
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,884.475,885.457,--That's right.
2010.09-837,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,886.678,887.146,Only one--
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,887.146,908.526,"--The government having lost based upon the words of the statute and the regulations that they had promulgated that had to do with the goals, the purpose, the objective, and the nature of the activity, lost every one of those cases and said: We are going to adopt a regulation that does have the virtue that the Chief Justice mentioned of -- of being categorical."
2010.09-837,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,916.93,922.581,Is it -- is it -- the -- the answer to Justice Ginsberg's question -- I was uncertain.
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,942.664,943.961,"--Oh, yes."
2010.09-837,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,945.272,945.631,All right.
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,945.631,946.571,--could take the position--
2010.09-837,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,946.571,946.929,Then it's not.
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1002.767,1003.562,"--Yes, they have."
2010.09-837,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1003.562,1003.937,All right.
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1017.604,1021.04,"Well, because it's both arbitrary and it's irrational."
2010.09-837,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1030.441,1031.377,--Mr. Olson--
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1031.377,1033.721,--The government is saying -- the government is saying--
2010.09-837,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1033.721,1034.22,--everyone learns.
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1044.527,1045.058,"--Oh, by the way--"
2010.09-837,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1045.058,1053.758,"--It's -- it's, in my mind, difficult to separate out what makes a person or stops a person from learning on a job."
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1053.758,1054.931,"--Well, the fact is--"
2010.09-837,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1054.931,1056.008,"At any job, actually."
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1056.008,1060.348,"--Well, the Justices of this Court are exempt from Social Security taxes--"
2010.09-837,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1060.897,1064.38,"You are not challenging that, are you, Mr. Olson?"
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1065.035,1066.065,"No, you're okay."
2010.09-837,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1066.065,1071.0,"I opted in, Mr. Olson, for the very reason the residents might want to."
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1071.0,1073.921,Congress -- Congress decided to provide an exemption for students.
2010.09-837,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1075.621,1084.621,"No, no -- didn't as interpreted -- it's not -- it's that -- I concede everything you say: It's a total learning experience and it's a special learning experience."
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1109.703,1110.28,--Well--
2010.09-837,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1110.28,1111.251,--in respect to the whole.
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1114.452,1115.232,--That's -- that's--
2010.09-837,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1115.232,1116.964,It's that the work is the education.
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1116.964,1124.15,"--That last step that you made is just like Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll's ""Through the Looking Glass"","
2010.09-837,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1168.851,1189.827,"Mr. Olson, there has been a concern expressed that if we accept your position that residents are students, it will have ramifications for other areas of the law, notably, the National Labor Relations Act."
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1215.38,1221.752,"That is the fallacy that the government is making, that you have to either be a student or an employee."
2010.09-837,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1319.758,1333.754,"I looked it up in the dictionary, and meaning number one of ""incident"" is: An accompanying minor occurrence or -- occurrence or condition."
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1347.531,1350.373,But that's the whole dichotomy that doesn't exist.
2010.09-837,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1432.594,1434.794,"--Well, that's because of the second meaning here."
2010.09-837,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1441.15,1444.573,We don't know whether that's a step forward or backward.
2010.09-837,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1444.573,1451.335,And here what it is says is: Something arising or resulting from something else of greater or principal import.
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1468.948,1469.716,But that--
2010.09-837,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1469.716,1471.12,"Rather, it's -- let's say it's of equal import."
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1471.12,1473.511,--I submit that that makes no sense at all.
2010.09-837,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1485.164,1485.834,You have to draw the line.
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1485.834,1487.117,"--I accept the word ""incident""."
2010.09-837,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1487.117,1488.755,"Why do you accept the word ""incident""?"
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1490.256,1490.599,"No, it isn't."
2010.09-837,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1492.128,1498.955,"Well, why isn't the answer that the -- that the noneducational aspect of the service has to be incidental to what they are doing?"
2010.09-837,0,43165,theodore_b_olson,,1498.955,1500.827,"--Well, that might be also."
2010.09-837,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1526.896,1527.551,"Thank you, Mr. Olson."
2010.09-837,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1534.144,1536.25,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-837,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1591.261,1605.053,"If the question is whether someone is predominantly a student or an employee, why shouldn't we ask: Why are they enrolled in this program, and why is the institution enrolling them in the program?"
2010.09-837,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1628.591,1644.786,"It's probably both, Your Honor, but it's not workable to determine student status by looking at a particular case, whether the predominant motive or the motive of the employee or the employer is education."
2010.09-837,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1644.786,1652.893,"In general, why are residents -- why do medical school graduates become residents?"
2010.09-837,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1659.311,1661.872,"I think they are doing it for both reasons, Your Honor."
2010.09-837,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1676.333,1677.799,Because they don't work at schools.
2010.09-837,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1677.799,1683.828,"Because they don't work at schools, colleges, and universities, and they, you know, may not be enrolled and regularly attending classes."
2010.09-837,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1700.744,1705.275,"What if on average they were paid $10,000 a year?"
2010.09-837,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1705.977,1707.849,Yes.
2010.09-837,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1865.815,1876.34,"What if the school said: You have to get all this clinical experience, but we are going to pay you for the first two hours of the day that you are doing that?"
2010.09-837,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1892.429,1910.858,"Well, the rule is that the paid work doesn't count towards student status, and it doesn't count whether you are doing it for 4 hours, for 10 hours, or for 40 hours."
2010.09-837,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1928.928,1936.676,"It looks more -- if you accept their classification, it looks more like their work is incidental to their status as a student."
2010.09-837,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1936.676,1941.594,--If you accept the classification in your hypothetical of two hours and the other eight hours?
2010.09-837,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1954.108,1957.715,"Presumably, you would say it does if they don't pay them anything."
2010.09-837,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1957.715,1960.776,"--No, not necessarily, Your Honor."
2010.09-837,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1977.703,1980.402,But I thought clinical work couldn't qualify as a course.
2010.09-837,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,1981.965,1986.119,Clinical work can qualify as a course under certain circumstances.
2010.09-837,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1994.086,2002.582,It certainly -- they can be a student in the last year of medical school and then they are doing intern-level work.
2010.09-837,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2012.702,2019.623,"--Yes, it's clinical work, but it's very different than the work that the residents are doing."
2010.09-837,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2041.05,2050.967,We now have a lot of briefs -- we now have a lot of briefs filed in this Court in which a lot of the work is done by students in law school.
2010.09-837,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2055.155,2059.37,--They are not getting paid for it.
2010.09-837,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2059.37,2062.26,But is it a course?
2010.09-837,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2063.071,2077.426,"It might be a course, Your Honor, but they are also engaged in other classes and other activities that make them regularly enrolled and its part of a degree program."
2010.09-837,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2081.906,2082.594,I understand that.
2010.09-837,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2089.967,2093.339,I'm not resisting the proposition that clinical work can constitute a course.
2010.09-837,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2129.963,2142.868,"Mr. Roberts, do you know the answer to the question I asked Mr. Olson; that is: Are all resident programs schools?"
2010.09-837,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2142.868,2145.067,"No, Your Honor, they are not."
2010.09-837,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2238.0,2243.514,"Mr. Roberts, the Petitioner's brief says twice that there is some question."
2010.09-837,1,36594,matthew_d_roberts,,2266.267,2268.549,"There's no -- there's no question, Your Honor."
2010.09-837,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2339.504,2340.159,"Thank you, counsel."
