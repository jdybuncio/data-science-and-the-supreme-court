1976.75-1771,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,14.414,"We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 75-1771, Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Standard Life & Accident."
1976.75-1771,0,42099,stuart_a_smith,,17.621,21.31,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.75-1771,1,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,2635.091,2976.918,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1976.75-1771,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2976.918,2988.955,"Well, Mr. Hughes, wouldn't you concede that there is at least a superficial plausibility to the Government’s approach that if a figure goes into the numerator, it ought to go into the denominator, too?"
1976.75-1771,1,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,2988.955,3160.912,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I would say that the word ""superficial"" is right, it is more optical than real."
1976.75-1771,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3160.912,3168.953,"But, Mr. Hughes, on that assumption, wouldn't the $75,000 premium be deducted from the payoff, and therefore you would have received income?"
1976.75-1771,1,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,3168.953,3200.708,"Well, we would receive it in next year, and that is the timing matter."
1976.75-1771,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3200.708,3218.08,"Mr. Hughes, maybe I am not following you."
1976.75-1771,1,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,3218.08,3223.731,"All right, sir."
1976.75-1771,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3223.731,3225.798,"Well, I have given you one."
1976.75-1771,1,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,3225.798,3235.885,"All right, sir."
1976.75-1771,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3235.885,3241.207,"Well, January 1."
1976.75-1771,1,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,3241.207,3249.857,"If it all happens within the same calendar year, Justice Blackmun, then there is no question, because it will come into income."
1976.75-1771,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3249.857,3256.882,"Well, I think you confuse when you speak of two taxable years and it is not necessarily so."
1976.75-1771,1,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,3256.882,4094.906,"Mr. Justice, I believe that this may be one of the problems with the case, then."
1976.75-1771,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4094.906,4096.514,What page were you on there?
1976.75-1771,1,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,4096.514,4120.58,"Page 5, sir."
1976.75-1771,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4120.58,4125.149,"You would agree that where they are equally valid, wouldn't you, or you would say neither of them is valid?"
1976.75-1771,1,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,4125.149,4225.399,"Neither of them are valid -- no, I would not agree that they are equally valid."
1976.75-1771,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4225.399,4253.062,"On that point, I wish you would pursue for me the hypothetical question I put to Mr. Smith about Justice Powell’s $100,000 premium."
1976.75-1771,1,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,4253.062,4253.836,Mr. Chief Justice --
1976.75-1771,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4253.836,4264.08,"Mr. Hughes, before you start, would you reduce that premium to $100, please?"
1976.75-1771,1,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,4264.08,4266.254,"With the Chief Justice’s permission, I will reduce it to $100."
1976.75-1771,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4266.254,4271.353,Mr. Smith would not agree to that; he wants a larger tax.
1976.75-1771,1,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,4271.353,4301.177,"But the novelty of the Government’s position shows up there, because under the taxpayer’s position, assuming that Justice Powell survives, the $75 would come into income in the succeeding year if paid."
1976.75-1771,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4301.177,4305.831,So you and Mr. Smith disagree.
1976.75-1771,1,43609,vester_t_hughes_jr,,4305.831,4642.436,"Oh, under the Government’s primary position, at the end of the year the deferred and uncollected -- and under the position of the four circuits -- the gross premiums, not the net premiums except as modified then by Federal in Great Commonwealth; but the gross premiums would be taxed in year one, assuming this policy was taken out in 1976."
1976.75-1771,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,4782.719,5115.752,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1976.75-1771,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5115.752,5118.558,"Of course, the Government prevailed in Foster Lumber; didn't it?"
1976.75-1771,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,5118.558,5178.726,"Yes, and that is exactly our point."
1976.75-1771,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5178.726,5185.554,Would you tell us precisely what sentence you were referring to in 818 that the Government is reading out?
1976.75-1771,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,5185.554,5190.365,"The Government is reading in, I am sorry."
1976.75-1771,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5190.365,5191.829,You just said that they were reading out one of them.
1976.75-1771,2,36970,matthew_j_zinn,,5191.829,5499.834,No.
1976.75-1771,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5499.834,5505.358,"Thank you, Mr. Zinn."
1976.75-1771,3,42099,stuart_a_smith,,5505.358,5662.996,Let me quickly just make a few points.
1976.75-1771,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,5662.996,5664.921,You argued Foster Lumber?
1976.75-1771,3,42099,stuart_a_smith,,5664.921,5665.398,I did.
1976.75-1771,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,5665.398,5666.785,"Not once, but twice?"
1976.75-1771,3,42099,stuart_a_smith,,5666.785,5667.376,That is true.
1976.75-1771,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,5667.376,5671.483,Do you have any comment to Mr. Zinn’s with regard to Foster Lumber?
1976.75-1771,3,42099,stuart_a_smith,,5671.483,5780.61,"Yes, I do, Mr. Justice Blackmun."
1976.75-1771,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5780.61,5795.553,"Mr. Smith, I just ask this very point."
1976.75-1771,3,42099,stuart_a_smith,,5795.553,5807.16,"Yes; but I think if you carry Mr. Zinn’s sort of initial premise, you land right in the alternative regulation, because none of these things are accruable items."
1976.75-1771,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5807.16,5810.038,But you land right into the NAIC under his argument.
1976.75-1771,3,42099,stuart_a_smith,,5810.038,5810.681,"No, I do not think that is so."
1976.75-1771,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5810.681,5811.668,"Why do not, well, that is the question."
1976.75-1771,3,42099,stuart_a_smith,,5811.668,5844.536,"I think you do not land in the NAIC point, because essentially the insurance texts uniformly provide, and there has been no refutation from the other side on that point, that these are not liabilities, they are overstatements."
1976.75-1771,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5844.536,5847.797,"Does one ever land in the ""except"" sentence?"
1976.75-1771,3,42099,stuart_a_smith,,5847.797,5904.743,"I think one lands in the ""except"" sentence to the extent that the NAIC method is recognized in the statute."
1976.75-1771,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5904.743,5906.551,You are going over old ground now.
1976.75-1771,3,42099,stuart_a_smith,,5906.551,5908.272,I am sorry.
1976.75-1771,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5908.272,5915.111,"I would like to ask you -- and this may be old or new, Mr. Smith -- is this a relatively new position of the Commissioner?"
1976.75-1771,3,42099,stuart_a_smith,,5915.111,5915.801,"Oh, absolutely not."
1976.75-1771,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5915.801,5917.665,How long has it been going on?
1976.75-1771,3,42099,stuart_a_smith,,5917.665,5927.392,For about 18 years.
1976.75-1771,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5927.392,5934.662,Are there proposals for it to amend the revenue laws to change the Commissioner’s practice?
1976.75-1771,3,42099,stuart_a_smith,,5934.662,5949.755,"Absolutely not, not that I am aware of."
1976.75-1771,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5949.755,5959.392,"Do you think this position you could say has been going on, or it may have been challenged all this time, but it has been the Commissioner’s position for 20 years or no?"
1976.75-1771,3,42099,stuart_a_smith,,5959.392,5964.627,"Well, say, I suppose, since '60, '59 or '60."
1976.75-1771,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5964.627,5968.428,"Well, of course, as long as the courts were going that way, you did not need to worry about it."
1976.75-1771,3,42099,stuart_a_smith,,5968.428,5974.453,"We were happy, that is true, although we submit that this Court should reverse the judgment below."
1976.75-1771,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5974.453,5977.312,"Thank you, gentlemen."
