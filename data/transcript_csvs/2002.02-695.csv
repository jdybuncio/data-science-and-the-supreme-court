2002.02-695,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.543,"We'll hear argument next in No. 02-695, Michael Fitzgerald v. Racing Association of Central Iowa."
2002.02-695,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,56.104,59.524,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-695,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,87.622,90.528,It's called gaming if... if you favor it.
2002.02-695,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,90.528,94.433,"I... is there a neutral term, Your Honor?"
2002.02-695,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,197.079,203.78,So now the bulk of the earnings are from slot machines rather than the races.
2002.02-695,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,204.639,207.029,"That... that's right, Your Honor."
2002.02-695,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,212.292,228.317,"But under your scheme, I take it the highest tax rate for slot machine income at racetracks is 36 percent versus 20 percent for slot machines on riverboats."
2002.02-695,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,228.317,230.41,"That... that is correct, Your Honor."
2002.02-695,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,238.688,241.499,And you want to offer a rational basis for that scheme?
2002.02-695,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,241.499,241.78,Yes.
2002.02-695,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,283.81,289.464,"Well, because of that legislation, the Delta King left the Sacramento River and it's gone up to the Mississippi."
2002.02-695,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,289.464,295.868,"Well, that was the next purpose, Your Honor, to try and get other boats to... to come to Iowa, and apparently--"
2002.02-695,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,295.868,302.349,"They're... they're saying... and maybe there's... I take it from their brief that, look, there's never been a tax scheme like this."
2002.02-695,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,346.362,355.281,"--Well, I think there's been many times where the... the taxpayer has been... been treated differently even if... even if the transaction is the same."
2002.02-695,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,355.281,355.563,Like what?
2002.02-695,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,355.563,357.577,"Sort of the... the enterprise zones, for instance."
2002.02-695,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,365.527,368.011,Typical... typical sales tax.
2002.02-695,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,375.601,376.148,--Yes.
2002.02-695,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,392.938,407.573,"Do... do you agree, at least to the extent the respondents say, that there's no other State in which slot machines are taxed at a different rate depending on their location, that this is unique to Iowa?"
2002.02-695,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,407.573,414.976,"I... I think as far as I know, that's... that's the... that's the case."
2002.02-695,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,453.991,457.552,So I push their argument or am I imagining... I'm trying to put it the strongest way.
2002.02-695,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,473.467,474.67,"--Well, there is difference--"
2002.02-695,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,474.67,475.935,"I... I... yes, go ahead."
2002.02-695,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,475.935,478.168,--There is difference in... in the enterprise.
2002.02-695,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,501.862,507.047,"As I understood it, didn't... didn't the tax on the... the higher tax on the racetracks come later?"
2002.02-695,0,43004,thomas_j_miller,,507.047,510.561,"It was... it was phased in, Your Honor."
2002.02-695,1,33864,kent_l_jones,,1045.876,1052.356,I'd like to thank counsel.
2002.02-695,2,36382,mark_mccormick,,1670.107,1681.15,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-695,3,43004,thomas_j_miller,,3360.192,3391.913,"I would just point out that Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Company is the... is the case where this Court decided that in... in a case before this Court that comes from a State court, that the Federal process, the Federal analysis applies, and that the total work, the total decisionmaking done by the State court is reviewable here, so much so that in that case they reversed a factual finding in... in the court."
2002.02-695,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3433.256,3433.943,"Thank you, General Miller."
