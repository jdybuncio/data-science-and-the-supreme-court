1973.73-157,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,15.705,"We will hear arguments first this morning in 73-157, Calero-Toledo against Pearson Yacht Leasing Company."
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,18.634,21.074,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-157,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,180.73,200.189,"Are you suggesting, Mr. Coleman, that if there were a mortgage -- if there’d been a full transfer and a mortgage back, that is the title had passed and the mortgage back, that this forfeiture would then wipe out the underlying security?"
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,200.189,202.445,"I don’t know that it would have in this case, Your Honor."
1973.73-157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,235.779,239.157,"Isn’t it right, Mr. Coleman, in this case, the lessee could buy the thing for a dollar at the end of --"
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,239.157,241.575,"Yes, $1 after the end of 5 years."
1973.73-157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,241.861,244.759,So it’s virtually indistinguishable from a conditional sale?
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,244.759,248.65,I think that’s true.
1973.73-157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,345.201,356.743,"Under the Puerto Rican statute, could someone having a property interest in the vessel who was not in possession of it have registered under this Puerto Rican statute and then been notified at the time of the forfeiture?"
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,356.743,357.545,I believe so.
1973.73-157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,496.202,498.508,"It fully applied, could it?"
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,498.508,499.656,"I’m not sure, Your Honor."
1973.73-157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,499.656,500.011,What is it?
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,501.665,509.66,"Well, there could -- there can be, I think, a respectable analysis made that it is before the --"
1973.73-157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,509.66,512.539,"Well, it treats -- we treat it like a State Court on other purposes?"
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,512.539,513.082,Yes.
1973.73-157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,513.082,517.52,"We treat judgments of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, I’m sure that’s what we do."
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,517.52,518.184,Yes.
1973.73-157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,518.184,522.042,"Treat judgments of the states, but can anyone really argue that Puerto Rico is a state?"
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,522.042,525.317,"Well, I would not attempt to argue it now, Your Honor."
1973.73-157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,532.331,534.263,"Well, do you have to if the Fifth applies?"
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,537.835,540.189,Your Honor has put his finger on the point.
1973.73-157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,549.99,552.893,"I know, but it’s purely a congressional Commonwealth, isn’t it?"
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,552.893,553.663,"Well, I --"
1973.73-157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,553.663,554.502,That’s just the way that that was given.
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,554.502,558.286,"I don’t think that that would be can absolutely agreed to, Your Honor."
1973.73-157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,558.286,561.889,I know that. I’ve been in Puerto Rico.
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,563.46,573.142,What I’m suggesting merely is that a proper determination of that issue would involve a very detailed analysis of the creation of the Commonwealth.
1973.73-157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,579.765,584.694,"I still, for the life of me, can’t see how it could ever be a fake one when it’s not been admitted to the Union."
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,584.694,586.865,"Well, it is certainly not a state of the Union --"
1973.73-157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,586.865,586.962,It certainly isn’t.
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,586.962,588.192,But as to --
1973.73-157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,588.192,595.387,I don’t see how the Fourteenth Amendment which applies only the States of the Union apply to Commonwealth of Puerto Rico?
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,595.387,597.822,"Well, I would not attempt to go into that this time."
1973.73-157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,597.822,607.008,"Well, does it have to be one of the other in order to sustain jurisdiction of this Court to review judgments of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico?"
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,607.008,608.862,"I would assume that it would, Your Honor."
1973.73-157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,611.35,614.191,"Yes, so we don’t really care which it is right now, do we?"
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,614.191,618.684,I don’t believe you do.[Laughter]
1973.73-157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,623.808,627.757,"Well, we haven’t."
1973.73-157,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,627.757,630.79,You want to clarify the existence of the problem rather than the --
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,630.79,631.692,That’s exactly right.
1973.73-157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,704.146,715.272,"On referring to the lease, you say that the seizure as opposed to the forfeiture didn’t impair the lessee’s obligation to pay rent to the lessor, so --"
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,715.272,717.844,"Nor did forfeiture, Your Honor."
1973.73-157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,717.844,720.525,Yes.
1973.73-157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,720.525,725.419,"But forfeiture did change the ownership, the basic ownership, and seizure did not?"
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,725.419,726.063,That’s true.
1973.73-157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,726.063,733.76,You say that during the term of the lease the lessor wasn’t entitled to possession anyway so that the change of possession didn’t affect him at all?
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,733.76,735.115,That’s right.
1973.73-157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,735.115,738.794,And he had a hearing for forfeiture or an opportunity for a hearing for forfeiture?
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,738.794,739.377,That’s true.
1973.73-157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,739.377,746.789,"Well, as I understand it, he had an opportunity if he’d been given notice in 15 days, there was a 15-day limitation."
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,746.789,748.933,"Of course, there’s a question."
1973.73-157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,754.644,754.983,Right.
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,754.983,756.9,He obtained actual notice.
1973.73-157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,756.9,758.131,Within 15 days?
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,758.131,759.167,"No, no."
1973.73-157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,793.161,800.812,Do you say that it has been judicially determined that that 15 day-period doesn’t begin to run until there’s actual notice?
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,800.812,811.306,"Until there’s notice. Whether actual notice will suffice, I’m not sure, but it may be that only notice by the -- formal notice by the Commonwealth pursuant to the statute will suffice."
1973.73-157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,811.306,814.019,"Now if that’s true, the period hasn’t begun to run yet?"
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,814.019,814.886,That’s exactly right.
1973.73-157,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,814.886,815.756,Is that right?
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,815.756,817.087,Yes.
1973.73-157,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,817.087,830.542,"If one takes the strictest possible view of the Puerto Rican forfeiture statute, that is, that it forfeits the interest of a totally innocent owner upon compliance with a statutory."
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,839.427,845.366,They would be restricted to arguing that either the crime was --
1973.73-157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,845.366,846.39,There wasn’t any marijuana?
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,846.39,850.979,"There wasn’t any marijuana or something of that nature, that’s true."
1973.73-157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,887.525,892.795,What does the Puerto Rican Government do to forfeited vessels?
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,894.081,895.965,They have the option of selling them or retaining them.
1973.73-157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,895.965,897.431,Do they normally just sell them?
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,897.431,898.789,"I think, normally, they sell them."
1973.73-157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,900.064,903.533,Maybe obtain this one for personal use of officials or something?
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,903.533,907.402,"Actually, the retained it pending the outcome of this case."
1973.73-157,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,907.564,912.471,"I know, but didn’t I read somewhere that officials are making use of it?"
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,912.471,914.64,No.
1973.73-157,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,937.588,949.591,"I suppose this case in its present posture would be the same if they -- whether they found marijuana, heroin, or machine guns that were being run to or from Cuba or --"
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,949.591,950.221,That’s exactly right.
1973.73-157,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,950.221,951.018,-- whatever?
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,951.018,953.177,That’s why the case is very important to the Commonwealth.
1973.73-157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1088.408,1092.976,Was this vessel just stopped and boarded?
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,1094.075,1098.471,"The record does not disclose that, Your Honor."
1973.73-157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1098.471,1104.164,"Well, is there any intention made that the officials had no right to go on the vessel at all?"
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,1104.164,1105.136,I don’t think so.
1973.73-157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1105.136,1108.555,Or is it challenged that there was marijuana found or not?
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,1108.555,1111.063,No.
1973.73-157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1111.063,1119.153,"So, are we to assume that the vessel was properly boarded and marijuana was found in judging this case?"
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,1119.153,1120.257,I believe so.
1973.73-157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1129.151,1132.75,And the parties were arrested?
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,1132.75,1135.656,Yes.
1973.73-157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1135.656,1138.034,Was there any challenge to their arrest?
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,1138.034,1142.185,Not on this record.
1973.73-157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1218.207,1224.434,"Well, what -- you don’t suggest a hearing -- that no hearing at all was required?"
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,1224.434,1225.321,"No, no, no."
1973.73-157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1232.131,1233.822,Yes.
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,1233.822,1242.862,And I think there’s provision that the hearing be very prompt following up on the seizure.
1973.73-157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1340.647,1346.569,But the lower court construed it as authorizing the taking of an innocent party?
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,1346.569,1348.955,The Puerto Rican Supreme Court enact in 1967 and --
1973.73-157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1348.955,1350.229,"But then, in this case--"
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,1350.229,1351.617,"In this Court, the --"
1973.73-157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1351.617,1352.373,In this case?
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,1352.373,1352.794,I’m sorry.
1973.73-157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1352.794,1353.151,In this case?
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,1353.151,1359.446,"That’s right and on the strength of that decision, Your Honor, this Court said that there was no other way to construe the statute."
1973.73-157,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1359.446,1362.786,"Well, are we about to disagree with him?"
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,1365.192,1379.042,"No, but my primary argument of course, Your Honor, it would be a wrong construction should the court view the constitutional requirements as being such, that this defense must be permitted."
1973.73-157,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1569.695,1573.681,But suppose they could’ve required a bond of some kind?
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,1573.681,1575.383,The statue does provide for bond.
1973.73-157,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1575.383,1577.234,In addition to what they have here?
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,1577.234,1579.219,"Yes, they could."
1973.73-157,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1579.219,1589.817,"Supposing, it views about one thing, in your appendix, I take it on page 29 is the memorandum opinion and order of the court."
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,1589.817,1590.774,That’s true.
1973.73-157,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1597.431,1609.515,In the appendix and yet in the index part you state that the memorandum opinion is not reprinted in the appendix.
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,1618.964,1620.048,That’s true.
1973.73-157,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1620.048,1621.765,So that the statement in the index is incorrect?
1973.73-157,0,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,1621.765,1623.799,That’s right.
1973.73-157,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1630.359,1642.149,"While the other side speaks of a deal within the District of Massachusetts, so maybe you’re even.[Laughter]"
1973.73-157,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1642.149,1644.065,Mr. Gelpi.
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,1644.065,1651.706,Mr. Chief Justice Burger and may it please the Court.
1973.73-157,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1670.911,1671.975,Of which document?
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,1671.975,1675.878,Of appellee’s brief.
1973.73-157,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1690.132,1691.063,I didn’t get to that.
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,1692.513,1696.532,"Page 3, the fifth line from the bottom."
1973.73-157,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1696.532,1698.161,And what’s the word?
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,1698.161,1700.243,It should be “or” instead of “of.”
1973.73-157,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1702.26,1702.803,"Oh, I see that."
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,1705.356,1726.572,And the other error is the omission of the page on page 9 to the citation of Fuentes versus Shevin which should be page 86.
1973.73-157,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1726.572,1728.205,What page?
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,1728.205,1729.226,Page 86.
1973.73-157,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1729.226,1737.846,"86, thank you."
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,1737.846,1758.399,The Puerto Rican statutes which the District Court declared unconstitutional facially allow the taking of an innocent man’s property thereby imposing a penalty upon one not significantly involved in a criminal enterprise.
1973.73-157,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1768.129,1770.133,Before a forfeiture takes place?
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,1770.133,1772.351,Yes.
1973.73-157,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1838.355,1847.786,"But -- or is he upheld on a factual basis, wouldn’t it, if the challenger could show that marijuana was not in fact discovered on the vessel?"
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,1847.786,1851.562,I don’t even think that such a showing would exempt --
1973.73-157,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1851.562,1855.72,"Well, what’s the point of the statute providing for any challenge then?"
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,1855.72,1856.723,That’s precisely it.
1973.73-157,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1858.275,1862.367,"Well, there must be some point well I would suppose here wasn’t?"
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,1862.367,1868.453,"It does exempt to -- it gives an opportunity, in the case of a common carrier, to come into court and show --"
1973.73-157,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1868.453,1880.127,"Well, that’s by judicial decision that a common carrier or somebody whose property was stolen and used for an illegal -- to transport contraband, is not covered by the statute."
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,1882.355,1883.438,Yes.
1973.73-157,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1883.438,1887.576,"-- of the courts of Puerto Rico, but the statute doesn’t mention anything like that."
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,1916.233,1923.171,There has been no case regarding whether that showing could be made.
1973.73-157,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1957.825,1976.415,"Well, to be more specific, suppose at the forfeiture hearing, the person came in and showed by the testimony of expert chemists that the substance found was ground soybeans and not marijuana."
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,1982.11,1987.007,I don’t think it would defeat the forfeiture under these particular statutes.
1973.73-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1987.007,2005.621,"Mr. Gelpi, at page 34 of the jurisdictional statement of your opponent, Section 1722 of the LPRA is set out under Section A there."
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,2032.277,2032.585,Oh!
1973.73-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2040.141,2050.138,What’s the point of providing for a hearing and adjudication of facts if the adjudication doesn’t have some effect on the proceeding?
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,2050.138,2053.101,"That is one of the defects of the statute, I think, which --"
1973.73-157,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2053.101,2059.55,But in this case you admitted that they were transporting marijuana illegally on this vessel?
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,2059.55,2061.313,"No, it hasn’t been admitted."
1973.73-157,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2068.88,2070.605,Illegal possession?
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,2070.605,2072.833,"Well, possession under --"
1973.73-157,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2072.833,2073.518,Illegal or not?
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,2073.518,2074.683,"It is illegal, yes."
1973.73-157,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2074.683,2077.107,Its illegal possession and a violation of law?
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,2077.107,2077.565,Yes.
1973.73-157,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2077.565,2079.505,And that’s admitted in this case?
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,2079.505,2082.864,"Yes, that is what it appears to have happened."
1973.73-157,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2082.864,2086.409,"So I guess it is true that, in your case, there’s no use in having a hearing."
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,2086.409,2086.9,Exactly.
1973.73-157,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2086.9,2090.005,Because he’s guilty.
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,2090.005,2091.301,The lessee is guilty.
1973.73-157,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2091.301,2095.978,Right.
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,2095.978,2103.128,"Well, the decision relied on Fuentes and in Coin and Currency."
1973.73-157,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2103.128,2106.139,Marijuana?
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,2106.139,2134.082,"Appellant’s argument based upon the lease contract between the parties of possible compensation from collateral sources and upon the alleged failure to exhaust contractual remedies are irrelevant, in my opinion, since they were neither raised nor argued in the court below and have no basis on the record before this Court."
1973.73-157,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2212.745,2216.926,"For the arrest or the seizure, the original seizure?"
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,2216.926,2219.83,"The seizure, for the seizure."
1973.73-157,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2276.05,2279.791,Do you think there was an illegal arrest there?
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,2279.791,2282.748,The record doesn’t show and I don’t know whether that --
1973.73-157,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2282.748,2289.198,"Well, you would have to claim that was illegal to make your present argument."
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,2289.198,2297.548,"Well, Your Honor, the thing is that the statute here -- the seizure in this case was for forfeiture."
1973.73-157,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2297.548,2309.565,"I understand, but it was after, as I understand it, marijuana was found on the vessel in possession of those in charge of the vessel."
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,2309.565,2311.263,"Yes, that’s what appears from the record."
1973.73-157,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2311.263,2323.233,"You think that was -- in those circumstances, do you think there would have to be a prior determination by a magistrate before an arrest could be made?"
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,2323.233,2327.381,That would depend upon what the circumstances were at the time of arrest.
1973.73-157,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2327.381,2330.763,We’ve just given you the circumstances?
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,2330.763,2340.378,"If the policeman walks upon the boat and finds the person in possession using marijuana at that time, he is entitled to make an arrest."
1973.73-157,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2340.378,2342.359,Yes.
1973.73-157,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2342.359,2344.564,"But you’re not challenging the arrest, that’s clear?"
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,2344.564,2351.768,"No, I don’t even know how the arrest came about or how it was affected."
1973.73-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2553.126,2564.279,"If it is desired to seize contraband, wouldn’t there almost always be exigent circumstances as to the seizure as opposed to the forfeiture?"
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,2570.45,2582.784,"No, but the seizure of contraband, Your Honor, is precisely one of the things that may be summarily seized because they are illegal per se."
1973.73-157,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2612.305,2622.072,"But, in the Fifth, it’s permissible to have a statute that says a boat on which contraband is found shall itself be forfeited."
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,2643.358,2653.429,"Well, Your Honor, if the contraband is there and has not yet been seized, that may very well be the case."
1973.73-157,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2671.357,2682.14,"Well, what if the boat is going to be used to transport the same thing within the next half hour, is that a good enough answer?"
1973.73-157,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2682.14,2687.515,"Or as another alternative, that the boat won’t be there when they come?"
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,2687.515,2690.832,"Well the boat, in the first place, Your Honor, does not belong to the lessee."
1973.73-157,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2701.188,2712.285,"Now, may I call your attention to paragraph 4 (a) of the lease on page 43 of the jurisdictional statement?"
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,2736.814,2741.065,"From the record of this case, it does not appear."
1973.73-157,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2755.852,2763.893,"Well, why should that be a matter of concern since the lessor had the right under the lease to demand the insurance?"
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,2771.774,2782.487,There is nothing in the record here to show that that there was -- that that insurance actually could exist.
1973.73-157,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2792.268,2803.956,"Does the lessor in this case declare the lease terminated and all of the rent due and payable, as is provided by the lease?"
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,2803.956,2808.543,"It does not appear so from the record, but that was in fact done."
1973.73-157,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2808.543,2817.255,"But under the terms of the lease the lessor now has the legal right to make a full recovery from the lessee, there’s no doubt about that?"
1973.73-157,1,25337,gustavo_a_gelpi,,2817.255,2823.595,Yes.
1973.73-157,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2913.583,2914.428,"No, I think not."
1973.73-157,2,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,2919.636,2922.012,"One or two things, Your Honor."
1973.73-157,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2946.803,2961.562,"But since the forfeiture is predicated on the illegal acts, it should reasonably follow that if no illegal act is found and determined, there couldn’t be any foundation for the forfeiture."
1973.73-157,2,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,2961.562,2962.907,"That’d be my view of the law, Your Honor."
1973.73-157,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2963.92,2969.403,"It’s not predicated on criminal conviction, is it?"
1973.73-157,2,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,2969.403,2980.36,"Well, it is predicated on their being a controlled substance, in effect, used in violation of the law on a particular vessel."
1973.73-157,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2993.293,2995.449,But it must require a conviction?
1973.73-157,2,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,2995.449,2997.048,"No, it certainly doesn’t--"
1973.73-157,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2997.048,3005.504,"All it requires is proof that the substance were there whether or not there is any prosecution, isn’t that it, under the statute?"
1973.73-157,2,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,3005.504,3007.278,"The statute reads that way, Your Honor."
1973.73-157,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3007.278,3008.997,"One way up, I mean, that’s where you would’ve taken it."
1973.73-157,2,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,3008.997,3009.772,I think that --
1973.73-157,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3009.772,3021.187,"Might you not find a situation where there was controlled substance of a vessel, but no sufficient evidence to say that any one given individual was in possession of the controlled substance?"
1973.73-157,2,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,3021.187,3027.357,"I think that could be certainly the case, Your Honor."
1973.73-157,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3134.42,3158.848,"I suppose, Mr. Coleman, that it has happened that a vessel on -- with no one on board at all may have been found with machine guns, heroin, or other contraband seized and forfeited and there would be no verdict of guilt of any person unless --"
1973.73-157,2,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,3158.848,3159.102,I think --
1973.73-157,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3159.102,3163.828,-- unless they could show that the owner in some way was involved in the conspiracy?
1973.73-157,2,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,3163.828,3164.871,"I think so, Your Honor."
1973.73-157,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3185.777,3187.861,Then the vessel was the instrument of the crime?
1973.73-157,2,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,3187.861,3188.507,I think that --
1973.73-157,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3188.507,3194.589,There was no proof of who navigated the vessel?
1973.73-157,2,34249,lynn_r_coleman,,3194.589,3199.701,"Yes, I think it’s an instance where fiction may bear a close resemblance to reality, Your Honor."
1973.73-157,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3200.566,3201.343,Thank you gentlemen.
