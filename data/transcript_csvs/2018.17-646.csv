2018.17-646,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.44,"We will hear argument this morning in Case 17-646, Gamble versus United States. Mr. Chaiten."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,7.44,19.16,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The separate sovereigns exception to the Double Jeopardy Clause is inconsistent with the text and original meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause."
2018.17-646,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,46.32,46.96,You think that's fair to --
2018.17-646,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,46.96,47.16,"Well, your --"
2018.17-646,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,47.16,48.64,"Excuse me, Chief."
2018.17-646,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,48.64,57.28,Your leading authority is a foreign prosecution in England of the -- in the Spanish case.
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,110.2,120.52,"Well, there's overwhelming evidence, as I said, that that is the English rule, and there's no dispute that the framers were incorporating English practice into the Double Jeopardy Clause."
2018.17-646,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,120.8,122.92,Any -- any country in the world?
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,122.92,123.96,Any country in the world?
2018.17-646,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,123.96,124.16,Yes.
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,124.56,126.2,"Well, it -- I'm sorry."
2018.17-646,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,126.2,136.4,"If there's a -- a prior criminal proceeding, either an acquittal or a conviction, any country in the world, that would count?"
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,136.4,138.2,So -- so there are a few requirements.
2018.17-646,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,145.84,147.0,It isn't clear.
2018.17-646,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,156.6,170.92,"And now I'm not going to say you're absolutely wrong, but three times the Court has considered your arguments, looked at those cases, the English case, Hutchinson, no report."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,214.44,214.6,So --
2018.17-646,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,214.6,216.64,"But the early cases, we find some --"
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,216.64,216.84,So --
2018.17-646,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,216.84,218.6,"-- you know, that support you and some that don't."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,219.16,221.16,So I do think they all support us.
2018.17-646,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,221.16,222.2,They all support you?
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,222.2,223.68,"Yes, I do believe they all support us."
2018.17-646,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,249.16,250.0,"No, I -- I -- I accept that."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,250.0,253.24,There is not to be prosecuted by -- for -- for a successive prosecution.
2018.17-646,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,253.88,263.8,"May I ask you to just step back so you can complete your answer to my question? I had asked you any country in the world, the judgment from any country in the world."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,263.8,271.12,"So -- so, if you're asking me what the English rule was, I would say yes, that is, but there are three important qualifications on the rule."
2018.17-646,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,345.36,345.52,How -- how -- how --
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,345.52,346.36,And the only --
2018.17-646,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,346.36,349.0,What's the third -- what's the third requirement?
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,349.0,354.04,The third requirement is that it can't be a sham prosecution or a collusive prosecution.
2018.17-646,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,354.32,355.2,"All right, it can't be a sham."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,402.96,406.2,So -- so let me address that in a few different ways.
2018.17-646,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,410.08,410.24,"Yeah, well --"
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,410.24,410.48,And that --
2018.17-646,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,410.48,414.68,"-- could you just answer whether that's correct or not? And if it's not correct, why is it not correct?"
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,414.68,428.36,"Under the original understanding, it would be up to the U.S. court to determine whether it's going to recognize the competent and concurrent jurisdiction of that other country. What I'm saying is, in the case of federal and state relations, there is no dispute about that."
2018.17-646,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,428.36,429.12,But I really don't think you're --
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,429.12,429.8,There's binding law on that.
2018.17-646,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,429.8,434.12,"I mean, I don't think this is in -- a surprise question or a particularly difficult one."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,443.4,444.12,"Well, it's not --"
2018.17-646,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,444.12,447.84,So your answer is? Can they be prosecuted here or can they not be prosecuted here?
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,447.84,455.64,"The -- the -- the answer, it's not just that the particular court has competent jurisdiction; it's that we're going to recognize the jurisdiction of the other country over the crime."
2018.17-646,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,483.36,484.12,"Well, we do have to reach --"
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,484.12,484.36,-- if the rule --
2018.17-646,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,484.36,502.92,"-- we do have to reach that question because your position logically would extend to Justice Alito's hypothetical, and if prosecution is part of the national security efforts of the United States, federal prosecution, then your position would substantially hamper those national security efforts."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,502.92,510.36,"So -- so I'm saying the reason you don't have to reach the question is, obviously, this is a case involving an Alabama crime and -- and -- and a federal crime, and there is --"
2018.17-646,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,510.36,511.24,But the logic of your position --
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,511.24,531.32,"The logic of our position, though -- but -- but the point is whatever -- whatever the court's ruling in that case, were it ever to come up, which I think is exceedingly unlikely, this is a different case because it's so much stronger. If the -- if the original understanding was the rule applied between foreign countries, then, a fortiori, it should apply between a state and federal government that --"
2018.17-646,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,531.32,538.48,"Yeah, a fortiori, but -- but your -- your -- you say -- I -- I wonder whether you have perhaps exaggerated in saying there's a mountain of support for your position."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,554.2,554.28,It --
2018.17-646,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,554.28,561.8,"So it's true, that's not what's involved here, but your -- your argument is based on foreign prosecutions."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,561.8,564.28,The original understanding was based on foreign prosecutions.
2018.17-646,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,574.68,574.84,But --
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,574.84,575.64,-- wanted to do that.
2018.17-646,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,575.64,576.56,"-- but, Mr. Chaiten, I think --"
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,576.56,577.0,It did that in --
2018.17-646,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,577.0,594.88,"-- I think the point is that you're asking us to write an opinion which is based on this original understanding, and the original understanding, as you put it, applies between foreign countries, and, a fortiori, it must be that our decision would apply between foreign countries."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,594.88,597.0,The -- the original understanding is it would.
2018.17-646,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,597.0,597.48,And that's what --
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,597.48,599.2,In Murphy v. Waterfront Commission --
2018.17-646,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,599.2,600.84,That's -- that's -- that's what your brief is all about.
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,614.32,621.6,"Well, first of all, I'm not sure the case is ever going to arise, but -- and this is State of Alabama and federal government and its undisputed concurrent jurisdiction."
2018.17-646,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,666.32,667.12,"Well, can I ask you a different --"
2018.17-646,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,667.12,671.0,"We've been through -- we've been through all this in Bartkus, right?"
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,671.0,688.0,"I don't think the Court has been -- ever given this question a full and fair opportunity, certainly post-incorporation, and it's important to understand how the holding of this Court arose. There was, of course, a suggestion in Fox v. Ohio in 1847 that there might be a separate sovereigns exception."
2018.17-646,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,725.4,728.36,"None of these concerns were presented in Bartkus, though, right?"
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,728.36,728.8,Excuse me?
2018.17-646,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,728.8,731.92,None of the concerns you've been talking about there were presented in Bartkus?
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,731.92,736.56,So -- so just -- Bartkus was decided at the same time as Abbate.
2018.17-646,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,762.24,769.44,Could you say a little bit more about why you think incorporation or the lack of incorporation had anything to do with this question?
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,769.44,769.8,Yes.
2018.17-646,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,782.36,805.52,"I mean, there is that reference in Fox, but it honestly makes no sense that incorporation would be the basis of the doctrine, because, if incorporation were the basis of the doctrine, you would have a doctrine that only cuts one way. In other words, it would -- it would -- the Court would have held that the federal government can't prosecute an individual for the same offense after a state prosecution, but not the other way around."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,813.12,832.08,"I think what the Court was getting at was the -- I think the -- it was the -- the baronial logic of it was that ""offense"" must mean federal offense because the Double Jeopardy Clause only applies to the federal government. That's what this Court was getting at. That's what was picked up in Abbate and Lanza, and that's what's no longer true."
2018.17-646,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,851.0,856.08,"I -- I guess what strikes me, Mr. Chaiten, is that you can say, well, you know, this case was a little bit different."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,895.84,921.04,"Well, I mean, I disagree with the 170 years because, again, it's -- it's dicta and dicta in Fox v. Ohio, and I think it is important to look at the rationale when the Court finally had an opportunity to decide this and make a holding on it, and that is Lanza. And there's -- nothing resembling an argument for the original understanding of the Double Jeopardy Clause was presented in Lanza. That was picked up in Abbate."
2018.17-646,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,929.0,947.56,"But why is the doctrine wrong? The -- given the uniqueness of our system of government, because there wasn't and isn't a comparable system in England at the time, there were not separate sovereigns, there was one sovereign, England."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,977.2,996.68,"Well, the logic of the English rule, as reported in numerous treatises from the early 18th Century through the 20th Century, it's still the rule today, is that, where there's a court of concurrent jurisdiction, even if it's another government that has concurrent jurisdiction, then an acquittal there bars a subsequent prosecution."
2018.17-646,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,996.68,997.04,Do you have --
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,997.04,998.12,And the logic for --
2018.17-646,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,998.12,1003.52,-- do you have any current case that describes the English rule that way?
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1003.52,1004.24,Current case?
2018.17-646,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1004.24,1006.0,"A current case, something --"
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1006.0,1008.0,So I refer the Court to two things.
2018.17-646,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1034.68,1041.08,Do you know how this rule applies within the European Union?
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1041.08,1043.36,It -- it applies the same way that we are urging here.
2018.17-646,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1043.36,1044.96,What --
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1044.96,1046.16,That is my understanding.
2018.17-646,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1046.16,1063.36,"The question, I thought, perhaps Justice Kagan and Justice Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor are asking, as I understand it -- in any case, I'm asking it -- I -- I -- I have spent a certain amount of time in these old cases."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1156.64,1159.96,"Well -- well, we can't know for sure how many successive prosecutions there are --"
2018.17-646,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1159.96,1160.52,Of course.
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1160.52,1161.6,-- because the federal government and the states --
2018.17-646,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1161.6,1163.8,I don't expect you to know for sure.
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1163.8,1184.04,"Well, and -- and I -- well, and I want to say the reason I'm saying we can't know for sure is because the government's Petite policy is a secretive policy that they implement and they don't really share data on it, other than the prosecutions they decline to make. Sources from the early 2000s say that they've authorized 150 Petite authorizations per year."
2018.17-646,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1207.52,1220.4,"How much does -- does Blockburger shrink the significance? Because -- because with -- if there's a different element in one, that's enough to take it out of double jeopardy?"
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1220.4,1226.8,"If each has a different -- an element the other doesn't have, then, yes, that's enough to take it out of double jeopardy."
2018.17-646,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1245.76,1246.96,"Well, it could come under --"
2018.17-646,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1246.96,1248.88,Do you know how that would work for the civil rights cases?
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1248.88,1249.6,"Yeah -- yes, yes."
2018.17-646,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1281.76,1300.0,"Well, that would be the case if the Blockburger rule holds, but your interpretation of the term ""offence"" in the Fifth Amendment is perhaps inconsistent with the way this Court has interpreted that -- that concept in Blockburger cases."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1300.6,1303.12,I -- I don't think it's the least bit inconsistent.
2018.17-646,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1320.88,1325.52,But didn't he -- didn't he say it is the elements defined by a particular sovereign?
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1325.52,1341.08,"I -- I don't believe he actually said that in Grady v. Corbin, and I don't think the Court said that in Dixon. There was nothing sovereign-specific about it. The government tries to say that it's -- it -- it -- it's necessarily a rule of legislative intent which makes it sovereign-specific."
2018.17-646,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1344.72,1361.44,"Can I go back to the way you began? I mean, you told us that there is a mountain of evidence supporting your interpretation of the original meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause. Put aside Hutchinson and put aside the case involving Welsh law that Justice Sotomayor referred to."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1373.56,1377.88,"In Great Britain? Well, it -- it's -- it's Hutchinson."
2018.17-646,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1399.04,1401.36,"Well, there's -- I mean, there are questions about Roche."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1407.8,1413.12,"Hutchinson wasn't cited, but Roche on its own -- Roche on its own stood for that proposition."
2018.17-646,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1417.68,1419.8,So this is a mount -- this is a mountain?
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1419.8,1422.96,The -- the mountain -- I would primarily start with the treatises.
2018.17-646,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1449.04,1456.48,"Do you have any evidence that most of these treatises -- that these treatises -- with the exception of Blackstone, which was every lawyer's bible at the time of the founding."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1472.32,1472.4,Yeah.
2018.17-646,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1476.08,1476.28,They were?
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1476.28,1477.8,They were well-known treatises.
2018.17-646,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1504.88,1508.92,But those treatises don't cite any actual authority.
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1508.92,1509.8,Those treatises?
2018.17-646,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1509.8,1520.48,What -- what actual authority? What holdings of pre-Fifth Amendment-adoption courts are cited in those -- can be cited in those treatises? You're just --
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1520.48,1524.84,"Yeah, MacNally -- MacNally cites Hutchinson and cites -- and cites Roche."
2018.17-646,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1524.84,1525.92,Hutchinson? Do we have the --
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1525.92,1526.92,It just doesn't cite them.
2018.17-646,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1528.48,1530.56,Do we have -- do we have the opinion in Hutchinson?
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1530.56,1539.52,"There is a bail notation, and that is the only thing that survived, and the scholars have -- scholarship has long noted that that was from one phase of the case."
2018.17-646,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1554.2,1574.84,"Counsel, I apologize for ping-ponging you from the -- from the framing back to the present, but I'd like to return you to Justice Breyer's question about the impact this might have on civil rights organizations and -- and others. You know, the stare decisis considerations, one of which would be are we upsetting settled expectations currently?"
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1574.84,1578.2,"Well, I don't think it would have an impact on civil rights litigation."
2018.17-646,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1579.6,1582.64,"You started, but I'm -- I'd like you to develop that further."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1582.64,1582.88,Yes.
2018.17-646,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1582.92,1584.68,I didn't get a complete answer.
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1584.68,1585.16,Sorry.
2018.17-646,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1602.28,1602.88,Now.
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1602.88,1604.36,-- a murder or an assault.
2018.17-646,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1604.36,1605.72,Now.
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1613.72,1615.92,"Well, in the federal government, if --"
2018.17-646,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1615.92,1622.32,"-- for a state in the 19 -- you see? Look, what's actually bothering me is, yes, I know you're convinced on the history."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1646.76,1647.0,So --
2018.17-646,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1647.0,1647.96,Okay? So -- so -- so now --
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1647.96,1649.4,-- I don't agree that the Court has several times looked --
2018.17-646,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1649.4,1650.72,-- my problem is that.
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1650.72,1650.84,But --
2018.17-646,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1650.84,1659.0,"My problem is, is this a basis for going back, the same one that -- the same question."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1662.92,1665.0,So -- so -- so two -- two responses.
2018.17-646,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1709.44,1715.72,"I -- I think the question, though, is, of all the errors this Court has made over the years -- (Laughter.)"
2018.17-646,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1715.72,1716.64,That's right.
2018.17-646,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1716.64,1719.32,-- why this one? Why should we care about this one?
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1719.32,1724.2,"Well -- well, we should care because there is an ancient right not to be tried twice for the same crime."
2018.17-646,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1729.56,1730.08,"But, Mr. Chaiten, I mean, one of the --"
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1730.08,1730.8,You should care --
2018.17-646,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1730.8,1731.32,I'm sorry.
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1731.92,1736.92,You should -- you should care because we've cited examples of cases where a state court --
2018.17-646,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1736.92,1737.64,I -- I -- I --
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1737.64,1739.84,-- acquitted someone of murder and the federal government convicted.
2018.17-646,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1739.84,1746.28,"Counsel -- counsel, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I think -- I think we've got that, okay? I think it's just a practical question."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1756.44,1773.84,It is -- it is important for the -- it is important because we currently have a rule that allows the federal government to come in and decide they didn't like the way a state prosecuted someone or the result of the prosecution or the sentence they got and re- prosecute them. It's precisely what happened in this case.
2018.17-646,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1780.76,1794.72,"Well, I guess -- I guess the -- the question that underlies Justice Breyer's question about civil rights is something along the lines of: You know, that's consistent with our structure of government. We have dual sovereigns."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1829.48,1842.08,"But where they have the concurrent jurisdiction over something that is the same offense, that is illegitimate for reasons that were understood at the framing. Take the cases of -- take Furlong."
2018.17-646,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1852.16,1852.4,Yeah.
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1867.72,1872.4,The murder of a British subject by a British subject on a British ship is what they were saying.
2018.17-646,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1872.4,1873.64,I guess I would ask --
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1873.64,1880.0,"They weren't -- they weren't -- they weren't drawing -- they were -- they were just applying the concurrent jurisdiction rule, and they were saying why would the U.S. have concurrent jurisdiction over that."
2018.17-646,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1880.0,1902.92,"I suppose my -- my main question, which actually goes back to Justice Gorsuch's question, because Justice Gorsuch has been trying to lead you away from something, and I'm a little bit also confused as -- as to why your argument seems, frankly, a little bit one note. You know, your -- your brief and now your argument is just all about the original jurisdiction."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1929.72,1930.2,Well --
2018.17-646,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1930.2,1932.36,And so this is your opportunity to give me more.
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,1932.36,1933.16,Okay.
2018.17-646,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1960.04,2004.6,"Part of -- part of the original understanding as well was stare decisis, and stare decisis is a principle, in my view, rooted in Article III, as Federalist 78 points out and as Justice Kagan points out. It's a doctrine of stability and humility that we take very seriously. And the reason -- with the bar that you have to clear, I believe, is not just to show that it's wrong but to show that it's grievously wrong, egregiously wrong, something meaning a very high bar because stare decisis is itself a constitutional principle. And given, as Justice Alito says, the uncertainty about the history, can you clear that bar? So two questions."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,2010.84,2021.36,So -- so I'm not sure grievously wrong is the right way to look at it when you're talking about an unconstitutional law enforcement practice because this Court has never upheld an unconstitutional --
2018.17-646,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2021.36,2022.72,But that's begging -- that's begging the question.
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,2041.88,2041.96,So --
2018.17-646,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2041.96,2045.08,"I mean, usually it has to be -- your -- your brief uses egregiously wrong."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,2046.92,2050.68,"Well, and I agree this -- this rule is egregiously wrong."
2018.17-646,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2078.44,2079.2,"And I guess, counsel --"
2018.17-646,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2079.2,2091.68,"How -- how does it work as a practical matter? Is this -- is it a race to the courthouse? I mean, if a prosecution bars a subsequent one, the state and federal government may have different perspectives, is it whoever can empanel a jury first is going to block the others?"
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,2091.68,2097.88,"So I don't think so. So, first of all, the -- the norm in the country is cooperation between federal and state authorities."
2018.17-646,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2101.24,2110.6,"Well, it sure wasn't entirely true at the time of the civil rights actions in the -- in the '60s and '70s. It wasn't true at the time of the fugitive slave law."
2018.17-646,0,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,2110.6,2119.96,"Well, as a practical matter, I think it is true today. Secondly, Blockburger has been subject to enormous criticism because it isn't defended, frankly, enough."
2018.17-646,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2152.88,2160.16,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feigin?"
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2160.16,2181.16,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Throughout its history, this Court has correctly recognized that the distinct and separate sovereign powers of the state and federal governments make state and federal crimes different offenses under the Double Jeopardy Clause. Petitioner provides no reason for this Court suddenly to conclude that it's been wrong all this time."
2018.17-646,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2189.72,2200.88,"Well, 170 years, I -- I -- I think your friend is right, isn't it, that we have not had a full consideration and exposition of the issue in any of our precedents?"
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2200.88,2202.8,"I don't think that's correct, Your Honor."
2018.17-646,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2255.16,2269.84,"But you -- you have to concede, won't you, that this rule, this separate sovereign rule, has been widely criticized by both academics and federal judges?"
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2269.84,2272.32,"Your Honor, it has come under some criticism."
2018.17-646,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2303.68,2310.32,"I thought the answer to the civil rights cases is it's not the same offense, 241 and 242."
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2313.84,2316.76,"Your Honor, those aren't the only civil rights charges we bring."
2018.17-646,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2334.72,2335.24,"Well, but once you say --"
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2335.24,2335.92,-- could be Blockburger barred.
2018.17-646,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2335.92,2340.12,"-- once -- once you say ""a bunch of elements,"" then you get into Blockburger."
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2340.12,2351.64,"No, Your Honor, murder would be a less -- considered a lesser-included offense of those offenses if the offenses defined by different sovereigns were considered the same, as Petitioner is urging."
2018.17-646,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2372.6,2378.72,"Well, you had -- you must think that there's some problem or you wouldn't have the Petite policy."
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2390.72,2418.44,"Well, no, Your Honor, I think there are a number of instances, including the Double Jeopardy Clause just last term, where a plurality of this Court has recognized the Constitution doesn't solve every potential policy problem that may arise, and we leave those -- a lot of those questions for legislatures or for the political branches in general. And I think this has actually been a real success story of that because he was just asked if he could point to any significant practical problems, and he couldn't."
2018.17-646,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2456.0,2464.52,"What about a case like this, this very case, a felon in possession? It's the same crime, federal and state."
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2468.08,2511.6,"Well, Your Honor, the -- the examples I would get into, and I'm happy to get into them, are examples of cases in which state and federal interests would be blocked. But speaking to this particular case, I don't think there's any dispute, at least by Petitioner, that the federal government has a substantial interest in regulating access to the interstate market for firearms by someone who has twice fired weapons that endangered members of his own family and other members of the community. The only question is whether that substantial federal interest was vindicated when he entered into an omnibus plea deal with the state where he wound up, as a practical matter, not receiving any additional time in prison for the firearm offense."
2018.17-646,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2511.6,2547.92,"Well, but I think that's exactly the problem that is practically more apparent today or at least of potential concern that counsel might have addressed, and that is, with the proliferation of federal crimes, I think over 4,000 statutes now and several hundred thousand regulations, the opportunity to -- for the government to seek a successive prosecution if it's unhappy with even the most routine state prosecution is a problem. Justice Brennan was concerned about it in Bartkus."
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2563.32,2565.6,"Well, let me say a few things about that, Your Honor."
2018.17-646,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2624.8,2632.92,"Well, you know, I wonder about that because, in our prior cases, we hinged on two things, in Bartkus, among other places."
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2700.08,2702.4,"Well, Your Honor, we don't view this as a routine case."
2018.17-646,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2785.56,2786.24,"Well, why not?"
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2786.24,2786.68,-- pieces of --
2018.17-646,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2786.68,2795.76,"We do it in -- in civil cases all the time, right? And we -- we won't enforce judgments that are shams."
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2813.52,2816.16,"Well, usually, Your Honor, there, there's going to be privity among the parties."
2018.17-646,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2832.96,2836.92,"Well, wouldn't they -- they say since there was never any trial, that they were never in jeopardy?"
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2836.92,2843.4,"Well, Your Honor, I'm not sure how far the proceedings with respect to each and every individual rebel we might charge in Colombia got."
2018.17-646,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2871.56,2875.48,I don't know whether a dismissal based on some amnesty --
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2875.48,2875.8,So --
2018.17-646,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2875.8,2878.64,-- is a -- anything like an adjudication on the merits.
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2878.64,2880.8,"So, Your Honor, let me give you another example."
2018.17-646,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2919.6,2926.68,"But -- but -- but as I understand it -- and tell me if I'm wrong -- the common-law countries, Great Britain and Canada, do?"
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2926.68,2928.48,"Not all of them, Your Honor."
2018.17-646,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2963.0,3012.24,"May I ask, before you do that, you -- you rely very heavily on federalism, separate sovereigns. Is there another case where federalism has been invoked to strengthen the hand of government, state and/or federal, vis-a-vis an individual? Federalism is usually invoked because it's a protection of the liberty of the individual, but, here, the party being strengthened is not the individual, it is the state's freedom and the federal government's freedom to bring -- to prosecute the same offense, felon in possession."
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3012.24,3046.32,"So I think the Court's recognized in older cases, like Cruikshank, which was from the 19th Century, and in its recent first decision in Bond against United States that one of the things that American citizens get by being citizens of both the state and the United States is that there are two sovereigns that can positively legislate; that is, pass affirmative legislation to protect them. So, in the civil rights era, when the states weren't affirmatively protecting the civil rights of their citizens enough, they're also American citizens, and the United States stepped in to vindicate those interests."
2018.17-646,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3046.32,3053.68,"To -- to -- to state a different crime, not the garden-variety assault, murder."
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3053.68,3072.08,"So, Your Honor, there are civil rights offenses on the books now, like 18 U.S.C. 249, which precludes -- criminalizes causing bodily injury to someone for racially motivated reasons that could be double jeopardy barred under their rule. But let me give you -- let me give you some other examples of --"
2018.17-646,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3072.08,3089.32,"But, counsel, just -- before we get to more examples, I thought Justice Ginsburg's point was worth exploring a little bit more. I -- I had thought in this country the people were the sovereign and that sovereignty was divided, exercise of sovereignty was divided, not multiplied."
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3113.84,3119.72,"Well, Your Honor, the people have vested the sovereignty in both the state and the United States --"
2018.17-646,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3119.72,3132.96,"Is there such an example? Is there such an example, other than double jeopardy, where the individual has a double whammy, both the state and the federal, usually federalism, as Justice Gorsuch just pointed out --"
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3132.96,3133.16,Well --
2018.17-646,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3133.16,3134.76,-- is protective of the individual?
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3134.76,3139.64,"Well, Your Honor, it is a common fact of life that everyone is subject to both state and federal regulation."
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3145.28,3155.92,"It's why businesses are regulated by both the federal and state governments, and why everyone knows that an act, and even Petitioner agrees, the same act can be both a state and federal crime."
2018.17-646,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3155.92,3162.6,But what about the adoption of the Black -- the Blockburger rule as opposed to the same -- same transaction test?
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3162.6,3163.8,"So, Your Honor, I think the -- the origins --"
2018.17-646,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3163.8,3169.48,That -- that's a -- that's a rule that -- that's a rule of federalism in a way.
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3178.84,3180.56,"I think that's right, Your Honor."
2018.17-646,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3186.48,3186.84,It's -- it's --
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3186.84,3187.6,-- heretofore been --
2018.17-646,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3187.6,3188.48,-- it's a double jeopardy.
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3196.28,3209.44,"Your Honor, I -- I think I've just given several examples of cases where people are regulated more heavily because there are two governments than -- than they would be if they were subject only to one unitary government."
2018.17-646,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3213.32,3232.08,"May I ask, Mr. Feigin, do you think that there's a prospect of abuse where two different governments can use the possibility of prosecutions as a bargaining tactic to get defendants to agree to plea deals? Is -- is -- is that something that happens regularly?"
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3232.08,3238.32,I'm not really familiar with that being a serious problem under the current system.
2018.17-646,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3272.04,3290.48,"Do -- do you remember what the situation was in D.C., not so very long ago, when we had the same prosecutor for the local courts and the federal court? And the D.C. code had lower penalties than the U.S. code, and the prosecutor engaged in just that kind of tactic."
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3296.48,3302.48,"Well, Your Honor, D.C. is kind of a special case where both of those fall under federal government."
2018.17-646,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3365.52,3365.8,Are --
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3365.8,3395.04,"Another difficulty that's going to arise here is prosecutions by the federal government that follow tribal prosecutions, which I think are about two-thirds of the -- of the few hundred successive prosecutions that we bring each year. And as this Court recognized a couple of terms ago in United States against Bryant, the federal government plays a critical role in curbing the serious problem of domestic violence against Native American women. Tribes are limited generally to prosecuting only for misdemeanors."
2018.17-646,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3411.0,3411.08,And what is --
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3411.08,3411.76,-- the tribes bring --
2018.17-646,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3411.76,3415.0,-- what is the reason for the tribes' very limited jurisdiction?
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3415.0,3418.44,So the tribes have limited jurisdiction as a consequence of federal law.
2018.17-646,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3453.92,3454.96,I see the problem.
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3548.64,3565.2,"Your Honor, I think they need to show a lot more than they have shown here in order to overcome this Court's consistent understanding throughout its history of what the Double Jeopardy Clause means. As Justice Kavanaugh pointed out earlier -- I forget what adjective he used, but it was --"
2018.17-646,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3565.2,3566.32,Grievously.
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3566.32,3566.76,Thank you.
2018.17-646,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3591.88,3602.44,May I ask you a question about issue preclusion? You say no -- no double -- double jeopardy doesn't operate state/federal -- federal/state.
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3619.48,3621.92,In -- are you talking in criminal law --
2018.17-646,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3621.92,3622.12,Yes.
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3622.12,3623.04,-- or in -- huh?
2018.17-646,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3623.04,3624.2,Yeah.
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3624.2,3624.8,Or in civil law?
2018.17-646,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3624.8,3627.2,I'm talking about criminal law.
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3627.2,3632.16,"So, in criminal law, Your Honor, there is no non-mutual collateral estoppel."
2018.17-646,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3645.0,3655.24,"Don't -- don't all your problems go away if you're the first to file, if you win the race to the courthouse? And I would assume the same is true with the states."
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3665.96,3670.56,"Well, Your Honor, I'm not sure that's true, because I'm not sure that we're always going to cooperate."
2018.17-646,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3724.52,3730.48,"So, counsel, it seems like the ones that you can't cooperate you could solve by getting to the courthouse first, right?"
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3730.48,3738.28,"Well, then we're not -- Your Honor, then, if there's a race to the courthouse, it deters state and federal prosecutors from cooperating even at the investigation stage."
2018.17-646,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3744.6,3755.56,Can I ask one question on -- on -- on stare decisis that we haven't explored so far? And that's reliance. The government doesn't make a reliance argument here as far as I can tell.
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3770.8,3784.84,"Well, Your Honor, I do think that it should weigh heavily on this Court that what it would be doing would potentially be letting people out of prison based -- based on, I think, a rule that is at best --"
2018.17-646,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3784.84,3796.88,"If we -- if we were convinced, though, the Constitution stood one way, against you, just hypothetically, you wouldn't -- you wouldn't argue that the government has a reliance interest to keep people in prison despite an unconstitutional rule, would you?"
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3796.88,3805.52,"Your Honor, I think if they had shown the kind of monumental or grievously serious evidence that they would need to show --"
2018.17-646,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3805.52,3805.96,"Well, no."
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3806.6,3806.96,-- to prevent stare decisis.
2018.17-646,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3806.96,3821.0,"Let's just say 51 percent, they've persuaded us 51 percent that the Constitution's meaning under any sort of interpretation, just hypothetically, is against the government. Would it be appropriate, in the government's view, to keep people in prison in those circumstances?"
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3821.0,3828.32,"Well, Your Honor, it's -- it's hard to put an exact percentage on it, but I do think they would have to show -- this isn't just a preponderance of the evidence test or stare decisis means nothing."
2018.17-646,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3871.84,3872.8,"Well, it's based --"
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3872.8,3873.72,And in terms of -- I'm sorry.
2018.17-646,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3873.72,3873.96,Go ahead.
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3873.96,3882.08,"Your Honor, you referenced earlier and -- as did Justice Kagan -- the idea of stare decisis representing something about judicial humility."
2018.17-646,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3894.4,3894.68,They --
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3894.68,3896.12,"If these -- I'm sorry, Justice Kavanaugh."
2018.17-646,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3896.12,3900.0,"They also raise, of course, a general principle of individual liberty."
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3928.0,3937.84,"No, Your Honor, I think it's a very narrow and not correct view of liberty, only to look at the liberty interests of the defendant. There are also the liberty --"
2018.17-646,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3937.84,3956.48,"From the perspective of negative liberty, liberty -- freedom from government oppression or government regulation, your rule strikes some -- and this is what they point out -- as a -- as an infringement of basic concepts of individual liberty: You didn't get me the first time; you're going to take another crack at it."
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3956.48,3959.88,"Well, Your Honor, I -- I don't think that's the right way to think about it."
2018.17-646,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3963.68,3963.8,Uh-huh.
2018.17-646,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3963.8,3991.84,"They were going to protect liberty in a particular way, and the way they were going to do that is by vesting sovereign power in the states and in the United States, which could both positively enact laws and protect people who may be victims of crimes. And they did not have any understanding that the United States or the states would be precluded from vindicating their distinct sovereign interests in their own sovereign spheres by the unilateral actions of the other sovereign. Thank you."
2018.17-646,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3991.84,3998.36,"Thank you, Mr. Feigin. General Hawkins."
2018.17-646,2,63066,kyle_d_hawkins,,3998.36,4017.44,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'm here today on behalf of a broad and diverse coalition of 36 states collectively representing over 86 percent of the U.S. population."
2018.17-646,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4051.16,4069.52,"In the -- in the numbers -- in the numbers you just mentioned, I thought we had heard from the other side that something like 25 states, something like that, do not have the separate sovereigns, one state versus another, state versus federal."
2018.17-646,2,63066,kyle_d_hawkins,,4069.52,4092.24,"Well, Your Honor, it's true that there are 20 states that have enacted a general sort of bar on their ability to bring a prosecution based on conduct that was already prosecuted by another sovereign. There are some quirks and differences within those states, but I think it's important to note that 14 of those 20 states are a part of our coalition today."
2018.17-646,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4211.28,4223.68,"I think what your friends on the other side might say to that is something along the lines of: Well, it's one thing to pick the higher penalty and, you know, let the state or the -- or the government with the higher penalty go forward."
2018.17-646,2,63066,kyle_d_hawkins,,4227.56,4231.64,"Well -- well, Your Honor, oftentimes, as a practical matter, there won't be both."
2018.17-646,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4272.2,4277.76,That would certainly limit the willingness of the defendant to cooperate if that -- if that were the rule.
2018.17-646,2,63066,kyle_d_hawkins,,4277.76,4280.48,"I'm sorry, Your Honor? Can you please repeat that?"
2018.17-646,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4280.48,4300.4,"If the -- if the -- if the defendant could be re-prosecuted by the state, that would be a disincentive to entering into a plea bargain if he can -- if he can just be subject to prosecution by another sovereign for the same conduct."
2018.17-646,2,63066,kyle_d_hawkins,,4300.4,4314.68,"Your Honor, I suppose that may be theoretically true, but, as my friend from the federal government indicated, we don't have any evidence that that's the case, and I don't believe that Petitioner has pointed to any. As was discussed earlier, we could also see this play out as to foreign prosecutions."
2018.17-646,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4346.48,4349.56,Acquit of conduct engaged in Florida?
2018.17-646,2,63066,kyle_d_hawkins,,4349.56,4360.2,"Well, yes, Your Honor, if -- if there were drugs being trafficked by the -- by Escobar and a cartel into the State of Florida, that would certainly implicate the interests of Florida. And under Petitioner's theory --"
2018.17-646,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4360.2,4373.16,"Yes, but I asked about the Colombia? If the crime is committed in Florida against Florida residents --"
2018.17-646,2,63066,kyle_d_hawkins,,4373.16,4418.16,"Well, Your Honor, my hypothetical I am making assumes that there's some sort of Colombian law against trafficking drugs out of that country into another country. We can certainly imagine that being the case in -- in many scenarios. Other practical concerns that would arise, as my friend from the Department of Justice indicated, would involve races to the courthouse and competition between states and the federal government, rather than cooperation, all to the detriment of law enforcement. And even setting aside these practical problems, there are a number of other concerns that Petitioner's view would raise. First, under Petitioner's view, courts around this country would be for the first time asked to apply Blockburger across the federal and state divide. That is no easy thing to do."
2018.17-646,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4499.56,4500.88,"Thank you, counsel."
2018.17-646,2,63066,kyle_d_hawkins,,4500.88,4502.68,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2018.17-646,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4502.68,4504.2,"Mr. Chaiten, four minutes remaining."
2018.17-646,3,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,4504.2,4513.32,"I just -- I guess I'll pick up where -- thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I'll pick up where he ended, which is that this has never been the rule in the country -- in this country today."
2018.17-646,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4593.4,4597.2,Do you think there's less reliance here than there was on the issue of the Miranda rule?
2018.17-646,3,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,4597.2,4605.4,"Well, the -- the issue is whether -- whether you are continuing an unconstitutional law enforcement practice."
2018.17-646,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4614.04,4614.76,So you think that --
2018.17-646,3,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,4614.76,4615.04,-- on reliance.
2018.17-646,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4615.04,4635.8,-- any -- any constitutional decision of this Court that imposes any limitation on any right in the Bill of Rights that affects criminal procedure is always open to reexamination without consideration of stare decisis because doing that would expand the rights of the criminal defendant? That's your position?
2018.17-646,3,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,4635.8,4641.0,"Your Honor, I'm not saying without consideration of stare decisis. I am saying without consideration of reliance interests."
2018.17-646,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4641.0,4641.48,Reliance --
2018.17-646,3,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,4641.48,4642.04,This Court has said --
2018.17-646,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4642.04,4675.04,"I mean, the obvious thing that comes into my mind, I got the other factors, but the -- the -- the -- it seems -- what's wrong with -- with what I'm thinking, which must be something wrong with it, that -- that very often this Court has said the rule of Constitution is X, but we're not going to apply it retroactively, because to do that would mean a vast release of prisoners who have committed crimes. Now that sounds like reliance and it sounds like reliance on a law that the Court has said is unconstitutional, which is the preceding situation."
2018.17-646,3,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,4675.04,4679.0,"Yeah, I don't think it's a reliance issue on addressing the underlying merits question."
2018.17-646,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4684.36,4684.72,You don't --
2018.17-646,3,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,4684.72,4685.76,-- I don't -- I'm sorry.
2018.17-646,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4685.76,4698.08,"No, the reason you don't apply the unconstitutional -- the reason you still apply the unconstitutional law to all those people who are in prison is because the reliance in the community on their staying in prison."
2018.17-646,3,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,4698.08,4709.64,"Well -- - well, I think the reason you don't apply it is because the judgment's final, but -- so I think it's a separate question from the underlying merits question, the underlying constitutional question. And, incidentally, I don't think this rule would be retroactive."
2018.17-646,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4715.24,4752.32,"I mean, there have been many decisions of this Court that have imposed some limits on -- have rejected some claims that have been asserted under the Fourth Amendment, under the -- the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, under the Sixth Amendment jury trial right and the right to ineffective assistance of counsel, under the Eighth Amendment, right against cruel and unusual punishment. And if any of those was challenged, you would say there's no -- there can never be a reliance, and because there's a -- there never can be reliance because it's a -- it involves an individual right, we put stare decisis aside?"
2018.17-646,3,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,4752.32,4756.2,I'm -- so I'm not -- there's more that goes into stare decisis than reliance.
2018.17-646,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4760.12,4760.28,But --
2018.17-646,3,63065,louis_a_chaiten,,4760.28,4766.32,"-- we will not rely on reliance in the case of an unconstitutional law enforcement practice. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2018.17-646,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4766.32,4767.12,"Thank you, counsel."
