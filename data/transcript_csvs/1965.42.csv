1965.42,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,40.822,"Number 42, Ralph Ginzburg et al, Petitioner, versus United States."
1965.42,0,40860,spritzer,,42.027,44.921,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.42,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,52.946,60.517,Motion is granted.
1965.42,1,41225,sydney_dickstein,,62.813,65.545,May it please the Court.
1965.42,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,126.035,135.06,Your view that all of those elements have to coincide to constitute obscenity or that if any one of the elements exist?
1965.42,1,41225,sydney_dickstein,,135.06,143.014,"No Your Honor, it's our view that all of these elements must coalesce in a single work in order for it to be proscribable obscenity."
1965.42,2,37685,paul_bender,,1025.834,1029.409,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1965.42,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1074.272,1080.093,"It's the only one -- that's the only one that the Court has ever tried to define or deal with, isn't it?"
1965.42,2,37685,paul_bender,,1080.093,1081.418,"Yes, I think so."
1965.42,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1088.256,1095.236,"Some of the other adjectives from the statute which you just quoted have quite a -- quite a different meaning, do they not?"
1965.42,2,37685,paul_bender,,1095.236,1104.241,"If taken alone, yes, I think the phrase ?redeem? in a case like this is a -- has -- carries one substantive concept."
1965.42,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1242.136,1242.608,That's right.
1965.42,2,37685,paul_bender,,1242.608,1260.875,-- that obscene materials existed which could be prohibited and that those prohibitions would not violate the First Amendment because first of all of the recognized reasons for the prohibition of obscene materials and second of all because of the lack of redeeming social importance which those materials carry.
1965.42,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1270.068,1272.052,Is that the test on which you depend?
1965.42,2,37685,paul_bender,,1272.052,1273.826,That is one of the tests.
1965.42,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1289.874,1292.842,That has to be found -- to be determined by us?
1965.42,2,37685,paul_bender,,1292.842,1293.891,"Yes, I think so."
1965.42,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1293.891,1294.956,By inspection?
1965.42,2,37685,paul_bender,,1294.956,1296.421,By inspection.
1965.42,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1296.421,1299.418,How much was this man given?
1965.42,2,37685,paul_bender,,1299.418,1306.806,"There were three works in issue, as to two of them he was given consecutive jail sentences."
1965.42,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1309.74,1311.23,Five years?
1965.42,2,37685,paul_bender,,1311.23,1318.291,"As to the third Liaison, he was given no jail sentence, so it's a substantial fine in all accounts of --"
1965.42,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1318.291,1319.958,"What was the fine, 40?"
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,2844.922,2851.62,Mr. Chief Justice.
1965.42,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2895.115,2899.254,How can it if you suppose to look at the whole work?
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,2899.254,2915.513,"Your Honor, this Court as I understand its ruling has said we're not going to permit a book to be suppressed unless we are satisfied that this is constitutionally permissible if the suppression of this book does not run afoul of the First Amendment."
1965.42,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2950.85,2954.325,"I would think it'd be just the opposite, Mr. Dickstein."
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,2970.995,2971.659,It might.
1965.42,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2972.598,2972.972,"(Inaudible) -- oh, wouldn't that be --"
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,2972.972,2982.684,"It would depend upon the particular book but I have found this and that is the claims for redeeming social importance are not made likely, they are serious claims."
1965.42,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3010.788,3012.585,Without reading the book?
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3012.585,3020.934,"In certain instances, we think it can be done on the briefs here where the Government does say if the Handbook has the values for example dealing with the Handbook."
1965.42,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3028.666,3034.133,"Well, how would they (Inaudible)?"
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3034.133,3040.561,The -- these are highlighted in the briefs Your Honor both in terms of the content of the publications --
1965.42,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3040.561,3048.384,(Inaudible)
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3048.384,3053.315,I don't say that in every situation this can act as a substitute for reading the book.
1965.42,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3053.315,3055.401,(Inaudible)
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3055.401,3061.361,"Well, we think that the descriptions in the briefs here of course are adequately representative of the basis --"
1965.42,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3061.361,3061.682,(Inaudible)
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3061.682,3063.796,-- of the claim of social value.
1965.42,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3160.22,3162.97,What's your standing for that?
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3167.404,3183.946,"Your Honor, I would say that if a work makes a serious claim, not a sham claim but a serious claim that we will not then be permitted -- one should not then be allowed to debate the relative merit of the claim, is it a good idea, is it a bad idea."
1965.42,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3193.722,3206.84,"What you are saying is that if the -- some circumstances on which we can just decide that the thing is socially good, ordinarily of course, it's for legislative branches to determine."
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3206.84,3210.192,"No Your Honor, I'm reading it in terms of a First Amendment text."
1965.42,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3216.429,3219.694,"Whether it has to be good, it has redeeming social values, isn't it?"
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3219.694,3220.969,"Well, no, not at all."
1965.42,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3286.248,3297.526,"Well Mr. Dickstein, are you telling us that we ought to take into account the intention or purpose of the publisher?"
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3297.526,3301.636,Only to the extent that it is exhibited and manifest within the work itself.
1965.42,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3305.85,3319.661,"Suppose the work itself says that the purpose of this work is to -- amuse you, essentially with oddities and chuckles, gripes and stuff and like that."
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3321.285,3329.763,"Your Honor, I would say that amusement creates social value if that was what the work in fact achieved."
1965.42,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3329.763,3332.19,"Well, the Courts probably have to come to that."
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3332.19,3341.72,And -- but of course I would say that one cannot put a man in jail for his bad jokes and we get to that kind of a question as well.
1965.42,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3341.72,3346.877,"Weren't you really right the first time in answer to Brother Fortas' question, the motive."
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3355.871,3359.857,"Your Honor, if there wasn't a profit motive, I just suppose books wouldn't be published in this kind of thing (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.42,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3359.857,3362.714,"Many, and except by philanthropists."
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3362.714,3364.591,That's right.
1965.42,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3364.591,3367.922,"So, why is -- why wasn't your answer correct the first time --"
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3367.922,3367.999,I --
1965.42,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3367.999,3373.06,-- except insofar as it's reflected in the nature of the publication and not even the publisher is irrelevant?
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3373.06,3374.044,That is correct Your Honor.
1965.42,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3374.326,3380.629,It wouldn't take into account what the publisher says in that publication to be its purpose or intent?
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3380.629,3381.58,"No, not by itself."
1965.42,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3391.692,3391.823,"Well, if"
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3391.823,3392.734,There's something --
1965.42,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3392.734,3396.401,"(Voice Overlap) what he said in the book, what -- how could we get it?"
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3396.401,3400.051,"You would have to get it through what is said in the book, you would also have to get --"
1965.42,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3400.051,3401.118,"Well then, that does in involve --"
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3401.118,3401.5,Except --
1965.42,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3401.5,3403.169,"-- his motives in publishing it, does it not?"
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3403.169,3413.148,"Except extrinsic aids, extrinsic evidence such as critical review, such as a prefatory statement of purpose, maybe of some aid in reading the book."
1965.42,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3417.873,3428.244,But it seemed to me you put great emphasis on the serious contention in this book that it did have social value.
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3428.244,3429.593,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1965.42,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3429.593,3439.779,"Well, then you are testing that book by -- apparently, by the sincerity and the logic of the man who writes that portion of it, don't you think?"
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3439.779,3445.327,"No Your Honor, I'm talking about the seriousness of the claim as distinguished from a sham claim such as the thing that --"
1965.42,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3445.327,3453.193,"Well, will you tell me how the -- how can you distinguish those for a man in serious terms writes both of them?"
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3453.193,3457.621,"Your Honor, this Court was able to point up the distinction in Valentine against Chrestensen."
1965.42,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3465.331,3481.522,"Well, you might find that on this Court there will be those who will think that some of these books at least are vile and indecent and obscene, they were -- they might agree."
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3503.935,3507.217,"It maybe of some moment, it's hardly conclusive Your Honor."
1965.42,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3531.682,3534.31,"Well, they said that about (Inaudible) in the public inquiry, not (Voice Overlap) --"
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3534.31,3542.856,And the only reason they accept -- the only reason as I understand the Government's argument that they accept Liaison is that they say it's riotously vulgar.
1965.42,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3600.347,3606.415,"You've said that -- you've said that twice, there's no reference to hardcore pornography, that this could be defined."
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3606.415,3613.435,"Your Honor, the question really isn't what hardcore pornography means or how one defines it."
1965.42,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3617.383,3619.293,That's why I was surprised to hear you continue (Voice Overlap) --
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3619.293,3619.951,The question is what --
1965.42,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3619.951,3621.72,(Inaudible)
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3621.72,3626.859,I -- may -- the question is what hardcore pornography is.
1965.42,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3678.888,3689.927,Did you understand that the Government can say that they excluded Liaison from the category of hardcore pornography?
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3689.927,3691.19,"Yes, Your Honor, I did."
1965.42,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3694.452,3694.759,I did not --
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3694.759,3696.7,-- which was riotously vulgar.
1965.42,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3696.7,3699.438,I did not so understand but --
1965.42,3,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3699.438,3702.245,Mr. Bender and I had said -- I think that is (Inaudible).
1965.42,4,37685,paul_bender,,3702.245,3704.046,I was not in agreement with Justice Fortas.
1965.42,5,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3704.046,3709.161,Excuse me.
1965.42,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3709.161,3709.888,Very well.
1965.42,5,41225,sydney_dickstein,,3709.888,3710.69,Thank you.
