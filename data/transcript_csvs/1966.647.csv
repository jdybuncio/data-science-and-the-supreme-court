1966.647,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,26.813,"Number 647, Louis Bostick, Petitioner, versus South Carolina et al."
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,27.882,31.322,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,154.1,157.251,How are they made up?
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,157.251,171.329,They're selected pursuant to the South Carolina constitutional provision that qualified male electors that is to say males over the age of 21 and less than the age of 65.
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,171.329,182.267,"It doesn't contain how it directly chose physically, how they select the names from the registered voters list?"
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,183.894,185.336,"That is correct, sir."
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,185.336,186.428,How do they go about that?
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,186.911,203.894,"Well, the testimony of the clerk of court Mr. Sensenbach set forth at various places in the record and particularly on pages 66, etcetera --"
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,203.894,207.744,"Now, it doesn't -- it -- they never get around to say how exactly how they do it?"
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,207.744,208.156,"Oh, yes."
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,222.102,232.685,"But now they have a list of registered voters, what mechanical process -- what process do they go through to actually select the -- a portion of the male electors from that registered voters list?"
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,232.685,257.252,"Once a year, that is to say, in the month of December of each year, the jury commission which is comprised of the clerk of court, the treasurer and the auditor of each county convene themselves for the purpose of selecting the grand jury, the grand jury for the ensuing year, and prior to the beginning of each term of Court during the course of the year."
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,276.035,277.948,They actually have roles before them?
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,277.948,278.448,That is correct.
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,278.448,280.988,With the names on it and their addresses?
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,280.988,281.577,"Yes, sir."
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,281.577,282.964,And the racial designation?
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,282.964,284.68,And the racial designation.
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,284.68,291.59,"So, they know -- they know the race of those of the people whom they collect from the registered voters list?"
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,291.59,297.092,They know that because race is clearly designated on the registration duplicates.
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,297.092,303.678,"If one of this is not by lot of them -- of the -- of that list, is it?"
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,303.678,305.013,It is not by lot --
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,305.013,309.847,Or it is by any -- every tenth name or every second name or?
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,309.847,310.528,"No, sir."
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,310.528,312.404,It's not a random choice of the list?
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,312.404,320.844,"Well, it is random but the jury commission is required by the law to select two-thirds of the qualified male electors of each county."
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,320.844,322.398,"Alright, to put it -- to put in the jury box."
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,322.398,324.326,To put in the jury box.
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,326.36,329.432,"So, how they go about throwing out the one-third?"
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,329.432,354.666,This is done through various actions on the part of the jury commission based upon such things as a would-be jurors profession such things as the feeling that he is possibly not qualified by reason of his failure to possess the necessary good character requirement.
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,354.666,357.087,How about race?
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,357.087,369.775,We submit that the record here indicates an opportunity to discriminate on race as was found by this Court in Avery versus Georgia from that factual situation.
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,369.775,378.348,Was there -- is there any testimony to show actually what proportion of Negroes and whites actually got into the jury box?
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,378.348,378.923,"Yes, sir."
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,379.892,392.85,"When you select the two-thirds out of -- of the jury off of the registered voters list, once that two-third goes into the jury box that, they could be proportioned there in the jury box?"
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,392.85,404.434,"Well, the clerk of court testified that he and the other jury commissioners made a conscious effort to maintain a certain proportion at representation."
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,404.434,406.192,Do you accept that?
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,406.192,407.34,"Well, of course, we --"
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,407.34,414.313,"And I know you say that even if that so, that's invalid selection but do you accept the fact they did put into proportion?"
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,414.313,419.705,"Well, of course, the only evidence on that point is the testimony of the clerk of the court."
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,419.705,421.649,But you don't accept or do you accept or?
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,421.649,422.838,"Well, of course, we --"
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,422.838,425.153,What do you care with that?
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,425.153,448.997,"I'm not at all sure that makes a great deal of difference in the context of the record before the Court at this time because we believe that this record establishes a prima facie case of discrimination in the selection of the jury based upon the fact, that over a long period of time, only one Negro had been called to serve upon the grand jury of that county."
1966.647,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,497.251,500.298,It may -- may not correctly coalesce.
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,510.677,523.486,"We think the record supports that and we refer the Court to pages 66 and commencing at that point forward, to the testimony of clerk of court, Mr. Sensenbach, who testified."
1966.647,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,533.994,545.414,"Yes, I'm -- I remember that but he was asking about the February term of Court of the grand juries over a period of time."
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,552.065,552.72,That is correct.
1966.647,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,554.526,558.242,"Is there anything -- that -- oh, you have only one grand jury?"
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,558.242,559.408,For the entire year.
1966.647,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,559.408,559.953,I see.
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,561.104,567.119,But approximately six terms of the Court convened during the course of the year.
1966.647,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,584.925,620.251,"Well, my -- my notes which may be incorrect to the fact that his testimony that then the 1959 term, there was one Negro in the grand jury panel, 1960 term possibly one Negro, and 1962 term which was when petitioner was tried the one Negro in the grand jury trial, and similarly in 1963 one Negro in the grand jury panel."
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,623.437,626.91,We think the record shows contrary to that Mr. Justice Fortas.
1966.647,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,694.407,697.619,I didn't read that testimony that way but I may be wrong.
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,702.46,719.628,"And if you will go back to page 68 of the top of the page with respect to 1958, the clerk of court does not recognize any Negro included on the grand jury during that term."
1966.647,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,720.868,739.3,"Well, Mr. Perry in the middle of 68, is the question whether you've seen the grand jury sitting since 1958 with more than one Negro sitting on that jury or more than five is that your -- I don't think more than five."
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,756.497,757.091,"No, sir."
1966.647,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,757.091,757.767,I see.
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,757.767,776.428,"We submit that if you will refer fully to the testimony of the clerk of court on this point, it was perhaps a not too accurate use of the semantics involved on the part of the interrogator and the witness himself."
1966.647,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,785.143,793.464,"Well, I gather your position is, are we dealing now since 1958 this record covered only since 1958, isn't it?"
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,793.464,799.451,"Well, I think that if you will look at the testimony of another witness who testified that he have visited --"
1966.647,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,799.451,811.161,"Well, except -- I wonder if you could tell me sir, are we dealing only with the situation since 1958 or does this record involved Negroes on the grand juries prior to 1958?"
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,811.161,813.255,It involves Negroes on the grand juries prior to 1958.
1966.647,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,813.255,814.105,Yes.
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,823.202,824.67,This is what we think is reflected --
1966.647,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,824.67,828.387,"But what -- and one -- some one of those terms which term, do you --"
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,828.387,837.623,The February 1962 term at which time this petitioner was indicted and of course presumably throughout the entire year of 1962.
1966.647,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,837.623,840.299,"At that time, there was one and that's the only time."
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,840.299,841.285,That is the only time.
1966.647,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,841.285,844.07,"Up until then that's there never been a Negro in the grand jury, is that it?"
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,844.07,844.702,That is correct.
1966.647,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,873.604,890.847,"May I ask you this Mr. Perry, if we would have think that this record justified a conclusion that at least one on the grand jury for each year at least since 1958 as what the evidence showed, would that change your position?"
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,890.847,892.616,"I don't believe so, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1966.647,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,918.262,923.9,"Well, Mr. Perry, I'd appreciate it if you would to tell me again."
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,939.764,941.468,That is correct sir.
1966.647,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,941.468,955.572,"Now, tell me just what the record shows as this as to how that list of electors was used for the purpose of making up the contents of the jury box?"
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,955.572,978.318,"Well, except for reference to the opinion of the Supreme Court of South Carolina which sets forth the procedure in making up the jury lists in South Carolina and except for reference to the testimony of Mr. Sensenbach, the clerk of Court, the record is otherwise silent concerning the exact mechanics."
1966.647,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,978.318,994.626,"This what bothers me in this case because Mr. Sensenbach's testimony, are you saying that Mr. Sensenbach's testimony makes out the case of systematic discrimination take that alone now?"
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,994.626,995.932,"Yes, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1966.647,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,996.492,997.392,Why?
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,997.392,1009.74,Because Mr. Sensenbach testified variously having reduced himself from any inference of any discriminatory purpose.
1966.647,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1019.212,1020.809,That's what I wanted to get clear.
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,1046.125,1047.023,"Yes, sir."
1966.647,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1047.023,1054.79,"Despite the fact that in this record, he has testified by at least the record can be read."
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,1068.716,1069.942,That is correct.
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1120.313,1122.472,I know but you had -- you had registered voters list which designated the --
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,1122.472,1124.496,We did have registered voter lists which designated the --
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1124.496,1128.483,What -- why in this -- what's the difference between this and Whitus?
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,1128.483,1152.385,"Well, I merely -- I merely point out that in -- well, in Whitus of course you have a situation I think of course, analogous to -- in Avery versus Georgia where the State of Georgia pursued a system of requiring different colored tax slips based upon race."
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1152.671,1155.49,Which is the source of jury name at all.
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,1155.49,1156.588,Yes.
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1156.588,1163.184,And here they have a registered voters list that separates Negroes and whites.
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,1163.184,1164.393,That is correct.
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1180.178,1196.71,But you would argue -- you would argue any time that the jury commissioner is that familiar with the -- with the electorate that there's the invalidity if there is not enough Negroes on the jury?
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,1196.71,1226.067,"I believe that looking at the entire record that when we add to the fact that only one Negro has been called for service on the grand jury and you add to that fact that the states has required the registrants to be identified by race, And add to that the further fact that the -- one of the jury commissioners can immediately identify the would-be juror by his race."
1966.647,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1239.611,1254.441,"Well, if -- if on every jury panel there was the exact proportion of Negroes and whites proportionate to the numbers on the jury -- on the registered voters list, what would you say in there?"
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,1254.441,1268.05,"Well, of course, the Court has certainly observed that the Constitution not only prohibits exclusion but it prohibits discriminatory inclusion."
1966.647,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1295.862,1296.499,Very well.
1966.647,0,36498,matthew_j_perry,,1296.499,1300.84,Thank you sir.
1966.647,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1300.84,1306.444,Mr. Brandon?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1306.444,1311.286,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.647,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1326.63,1328.954,You mean each term Mr. Brandon?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1328.954,1343.403,"Well, we think that he said that there was usually one on the grand jury and that while the record is not entirely explicit as to each year, we think that there is the fair inference to be withdrawn from that --"
1966.647,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1343.403,1345.76,Was that set in 1958 of the Court?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1345.76,1373.383,"Well, since 1958 and of course the petitioner has said that it refers to the time prior but there was no direct examination of any witness as to any time prior to 1958 except that Mr. Sensenbach was asked about the quashing of an indictment in 1954 and he said that, it was quashed and that after they did about the same thing."
1966.647,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1444.833,1454.286,"Mr. Brandon, would you tell us something I don't know whether the records clearly shows that what actually happened when they take the electors' list, what would-be grand jury?"
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1454.286,1455.689,Alright sir.
1966.647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1468.36,1470.158,But that it's designated with which race they are?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1470.158,1471.28,No question by that.
1966.647,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1476.38,1478.194,But what is -- I miss that sir.
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1478.194,1478.969,Sir?
1966.647,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1478.969,1479.593,What is the designate --
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1479.593,1485.124,The registration books which are used to select jurors are -- designated race.
1966.647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1486.256,1489.314,"Well, you don't just take everyone that comes along?"
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1489.314,1490.023,"No, sir."
1966.647,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1505.864,1513.809,"Mr. Brandon, why is it this then the same problem we had in Whitus, if we decided on this?"
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1513.809,1534.28,"For the simple reason sir, that if the statute is complied with and two-thirds of those eligible are placed in the jury box, those names are typed on a small piece of paper rolled up, inserted in a little pellet or a capsule thing, fastened, placed in a box, and mixed up."
1966.647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1536.812,1539.475,"Well, there is in the selection of the names that go in?"
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1539.475,1541.279,There is in that and of course --
1966.647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1541.279,1542.788,Isn't that in Whitus?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1542.788,1543.531,"No, sir."
1966.647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1568.778,1583.025,"I know but why is it -- why is it the segregated pack list in Whitus, the equivalent of the racially designated registered voters list in this case?"
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1583.025,1589.614,"Well, as I understand Whitus, they were separate in list, that Negroes in one section of whites in another."
1966.647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1589.614,1601.26,But what -- but why should that make a difference as long as if you can held when they come to the designations in the race of the various people.
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1601.26,1620.891,"Well, it seems to me that in our system that to have the race designated on there, it would be helpful because you have an opportunity to at least get of somewhat of a proportion of representation into the jury box."
1966.647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1627.706,1635.158,"Well, you would suggest to that person -- you wouldn't suggest that that purpose was achieved here, would you?"
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1635.158,1636.019,"Well, there is a --"
1966.647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1636.019,1642.532,"If there was any proportion of representation of Negroes on the jury panel, wasn't it?"
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1642.532,1644.793,Insofar as the --
1966.647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1644.793,1647.424,What was the proportion of Negroes on the jury box?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1659.384,1674.153,"In about -- there were -- the testimony of the registration board, the clerk in the board was if there were 900 plus I think whites and 200 plus Negroes."
1966.647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1675.826,1677.104,Was it about 20%?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1677.104,1678.63,Yes.
1966.647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1678.63,1681.944,"Now, with 20% on the panel of the court?"
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1681.944,1682.919,On panels?
1966.647,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1697.968,1703.275,"What is the language of the clerk that you rely on to that effect, in the record?"
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1703.275,1720.811,"On Mr. Sensenbach's testimony on page 71, I think that -- I believe it was Mr. Justice Brennan read that if I'm not mistaken."
1966.647,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1720.811,1729.388,I think I read something in 68.
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1729.388,1736.394,"Yes, he answered, “I don't think on a grand jury there has been more than one or two at any one term that I can recall.”"
1966.647,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1736.394,1743.166,"Well, does that -- does that say that there are one or two on every one?"
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1745.079,1745.438,Well --
1966.647,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1745.438,1747.418,-- whether it's more than one or two.
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1757.659,1758.368,"No, sir."
1966.647,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1772.316,1773.204,Who might be?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1773.204,1773.362,Yes.
1966.647,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1773.362,1773.663,Yes.
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1784.086,1784.239,"Yes, sir."
1966.647,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1784.239,1786.776,-- and so forth that whether in relation with the other.
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1788.267,1788.514,"Yes, sir."
1966.647,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1788.514,1793.594,-- answer that after.
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1793.594,1795.991,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.647,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1806.729,1812.275,"My question was, I believe, I asked it two I think."
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1841.587,1856.037,I do not believe that that précised language is in the record any more than the précised language that there was only one Negro on the grand jury at any time in the county.
1966.647,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1866.652,1867.148,Yes.
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1867.148,1879.434,"And then on 71, so that at most you have only been able to observe one Negro serving on the grand jury at one time, is that correct?"
1966.647,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1879.434,1882.045,His answer was?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1882.045,1885.359,In my recollection.
1966.647,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1885.359,1908.173,"Now, but the counsel pointed out on pages 66, 67, and 68 certain answer of citizen which says this witness said, first concerning was February 1961 grand jury, if there is a Negro on there I don't recognize it."
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,1985.504,1998.396,"Not necessarily, except with and the general context of his testimony, he said that there were -- that Negro served on the grand juries and Negro served on the petty juries and in varying numbers."
1966.647,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2000.107,2001.325,In what kind the numbers?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2001.325,2003.03,In varying numbers.
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2007.894,2009.458,A grand -- of grand jury?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2009.458,2012.361,Petty jury.
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2013.076,2023.437,"But suppose -- suppose there was only one on each one, could that be any different to having none on each one but the percentage of white and colored people that lived in the county?"
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2023.437,2032.147,"Well, Mr. Justice Black, the -- of course, the percentage of white and colored is fairly equal or maybe a little more colored."
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2052.001,2057.108,"Although, there may have been testimony in the record, they were not kept from it but the history shows they were kept from it?"
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2057.108,2068.842,"Well, I think it does show that it has been done in some places but I don't know that history shows it was done in Jasper County, South Carolina."
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2068.842,2077.456,Why do they need separation of the colors in determining the elector?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2077.456,2077.808,I --
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2077.808,2078.716,What's the reason for this?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2078.716,2079.333,I don't know.
1966.647,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2088.531,2088.8,Well it's not --
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2088.8,2090.594,-- and not only in that but in other --
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2090.594,2096.762,"It's been utilized, hasn't it, as a means to keep them from serving on the jurors and voting."
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2096.762,2100.865,"I do not believe that has been used in Jasper County, South Carolina."
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2101.13,2102.416,You do not believe you can use that?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2102.416,2103.398,"No, sir."
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2103.759,2105.54,But have you read the Whitus case?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2105.54,2106.419,"Yes, sir."
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2106.419,2107.554,What about it?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2107.554,2109.184,Apparently was used that
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2109.184,2109.647,What?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2109.647,2111.462,"It apparently was, yes, sir."
1966.647,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2113.013,2115.523,Do you have a statute?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2115.523,2116.126,Sir?
1966.647,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2116.126,2122.018,You have a statute on the keeping of the records or perhaps to be designated by race?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2122.018,2123.795,On the registration records?
1966.647,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2123.795,2124.138,Yes.
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2124.138,2125.022,"Yes, sir."
1966.647,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2125.022,2127.689,"That's the same as Whitus, they have the statue?"
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2127.689,2155.733,"Well, of course as I reach Whitus and I said this before it's been up here a couple of times and if -- as I read it when they prepared the last jury list, they used the list that has bee prepared from a so-called tainted source, plus the designation from the tax list."
1966.647,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2156.512,2162.321,"In the tax list, they were designating just figured that?"
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2162.321,2163.886,Want to see or colored?
1966.647,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2163.886,2165.351,Yes.
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2165.351,2172.422,"Well, they're also separated into colored, different colored type in, if this part of the books and want it."
1966.647,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2172.422,2177.34,Do they had a statute with each -- each person had the power return.
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2200.722,2201.308,Yes.
1966.647,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2201.758,2211.312,"That was the same as yours as I understood you to say, and this from which the jury was selected did have a designation?"
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2211.312,2213.163,From which the box was filled.
1966.647,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2213.163,2213.602,Yes.
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2213.602,2223.773,I -- I will certainly concede that that designation puts the situation into such a -- into such a condition that it could be abused.
1966.647,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2226.036,2233.227,"As we said in Whitus by all that jurors except anything now to see there after those designations, was it?"
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2233.227,2235.07,I read that.
1966.647,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2235.07,2242.646,"We said the potential of it, probability of it as it there and therefore we have struck them in?"
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2242.646,2243.191,"Yes, sir."
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2300.165,2303.605,You don't really -- why wouldn't more turn off in the box?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2303.605,2303.696,Sir?
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2303.696,2307.526,If there -- why wouldn't more turn off in the box to serve.
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2307.526,2307.783,Well --
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2307.783,2320.073,"If they had made that which is all required genuine, bona fide effort on the part of the state under the decision of this Court back by 1887."
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2320.073,2321.074,"Yes, sir."
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2321.074,2323.097,To see that they have put on the jury?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2323.097,2332.647,"If Your Honor please, this record doesn't cover every term of Court for every year since 1958."
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2354.833,2357.903,How many of them have served?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2357.903,2359.446,"None sir, on this case --"
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2359.446,2360.819,But any of them served on any case?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2360.819,2364.54,I can assure the Court that Negroes served on juries in Jasper County.
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2364.54,2366.655,How many have served according to the record?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2366.655,2367.582,This record?
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2367.582,2367.863,Yes.
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2367.863,2372.641,That no effort has been made to determine that that I know of to that number.
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2373.384,2377.819,I'm asking you -- I'm asking you these questions for this reasons.
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2399.137,2399.415,Well --
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2399.415,2403.923,Genuine bona fide effort but you don't have to use microscope to find them.
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2403.923,2419.841,"If Your Honor please, I can only call your attention to the fact that this Court has never found jury discrimination in the case of South Carolina to my knowledge and that goes back to Franklin against South Carolina in 1910."
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2450.183,2451.462,Is that enough?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2451.462,2461.458,"It may not be enough but it seems to me, it certainly doesn't qualify proportionately which as I understand it, it is not required."
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2463.929,2472.36,The requirement is that there'll be a bona fide efforts made to give a fair representation of the colored people on the jury.
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2472.36,2473.333,Yes sir.
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2484.821,2487.917,But why shouldn't we get away with that political designation?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2487.917,2490.38,Sir?
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2490.38,2495.833,"Designating and dividing them up into one color, what's the reason for that if not just that?"
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2495.833,2498.504,"Well, if you just ask me sir why?"
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2500.478,2507.494,I have said you're not just to read -- I understand you're not responsible for the system and I maybe I question too much?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2507.494,2508.413,"No, sir."
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2544.255,2545.904,I would think it is already where --
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2545.904,2558.774,It's not true -- I would think that probably this Court doesn't know 90% of employees that work here and that I don't know 90% of the people that work in the highway department.
1966.647,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2689.393,2695.331,"Mr. Brandon, one thing that occurs to me is this."
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2763.353,2779.421,"Well, the only answer I can make to that is Your Honor is that lawsuits are tried sometimes a long way from the way place where the principal case was tried and in this instance it was in Columbia."
1966.647,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2785.232,2790.761,"But when a man's -- what a man's life is in jeopardy, they shouldn't be sloppily tried that way?"
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2790.761,2798.861,"Well, they -- I certainly agree."
1966.647,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2871.327,2873.31,"How would that be would you say, I didn't get it?"
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2873.31,2878.018,I say that if that is followed fairly.
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2901.53,2902.727,That is the electors.
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2907.51,2910.009,By the actual registration itself.
1966.647,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2917.302,2920.708,But it comes into it of course when you may use of that as basis?
1966.647,1,21816,everett_n_brandon,,2920.708,2921.103,Yes.
1966.647,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2973.676,2975.172,Mr. Perry.
1966.647,2,36498,matthew_j_perry,,2975.172,2978.701,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.647,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3054.912,3056.319,1960?
1966.647,2,36498,matthew_j_perry,,3056.319,3058.197,"1959, I believe at the bottom of --"
1966.647,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3058.197,3059.058,1959?
