1975.74-1599,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,73.181,"We will hear arguments next in 74-1599, Chandler against Roudebush."
1975.74-1599,0,32958,joel_l_selig,,78.231,81.975,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1599,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,326.073,349.458,"Do you admit that the possibility that the mode of trial in a District Court might be one way had there been no appeal to the Civil Service Commission but on another way if as in this case there was, I suppose, you, representing the clients you do, would not admit of any possibility that -- because your client did take an appeal to the Civil Service Commission."
1975.74-1599,0,32958,joel_l_selig,,349.458,350.29,"Well, that is correct your Honor."
1975.74-1599,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,357.678,362.741,"But the suit maybe filed within 30 days after the final agency decision, as I understand it."
1975.74-1599,0,32958,joel_l_selig,,362.741,363.252,That is right.
1975.74-1599,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,363.252,371.024,Or within 15 days after the final agency decision then appeal maybe taken to Civil Service Commission then it is a 180-day.
1975.74-1599,0,32958,joel_l_selig,,390.761,401.005,"Well, of course, I would also point out that the only thing added by the appeal to the Civil Service Commission is a further, is a review of the record by the Civil Service Commission."
1975.74-1599,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,410.388,412.923,(Inaudible) in an Appellate Court certainly.
1975.74-1599,0,32958,joel_l_selig,,412.923,413.028,That is correct.
1975.74-1599,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,413.028,415.241,"I mean appeal on the record, right?"
1975.74-1599,0,32958,joel_l_selig,,415.241,417.888,That is correct.
1975.74-1599,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,453.625,459.35,What would be the rule as to the admissibility of the administrative record under your theory that you say.
1975.74-1599,0,32958,joel_l_selig,,459.35,472.858,It is our assumption -- in the first place let me say that normally there is no objection by anyone to admission of the administrative record but we believe that the administrative decision is clearly admissible.
1975.74-1599,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,480.626,491.548,"Well, I do not know that that necessarily follows if your theory is this is a de novo trial, presumably those issues of fact are for the Court or the jury."
1975.74-1599,0,32958,joel_l_selig,,501.024,507.097,It is our position that certainly the agency decision and the Civil Service Commission is admissible and I am aware --
1975.74-1599,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,507.097,511.652,What theory if it is really a de novo trial starting all over again?
1975.74-1599,0,32958,joel_l_selig,,511.652,525.705,It is a -- I think that findings of agencies are normally admissible whether or not the judicial proceeding is a de novo proceeding and it is also a business record.
1975.74-1599,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,525.705,532.855,Are you not suggesting a mixed procedure partly agency review and partly trial de novo?
1975.74-1599,0,32958,joel_l_selig,,532.855,537.392,"No your Honor, not to -- it does not follow from the fact --"
1975.74-1599,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,537.392,541.248,"(Inaudible) fact could be given, what constructions?"
1975.74-1599,0,32958,joel_l_selig,,541.248,542.103,It would depend.
1975.74-1599,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,552.992,556.644,"Well, what if judge charge the jury as to the weight to be given."
1975.74-1599,0,32958,joel_l_selig,,556.644,558.21,"Well, there is no is not a jury trial at the time so --"
1975.74-1599,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,558.21,559.131,Okay.
1975.74-1599,0,32958,joel_l_selig,,562.831,570.53,"Well, this Court in Alexander against Gardner-Denver Company addressed that question in a footnote and said we adopt no rule."
1975.74-1599,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,596.476,600.473,"That is a contractual grievance -- that was a contractual grievance proceeding, was it not?"
1975.74-1599,0,32958,joel_l_selig,,600.473,602.576,That is correct your Honor.
1975.74-1599,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,792.768,797.717,"(Inaudible) assumes the conclusion, does it not?"
1975.74-1599,0,32958,joel_l_selig,,807.47,820.983,"That is correct Mr. Chief Justice and I was just trying to point out that the Government’s rule would be completely inconsistent, what the rule is, in the private sector and in the state and local sector onto the decisions of this Court."
1975.74-1599,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,820.983,826.981,"That is true in a great many other areas, is it not, a judicial review of administrative action?"
1975.74-1599,0,32958,joel_l_selig,,826.981,836.304,"That is correct but I think that we have to look at this particular statute, its particular language, its particular legislative history and its particular purpose."
1975.74-1599,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,871.723,873.492,"That was when, in 65 or in 72?"
1975.74-1599,0,32958,joel_l_selig,,873.492,873.99,"No, Your Honor."
1975.74-1599,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,886.436,892.14,Is that proposed provision was applicable to federal employees only?
1975.74-1599,0,32958,joel_l_selig,,892.14,907.773,"No, and that is the second point in our favor Mr. Justice Stewart which is that even that draft legislation did not apply to the federal sector and federal sector cases were governed by completely different section of the draft legislation."
1975.74-1599,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1016.977,1025.569,What was the -- what was the occasion for providing an elaborate administrative remedy for federal employees?
1975.74-1599,0,32958,joel_l_selig,,1025.569,1030.691,It already existed Mr. Justice White in substantially the same form prior to the enactment.
1975.74-1599,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1030.691,1042.011,"That maybe so, but in saying that you provide the same remedies, well that is just not true if there is an elaborate administrative remedy available."
1975.74-1599,0,32958,joel_l_selig,,1042.011,1045.665,"Well, they were referring to providing the same remedies in Court."
1975.74-1599,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1046.784,1053.985,I thought that is what you were saying but nevertheless the federal employee does have different remedies.
1975.74-1599,0,32958,joel_l_selig,,1053.985,1060.345,"Well, it has different remedies with respect to federal agencies.I would also point out Mr. Justice White --"
1975.74-1599,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1060.345,1064.453,"Well, it does have different remedies, the additional remedies, it is not the same at all."
1975.74-1599,0,32958,joel_l_selig,,1064.453,1075.028,"Well, private sector employees and state and local employees frequently have remedies at the state and local level pursuant to State Fair Employment Practice Statutes."
1975.74-1599,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1120.434,1130.301,"Aside from Title VII cases, what happens to a federal employee who is discharged and utilizes fully the administrative processes available to him?"
1975.74-1599,0,32958,joel_l_selig,,1133.1,1136.308,"You mean under other basis or jurisdiction, Your Honor."
1975.74-1599,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1138.534,1141.328,Where?
1975.74-1599,0,32958,joel_l_selig,,1141.328,1145.602,"Well, there has traditionally been a remedy in the District Courts."
1975.74-1599,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1153.637,1159.177,Congress has never sent federal employees to the Court of Appeals after civil service action.
1975.74-1599,0,32958,joel_l_selig,,1159.177,1164.513,Not to my knowledge and the DC Circuit has criticized that on numerous occasions and the --
1975.74-1599,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1234.911,1238.646,Mr. Chief Justice and may ot please the Court.
1975.74-1599,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1277.883,1288.355,Then how it -- and yet it is very cleat that an employee claiming discrimination can wholly avoid such review and go into the Federal District Court after his agency has acted.
1975.74-1599,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1288.355,1295.475,"It depends, Mr. Justice Stewart on how broadly you consider the Civil Service Commission and its responsibility in this area."
1975.74-1599,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1339.274,1340.097,In your agency?
1975.74-1599,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1340.097,1340.77,That is correct.
1975.74-1599,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1378.389,1384.156,Is that what you say applicable to the very first processing of the very first administrative complaint?
1975.74-1599,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1384.156,1396.761,"The very first, the very first step starts on Page 28A of our Appendix, talks about the counseling procedure and that is pursuant to Civil Service Commission Regulations."
1975.74-1599,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1397.004,1398.161,Is that done by a Civil Service personnel?
1975.74-1599,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1398.161,1404.627,"No, not personnel, the personnel comes into the point at the hearing examiner but pursuant to Civil Service Commission Regulations."
1975.74-1599,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1565.374,1573.901,"Are there any, even conceivable conditions under which a federal employee could go to the EEOC, they are not."
1975.74-1599,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1573.901,1574.485,"No, they are not."
1975.74-1599,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1574.485,1575.015,Just not.
1975.74-1599,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1575.015,1576.283,They just do not have jurisdiction on it.
1975.74-1599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1638.934,1647.946,"When you review those status, Mr. Lee, the employee’s options first within the agency briefly."
1975.74-1599,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1647.946,1649.892,Be happy to Mr. Chief Justice.
1975.74-1599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1659.417,1659.993,Within the agency?
1975.74-1599,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,1659.993,1661.031,Within the agency.
1975.74-1599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2043.879,2047.597,(Inaudible) the reviewing of the same record?
1975.74-1599,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2047.597,2049.645,That is correct; that is correct.
1975.74-1599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2049.645,2058.724,"Civil Service Commission would review the record last made or if he took the route to the District Court, that would be the basis of judicial review."
1975.74-1599,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2058.724,2079.984,"That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice and I am saying one more thing and that is that whether you go directly from the agency in to Court, it is a review of the administrative record or if you go from the Civil Service Commission in to Court, it is a review of the administrative record because under either circumstance you have the agency having brought its expertise to bear on the problem."
1975.74-1599,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2173.819,2179.808,Mr. Lee is this a point of whether Congress might have said so explicitly taking the other’s sides position explicitly?
1975.74-1599,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2192.291,2196.581,I am confident that there are Justice Stevens.
1975.74-1599,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2283.751,2285.922,The complainant has an absolute right to a hearing.
1975.74-1599,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2285.922,2287.4,That is correct.
1975.74-1599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2329.123,2336.759,"But elapsed time, from beginning to end, not the time consumed in that number of days, is that right?"
1975.74-1599,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2336.759,2349.005,What we are talking about Mr. Chief Justice is the period of time that it takes from the filing of a complaint up until the time that the administrative record is complete.
1975.74-1599,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2565.403,2573.553,"It did not find difficulty with the sex scene, it did not find them because they were the race points so, could credibility not be something in there?"
1975.74-1599,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2573.553,2591.628,"Mr. Justice Marshall, if you look carefully at what the examiner concluded with regard to sex, it did not depend in any way on what the witnesses said on the matter of credibility, one having said one thing and one having said another and which was telling truth."
1975.74-1599,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2666.618,2687.1,The alternative that your friends are suggesting is that this being trusted to 403 or 425 Federal District Judges who would treat the matter as any other kind -- as any other independent kind of litigation trying it de novo.
1975.74-1599,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2687.1,2700.784,"That is true and that Mr. Chief Justice specifically is the problem, there are 423, we wish there were 473 but there are 423 of them."
1975.74-1599,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2716.066,2738.304,"Mr. Lee, your opponents also suggest that Congress was not all that convinced that the Civil Service Commission had this high degree of expertise in the field of equal opportunity, in fact that it had been lagging some and that is the reason they had advanced, is there not some indication in the legislative history that that was the feeling of Congress."
1975.74-1599,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2738.304,2742.388,"Surely, and that is totally irrelevant so far as the present issue is concerned."
1975.74-1599,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2871.519,2913.151,"Mr. Lee, my question is, if I may, throughout your brief you keep -- you emphasize and repeat that the rule that you proposed of review on an administrative record should be the rule in the ordinary case, that it should be the general rule, and you make very explicit that there -- you concede that maybe in our exceptions, exceptions when there has been an inordinate delay in the administrative review and another exception you suggest when a witness has not been amenable to compulsory process because he is not a government employee and you suggest there may be others."
1975.74-1599,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2928.627,2944.323,"I think, Mr. Justice Stewart in, generally, the review of the record, the review of the administrative record necessarily implies, and I think it has been the consistent practice that the Court has to have a certain discretion."
1975.74-1599,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2945.229,2948.75,"Is it true in Labor Board cases for example, review by the Courts of Appeals."
1975.74-1599,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2948.75,2950.371,"Well, I would think that if I am --"
1975.74-1599,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2950.371,2954.918,Have you ever heard one where the Court of Appeals took additional evidence.
1975.74-1599,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2954.918,2956.583,Where the Court of Appeals took --
1975.74-1599,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2956.583,2958.389,"Well, that is the reviewing agency --"
1975.74-1599,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2958.389,2959.081,"Yes, I understand."
1975.74-1599,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2959.081,2960.232,-- of many administrative --
1975.74-1599,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2960.232,2964.744,"Well, rather than sending it back, you mean."
1975.74-1599,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2968.491,2973.446,"Now it is the Court of Appeals that is the reviewing court in most modern, as you well know."
1975.74-1599,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2978.281,2997.579,"No, I do not, but I think that it follows from this kind of statutory, from this kind of statutory structure and that it simply makes sense in the discretion of -- to allow this kind of discretion in the District Court for those two kinds of circumstances."
1975.74-1599,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2997.579,2999.217,Then you suggest there may be others.
1975.74-1599,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,2999.217,2999.92,There may be.
1975.74-1599,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3001.147,3002.553,(Inaudible)
1975.74-1599,1,39761,rex_e_lee,,3002.553,3016.931,Thank you.
1975.74-1599,2,32958,joel_l_selig,,3016.931,3028.73,Mr. Justice Marshall credulity is certainly was an issue in this case and I would direct the Court’s attention to Pages 63 through 67 of the certified administrative record.
1975.74-1599,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3191.455,3195.723,Is my understanding correct that here a complainant has an absolute right to a hearing --
1975.74-1599,2,32958,joel_l_selig,,3195.723,3196.188,That is correct.
1975.74-1599,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3196.188,3196.887,-- in his agency?
1975.74-1599,2,32958,joel_l_selig,,3196.887,3197.878,That is correct Your Honor.
1975.74-1599,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3197.878,3200.758,And only he may waive it?
1975.74-1599,2,32958,joel_l_selig,,3200.758,3204.124,That is correct.
1975.74-1599,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3238.625,3245.523,"Now the Government case, if not a middle position, it does not take -- it admits of exceptions to what it -- to the rule that it advocates."
1975.74-1599,2,32958,joel_l_selig,,3245.523,3247.191,"Very narrow exception, Your Honor I would suggest."
1975.74-1599,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3247.191,3258.419,"But it concedes 54:08 that the rule it advocates maybe inadequate or defective in certain circumstances, is that correct?"
1975.74-1599,2,32958,joel_l_selig,,3258.419,3265.025,"That is correct, but -- and I think the exceptions that they are recognizing are very narrow."
1975.74-1599,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3305.302,3314.217,"Now you start from the scratch here as you would be in a civil action in the District Court in its primary jurisdiction, are you?"
1975.74-1599,2,32958,joel_l_selig,,3314.217,3329.966,"Well, you are starting -- well first of all Mr. Chief Justice I do not think it is contended by anyone that the Commission has primary jurisdiction in the normal sense if that word, but I am starting from scratch as far as the complainant having control over the development of his case."
1975.74-1599,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3329.966,3340.284,I am suggesting that the plaintiff -- I am suggesting that the complaining party has had a good deal of procedure up to that time?
1975.74-1599,2,32958,joel_l_selig,,3340.284,3344.783,"Well, as we have said, we assume that the administrative record is admissible."
1975.74-1599,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3430.881,3431.602,Thank you gentlemen.
