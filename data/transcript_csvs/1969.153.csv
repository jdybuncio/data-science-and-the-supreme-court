1969.153,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,39.639,"Number 153, McMann against Richardson."
1969.153,0,18028,brenda_soloff,,42.237,43.619,Thank you.
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1750.237,1772.058,"-- from the bench if a defendant plead at guilty prior to the Bruton decision, he may not now come forward and say that he was induced to plead because he expected that his co-defendants' confession would be introduced and the jury would hear it and that would prejudice him."
1969.153,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1772.058,1776.453,"Well, I would think in the Second Circuit he could?"
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1776.453,1795.222,"It's difficult to understand precisely how far the Second Circuit would go, but I think that is a logical outcome of much of the reasoning of the Second Circuit and I think it's intolerable -- it is an intolerable outcome."
1969.153,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1795.222,1803.665,Could I ask you whether in New York now there maybe a pre-trial hearing about the admissibility of confession?
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1803.665,1820.143,"Yes, New York State appears to be the only jurisdiction in America in which there can be a pre-trial hearing as to admissibility of confessions and the defendant may preserve his claim of coercion on appeal after a plea of guilty."
1969.153,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1820.143,1828.272,"And if the -- and if the upper court reverses the decision that it was admissible, he may re-plead?"
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1828.272,1839.806,"He has the option of withdrawing his plea and going to trial or negotiating a lesser plea, but at his option, the judgment of conviction is vacated."
1969.153,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1839.806,1842.24,Any time limit on that in New York?
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1842.24,1845.539,"Yes, the time limit is the normal appellate process."
1969.153,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1845.539,1848.858,But he can't do this by collateral attack 15 years later?
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1848.858,1849.424,No.
1969.153,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1849.424,1852.185,How long is this right been?
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1852.185,1858.275,"This was enacted by the legislature in 1965, about six months after the Jackson case."
1969.153,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1858.275,1866.778,"You understand -- you don't understand that that so-called omnibus hearing, pre-trial hearing in some jurisdictions includes a confession hearing?"
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1866.778,1877.988,"Yes, the hearings include the issue of confession, I would assume, in every jurisdiction but only in New York is that issue preserved on appeal after a plea of guilty."
1969.153,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1877.988,1880.936,"I see, I see."
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,1880.936,1920.714,"And the logical outcome perhaps of the Second Circuit opinion read in its broadest sense is to require the New York procedure as a matter of constitutional law to be enacted in every jurisdiction because the logical outcome indeed of the Second Circuit position and apparently of the relators' arguments is that if evidence is obtained by police in an illegal manner, there really is no way that a contested hearing on issues of fact can be avoided even if the defendant pleads guilty."
1969.153,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2024.0,2038.154,"Suppose that if they were admittedly or clearly coerced confessions, a counsel would've advised him of that and he wouldn't have taken them in a consideration in considering whether to plea?"
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2038.154,2051.735,"Yes, and that brings us to the second possible nexus between the coerced confession and the plea of guilty and that is the suggested nexus of incompetency of counsel."
1969.153,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2099.729,2103.825,"What do you mean by nexus, Mr. Juviler, a connection, a connection or what it is?"
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2103.825,2115.899,"Well, I think the problem here is that the relators are striving to find some kind of a constitutionally acceptable theory on which they can connect this confession."
1969.153,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2115.899,2121.92,"Well, I'm not interested in theory as to the meaning of that particular word to you."
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2129.39,2133.685,As I suggest it has been used in many contexts and I'm just trying to pinpoint that.
1969.153,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2133.685,2136.195,"Well, that's reason I'm asking you what do you mean by it?"
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2136.195,2146.867,To me I would say that a nexus is some constitutionally acceptable reason why the plea of guilty should not be considered binding.
1969.153,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2146.867,2148.69,That's not a definition you find in the dictionary for nexus.
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2148.69,2149.428,No.
1969.153,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2155.167,2158.936,"Well, I don't mean such in nexus, what do you mean by the word nexus --"
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2158.936,2161.364,"Well, a chance."
1969.153,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2169.24,2170.591,"It means relationship, doesn't it?"
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2170.591,2171.105,Some relationship.
1969.153,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2171.105,2172.333,"Connection, doesn't it mean connection?"
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2172.333,2174.059,It could mean a factual connection.
1969.153,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2174.059,2176.226,But what does it mean to you?
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2176.226,2178.673,"To me, it means a factual connection."
1969.153,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2178.673,2179.266,Thank you.
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2179.266,2190.993,"It means a continuation of the coercion that was addressed in the station house to the defendant, a continuation of that coercion into the courtroom."
1969.153,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2190.993,2192.006,"Now, that's --"
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2192.006,2194.296,And that is not alleged in these cases.
1969.153,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2360.82,2366.709,How does Jackson and Denno are on at point?
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2366.709,2382.504,"It could enter into the picture if the defendant and his attorney are actually, factually motivated to enter a plea of guilty on the feeling that they just can't get a fair trial, they just can't get a fair hearing."
1969.153,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2382.504,2387.629,"Wouldn't that come out in the hearing that the Second Circuit proposes, yes or no?"
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2387.629,2393.306,I think that the first obligation is to allege it before such a hearing should be ordered.
1969.153,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2426.786,2430.012,Didn't Judge Kaufman slow you down a little on that?
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2430.012,2444.471,"He tried and he prevailed in the Second Circuit, but I think that with all respect to the opinion of Judge Kaufman, it is not persuasive and it does not overcome the fact that there was no factual allegation."
1969.153,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2572.935,2575.858,Do I understand you to say that there was perjured testimony?
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2575.858,2579.549,"Yes, I think it was, Your Honor who ask or suggested that perhaps --"
1969.153,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2579.549,2595.561,"Do you say if there were perjured testimony by a police officer and as a result of that and for no other reason, a man can't take a chance that he is still convicted and there is no way to reach it."
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2595.561,2596.263,"Now, then I --"
1969.153,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2596.263,2597.222,You don't have to go that far?
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2597.222,2624.156,"Then I think that plea should be vacated and I'm talking about a case where the man admits his guilt and he pleads guilty because after consulting with his counsel, he comes to the conclusion that he is guilty, he will admit it in Court, his conviction will be based on that plea and it just isn't worth a contest, and that brings us to the other allegations in these petitions."
1969.153,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2891.171,2894.811,"This was submitted at the Court of Appeals, Federal Court of Appeals level?"
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2894.811,2899.812,"Yes, it was attached to the appellate brief in 1968."
1969.153,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2938.1,2942.532,"That would be corrected vice today in New York, wouldn't it?"
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2942.532,2943.709,I'm sorry.
1969.153,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2943.709,2946.453,That would be corrected vice today in New York as I understand that.
1969.153,1,36102,michael_r_juviler,,2946.453,2982.382,"Yes, that's why as I was about to say even if the allegations in the supplementary affidavit are true and not that they present the picture of an outstanding member of the bar, but if they are true they still do not state a claim for federal relief because they do not show that this man was completely without the effective assistance of counsel and the length of the deliberations and consultations with his counsel which are alleged to be too short are not the test of the effective representation."
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,3402.357,3405.861,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.153,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3733.478,3738.01,Ms. Oberman could I interrupt you a moment?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,3774.675,3775.378,I don't --
1969.153,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3775.378,3802.486,"Let's put aside the -- I know there are other allegations in these cases but as I read their opinions that even if there weren't any allegations of incompetency of counsel, as long as he alleged there was coerced confession and if that coerced confession motivated or caused his plea and without the confession he never would have plead guilty, as long as he alleges that he can get a hearing?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,3802.486,3807.521,"Yes, I would have to amplify that just to a certain extent."
1969.153,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3818.808,3819.057,Oh!
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,3821.105,3825.713,"No, no, in order to get the hearing so that the bare allegations as you have outlined."
1969.153,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3825.713,3826.971,"Sure, alright."
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,3837.519,3837.914,Yes.
1969.153,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3837.914,3845.416,"And assume he says, there weren't any -- the state had no other evidence that no other substantial evidence but the confession?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,3845.416,3859.735,"Well, if he made a colorable showing and if I think of that's the only way I can express it, the confession was coerced and that the confession for reasons specified was the factor which induced his plea of guilty."
1969.153,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3859.735,3862.083,That's all he has to allege.
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,3862.083,3866.316,Yes.
1969.153,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3866.316,3876.986,"And then in Richardson you have the additional factor of allegations of incompetency of counsel, don't you, in connection with advising the plea?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,3876.986,3916.749,"In Richardson, you have the factor of incompetency of counsel which I think comes to bear in two places, that it is an independent ground or claim for relief beyond the coerced confession claim and vis-à-vis the coerced confession claim, counsel's failure to investigate and counsel's wrong advice and it was clearly wrong under New York law and under federal law at that time about the time for raising the confession was the reason the nexus, the causal connection."
1969.153,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3916.749,3922.484,"Well, if you win, if you win, his advice was right?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,3922.484,3929.571,"Well, that's fortuitous circumstance that I don't think should have anything to do with decision here."
1969.153,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3929.571,3946.063,"Yes, but I take it then on my previous question if he just alleges the coerced confession that caused his plea, he gets a hearing even though he freely concedes that his counsel was competent."
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,3946.063,3953.235,I'm afraid I have to divide that question into two parts and then answer each one.
1969.153,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4024.71,4026.58,If he takes advantage of it?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,4026.58,4042.288,Yes and after Jackson against Denno the deterrent effect or there is no unconstitutional procedure which could deter a defendant from going to trial on a coerced confession.
1969.153,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4042.288,4056.748,"But I understand -- as I understand the Court of Appeals' opinion, it did make incompetency of counsel a critical matter in or a necessary item in ordering his hearings."
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,4065.535,4080.445,"Yes, Your Honor but I believed in the Richardson decision which was not an en banc decision and a separate decision in which one of the dissenters in the en banc wrote the majority."
1969.153,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4095.265,4098.712,That was the -- that was the factor in the Richardson case?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,4098.712,4109.341,"Yes, but in Dash, it was pointed out by the Second Circuit that there was no allegation of incompetent representation by counsel."
1969.153,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4186.496,4188.769,"Mrs. Oberman, may I ask?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,4222.676,4223.25,"No, Your Honor."
1969.153,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4223.25,4226.295,"Well, what is the relevancy of advice to counsel then?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,4226.295,4234.476,I think the circuit viewed it in terms of the prime motivating factor that other circuits have talked about --
1969.153,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4234.476,4239.031,"Well, excuse Mrs. Oberman, let's take a concrete hypothetical."
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,4287.967,4315.167,"Taking your hypothetical strictly on its facts, I think the circuit has answered the question in its opinion by saying even where of confession is coerced, a defense counsel may have -- may properly advise a defendant to plead guilty, say if there's a substantial or the evidence or if the possibility of proving the claim is minimal because of the caliber of witnesses is in so--"
1969.153,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4315.167,4318.882,Was that quite the question I put to you?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,4318.882,4319.821,Perhaps I --
1969.153,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4319.821,4352.367,"Well, I'm trying to get at now is the reasons you told me, initially a hearing on the -- whether or not the confession is coerced and it is decided factually that the officers testify and I'm speaking now with the habeas hearing and here were the issue was resolved in favor of the petitioner and they said yes it was coerced and yet the counsel had said to him at the time before he pleaded guilty, these are the chances that we take."
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,4377.527,4382.818,"Well, the Ninth Circuit has held no in a very recent case."
1969.153,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4382.818,4384.177,And then what would you say?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,4384.177,4391.385,And I would say no also under the decision of the circuit because there are two elements.
1969.153,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4391.385,4392.9,"No, he's not entitled to relief."
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,4392.9,4411.932,"Yes, there are two elements that have to be proved not only the fact that the confession was coerced, but the fact that the confession was the substantial, the prime, the main motivating force behind entry of the plea of guilty."
1969.153,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4412.551,4428.442,"Well, of course the confession is in my hypothetical is not in the sense of what's involved he's getting advice from the lawyer whether or not he should take the chance on the issue of credibility as it bears on his claim of coerced confession?"
1969.153,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4428.442,4431.586,And he was afraid of the confession that's why he pleaded guilty.
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,4435.913,4455.081,"Well, I thought that your hypothetical was that he was not -- well, perhaps I divided my own mind a little bit to finely not that he was a afraid of the coerced confession but he was afraid that his proof would not be accepted, his proof of coercion would not be accepted voluntary."
1969.153,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4455.081,4485.985,"No, he was -- the lawyer called in frankly as I would expect any good lawyer would. Now, look this is going whether of not a confession is beaten out, it just going to turn on whether the fact finder believes you and your witnesses or believes police and that's the (Voice Overlap) that we go to trial on this and they believe -- the fact finder believes the police you may end up in the electric chair and I think you better not take that chance you just better plead to second degree if we can get such a plea."
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,4485.985,4490.374,"Well, I think that only what I could answer that question Your Honor is the following."
1969.153,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4537.967,4541.107,"Well then, I want to get very clear."
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,4564.944,4569.832,I guess that is not my position and yes I don't think the Court of Appeals says that --
1969.153,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4569.832,4581.454,"But I gather, you also answer that even if on the habeas hearing it shown that coerced confession was a major factor in inducing the plea that there would not be a relief."
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,4581.454,4620.011,"No, if it -- if it were a major factor in the terms that the Second Circuit has spoken out, if the coerced confession were the prime motivating factor and not other kinds of considerations, then there would be relief but I say that the Second Circuit has taken rather a hard line with this because there are other courts which have granted relief upon a showing that the confession was coerced and that the confession was the factor to be reckoned with."
1969.153,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4666.347,4671.543,"Now, bring this to something that I've been wanting to inquire about by me."
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,4684.782,4685.595,Possibly.
1969.153,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4685.595,4723.873,"Well, now we come to this hearing which maybe three years, nine years, twelve years after the trial and the state then is required to show that it had five eyewitnesses and if they can bring these five eyewitnesses then I suppose reasonably the District Judge might find that the coerced confession, the allegedly coerced confession, was not the primary motivation, is that a reasonably fair conclusion to draw for the moment?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,4743.018,4759.221,"The point, I think that the dilemma that you pose is really not a prosecution or a state dilemma because it is up to the petitioner to establish that the confession was the prime motivating factor and not --"
1969.153,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4759.221,4769.263,The state isn't going to take the risk of just letting him hear all his evidence unless it so utterly spurious on its face that they are willing to take that risk.
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,4778.606,4789.337,"Well, I think the only answer I can give Your Honor is that the federal courts throughout the country have lived with this problem for long lengths of time that there have been --"
1969.153,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4789.337,4793.657,"They suffered would be rather a better word for us, suffered with this problem."
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,4793.657,4804.166,"Well, I like to think that whenever a claimant comes in to Court with a constitutional claim that it is not suffering for a district judge to hear that."
1969.153,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4804.166,4806.397,12 years later.
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,4806.397,4813.714,"Well, in Pennsylvania against or Pennsylvania ex rel Herman against Claudy was eight years later."
1969.153,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4834.736,4842.645,"We're dealing now with the cases where they had lawyers, they did have lawyers at the time these pleas were entered."
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,4849.597,4873.766,"Well, two of the defendants alleged that that court-assigned counsel was incompetent, that court-assigned counsel didn't protect their best interests, and those of the hearing goes forward on the allegations or it doesn't."
1969.153,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4878.217,4891.186,"Just before we leave the business of what would be incompetence then involve in the hearings, in the hearings that have been now ordered under the Court of Appeals directives?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,4905.394,4906.245,"No, your Honor."
1969.153,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4906.245,4907.171,Why not?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,4907.171,4908.592,"Well, first of all the Second Circuit --"
1969.153,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4908.592,4913.189,"He knows better than anybody else in the world what motivated his plea of guilty, doesn't he?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,4913.189,4914.96,"Well, it's not just a question of motivation."
1969.153,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4914.96,4917.564,"(Voice Overlap) motivated it and it is pretty hard to disprove it, isn't it?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,4917.564,4924.297,But motivation is only one of the two aspects that have to or one of the two factors that have to be proved.
1969.153,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4939.963,4946.624,"But how do you get at that without the subjective test, Mrs. Oberman?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,4956.473,4959.32,"Yes, but the motivation is not the be-all and end-all."
1969.153,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4978.306,4991.885,"Well, what if he says, “Yes, I confessed orally to a policeman only because he was beating me with his club above my head and this did happen and I did confess orally and that's the reason I pleaded guilty.”"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5020.208,5022.605,The -- I don't think so.
1969.153,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5041.989,5051.273,"Well, he's now a petitioner, not a defendant and he comes in and he -- unlike the defendant in a criminal case, the petitioner does have the burden of proof."
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5102.145,5110.861,"Your Honor, this may seem like a problem in the abstract, but I don't think it is a problem in the concrete situation because as I have said before --"
1969.153,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5110.861,5120.213,"Well, we're up against the very concrete situation here and I'm just asking what kind of a hearing this is going to be or many hundreds of hearings?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5120.213,5156.747,"Well, I would rather -- I would like to answer that by saying that there have been hearings of this sort and perhaps the latest case is French against United States which is Ninth Circuit case were after a full hearing the District Court judge found that the confessions were taken in violation of both Miranda and Escobedo that they were illegal confessions, but also found that the illegal confessions did not induce the plea because there were a number of other facts in the case."
1969.153,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5156.747,5162.617,Wouldn't you have to show that the petitioner knew of all those facts?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5162.617,5163.769,I don't --
1969.153,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5163.769,5167.183,It's not sufficient for the state to show that there were eight eyewitnesses.
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5170.087,5175.749,I don't believe that this is how it has been done.
1969.153,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5176.356,5181.064,"But if the theory -- that's the theory of the Second Circuit Court of Appeal, isn't it?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5204.06,5229.155,"Not precisely because I think the theory of every other case that we cite in the appendix to our brief is also of substantial motivation theory, but for substantial motivation prime inducing factor and you don't have to psychoanalyze the defendant at the hearing to come to the result."
1969.153,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5241.403,5242.954,Under this standard?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5242.954,5243.625,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.153,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5269.109,5275.726,"Well, the old standard was is this plea voluntary or involuntary the plea of guilty?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5300.748,5308.143,"Well, I think the test has been yes whether or not the plea was voluntary but what is voluntary."
1969.153,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5308.143,5311.566,"Yes, exactly that's where the horse is buried, what is voluntary?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5342.899,5348.488,"With the all due difference Your Honor, I don't believe that that was the basis of the decision that all."
1969.153,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5398.343,5409.951,"I'd understood those other cases, at least the ones which I'm familiar, were posted on the proposition that the coercion continued up to and through the time of the plea."
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5409.951,5410.359,I don't think so.
1969.153,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5410.359,5420.535,Which is presenting quite different thing than a voluntary plea made in the light of the fact that there had been a confession it can be set aside.
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5420.535,5444.415,"But voluntary is the conclusion that we're all after and when you say voluntary plea, I must take exception with you because I think all you have in these cases are pleas of guilty and whether they're voluntary or they're presumptively voluntary, let's say because you have a presumption of regularity and the earmarks of voluntariness were there."
1969.153,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5491.473,5498.114,Doesn't it sometimes have something to do with what happened before he was arrested?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5505.128,5506.314,Well taking -- yes.
1969.153,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5506.314,5511.838,"Suppose you have -- suppose you have, this may seem a very elementary question, but it maybe needed to clear it up."
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5535.109,5535.909,No.
1969.153,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5535.909,5546.134,"By the facts he is compelled to come to the conclusion that he better take the best plea he can get, is he not?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5546.134,5548.555,"No, he has a perfectly free choice at that point."
1969.153,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5550.07,5554.857,What's the difference between the free choice in the one case than the other if you will?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5554.857,5565.247,"I can't see a free choice when you have an attorney, say in Richardson, the allegations were this."
1969.153,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5623.069,5627.292,"It turned out to be a very good advice, didn't it, so far as the Second Circuit held?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5627.292,5629.168,"Fortuitously only, Your Honor."
1969.153,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5630.44,5635.376,It wouldn't have mattered.
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5635.376,5640.061,It was -- you can't escape the fact that it was wrong advice at the time.
1969.153,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5664.737,5687.356,"Each one and then there was, Richardson as I understand it turned down the original offer of the guilty plea, opportunity to plead guilty to the greater charge and he negotiated plea was, a bargain was then made that he plead guilty to lesser your charge, lesser, lesser degree of the same offense, is that it?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5687.356,5693.268,The offer of a plea to lesser degree is not an uncommon offer in New York.
1969.153,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5693.268,5695.252,Or anywhere else.
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5695.252,5705.954,"Secondly, it could very well be that everything that Richardson says can -- just won't wash at a hearing."
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5724.871,5732.818,"Is there anything in the pleadings that says, that New York State was going to use that alleged confession?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5732.818,5739.604,"No, Your Honor and there's nothing in New York State's answers that say that they weren't."
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5739.604,5747.498,"You sought the kind of burden, aren't you?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5747.498,5748.2,These cases are little bit --
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5748.2,5749.665,Let me put it in another way.
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5764.931,5773.023,"Well, I believe that there is a -- well, at that stage --"
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5773.023,5780.071,Isn't it true that it doesn't become a constitutional right unless when it's presented as evidence?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5780.071,5782.575,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5782.575,5797.514,What right was violated when they beat him up to get a confession?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5797.514,5799.627,I will.
1969.153,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5807.339,5808.581,That's due process of law.
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5815.054,5825.434,You can have the policeman convicted or you can sue him for damages but what constitutional right is violated if the state never uses the alleged confession?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5825.434,5841.808,"But the point here is that if it was a motivating factor to induce a plea, the state had the benefit of that wrong its police officers committed in that back room of the station house."
1969.153,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5842.193,5848.457,Do you assume that a state was going to use evidence of violation of the Constitution?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5848.457,5850.576,I don't make the presumption one way or another.
1969.153,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5850.576,5853.122,"(Voice Overlap) I should think the presumption would have to be the other way, wouldn't it?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5853.122,5855.68,I'm sorry Your Honor I don't agree.
1969.153,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5869.669,5874.004,"Now, do you know how many cases there may have been when they didn't because that would never be a matter of record."
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5874.004,5914.583,"That's right and this is something that's pointed out that I think very cogently by Professor Oshiler (ph) in his University of Chicago Law Review article where he says that sometimes, compromised police are offered by the prosecution to cover up constitutional weaknesses in their case and I would think that the extent to which it could be shown by a petitioner that he was offered a plea to a lesser degree in his case because the prosecuting attorney was worried about the legality of his confession to that extent bad faith is present."
1969.153,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5914.583,5923.032,"But then when a close question, a choice is made, why is not that the end of it?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,5941.979,5950.326,"In these cases, I think the petitions themselves cry out as to why the choice is not final."
1969.153,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6090.298,6092.568,And what was the offense?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6092.568,6095.619,Robbery.
1969.153,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6095.619,6097.282,Larceny or burglary?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6097.282,6098.015,Robbery.
1969.153,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6098.015,6100.883,Robbery under the statutory.
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6100.883,6116.301,"Now, Williams also alleged that he told his attorney that he had an alibi defense and the attorney refused to raise at a trial were also as Mr. Juviler before pulled out of the thin air."
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6212.61,6217.941,What about the past statement that he did kill the woman?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6217.941,6219.851,"Now, this was Richardson, Your Honor."
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6219.873,6223.798,"Yes, what about that?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6223.798,6225.435,I think and I --
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6225.435,6239.867,"Before he went, you say the court has went that far, he said on the other day, yes I'm guilty and everything but then he says to a specific crime and he says yes, I did it."
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6239.867,6276.66,"If the confession was involuntary and if the confession was the reason that he made this in-court admission then that in-court admission is tainted and I think that here I must cite Harrison against United States where a similar kind of situation was considered because in that case, the defendant had made a confession which was introduced into two evidence at the first trial and the defendant took the stand in order to counter certain statements that were contained in the confession."
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6284.089,6291.524,We're not dealing with use in that statement except in a colloquy between you and me.
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6307.682,6315.63,"Well, it would be very difficult to say no after there is a confession and when you have an attorney who is not willing to --"
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6315.63,6317.169,But he could have said no.
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6317.169,6322.124,He could have said no and the house could have fallen on his head even harder than it did fall.
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6322.124,6323.031,It did happened.
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6329.599,6348.055,"In New York, that's really not so clear because New York has a couple of cases which hold that if inconsistent material comes out at the pleading then the judge does have a duty to make further inquiry."
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6348.055,6352.023,"Well, but he could've."
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6362.32,6375.944,I'm afraid that I can't make two compartments and say what happened in Court was respectable even though what happened out of Court immediately before it was not.
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6375.944,6392.136,"Well, would your submission be in trouble so far as I'm concerned if I can put it in two compartments, if I can?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6392.136,6411.217,"Well, if the in-court admission is going to be isolated from everything that happened before the statements in court were made, then no collateral attack upon the plea of guilty is possible."
1969.153,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6411.217,6448.906,"Suppose instead of just asking the question as was put here, did you commit the crime and getting an affirmative answer, suppose the trial judge taking the plea said, now tell me what you did and the defendant then related in great detail all of the circumstances, how to crime was planned and executed, would you say -- would you make the same arguments with reference to the possibility of an alleged coerced confession that you now do?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6448.906,6451.779,"Yes, Your Honor because it's --"
1969.153,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6451.779,6466.436,"In other words, then the issue does not have anything to do with guilt or innocence, but only with what led the man to decide to make the plea?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6466.436,6486.721,"No, guilt or innocence is relevant to a certain extent, but I don't think it's dispositive because in all cases where the voluntariness or the intelligent nature of a plea is considered, the allegation that a man is innocent to is not critical because we are arguing due process."
1969.153,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6486.721,6495.911,"You're now speaking though in the context of case towards being tried and the question of the use of the confession is involved, isn't that quite different when you come to a plea of guilty?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6495.911,6509.454,"No, Your Honor because a plea can be coerced even from a man who is guilty and in that -- in a such a case the Due Process Clause does not permit that plea to stand."
1969.153,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6553.91,6574.374,"How does that value to come in to play when the man has stood before the judge in open courtroom, and spent 15 minutes describing in detail how he committed the crime when there can be no possibility that a policeman or anyone else is going to beat him with the club in the presence of a judge?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6574.374,6604.947,"But if his freedom of choice has been removed, if he can make no other statement because of what happened to him before the plea was entered, then the in-court admission is as tainted as the out of court admission and I think that this I can only again cite to Harrison because I think this was the consideration which underlie the Harrison case."
1969.153,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6641.84,6650.126,"What was the evidence, state evidence on which you say it was a coerced plea?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6650.126,6651.527,A coerced plea?
1969.153,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6651.527,6656.379,"Yes, what was the evidence to support that?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6656.379,6666.322,"Well, in each of the three cases there were independent or separate allegations."
1969.153,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6666.322,6667.796,I'm not talking about the allegations.
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6670.221,6672.742,"I don't know, Your Honor because there has never been the hearing."
1969.153,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6677.702,6681.135,What was the allegation of coercion?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6681.135,6681.457,The allegation -- (Voice Overlap)
1969.153,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6681.457,6690.316,Mere existence of a fear that he might be convicted because of the coerced confession?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6690.316,6699.159,"Well, in -- the allegations vary from case to case because each case was brought separately."
1969.153,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6767.225,6778.274,"So, he put himself up to prove two separate statements, one was that he was beaten and coerced about beating and to a confession."
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6784.503,6798.038,No that his -- that his lawyer refused to do anything to prepare the case to take to the case to.
1969.153,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6798.038,6803.923,Did he say that the charge that he'd made anything complain about his lawyer in court?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6803.923,6815.136,"No, there was no allegation about the complaint but the Mr. Justice Black, this is -- the complaints to court are really the exception rather than the rule."
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6825.635,6840.882,"Well, isn't it true that about what percentage of your people that come to legal aid complain about ineffective counsel, including legal aid, what percentage, about 90, isn't it?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6840.882,6843.226,"Oh, I wouldn't think so, Your Honor."
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6843.226,6849.113,"Well, if the petitions filed in the Southern District about how many complains ineffective counsel?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6849.113,6854.061,I haven't seen at that often and I've been --
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6854.061,6863.949,"Where is and if in order to sustain your position, do we have to say that charge of ineffective counsel of itself will get this relief?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6863.949,6864.693,"No, not a charge."
1969.153,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6867.963,6873.104,What it is that he didn't do anything is rather conclusory?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6873.104,6888.367,"Well, that there was -- here you have a ten-minute conference taking the allegations on their face un-controverted an allegation of a ten-minute conference between an attorney and a client in a capital case and there are at least --"
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6888.367,6897.04,"Do you have any doubt that was told to any judge in New York State, he would have given a continuance?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6899.452,6903.168,But yet you have a case in the Ninth Circuit where the same thing happened.
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6911.881,6915.014,I'm talking about New York.
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6925.662,6944.916,But still and no complaint was made and possibly at a hearing the fact that no complaint was made might be considered dispositive either of the truth or falsity of the defendant's allegations afterwards or may not but that's something to be considered at a hearing.
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6944.916,6947.225,Was that litigated in New York Courts?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6947.225,6947.86,I beg your pardon?
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6947.86,6951.082,Was it litigated into post-conviction in New York Courts?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6951.082,6954.323,There was never a hearing in anyone of these three cases in the New York Courts?
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6954.323,6956.051,Was it alleged?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6956.051,6965.963,"Yes it was, I believe all of these allega -- all of these claims were alleged and Mr. Juviler's bringing in exhaustion of state remedies on oral argument."
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6965.963,6969.118,You believe it but is it here in the record?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6970.111,6970.587,"Yes, Your Honor."
1969.153,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6970.587,6973.72,What happened in the New York Courts?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6973.72,6983.799,That there were post-conviction -- that there were post-conviction remedies sought probably coram nobis in all cases.
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6983.799,6985.76,"Well, are the papers here?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6985.76,6987.132,"No, Your Honor."
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6991.776,6994.363,"Well, you could have, couldn't you?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,6994.363,7001.747,"Your Honor, we were assigned in the Circuit Court of Appeals at which point the record was fixed."
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7001.747,7004.024,You didn't make any effort to get that?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,7004.024,7005.21,"No, Your Honor."
1969.153,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,7005.21,7012.606,"So, if we want to see it, we'll have to go find to what?"
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,7012.606,7019.805,The papers were not before the District Court and that's the way the cases came up.
1969.153,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7019.805,7022.868,Are all three charged with the same crime?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,7022.868,7023.916,"No, Your Honor."
1969.153,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7023.916,7025.13,Separate crimes?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,7025.13,7026.324,"Separate crime, Richardson --"
1969.153,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7026.324,7028.034,Separate places?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,7028.034,7028.583,Yes.
1969.153,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7028.583,7031.489,Separate times?
1969.153,2,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,7037.692,7040.365,"No, Your Honor."
1969.153,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7095.218,7097.492,"Thank you, Mrs. Oberman."
1969.153,3,36102,michael_r_juviler,,7097.492,7107.041,"As Mrs. Oberman says, it's very difficult to assess the competency of counsel and it's rarely required that a federal court do so."
1969.153,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7118.027,7119.084,What was it --
1969.153,3,36102,michael_r_juviler,,7119.084,7135.513,"If Mr. Williams attorney had attempted to base an alibi defense at trial on his client's fingerprint record, then the attorney would have come to the attention of the appellate division long before that divorce case."
1969.153,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,7194.902,7196.886,What was he charged for admitting?
1969.153,3,36102,michael_r_juviler,,7196.886,7223.012,"He was charged with stabbing to death two people at the same time, and he admits in his motion papers before this Court that the police knew that three men had seen him in the company of the deceased pair before they started an altercation which led to their death."
1969.153,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7336.049,7339.348,"That was not in New York City or the state, is that Buffalo or what?"
1969.153,3,36102,michael_r_juviler,,7339.348,7341.997,"No, that was New York County."
1969.153,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7341.997,7343.221,Richardson I thought was --
1969.153,3,36102,michael_r_juviler,,7343.221,7343.917,"Yes, New York County."
1969.153,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7343.917,7345.055,-- in the northern district?
1969.153,3,36102,michael_r_juviler,,7345.055,7349.013,"No, Richardson -- the petition was in the Northern District."
1969.153,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7349.013,7350.541,Because that's where he was incarcerated.
1969.153,3,36102,michael_r_juviler,,7350.541,7351.639,That's right.
1969.153,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7351.639,7353.231,"I think your time is up, Mr. Juviler."
1969.153,3,36102,michael_r_juviler,,7353.231,7354.089,Thank you.
1969.153,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7354.089,7355.952,Thank you for you submission.
1969.153,4,25856,gretchen_white_oberman,,7370.844,7371.513,Thank you.
1969.153,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7371.513,7373.363,Counsel we thank you.
