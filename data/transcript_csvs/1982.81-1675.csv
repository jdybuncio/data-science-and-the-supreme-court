1982.81-1675,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.237,We will hear arguments next in the case of Kush versus Rutledge.
1982.81-1675,0,35900,michael_l_gallagher,,68.56,69.544,Thank you.
1982.81-1675,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,201.481,205.266,"Mr. Gallagher, I would like to get a time sequence straight if I could."
1982.81-1675,0,35900,michael_l_gallagher,,213.039,230.75,"Justice Rehnquist, this complaint in this lawsuit alleges that from the time Mr. Rutledge filed his claim against the Arizona State University Board of Regents, which was prior to the initiation of any suit, and continuing the conspiracy supposedly went on."
1982.81-1675,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,245.51,249.045,Did the federal court case go to trial on the merits?
1982.81-1675,0,35900,michael_l_gallagher,,249.045,251.497,"No, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-1675,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,253.03,258.568,"Well then, the only case in which there could have been witnesses would I'm sure be the state court case."
1982.81-1675,0,35900,michael_l_gallagher,,258.568,281.183,"My understanding of what the Ninth Circuit found in that regard, Justice Rehnquist, was that the language in the complaint, the continuing language, if you would, if you will, suggested that there was intimidation of witnesses going on after the federal court case had been filed."
1982.81-1675,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,281.183,284.635,"Well, but there are no witnesses in a case until the case has been tried."
1982.81-1675,0,35900,michael_l_gallagher,,286.503,295.943,"Well, that raises the next question, Justice Rehnquist, as to how broad 1985(1) as to what is a pending action."
1982.81-1675,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,324.093,327.462,Have there been any proceedings on remand in the district court?
1982.81-1675,0,35900,michael_l_gallagher,,327.462,329.764,"There have not been, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-1675,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,486.199,494.055,"Mr. Gallagher, why do you think the Congress in 1871 did not include the equal protection language in the first clause?"
1982.81-1675,0,35900,michael_l_gallagher,,494.055,505.446,"I think, Your Honor, that they were not thinking about federal courts as much as they were thinking about state courts."
1982.81-1675,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,582.113,588.117,"Well, to assure constitutionality in its application to the states, right?"
1982.81-1675,0,35900,michael_l_gallagher,,588.117,589.05,"--I would agree with that, yes, Justice O'Connor."
1982.81-1675,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,896.767,899.136,Could I ask you a question?
1982.81-1675,0,35900,michael_l_gallagher,,899.136,900.202,"Surely, Justice White."
1982.81-1675,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,900.202,905.623,You indicated that the state trial did go forward and was completed?
1982.81-1675,0,35900,michael_l_gallagher,,905.623,906.242,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-1675,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,906.242,912.979,And is part of your claim that any federal issue is res judicata?
1982.81-1675,0,35900,michael_l_gallagher,,912.979,924.786,"I don't think, in all candor, we can go far enough, Justice White, to claim that they are all barred, because in truth and in fact a lot of the underlying facts were presented to a jury."
1982.81-1675,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,926.686,931.607,But couldn't all these claims in federal court have been presented in the state proceeding?
1982.81-1675,0,35900,michael_l_gallagher,,931.607,944.331,"--They could have been had the state court judge presumably not dismissed the 1985(2) count on, number one, the ground it was barred by res judicata, and number two that it failed to state a claim."
1982.81-1675,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,949.069,957.84,Didn't the federal court... didn't the federal court... didn't the Court of Appeals remand to the district court to see whether any claim survived the state action?
1982.81-1675,0,35900,michael_l_gallagher,,957.84,965.78,"Yes, and the state action had gone to verdict by the time the Ninth Circuit remanded, and there have been no further--"
1982.81-1675,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,965.78,974.136,"Well, it could be that... it could be that the district court will decide that the entire matter is res judicata."
1982.81-1675,0,35900,michael_l_gallagher,,974.136,976.219,"--I think it may well, Justice White."
1982.81-1675,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,976.219,979.254,"Well, so we're just whistling in the breeze."
1982.81-1675,0,35900,michael_l_gallagher,,979.254,984.289,"Well, there's no indication, of course, what the district court's going to do."
1982.81-1675,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,984.289,984.789,All right.
1982.81-1675,0,35900,michael_l_gallagher,,985.072,985.741,Thank you.
1982.81-1675,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,985.741,993.145,Mr. Hing.
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,993.145,998.982,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1675,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1043.577,1046.546,Do you say the actual intimidation occurred then?
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,1049.898,1052.483,"No, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-1675,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1056.754,1063.908,"But witnesses in what proceeding did it claim was intimidated, or were intimidated?"
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,1063.908,1067.21,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in the federal court proceeding."
1982.81-1675,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1067.21,1073.966,How could you determine whether... who were witnesses in the federal court proceeding if there had been no trial?
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,1073.966,1082.536,"Your Honor, let me explain factually how this occurred, which I think would shed some light on it."
1982.81-1675,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1127.516,1133.087,"Well, perhaps my concern can be solved right there."
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,1143.96,1155.168,"Yes, Mr. Rehnquist, I believe it does, because at the point that the action was filed we immediately noticed depositions."
1982.81-1675,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1224.514,1226.064,"Could you explain, Mr. Hing, what happened?"
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,1232.718,1235.17,--And included the--
1982.81-1675,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1235.17,1237.403,To include this allegation--
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,1237.403,1240.288,--allegation under Section 1985.
1982.81-1675,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1240.288,1247.727,"--And then how did the state cause of action develop, and did the state cause of action include this same allegation?"
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,1247.727,1266.439,"What happened, Justice O'Connor, was that the federal action was subsequently dismissed in its entirety by the federal district court on the ground that the court had no Jurisdiction over any of the parties based on the Eleventh Amendment."
1982.81-1675,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1283.567,1286.102,That included this claim.
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,1286.102,1289.637,We did include the 1985 claim.
1982.81-1675,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1311.484,1315.372,"And in fact you may never, notwithstanding what we do, is that right?"
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,1315.372,1362.186,"--Well, Justice O'Connor, my assumption is that we will have a day in court on not only the 1985 claim, but depending on what happens on the appeal in the state court action we may very well have a day in court in the federal court on all of the claims, for the simple reason that the Plaintiff made a decision long ago that he wanted to try this case in the federal court, and for very good reasons, and that is that there was a strong prejudice against the Defendant locally."
1982.81-1675,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1478.894,1481.429,"Mr. Hing, do we have the complaint here anyplace?"
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,1481.429,1482.979,--Yes.
1982.81-1675,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1488.666,1494.07,"Well, I have an appendix here that has nothing, and I mean nothing."
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,1498.806,1505.212,It is part of the appendix to the Petitioner's brief.
1982.81-1675,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1505.212,1505.728,I see.
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,1513.315,1536.314,But the enabling or the section of the statute which creates the private rights says the party so injured or deprived may have an action for the recovery of damage occasioned by such injury or deprivation against any one or more of the conspirators.
1982.81-1675,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1712.244,1714.779,"But that is a crime, isn't it?"
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,1719.849,1721.199,"Your Honor, that is."
1982.81-1675,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1721.199,1722.884,--Can you enjoin a crime?
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,1722.884,1727.772,I do not believe so.
1982.81-1675,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2254.381,2263.737,"Well, the Court... of course, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, they thought that they were deciding contrary to the Fifth and the Eighth Circuit."
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,2263.737,2272.343,"Your Honor, I believe they were, but I don't think an examination of the precise claim that each plaintiff was advancing--"
1982.81-1675,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2272.343,2279.413,"Well, the Court of Appeals below was wrong in saying that they were in conflict with the Fifth and the Eighth."
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,2279.413,2280.313,"--Your Honor, I believe they were."
1982.81-1675,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2280.313,2280.865,"Yes, all right."
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,2280.865,2298.493,"And I believe that the First Circuit and the Third Circuit and the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, of course, were correct in their decisions."
1982.81-1675,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2404.727,2415.499,"You would agree, then, that if a complaint were not yet filed in federal court there could be no claim that potential witnesses in a later to be filed lawsuit were intimidated?"
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,2415.499,2430.426,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that could be possible if the plaintiff were so sure that witnesses were already being intimidated and he had every intention of filing that lawsuit in the federal court."
1982.81-1675,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2431.045,2433.747,"How would you define ""witness"" in that broader sense?"
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,2436.699,2459.195,"--Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I believe that a witness under those circumstances would involve potential witnesses, because theoretically I think it would be rather hypertechnical to take the position that you really don't have a witness until you go to trial and call him."
1982.81-1675,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2459.195,2466.218,"Well, but isn't the harm which Congress sought to avoid here the harm to the functioning of the federal courts?"
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,2479.109,2483.728,"Well, under those conditions, Justice Rehnquist, I would agree."
1982.81-1675,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2563.43,2573.653,"If you have an assault case, can't you say in almost any assault case that the person assaulted was a member of a class who didn't meet the standards of the person who assaulted them?"
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,2573.653,2581.593,"--Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that... in that context I would agree with you."
1982.81-1675,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2676.519,2678.554,"Counselor, I have to ask you."
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,2697.931,2704.502,"--In the complaint with respect to this particular claim, the 1985 claim?"
1982.81-1675,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2704.502,2708.304,With respect to the case you're asking us to decide.
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,2708.304,2722.964,That appears on paragraph 56 of the complaint.
1982.81-1675,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2722.964,2728.701,And where will I find that in anything that's here before me?
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,2728.701,2739.258,I believe that's Appendix E-11 of the petition for a writ of certiorari.
1982.81-1675,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2739.258,2739.825,E-11?
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,2741.96,2743.46,E-11.
1982.81-1675,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2743.46,2744.579,"Oh, that's it."
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,2748.031,2750.4,Right.
1982.81-1675,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2750.4,2755.185,"Well, this is some pleading I never understood in my life."
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,2768.778,2770.814,Basically.
1982.81-1675,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2770.814,2771.847,"Oh, except interest."
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,2771.847,2787.339,"Basically, the situation was such that it was necessary to get rid of certain players, and under NCAA regulations you could not get rid of a player for any athletic reason."
1982.81-1675,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2851.266,2854.384,"Counsel, your time has expired."
1982.81-1675,1,39418,robert_ong_hing,,2854.384,2864.406,--We respectfully submit that the decision of the Court of Appeals be affirmed.
1982.81-1675,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2864.406,2870.393,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Gallagher?"
1982.81-1675,2,35900,michael_l_gallagher,,2870.393,2873.076,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, very, very briefly:"
1982.81-1675,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2917.957,2919.624,"Thank you, gentlemen."
