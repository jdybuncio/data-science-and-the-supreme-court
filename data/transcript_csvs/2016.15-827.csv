2016.15-827,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.47,"We'll hear argument this -- this morning in Case No. 15-827, Endrew F. v. Douglas County School District. Mr. Fisher."
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,9.47,20.66,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The IDEA does not permit a school district to provide a child with a disability a barely more than de minimis educational benefit."
2016.15-827,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,43.07,60.35,"Well, it also -- it also didn't appear anywhere in the original petition, did it? I'm looking at Footnote 8 in your -- your opening brief where you note that substantial educational benefit was the standard that was discussed in the petition and then a significantly different one in your -- your opening brief."
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,60.35,63.37,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we don't intend it to be significantly different."
2016.15-827,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,68.83,76.555,"The standard -- the standard you're asking us to adopt, substantially equal opportunity, that does appear someplace."
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,102.69,111.56,"Justice Ginsburg, yes, Justice Blackmun proposed a standard similar to the one that we offered the Court today, but that was 1982."
2016.15-827,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,123.29,125.95,"Well, that raises a concern under the Spending Clause."
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,150.14,151.73,"No, I don't think it does."
2016.15-827,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,232.465,233.1,How does that work?
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,233.1,233.475,Then --
2016.15-827,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,233.475,233.9,I'm sorry.
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,248.26,248.41,Right.
2016.15-827,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,248.41,256.215,"-- where we were dealing with someone with a particular disability, but one that was rather readily and easily addressed."
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,256.215,256.96,Uh-huh.
2016.15-827,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,256.96,258.69,Here you have a very different context.
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,265.83,270.165,"Most likely not all the way up to grade level in this case, Mr. Chief Justice."
2016.15-827,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,383.16,412.74,"I suppose -- I suppose it's implicit in your standards and in some of the provisions you read that what we're talking about is the word ""reasonable"" that we see throughout the law. Do -- do you see any -- any function for that word and, in addition, as part of what reasonable is, is there any place to discuss the cost that the -- would -- would be incurred for, say, severely disabled students?"
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,412.74,420.23,"Let me answer both reasonableness first and cost second. So reasonableness, yes, is an essential feature of the Act."
2016.15-827,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,522.56,527.83,"Mr. -- Mr. Fisher, the tab here is -- is at $70,000 tuition?"
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,527.83,533.45,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, at the time this case was litigated, it was more like $40,000 in the private school."
2016.15-827,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,549.35,555.69,"And in your -- in your position, what -- in your view, what should have been done for this student?"
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,555.69,569.33,The first and most important thing that should have been done is what's known as a behavioral assessment should have taken place to figure out why Drew's behaviors were so dramatically interfering with his education.
2016.15-827,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,617.84,629.795,"Weren't they going to -- what -- the -- the conference that the parents didn't attend, they had scheduled a conference, and I thought a behavioral expert was part of that conference."
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,629.795,631.8,"So there were two conferences, Justice Ginsburg."
2016.15-827,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,701.5,724.815,"Why didn't the -- why didn't the -- the statement that an IEP, what it has to do is it has to, based on peer-reviewed research, when practicable, will -- will be provided to the child to advance appropriately towards attaining the annual goals to make progress in the general education curriculum and so forth."
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,754.71,755.19,Yeah.
2016.15-827,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,755.19,769.27,"Besides having nine people who don't know -- I mean, at least speaking for myself -- don't know that much about it, creating a new standard out of legal materials which are at a distance from the people, the children and the parents, who need help."
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,769.27,785.68,So I think the critical reason why the Court in Rowley itself gestured towards needing the need for a overall standard that encapsulates the Act and the reason why we ask for it here today is that you will find in every brief in this case -- our brief --
2016.15-827,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,785.68,785.795,Uh-huh.
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,785.795,793.405,"-- the red brief, their amicus briefs -- everyone agrees that school districts, I believe -- this is at page 29 and 47 of my friend's brief."
2016.15-827,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,802.385,804.11,"Well, I'm sorry if it doesn't happen."
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,832.05,832.17,Yes.
2016.15-827,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,832.47,840.94,I foresee taking the money that ought to go to the children and spending it on lawsuits and lawyers and all kinds of things that are extraneous.
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,842.41,842.67,Right.
2016.15-827,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,892.83,901.175,"Well, suppose we have a child who is a handicapped child, there's a range of people, and they can't do much for them, but they can do something for them."
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,904.12,904.765,Uh-huh.
2016.15-827,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,904.765,912.18,"But if you, say, measure that in terms of their ability to progress from grade to grade, maybe some will; some won't."
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,924.49,941.91,"At bottom, we agree that there's flexibility in the Act to accommodate each child's individual potential and needs. But if I could just give a full answer to your question, we think that it would be fine if the Court just said the IEP should be tailored to achieve in a general educational curriculum at grade level for most kids."
2016.15-827,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,954.945,955.45,How so --
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,955.45,956.31,-- way of putting it.
2016.15-827,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,956.31,959.3,"It makes a big difference whether you take the word ""equal"" out though."
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,962.68,963.26,"Well, it might --"
2016.15-827,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,963.26,963.52,Isn't that --
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,963.52,967.815,"It might be, Justice Alito, I'm describing what it means to provide an equal educational opportunity."
2016.15-827,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,969.95,979.445,"Well, I understand what an equal outcome would be, but I don't understand what an equal opportunity means when an equal outcome is not practical."
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,979.445,998.33,What it means is that you give the -- so when you're dealing with a child who cannot get to grade level -- I think that's what you're asking -- what it means -- and this is in a 2005 guidance document by the Department of Education -- what it means is you're giving children with disabilities equally challenging curriculum on the academic side and in terms of their functional and -- functional and developmental goals.
2016.15-827,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,998.33,998.8,But for those --
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,998.8,1006.55,The standard -- I would just say the standard is highest possible standards achievable directly in the text of the statute.
2016.15-827,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1006.55,1013.76,"But for those of us who have some feeling that the word ""equality"" is a poor fit for this statute and its focus on individuation --"
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1013.76,1014.755,Uh-huh.
2016.15-827,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1014.755,1023.15,-- what would you say to those of us? How would you describe what you think is required without focusing on equality?
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1023.15,1035.63,"I would say just what the Court said in Rowley for the -- for the typical child with a disability who can achieve at grade level, which is the standard that the school district has to try to meet, is progress in the general educational curriculum --"
2016.15-827,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1035.63,1036.26,But we're dealing here --
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1036.26,1036.66,-- at grade level.
2016.15-827,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1036.66,1038.2,We're dealing here with a child who --
2016.15-827,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1038.2,1052.77,"And then -- and then dealing with a child who's not going to get there equally challenging or, Justice Kagan, I would say alternate achievement benchmarks, to use exactly the words in the standards, that are the highest possible achievable by the student."
2016.15-827,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1060.51,1077.365,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Gornstein."
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1684.785,1690.24,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: To prevail, my friends have to overcome three different things."
2016.15-827,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1720.27,1735.095,"What did you -- what we were told by Mr. Fisher, I think he was referring to 79A of the government's appendix."
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1735.095,1743.02,"So he has two different arguments, Justice Ginsburg, about -- about the changes to the amendments."
2016.15-827,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1778.72,1786.355,But the procedural standards certainly are the measure by which a court can determine whether or not the procedures were adequate.
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1786.355,1788.36,"Absolutely, Justice Kennedy. We agree."
2016.15-827,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1788.36,1792.18,Then why doesn't that automatically make these part of the standards?
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1792.18,1794.11,We -- we do think it makes them part of the standards.
2016.15-827,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1803.51,1806.09,"Well, do you agree that the procedures have to meet these standards?"
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1806.09,1806.895,Absolutely.
2016.15-827,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1810.7,1813.89,Then I don't understand your disagreement with Mr. Fisher.
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1813.89,1822.28,"Well, it's -- it's very large. That is, we think that these are -- a procedural checklist, and it's a detailed and exhaustive one, to be sure, Justice Kennedy, after --"
2016.15-827,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1822.28,1826.78,But -- but are -- are not the procedures subject to judicial review to see that the procedures were followed?
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1826.78,1829.07,"Absolutely, Justice Kennedy. We agree with that."
2016.15-827,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1848.27,1851.71,"But the procedures, as I'm sure you'll agree, is geared towards something."
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1895.09,1895.345,Correct.
2016.15-827,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1895.345,1899.09,So that's what the dispute is ultimately going to be about.
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1917.945,1920.33,"Justice Kagan, we don't disagree with a lot of what you said."
2016.15-827,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1946.05,1951.22,"But your substantive standard is so low, is so easy to meet, and then you justify that."
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,1967.105,1969.61,So we disagree in two different respects.
2016.15-827,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2009.16,2019.685,"It says ""some benefit,"" but you're -- you're reading it as saying ""some benefit,"" and the other side is reading it as saying ""some benefit,"" and you know that -- (Laughter.)"
2016.15-827,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2019.685,2020.9,And it makes a difference.
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2050.2,2059.49,"Well, our position is Rowley doesn't say that it's got to be grade-level progress. Rather, it says that you've got the -- the word ""appropriate"" -- this is footnote 21 -- reflects --"
2016.15-827,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2059.49,2060.155,The -- the --
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2060.155,2072.0,"-- reflects, quote, ""Its recognition that some settings simply are not suitable environments for the participation of some handicapped children,"" not as a term of art which concisely expresses the standard found by the lower court's equality standard."
2016.15-827,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2097.2,2100.025,"You don't think ""some benefit"" is ambiguous?"
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2100.025,2117.34,"Well, I think that there's a little bit of ambiguity in that, but I think it's a lot easier to administer that question because the question -- you know, Justice Ginsburg, let's just say, this is the way ordinary English works. If I have a duty to benefit you, Justice Ginsburg, if I give you no benefit, I think courts can easily review that."
2016.15-827,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2124.47,2126.925,But I think it doesn't say it's more than de minimis.
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2126.925,2128.1,"Exactly, but that can't be --"
2016.15-827,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2128.1,2128.73,So what is it?
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2128.73,2131.25,That can't be -- just to finish that -- that -- that thought.
2016.15-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2142.41,2148.3,"Where is it? As I see one way of looking at what we're doing, two things have occurred."
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2226.1,2227.54,"So, Justice Breyer, three things."
2016.15-827,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2271.69,2288.91,"But would you agree with at least the courts should say that the formulation more than de minimis sets the level too low, and that's -- that's the formula that was used at levels here."
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2288.91,2290.8,"And, Justice Ginsburg, we disagree with that."
2016.15-827,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2301.33,2304.41,So you're -- you're equating some benefit to more than --
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2304.41,2305.49,More than de minimis.
2016.15-827,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2338.41,2355.76,"But, Mr. Katyal, let's say -- let's say that during the school year, the school districts -- district sends someone to work with the particular student in this case, and they send her there for two weeks, you know, she goes around."
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2365.84,2366.36,It does not.
2016.15-827,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2379.66,2379.87,Okay.
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2383.455,2388.8,"And -- and -- and, you know, five minutes a day, I think, wouldn't meet the de minimis standard."
2016.15-827,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2393.95,2398.885,"Well, I guess it depends on whether somebody can tell us at some point whether it's beneficial."
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2417.19,2418.95,"Mr. Chief Justice, I'm saying two different things."
2016.15-827,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2441.51,2447.09,"Yeah, but you're putting a lot -- you're assuming that the procedural process will yield significant results."
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2463.54,2469.4,"I -- I am assuming that it is in general going to work, which is what Rowley itself said at page 206 of its opinion."
2016.15-827,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2492.2,2492.6,It's not exact --
2016.15-827,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2492.6,2502.79,"You'll have to excuse me, I'm not sure I understood your answer to the Chief Justice. He -- he had a hypothetical where you have the hearing, the hearing makes a recommendation, recommendation not followed."
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2503.585,2504.71,If the recommend --
2016.15-827,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2504.71,2507.9,"And -- and then I thought I heard you say, well, the procedure we followed, that's good enough."
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2507.9,2509.31,If -- if -- I might have misunderstood.
2016.15-827,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2553.32,2554.92,"So where do you get ""some benefit"" from?"
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2554.92,2558.03,I get it from Rowley itself at page 200 which says that --
2016.15-827,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2558.03,2559.34,"What do you do with ""meaningful"" --"
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2559.34,2560.05,"So ""meaningful"" --"
2016.15-827,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2560.05,2561.29,-- that was in Rowley itself?
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2561.29,2563.21,"So ""meaningful"" was not actually in Rowley."
2016.15-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2581.02,2581.2,All right.
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2581.2,2581.9,So that's what we have --
2016.15-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2581.9,2583.555,That's what we have -- we have now.
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2596.16,2597.205,"""Some benefit."""
2016.15-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2597.205,2600.465,You could say some benefit or you could say some benefit.
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2600.465,2600.635,Yeah.
2016.15-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2600.635,2601.01,All right.
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2602.785,2603.08,Yes.
2016.15-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2603.08,2608.155,"And as you pointed out, most courts have interpreted what I think is the correct thing, they said benefit."
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2624.49,2624.96,"Well, first --"
2016.15-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2624.96,2639.88,"-- simply to take that word from the IEP, which is enforceable anyway, and say, look at these two words of ambiguity, and we think we should interpret them in light of the IEP requirements, which are pretty close to what the SG suggests?"
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2639.88,2648.07,"But, Justice Breyer, I don't think that there was some problem in the lower courts. They're not citing cases that show that there's some parade of horribles akin to the hypotheticals --"
2016.15-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2648.07,2648.215,Uh-huh.
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2648.215,2649.0,-- that we've heard.
2016.15-827,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2690.33,2695.54,What is frustrating about this case and about this statute is that we have a blizzard of words.
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2696.475,2696.82,Right.
2016.15-827,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2696.82,2701.835,"-- read them literally, it's not clear to me that they mean anything different. Now, ""progress"" benefit."
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2729.6,2738.47,"Well, we think that you should look to what Rowley did here, which is to say the word is ""some benefit."" And that actually follows from the text of the statute itself."
2016.15-827,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2750.84,2753.15,"What is the difference between ""some benefit"" and ""significant""?"
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2753.15,2779.69,"I think it's quite large; that is, you know -- you know, I think it's straightforward. So, you know, basically, I think, you know, if -- if the Court is to ask whether there is some benefit, as I was saying to Justice Ginsburg in my hypothetical, you know, that's a pretty easy question, is, have I benefited? Has the school district benefited? But once we start getting beyond that to ""significant,"" the Court has to ask both: Was there some benefit and then was that benefit significant? And I can imagine --"
2016.15-827,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2779.69,2780.05,It didn't just say --
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2780.05,2781.35,-- a variety of views about what is significant.
2016.15-827,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2781.35,2798.62,"It didn't just say ""some benefit."" It said that that benefit would normally allow the -- a student with the disability to keep up with his peers in a different grade. Now, as soon as they say that, you appreciate that you're dealing with more than just some benefit."
2016.15-827,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2801.315,2805.91,"Significant -- ""significant,"" ""meaningful,"" whatever."
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2818.12,2821.64,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that's what Rowley said when it used grade to grade."
2016.15-827,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2835.54,2861.23,"Well, how does your position, Mr. Katyal -- you have a passage in your brief on page 47 which says, ""An IEP must have the goal of advancing a child in the general education curriculum and, to the extent possible, enable her to be educated in the school's regular classes."" And, to me, that sounds exactly like what the chief justice just said, that an IEP has to be reasonably calculated to do those things."
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2864.965,2870.89,"So I think, again, it's just a procedural guarantee that they have to think about and consider grade-level progress."
2016.15-827,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2872.88,2873.31,That's wrong.
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2892.63,2893.86,"But I don't think so, Justice Kagan."
2016.15-827,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2914.7,2914.95,But if we --
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2914.95,2915.31,But you wouldn't --
2016.15-827,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2915.31,2918.63,"-- consider all of them and we do none of them, that's just fine?"
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2918.63,2923.37,"That's -- well, the Congress's judgment was the process -- and this is something that happens in NEPA --"
2016.15-827,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2923.37,2926.26,So your answer to Justice Kagan is yes.
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,2928.735,2929.05,No.
2016.15-827,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3018.87,3019.59,And what I'm --
2016.15-827,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3019.59,3029.225,"One -- one aspect of -- of your position is you say yes, there is a substantive standard, some benefit."
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3043.7,3044.02,Correct.
2016.15-827,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3044.02,3049.61,So some with bite and more than de minimis don't sound like equivalence to me.
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3049.61,3060.11,"I think they are, and I think that's what the -- circuit after circuit has said, which is that some educational benefit, the language at page 200, means more -- more than de minimis."
2016.15-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3081.46,3093.755,"We get that -- I mean, how does this actually work? I thought there is a statute in 1414 before that, it says you have to, school district, write an IEP."
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3132.35,3132.63,Absolutely.
2016.15-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3132.7,3132.79,Okay.
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3132.79,3134.05,"-- if there is a statement, the key word --"
2016.15-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3134.05,3136.39,So they have to write something that's minimally --
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3136.39,3136.92,-- is statement.
2016.15-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3136.92,3140.175,"Now, let's suppose they write it, but they don't do it."
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3140.175,3140.835,Yes.
2016.15-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3140.835,3143.83,"Now, isn't there something saying you have to follow the IEP?"
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3143.83,3144.45,Correct.
2016.15-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3144.45,3145.895,"And so, again, they go to court?"
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3145.895,3146.48,Correct.
2016.15-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3147.22,3148.91,And what they -- again they say they didn't follow the IEP?
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3148.91,3150.36,"Correct, Justice Breyer."
2016.15-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3157.64,3164.26,But they do have to provide something that makes progress in the general education curriculum and --
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3164.26,3166.87,They have to follow the checklist that is a statement --
2016.15-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3166.87,3167.88,-- and advance appropriately --
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3167.88,3168.14,Yes.
2016.15-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3169.39,3169.645,-- towards a --
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3169.645,3174.11,-- yes. I think everyone agrees you don't look at outcomes or anything like that.
2016.15-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3176.29,3177.03,It's procedurally calculated.
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3177.03,3181.18,"It's just the same as Rowley. Rowley -- you know, we're not saying anything different than what Rowley said."
2016.15-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3181.18,3181.69,I don't know.
2016.15-827,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3191.51,3192.57,Some -- some benefit.
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3192.57,3193.43,Some educational benefit.
2016.15-827,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3193.43,3198.085,"Some educational benefit. If you say ""some,"" this is inconsistent with Rowley."
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3198.085,3198.98,"Well, I don't think so."
2016.15-827,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3204.74,3205.47,Mr. Katyal --
2016.15-827,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3205.47,3232.95,"Mr. Katyal, are there -- in the wake of the many years this Act has been enforced and these many individual meetings, have there been documented areas of consensus as to certain standards, certain methodologies, certain systems that work and certain that don't? And do the courts, in reviewing these proceedings, ever refer to those?"
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3232.95,3238.69,"So I think that's where the amici briefs are so important, because they show -- say that education isn't really one of those areas."
2016.15-827,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3243.88,3245.37,So we've gone -- so we've gone nowhere.
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3245.37,3253.95,"Well, I don't think we've gone nowhere, but I think that worry is to thrust courts into the business of deciding which philosophy is appropriate. And take Firefly, for --"
2016.15-827,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3253.95,3262.26,"So you say that there is generally no consensus as to appropriate methodologies for, say, a hearing-impaired student, an autistic student."
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3263.47,3265.54,I don't mean to say that there's no agreement.
2016.15-827,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3305.42,3318.39,"Mr. Katyal, can you go back to Justice Ginsburg's question that I'm a bit confused of -- about for the same reason. You said something like, well, this -- this standard is -- is being applied with bite."
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3322.455,3327.37,"We favor the standard that Rowley said, which lower courts have done for 34 years, which does have --"
2016.15-827,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3327.37,3328.6,Do you favor a standard with bite?
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3328.6,3329.45,It does have some bite.
2016.15-827,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3330.31,3336.46,"Would that be ""some bite"" or ""somebite""? (Laughter.)"
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3336.46,3340.66,It is some educational benefit. That's the language of Rowley.
2016.15-827,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3342.89,3351.39,"Well, again, if somebody said to you, write a stature with -- write a standard with bite, I doubt you would come up with the words ""more than merely de minimis."""
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3351.39,3357.2,"Well, but again, I think, Justice Kagan, Congress's bite, the substantive bite is only at the back end."
2016.15-827,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3361.18,3363.28,But the back end is what this case is all about.
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3363.28,3363.8,I understand that.
2016.15-827,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3363.8,3364.67,We are at the back end.
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3364.67,3383.08,"But -- but, Justice Kagan, don't take the policy concerns about the hypotheticals and other things to try and re-jigger the back end. Congress's handiwork was to say it's the procedural protections shining a light, the IEP process with highly incentivized teachers and -- teachers and parents that's generally going to yield the right result."
2016.15-827,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3385.53,3395.78,We're going to have to use musical notation to -- and not just words -- to express the -- the idea that seems to be emerging.
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3420.63,3421.09,I would.
2016.15-827,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3433.78,3438.41,"That sounds very harsh. What's the origin of this phrase, ""more than de minimis""? Who thought this up?"
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3438.41,3441.08,"Well, it goes back to Latin. And so again, we, you know --"
2016.15-827,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3441.08,3444.015,"I know where ""de minimis"" comes from. (Laughter.)"
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3444.015,3444.72,"No, no, no."
2016.15-827,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3454.54,3458.21,But who -- who decided to apply it here in this context?
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3458.21,3464.63,"Well, I think the Court in -- in Rowley, then Justice Rehnquist's opinion, invoked that by talking about some benefit."
2016.15-827,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3468.635,3478.46,"Who -- who put the term, ""more than merely de minimis""? That's the formula that we're -- that you are espousing."
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3478.46,3478.85,Yes.
2016.15-827,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3478.99,3480.97,"And de minimis is not enough, you know."
2016.15-827,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3484.06,3489.28,And it's not in Rowley. So where does it -- who invented it?
2016.15-827,1,37171,neal_kumar_katyal,,3489.28,3493.08,"Well, I think that it came directly from the circuits right after Rowley."
2016.15-827,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3500.785,3504.965,"Thank you, counsel. Two minutes, Mr. Fisher."
2016.15-827,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3504.965,3507.98,"Three points, Your Honors."
2016.15-827,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3535.88,3537.86,Answer Justice Alito's question.
2016.15-827,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3540.445,3541.17,Pardon me?
2016.15-827,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3541.17,3546.85,"What's the practice today? Do most courts use the ""more than de minimis"" standard?"
2016.15-827,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3546.85,3547.285,Yes.
2016.15-827,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3553.195,3557.08,Before -- putting aside -- I don't want -- I'll take 10 seconds.
2016.15-827,2,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3562.655,3563.985,I think they need a kick.
2016.15-827,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3672.56,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
