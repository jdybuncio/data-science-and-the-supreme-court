1974.73-696,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,55.705,"We'll hear arguments next in 73-696, Emporium Capwell Company against Western Addition Community and the Labor Board's related petition."
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,58.909,62.769,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-696,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,435.996,438.547,"Excuse me Mr. Wallace, which color was it?"
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,438.547,443.017,"This is the dark yellow one, the appendix to the petitioner."
1974.73-696,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,443.017,444.038,Page?
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,444.038,446.701,Page 103.
1974.73-696,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,535.34,539.571,"I don't seem to have that petition Mr. Wallace, which is certainly not your fault."
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,545.025,548.442,"Perhaps it's found in a different color, but it could be the same petition."
1974.73-696,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,552.298,552.617,"Yeah, well --"
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,552.617,554.266,It might have a different color.
1974.73-696,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,554.266,554.947,Alright.
1974.73-696,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,554.947,559.491,On what page of that petition -- the darker petition?
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,559.491,573.104,At 103 is the Board's finding that the Union was endeavoring in every way available to it under the agreement to adjust any and all cases of racial discrimination brought to its attention.
1974.73-696,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,594.227,596.179,"And now, I don't find that on Page 55."
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,596.179,600.947,"Well it's in Footnote 2, I am summarizing it slightly."
1974.73-696,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,610.099,613.989,"I see it now, thank you."
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,617.788,619.894,That is correct Mr. Justice.
1974.73-696,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,619.894,621.269,I--
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,621.269,640.705,"The Board really has not passed on what the result would be in a situation where there had been a finding that the Union was in breach of its duty of fair representation, and counsel for the Board really can take no position on the matter that the Board hasn't passed on."
1974.73-696,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,642.864,643.74,Right.
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,655.199,668.074,"Well, that's why I mentioned at the outset the question that the Board and the Court of Appeals decided and which was presented in the petitions in what we thought was the question here."
1974.73-696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,681.383,681.887,Or ignored?
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,681.887,687.606,-- as to the objective of the activities for which these two people were fired.
1974.73-696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,687.606,691.137,At least to ignore them.
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,697.04,701.497,It was accepted very emphatically by the Court of Appeals.
1974.73-696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1132.48,1142.475,"Is that -- Mr. Wallace, is that issue settled, let's assume there was not a racial tinge to this case."
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1167.792,1170.47,Now there are wildcat strikes --
1974.73-696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1170.47,1171.354,"Well, it isn't a strike, just a picket?"
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1171.354,1174.448,In many of the cases have been about wildcat strike.
1974.73-696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1215.017,1223.087,"So you are saying that outside of the context in which this case arises, it is not settled whether the activities I refer to are protected activities --"
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1223.087,1224.667,"That is, that is correct."
1974.73-696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1224.667,1227.497,-- under 8 (a) or under 7?
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1227.497,1245.738,"My understanding is that a complaint, a charge that the employer refused to bargain with the individuals who demanded it, is not processed by the General Counsel as a compliant because he doesn't regard 9 (a) is imposing any duty on the employer --"
1974.73-696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1245.738,1252.16,But why the employer is requiring his employees for doing what I suggested he was doing?
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1254.97,1257.395,I don't believe that is settled.
1974.73-696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1267.832,1278.383,"I don't think -- it might be one thing to say that the individual employees aren't entitled to bargain with the employer, but it might be another thing to say to fire them."
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1278.383,1282.338,"So far as I know, the Board has not passed on that issue."
1974.73-696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1282.338,1287.435,Well certainly it's passed -- it's passed order in this case?
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1287.435,1290.776,"Well, it doesn't regard this case as a case of --"
1974.73-696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1290.776,1293.329,But this is a case of picketing to gain bargaining rights --
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1293.329,1298.365,"That's right, rather than to get the employer to talk about individual grievances."
1974.73-696,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1302.242,1312.866,"The Larry case that is argued by your brothers on the other side including a good many amici and including indeed the exclusive collective bargaining agent in this case, is that right?"
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1312.866,1317.086,That is correct.
1974.73-696,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1323.278,1324.329,"Right, I know that."
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1324.329,1329.282,-- coming out on the other side.
1974.73-696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1411.152,1415.368,"Mr. Wallace, could you tell me again, I probably missed it."
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1431.962,1434.139,Well that's -- that --
1974.73-696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1434.139,1448.554,Let's assume individual employees are picketing to have the employer adjust a grievance in a particular way and the Union is also grieving with the employers.
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1454.059,1471.871,"Well, they are privileged under 9 (a) to meet with the employer, to try to adjust their grievance with them, and that doesn't under the proviso to 9 (a) derogate from the authority of the Union."
1974.73-696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1489.191,1506.393,"You mean -- they not be guilty of the refusal the bargain, he refuses to bargain, but how about being guilty of an unfair practice, if he fires the employee for exercising what is the privilege under 9 (a)?"
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1506.393,1514.736,"Well, there is no question that they have a right under 9 (a) to do with the meeting with the employer if he'll meet with them --"
1974.73-696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1514.736,1515.353,"Well, what does the employer --"
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1515.353,1519.256,-- and that doesn't take away anything that the Union gets in Section 9.
1974.73-696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1519.256,1526.112,"So what -- so, what did the employer fire these people for here, something beyond what's guaranteed to do them in 9 (a) which is --"
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1526.112,1526.921,It's completely --
1974.73-696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1526.921,1528.268,Which is what?
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1528.268,1535.488,Well the 9 (a) is limited to presenting grievances and the Board found that this wasn't an effort to present grievances.
1974.73-696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1537.335,1537.975,About what?
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1537.975,1548.148,-- conditions throughout the store on behalf of all minority people and obviously to bargain about things that will effect others as well.
1974.73-696,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1548.148,1553.428,If these people have wanted just to bargain with him about their own status?
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1553.428,1557.053,That would be a different case which the Board has not passed on.
1974.73-696,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1557.053,1563.182,Even if it affected other employees?
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1563.182,1573.042,"Even if it affected other employees, the case would be presented in quite a different context."
1974.73-696,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1643.667,1651.866,Do you think that when the Board supplied its experience and resolved this then it settles it pretty much?
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1651.866,1656.714,"Well, of course the Board is very experienced in this kind of fact finding."
1974.73-696,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1720.109,1730.885,"Well Mr. Wallace under 9 (a), that -- it really means nothing to it -- if the management does not want to discuss it, 9 (a) means nothing?"
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1730.885,1740.916,"Well, that something that so far as I know the Board hasn't passed on and that leaves me in a position where I can't make a commitment on behalf of the Board."
1974.73-696,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1740.916,1753.659,"So if the employees told the management we want discuss this and management says we don't want to discuss it, there is no means available for the employee to do anything?"
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1753.659,1760.452,"Well, I think their usual recourse is to get the Union to do it on their behalf because the employer has to discuss things with the Union."
1974.73-696,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1760.519,1764.47,"Well, I understand and basically when the Union won't do it?"
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1764.47,1766.961,"Well, sometimes the Union is willing to do it."
1974.73-696,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1766.961,1776.55,"Well if the Union is willing to do it, then management is willing to talk to them, employee is just out?"
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1776.55,1779.473,The Board has not decided that.
1974.73-696,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1781.952,1790.262,My difficulty is in thinking that Congress would put 9 (a) in there and end up with not giving them any relief at all?
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1790.262,1816.08,"Well, it's certainly a possible reading of 9 (a) because it's quite possible that the Union is trying to adjust grievances in one way and that some dissident employees want them adjusted in another way and we'll start engaging in coercive tactics on the employer that are contrary to what the Union is seeking to accomplish in the grievance proceedings."
1974.73-696,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1850.858,1862.849,"Well, if the employer talks to the dissident Union member, facing facts, wouldn't the employer be in trouble with the Union?"
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1862.849,1868.327,I think that varies with the situation.
1974.73-696,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1898.785,1911.439,"Mr. Wallace, before you sit down, am I correct in understanding that your argument as to 8 (b) 7 (a) was not raised below?"
1974.73-696,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1911.439,1913.758,"Well, it was not raised below."
1974.73-696,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1967.857,1976.296,"Thank you Mr. Wallace, Mr. Bahrs?"
1974.73-696,1,25006,george_o_bahrs,,1976.296,1979.273,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-696,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2407.579,2409.197,"What page are you on now, Mr. Bahrs?"
1974.73-696,1,25006,george_o_bahrs,,2409.197,2410.26,I'm sorry.
1974.73-696,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2545.818,2566.864,"I think it -- you must be urging that even though the employer need not bargain, needn't say a word to the picketing group that because it need not bargain, that the employer may fire those who were picketing?"
1974.73-696,1,25006,george_o_bahrs,,2566.864,2569.969,"No, I'm not saying that."
1974.73-696,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2572.038,2584.924,"What the -- what the containable position would the employer be in if he needn't bargain at all, but he couldn't fire picketers?"
1974.73-696,1,25006,george_o_bahrs,,2584.924,2596.353,"Well, the picketers were fired primarily because of a violation of the Jefferson Standard case."
1974.73-696,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2619.779,2621.508,Or do it through the Union?
1974.73-696,1,25006,george_o_bahrs,,2621.508,2624.368,"Or do it through the Union, yes Your Honor."
1974.73-696,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2624.368,2632.245,So this case would be different if the people had gone on strike and left the payroll?
1974.73-696,1,25006,george_o_bahrs,,2632.245,2636.071,"Your Honor, we are in a middle of a contract."
1974.73-696,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2658.857,2666.934,"Thank you, Mr. Bahrs."
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,2666.955,2670.716,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-696,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2775.483,2790.2,"Would you make all of these same arguments, Mr. Hecht if the whole episode, it involved two women who were picketing against alleged discrimination against women?"
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,2790.2,2810.77,"If the women engaged in their concerted activities on a good faith of belief as the Court found, if the women had attempted to go through the Union, for seven months, Hollins and Hawkins tried very hard to use the processes which the Union controlled; that is to say the grievance process."
1974.73-696,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2837.662,2851.865,"Then your answer would probably be the same if we hypothetically suggested Catholics, catholic employees as a group or any other identifiable --"
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,2851.865,2871.802,"Mr. Justice Burger, if all of the facts which I've listed before were present, if there were discrimination and a good faith belief that the employer was discriminating on the basis of race for instance, or religion as you have suggested, yes, our answer would be the same, we think that's what the law requires."
1974.73-696,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2893.248,2907.963,"You think it's the Title VII factor that makes a difference, absent Title VII, absent the racial dimension to the case the discharge would have been proper under Jefferson Standard?"
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,2907.963,2910.283,"No, not at all Your Honor."
1974.73-696,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2919.872,2923.736,"Well, you say you don't rely on Title VII at all?"
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,2923.736,2925.301,"No, I did not say that."
1974.73-696,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2926.671,2928.757,Do you think Title VII makes a difference or not?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,2928.757,2929.914,"No, it does not make a difference."
1974.73-696,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2940.325,2942.281,Well that's absence of Title VII?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,2942.281,2943.58,"Absolutely, absence of Title VII."
1974.73-696,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2943.58,2946.253,But it's not absence of the racial factor?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,2946.253,2947.986,It is not absent the racial factor.
1974.73-696,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2947.986,2963.925,"Absent a racial factor would the discharge for picketing by a minority where there is or isn't an exclusive bargaining agent, is a discharge for picketing an unfair practice?"
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,2963.925,2968.412,Let me try to break the question down for a minute if I can.
1974.73-696,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3039.271,3042.359,Were the stationary in the doorway?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3042.359,3044.337,"They were not stationed in the doorway, Your Honor."
1974.73-696,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3054.204,3058.181,There could be harassment by just standing in the doorway?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3058.181,3060.971,"Well, the people who were distributing the leaflets were harassed."
1974.73-696,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3066.642,3075.308,"Well, what do you say about Mr. Bahrs point in which he wanted two Unions representing the exact same group of employees?"
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3075.308,3084.33,It's one of the reasons why we have urged upon the Court to find the conclusion of law rather that the employees were engaged in furthering a grievance.
1974.73-696,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3119.719,3124.225,Did they strike?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3124.225,3127.251,"No, I don't believe they can strike under this contract in this case."
1974.73-696,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3136.315,3138.547,Which means they couldn't strike?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3138.547,3141.42,The contract does say they couldn't strike.
1974.73-696,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3141.42,3146.864,So that the second Union -- I just don't understand what this group wouldn't be a union in the --
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3146.864,3148.05,The group is not a union.
1974.73-696,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3151.937,3153.952,They don't want a union?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3153.952,3154.65,These employees?
1974.73-696,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3154.65,3155.045,Yes.
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3155.045,3155.203,No.
1974.73-696,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3165.754,3171.736,You want the employer to give them what their own Union wouldn't give them?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3171.736,3172.939,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you."
1974.73-696,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3172.939,3179.66,You want the employer to give them what their own Union wouldn't give them?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3179.66,3189.096,"It's only the employer which could give them this which they asked for which was nondiscrimination in employment, but the Union had a duty to help them to get it from the employer."
1974.73-696,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3189.096,3191.816,Are they making grievance to this?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3191.816,3198.011,"Well, the Union of course have the duty to make a grievance and it's the specific finding of the Court of Appeals that the Union did not discharge --"
1974.73-696,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3198.011,3200.488,But you want the employer?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3200.488,3201.193,I'm sorry?
1974.73-696,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3201.193,3204.312,You want the employer to do the Union's work?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3204.312,3205.663,"No, no, not at all."
1974.73-696,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3211.071,3215.241,"You didn't pass out leaflets about the Union, did you?"
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3215.241,3216.109,No because there was --
1974.73-696,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3216.109,3218.835,You passed out leaflets about the employer?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3218.835,3220.066,Yes.
1974.73-696,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3232.234,3241.806,"But my point is that in your view, this is the only way that the minority members of the Union can get what they are entitled to, that's your point, isn't it?"
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3241.806,3250.042,"No it ought not to be, Your Honor, but it proved to be in this case and the employees waited seven months to make that decision."
1974.73-696,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3250.042,3258.999,"Mr. Hecht, you were drawing a distinction as I understood it between picketing and handing out leaflets."
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3268.813,3280.878,"Section 8 (b) (7) of the statute of the National Labor Relations Act which is the operative section with regard to picketing has three requirements, Your Honor."
1974.73-696,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3321.127,3332.778,"I understand that is your position, but if you assumed or agreed for example that there were picketing, would that make the case different in your view?"
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3332.778,3333.748,"No, it would not."
1974.73-696,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3333.748,3334.113,It would not.
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3334.113,3336.563,"In fact, the Board and the Court found that there was picketing and that made no difference to the resolution."
1974.73-696,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3336.563,3348.033,"I understand, yes."
1974.73-696,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3348.033,3368.768,"You're really arguing a case that isn't here, a case that well might be here if the findings have been different, but the findings of the Trial Examiner accepted by the Board and accepted then by -- unanimously by the three members of the Court of Appeals were that your clients were attempting to bargain?"
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3368.768,3370.372,Yes.
1974.73-696,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3561.691,3565.608,Do you -- I take it you are defending the Court of Appeals?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3565.608,3567.222,Absolutely.
1974.73-696,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3567.222,3568.711,Judgment and its opinion?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3568.711,3569.465,Yes.
1974.73-696,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3569.465,3570.868,Right down on the line?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3570.868,3571.631,Yes.
1974.73-696,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3571.945,3575.843,Although you have some supplemental arguments --
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3575.843,3578.734,We have some arguments we've been pushing through a long time --
1974.73-696,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3578.734,3585.164,"I take it then you agree that there would still be open, the Jefferson Standard question before the Board?"
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3585.164,3586.608,Yes.
1974.73-696,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3586.608,3606.27,"And that if it were found which it wasn't found by the Board although the Trial Examiner apparently discussed it, if it were found that this is the kind of picketing and would that justify discharge under the Jefferson Standard, you would have no objection?"
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3606.27,3607.241,I have great objection.
1974.73-696,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3609.156,3612.784,You're not supporting the Court of Appeals' opinion there?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3612.784,3612.944,I have --
1974.73-696,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3612.944,3614.786,The Court's opinion left that open?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3614.786,3623.484,That's right and I think the appropriate thing for the Court to do and I believe on remand that the Board has before it the question of the Jefferson Standard issue --
1974.73-696,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3623.484,3633.56,"And the Court of Appeals as I read it that if the finding was made of the discharges for that reason, this case is over?"
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3633.56,3637.002,"I don't think the Court of Appeals reached that, but I think it's implicit in what the Courts --"
1974.73-696,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3637.002,3638.03,So you support that?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3638.03,3640.108,Yes I do.
1974.73-696,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3640.108,3649.306,And what do you understand then the claim is as to why the employees were fired?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3649.306,3655.846,I believe the employees were fired here because they on two Saturdays distributed leaflets which --
1974.73-696,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3655.846,3663.602,"What was the -- normally, you have to be fired for some cause?"
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3663.602,3667.22,Of course.
1974.73-696,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3667.22,3671.086,"What cause was asserted, that you just handed out leaflets in the front of my store?"
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3671.086,3680.298,"Yes, that's all that is stated on the face of the warning notice or the discharge letter, and it was in response to those that the Union immediately filed grievance."
1974.73-696,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3680.298,3686.958,Without any assertion or finding that it was a sign of disloyalty or something like that?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3686.958,3689.977,"Well, there is suggestion that there is disloyalty, absolutely."
1974.73-696,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3689.977,3693.209,"Didn't that put it directly on the Jefferson Standard kind of conduct?"""
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3693.209,3694.059,Yes.
1974.73-696,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3694.059,3694.89,"Well, but the Board --"
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3694.89,3696.828,They didn't mention Jefferson Standard on the slip.
1974.73-696,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3696.828,3702.635,But the Board sustained the discharge without making any Jefferson findings -- Jefferson Standard findings?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3702.635,3705.857,I think they believe they didn't have to and I think the Trial Examiner found it a difficult question.
1974.73-696,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3705.857,3708.535,What was the Board's justification for the findings?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3708.535,3727.695,"The Board's justification was that the employees again were intent upon bargaining, separate bargaining, that this so undermined the Union, disrupted the Union Management relationship that by virtue of the principles inherent in Section 9 (a) of the Act, they simply were engaging in a prohibited activity."
1974.73-696,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3727.695,3740.373,My real reason in asking was you would agree then that Section 7 of the Labor Law does not protect this activity if it were Jefferson Standard type activity?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3740.373,3742.968,I believe Jefferson Standard so holds.
1974.73-696,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3742.968,3750.468,"And that it wouldn't, even though there was a -- it's the objection as to an alleged racial discrimination?"
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3750.468,3753.495,I don't think that the racial element in the case needs the Jefferson Standard.
1974.73-696,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3753.495,3756.103,And even in the light of Title VII?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3756.103,3767.894,Yes.
1974.73-696,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3833.055,3844.155,You have already answered I think to Mr. Justice Powell saying your position would be the same if they have in fact picketed instead of handing out leaflets.
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3873.506,3873.606,No.
1974.73-696,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3886.291,3894.561,"-- special characteristics of picketing, but you say this case would be no different if they have picketed instead of handing out leaflets, didn't you?"
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3894.561,3914.553,"The major point of difference I think would be that under a regular kind of problem that the employees have Section 9 (a) has made it clear that their recourse is to try to work first through the Union, their exclusive bargaining agent, then to go the employer with a grievance if that proved necessary."
1974.73-696,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3972.973,3976.589,Well you enlightened me somewhat on your view.
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3976.589,3979.851,But perhaps not on the question you had in mind.
1974.73-696,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3979.851,3980.819,Mr. Hecht?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3980.819,3983.059,Yes sir.
1974.73-696,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3983.059,3992.163,What is your position as to what the record shows about exactly why these employees did abandon the Union?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,3992.163,4011.38,"I think the record is clear from the testimony of Hollins and Hawkins themselves that they abandoned the Union principally because after waiting seven months, the Union insisted upon handling the problem as if there were a serious seriatim of individual grievances which should be adjusted individually."
1974.73-696,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4030.793,4039.266,Would the grievance procedures in the contract have permitted the type of group resolution that Hollins and Hawkins wanted?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,4039.266,4047.857,There is nothing in the contract that would tend to prevent that kind of group presentation and the law specifically permits it.
1974.73-696,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4058.993,4063.943,That's presented directly to the employer by 9 (a)?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,4063.943,4066.291,I'm sorry?
1974.73-696,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4066.291,4072.863,You say that the law permits presentation by employees or groups of employees -
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,4072.863,4073.124,That's right.
1974.73-696,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4073.124,4084.554,-- I was curious as to whether under the grievance procedure in the collective bargaining contract that the type of group resolution where would be permissible that Hollins and Hawkins wanted?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,4084.554,4087.459,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist I, believe the contract is silent on that."
1974.73-696,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4095.836,4102.022,How about the law assuming absence of anything in the contract?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,4108.863,4110.26,No.
1974.73-696,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4111.513,4115.587,Which provides for a term that it was -- it hasn't expired here --
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,4115.587,4121.444,Provides for a term that there should be discrimination in employment and that's what Hollins and Hawkins wanted.
1974.73-696,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4142.915,4150.26,What sort of a group did they -- a group processing of this so called grievance to day one?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,4155.947,4156.238,Yes.
1974.73-696,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4168.966,4173.044,"They were talking about only the employees presently employed -- then employed, weren't they?"
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,4173.044,4173.56,Yes.
1974.73-696,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4173.56,4175.077,They were not talking about hiring?
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,4175.077,4175.243,Oh!
1974.73-696,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4212.017,4214.939,I'll ask a minor one.
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,4243.416,4253.658,"That maybe frank to say that at first I was troubled by that standard too, and I'd like to offer following observations on it if I can."
1974.73-696,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4394.1,4394.858,Thank you Mr. Hecht.
1974.73-696,2,33851,kenneth_hecht,,4394.858,4395.305,Thank you very much.
1974.73-696,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4395.305,4400.702,"Mr. Wallace, do you have any further, you have only one minute."
1974.73-696,3,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,4400.702,4421.482,"Well, with respect to the standard, I'll just say that the word remedying and what constitutes the proper remedy for agreed upon discrimination is itself subject to great dispute, let alone by the most efficacious and effective means."
1974.73-696,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4457.897,4458.561,Thank you gentlemen.
