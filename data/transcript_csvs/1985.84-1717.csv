1985.84-1717,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.858,We will hear arguments next in United States against Quinn.
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,63.912,71.252,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit."
1985.84-1717,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,260.02,279.027,"Mr. Levy, the respondent, of course, has changed the whole attack now that he is in this Court, and says, well, the real problem is the seizure of the boat and possibly the seizure of the marijuana revenue."
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,294.411,295.161,We think he cannot.
1985.84-1717,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,319.572,327.82,Is it quite clear that it is precluded under the terms of the reserved issue under the plea?
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,327.82,328.788,Absolutely clear.
1985.84-1717,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,363.851,374.707,"Well, I suppose his argument is that there is no right to search, because the search was the product of the illegal seizure, so that is the concern."
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,374.707,378.987,"--That may be an argument that would have been open to him in the District Court, but it is certainly a different argument."
1985.84-1717,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,391.373,394.825,What if we disagree with you on that?
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,394.825,397.837,"Well, we have also argued the merits of the seizure issue in our reply brief."
1985.84-1717,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,400.025,400.541,"All right, you go ahead."
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,400.541,411.52,"Let me return to the search issue, since that is the issue that the Court of Appeals decided and the question presented in our certiorari petition, and one that we think warrants the consideration of this Court."
1985.84-1717,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,526.676,528.582,"We will resume there at 1:00 o'clock, counsel."
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,542.03,550.136,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, before the luncheon recess I was discussing that respondent had no Fourth Amendment privacy interest in the Sea Otter."
1985.84-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,637.788,656.171,"May I ask, Mr. Levy, supposing the respondent here had entered some kind of an instruction to the people who were using the boat and said, don't let anybody on the boat except the people working in our... whatever we are up to, and just don't let people generally on it."
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,657.671,658.686,"No, I don't believe so."
1985.84-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,664.045,667.276,"--What if he gave it to somebody and said, I don't want anybody except you to use it."
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,670.65,679.506,"--Again, where he had no previous connection, no prior privacy interest, that kind of reservation would not by itself create one."
1985.84-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,679.506,685.268,"What if he said I have got some papers in the desk I don't want anybody to look at, so please don't let anybody on the boat."
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,685.268,690.674,"Well, that would start to present a closer question, because there the owner had made use of the boat in a way that--"
1985.84-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,690.674,702.7,"Say he had... please put these papers in the desk, and I don't want people to look at them, but I figure that is a safe place where nobody can get in and out unless you let people wander onto the boat."
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,702.7,705.372,--That may give him in expectation of privacy in the desk.
1985.84-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,708.215,715.291,"But I take it it would not be true if he said, please put this gun and this marijuana or this contraband in the desk."
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,716.338,717.337,I think not.
1985.84-1717,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,842.521,845.661,"Well, how do you distinguish it from Jeffers?"
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,852.095,853.0,That's correct.
1985.84-1717,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,884.551,887.362,"--Because of items other than the drugs, you think?"
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,887.362,901.059,"Not just because of items other than drugs, but because of his access to and use of the room in ways that essentially made him a person who had a sufficient connection or had an expectation of privacy in the room even though he did not have a common law property right interest."
1985.84-1717,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1090.311,1094.778,"That fact is contested by the other side, isn't it?"
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1094.778,1099.181,"--Well, he didn't contest it in the District Court, and we submit that it is too late at this juncture."
1985.84-1717,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1107.24,1113.879,What is the fact about the dispute as to a loss of six tons by fire?
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1115.363,1117.612,--I don't think that is significant to the outcome of the case.
1985.84-1717,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1119.408,1123.547,"Now, it is in your footnote, and you make a flat statement to that effect, and I want to know what is true."
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1123.547,1134.387,--I am informed by the U.S. Attorney's office that the grand jury transcript in this case contains testimony by Hunt that there was a fire aboard the Sea Otter and it destroyed approximately half the cargo of the marijuana.
1985.84-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1246.841,1250.027,Let me just stop you there for just a second.
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1261.725,1268.488,"That would be under the traditional fruits analysis, but it would not be because there was anything independently wrong with the search."
1985.84-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1271.597,1285.997,"What if he had come into court and said, my standing rests on the seizure, I don't care, you can keep the boat, it is a lousy boat, I don't want it back, but having standing in that way, I still want the evidence suppressed, and therefore I still have standing to... that gives me standing to challenge the cert.--"
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1285.997,1294.4,"--For this purpose, I can assume, although I will come back to it later, but I can assume that if he had raised this in this District Court and included it in the conditional--"
1985.84-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1294.4,1300.492,"--What you are just saying is, he made the wrong argument, but nevertheless, if he is right, it would sustain the judgment, wouldn't it?"
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1300.492,1303.662,--But it is not a question that only a... to sustain the judgment.
1985.84-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1317.266,1320.125,The matter that is being reserved is whether he has standing to challenge the search.
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1320.125,1320.656,--That is right.
1985.84-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1321.921,1329.761,"And if the evidence shows that he had standing to challenge the seizure and as an incident thereto the search as well, doesn't he have standing to challenge the search--"
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1329.761,1332.01,"No, we submit he did not have standing to challenge the search."
1985.84-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1341.116,1349.816,"--Supposing he had, instead of arguing on the basis of four factors, he just forgot to argue that he was the owner of the Sea Otter, but the records show that he in fact was."
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1357.891,1359.188,--On the search question?
1985.84-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1359.188,1360.78,"Well, all the search."
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1383.582,1387.769,I am not sure if he didn't rely on his ownership in the District Court that he would be free to raise that on appeal.
1985.84-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1387.769,1389.284,Even though the record showed it.
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1389.284,1389.956,Even though the record showed it.
1985.84-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1396.188,1403.342,You cannot introduce a new legal argument in this Court that would sustain the judgment based on the record that is already made.
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1403.342,1405.372,Not if it weren't raised and preserved below.
1985.84-1717,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1413.571,1414.711,What about our rule?
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1414.711,1418.46,--and I think it is also true under the rules of this Court on alternative grounds for affirmance.
1985.84-1717,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1420.584,1420.991,What does it say?
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1421.85,1429.377,--My understanding of the rule is that the defendant is free to raise an alternative ground that would not change the judgment if that ground was properly raised and preserved below.
1985.84-1717,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1429.377,1433.08,Doesn't it say if the record supports it?
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1433.08,1443.934,"I think there is a separate requirement that it had been properly raised and preserved in accordance with the usual legal procedures, and the Court said as much yesterday in Whitley against Albers, if I read the opinion correctly."
1985.84-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1443.934,1447.652,"Of course, if it has been preserved below, it doesn't have to just sustain the judgment."
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1450.009,1450.478,The petitioner can.
1985.84-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1451.461,1457.365,--The theory of this rule is that respondent has a little greater latitude than petitioner does.
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1457.365,1459.334,"--That's correct, but his latitude is limited by--"
1985.84-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1459.334,1463.097,"And the limitation on petitioner's right is, he has to have made the objection below and preserved it."
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1463.097,1464.347,"--That's right, but the limitation on the--"
1985.84-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1464.347,1464.957,You are saying the same limitation--
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1464.957,1471.407,--on the respondent's right is that it has to not alter the judgment and that he had properly presented it and preserved it below.
1985.84-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1602.182,1611.819,"--Yes, but isn't it true, Mr. Levy, in fact marijuana was found, and couldn't you have then permanently seized the vessel as a result of that ten-minute... that short detention?"
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1611.819,1619.41,"--Well, we could based on the subsequent discovery of the marijuana, but the seizure that respondent seeks to challenge here is not the ultimate seizure."
1985.84-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1619.41,1623.783,"Yes, but as a consequence of that seizure, you have got the right to take his boat away from him."
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1623.783,1635.591,"Because of new evidence that was found, but his argument would be the same if... or his right to make the argument would be the same if we had temporarily detained the Sea Otter, pumped out the holds, and found nothing."
1985.84-1717,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1640.401,1647.476,"If had been an unlawful pumping out, I suppose he then... and he wanted to sue you for, you know... of course, it is federal, not 1983, but I would suppose that is right, yes."
1985.84-1717,0,36246,mark_i_levy,,1647.476,1658.268,--And we submit that he as the absentee owner had no interest that was infringed by that interim detention when the boat was out of his control for such an extended period of time.
1985.84-1717,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1662.86,1667.749,Mr. Iredale.
1985.84-1717,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1667.749,1692.614,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question presented to the Court of Appeals by the appellant, Mr. Quinn, in this case was whether defendant Michael Robert Quinn had standing to contest the seizure and search of the vessel Sea Otter in 1979, when he was the owner of the vessel which was seized and searched, and the owner of the items seized."
1985.84-1717,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1718.463,1724.274,"That is a broader question than was preserved in the conditional plea, wasn't it?"
1985.84-1717,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1724.274,1730.193,"With respect to that, Justice Rehnquist, I have to say that we use imprecise language."
1985.84-1717,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1731.738,1734.097,I was curious about what you actually did preserve.
1985.84-1717,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1734.097,1739.048,--What both parties intended to preserve was the Fourth Amendment issue in the case as distinguished--
1985.84-1717,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1739.048,1740.734,--What does it say?
1985.84-1717,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1740.969,1745.843,--I cannot recall the precise language.
1985.84-1717,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1745.843,1746.967,Is it in the record?
1985.84-1717,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1746.967,1747.358,It is.
1985.84-1717,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1748.826,1750.872,Is it in the printed--
1985.84-1717,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1750.872,1751.418,Yes.
1985.84-1717,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1751.418,1756.323,"--It referred only to search, didn't it?"
1985.84-1717,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1756.323,1767.647,"Yes, it did, Justice O'Connor, and that was because there was one motion filed under the Fourth Amendment, and I filed about 15 other motions, and we intended to limit it to that one issue."
1985.84-1717,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1767.647,1780.047,Have you ever made this argument about the seizure of the boat has given you standing to challenge the search of the boat in the courts below this Court?
1985.84-1717,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1780.047,1784.093,"We raised the seizure issue, but--"
1985.84-1717,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1784.093,1786.436,Did you ever make the argument?
1985.84-1717,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1786.436,1790.762,"--The search being the fruit of it, in that precise form, no."
1985.84-1717,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1790.762,1791.933,Thank you.
1985.84-1717,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1798.665,1811.208,The language can be found on Pages 21 through 24.
1985.84-1717,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1862.982,1866.06,Whether or not they were presented to the court below?
1985.84-1717,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1866.06,1875.744,"I believe whether or not they were presented to the court below, if they were involved in the facts of the case, and I believe that this was clearly and fairly presented to the court below."
1985.84-1717,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1958.961,1963.304,What difference would it have made if there were a handful or a ton for these purposes?
1985.84-1717,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1963.304,1964.865,None.
1985.84-1717,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1964.865,1968.77,"I wondered, because you emphasized the handful so much."
1985.84-1717,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1968.77,1985.715,"Except to say that this case in many ways is much ado about nothing, because they came up with a very small quantity of contraband, the only relevance of which in the case before the District Court would have been to corroborate the testimony of their chief witness, George Mayberry Hunt."
1985.84-1717,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1987.714,1994.009,"Well, since you can't point out how much, how many many tons did the vessel hold?"
1985.84-1717,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1994.009,1996.585,--How many tons did it hold?
1985.84-1717,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1996.585,1997.851,Yes.
1985.84-1717,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,1997.851,2001.21,"There is nothing in the record concerning that, and I don't know, Justice Marshall."
1985.84-1717,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2001.912,2003.584,"Well, it held more than a handful."
1985.84-1717,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2003.584,2004.926,"Oh, yes."
1985.84-1717,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2006.598,2008.534,The vessel had a nine-foot beam.
1985.84-1717,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2009.299,2009.923,"Yes, sir."
1985.84-1717,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2011.032,2012.219,And fifty-four length?
1985.84-1717,1,22510,eugene_g_iredale,,2012.219,2014.219,A good many tons.
1985.84-1717,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,3208.883,3216.989,"I have a few brief points, Mr. Chief Justice, none of which is central to the resolution of the case, but may help clarify the Court's consideration."
1985.84-1717,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3322.448,3327.992,What do you say to his argument that Quinn could have consented to a search?
1985.84-1717,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,3327.992,3330.898,"Well, I am not sure it is as clear as Mr. Iredale suggested."
1985.84-1717,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3346.421,3352.45,"Well, but consented to precisely the steps the government took in this case, taking it into port and pumping out the water."
1985.84-1717,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,3354.778,3356.699,--It is not so clear on these facts.
1985.84-1717,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3356.699,3357.042,Why not?
1985.84-1717,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,3361.603,3365.118,The question would be whether... the basis for the consent--
1985.84-1717,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3365.118,3370.1,Is there anything in the record which would show he did not have authority to grant such consent if he owned the boat?
1985.84-1717,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,3370.1,3371.365,--There is nothing in the record either way.
1985.84-1717,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3380.393,3385.329,"But his legal right to grant that consent would flow simply from the fact that he owned the boat, wouldn't it?"
1985.84-1717,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,3385.329,3389.327,If it was an area in which no one else--
1985.84-1717,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3389.327,3391.419,We know what we are talking about.
1985.84-1717,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,3396.572,3399.572,--He might have had consent to--
1985.84-1717,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3399.572,3401.603,"Well, he would have had power to consent, wouldn't he?"
1985.84-1717,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,3401.603,3412.895,"--Well, if, for example, taking it into the port would constitute a Perry stop or a seizure of the people on board the boat and interfere with their freedom of movement and their right to use the boat, it is not so clear that he would have been able to consent to that."
1985.84-1717,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3433.495,3441.68,"Put a little differently, if you say he couldn't... could he have gotten on the radio wireless or something and talked to the skipper of the boat and said, take it into port for ten days?"
1985.84-1717,2,36246,mark_i_levy,,3443.695,3447.224,"From all that the record appears, I assume that he could have done that."
1985.84-1717,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3447.224,3447.505,I would think so.
1985.84-1717,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3447.505,3450.396,"Thank you, gentlemen."
