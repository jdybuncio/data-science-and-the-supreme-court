1975.74-1560,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,17.526,"We will hear arguments first this morning in 74-1560, United States against Martinez-Fuerte and 75-5387, a consolidated case."
1975.74-1560,0,17451,ballard_bennett,,29.356,35.491,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1560,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,107.445,116.599,Mr. Bennett as it goes you would agree that precisely at the border all of the things that we have done here could be done.
1975.74-1560,0,17451,ballard_bennett,,116.599,121.664,"Yes Your Honor, there is no argument about that as far as I know Your Honor."
1975.74-1560,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,122.477,124.741,"The only issue is the distance, is it not?"
1975.74-1560,0,17451,ballard_bennett,,124.741,126.29,Yes sir.
1975.74-1560,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1458.382,1461.949,Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the court.
1975.74-1560,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1764.157,1774.421,"Last term in those two cases Brignoni-Ponce and what was the other, Ortiz or one (Inaudible) Ortiz?"
1975.74-1560,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1783.733,1784.007,That is correct.
1975.74-1560,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1784.007,1790.401,"But further settled that there could not be a stop and search at a fixed checkpoint, is that correct?"
1975.74-1560,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1790.401,1792.393,That is without probable cause and --
1975.74-1560,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1792.393,1796.52,Without the ordinary probable cause or for a search or consents.
1975.74-1560,1,35781,mark_l_evans,,1799.957,1800.388,That is right.
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3742.631,3745.19,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.74-1560,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3813.463,3817.009,"Now, does that happen to every car?"
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3817.009,3819.632,That happens to every car when the checkpoint is running.
1975.74-1560,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3826.313,3827.795,And he does that with every car?
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3827.795,3828.311,With every car.
1975.74-1560,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3828.311,3829.753,And that is the so-called fleeting stop.
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3829.753,3832.855,"That is the fleeting stop, then he selects--"
1975.74-1560,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3832.855,3834.842,About one out of twenty?
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3834.842,3838.606,"Whatever the figure is, whatever car he wants to have further inspected."
1975.74-1560,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3869.24,3875.341,What is the problem if he stops and he sees two people lying down and hidden on the floor?
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3877.663,3880.347,With the stop the initial intrusion without any factual basis.
1975.74-1560,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3880.347,3888.369,"No, after he stops and he sees that certainly there is no complaint about him going to the secondary area after that is a --"
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3888.369,3895.257,"If you justify, if you can justify the initial intrusion but it seems to me the Fourth Amendment, requires the factual basis for the stop."
1975.74-1560,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3895.257,3914.614,"If you were talking about just being rolled on the side but once he does stop them, I mean once he sees illegal aliens or what appeared to be illegal aliens or for some reason by lying down on the floor and send them on secondary, the only complaint there is the stop."
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3914.614,3915.6,Yes.
1975.74-1560,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3940.854,3943.37,But you could stop him for a red light.
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3943.37,3946.814,"Yes, I know the government has alluded that this is the equivalent of a red light."
1975.74-1560,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3956.41,3958.006,But he could.
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3958.006,3958.656,They could.
1975.74-1560,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3958.656,3963.652,A police officer could stand at the stop sign and look in to your car and it will be nothing real wrong with it.
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3963.652,3965.16,"I agree, I agree absolutely."
1975.74-1560,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3965.16,3970.375,"In this all contraband he could operate accordingly, could not he?"
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3970.375,3971.292,That is correct but that is not what is happening.
1975.74-1560,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3971.292,3972.938,Which is to lock you up?
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3972.938,3985.669,That is not what is happening in these cases and I would submit that the whole purpose of the stop procedure is to allow the officers to look the individuals to seize them momentarily and make a decision as to whether they are going to allow the person free passage or --
1975.74-1560,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3985.669,3988.758,The only point is the stop --
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3988.758,3989.639,The only point is the stop --
1975.74-1560,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3989.639,3991.843,-- that you are objecting to.
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,3991.843,3994.524,"Well, that is the beginning of the whole intrusion."
1975.74-1560,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4005.331,4008.891,"You object to the guard looking in the car, do you?"
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,4008.891,4027.432,At a stop sign somewhere in the city any officer can look at traffic just as any citizen can but they cannot put up a road block to stop all north bound traffic 66 miles north to the boarder and above 19 communities and some two million inhabitants just to stop people to see if they look like citizens or local residents.
1975.74-1560,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4046.547,4050.765,When you see somebody laying down in the back of the car?
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,4050.765,4057.49,"Well, if he can see that, but the more typical case is just going to be the random arbitrary decision to refer someone --"
1975.74-1560,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4057.49,4059.985,"In this case that is what he did see, did not he?"
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,4059.985,4062.369,"Not in my case, no, there is no record on what he saw."
1975.74-1560,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4062.369,4064.855,In the Texas case he saw three of them.
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,4064.855,4067.048,"Laying down after the initial stop, correct."
1975.74-1560,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4067.048,4069.419,"Well, he had to do something then, did he not?"
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,4069.419,4085.356,"Well, it may have allowed for a further investigation but that is not the factors in my case and again I would do some hard back to my point that without a factual predicate under Brignoni-Ponce there is no basis for stopping an individual who is proceeding away from the border."
1975.74-1560,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4085.356,4088.422,Where was the illegal passenger in your case?
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,4088.422,4091.401,There were two women and they are seated up right in the passenger compartment.
1975.74-1560,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4091.401,4103.326,"Mr. Sevilla, I take if from what you have said, if your argument would be the same if you represented the non-Mexican who had been subjected only to the fleeting stop."
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,4103.326,4105.457,"Oh, yes, yes, but the point is that --"
1975.74-1560,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4105.457,4106.81,But he probably would not be in court?
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,4106.81,4107.609,He probably would not.
1975.74-1560,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4112.81,4123.734,"I understand that but the answer to my question is that if you represented a non-Mexican who had been stopped for five seconds, you would make the same constitutional argument."
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,4123.734,4128.714,"Yes, but there is more to it, if I was representing a non-Mexican individual."
1975.74-1560,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4133.122,4138.841,No you -- perhaps I have not stated the question correctly.
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,4165.341,4169.294,Constitutionally I would make the same argument practically I would take the case.
1975.74-1560,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4169.294,4171.318,Well what kind of case would you have?
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,4171.318,4172.127,What is that?
1975.74-1560,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4172.127,4173.533,All you would have is a plaintiff's case.
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,4173.533,4182.198,That is all we have and that is the whole point of the Fourth Amendment is to protect those intrusions so these people do not have to sue the government for a five second stop.
1975.74-1560,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4186.59,4199.936,I understand that but you are saying in fact that the constitutional intrusion is that initial five second stop that gives out officer an opportunity to take a look.
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,4199.936,4203.231,That is the beginning that is the constitutional intrusion.
1975.74-1560,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4207.315,4208.867,I understand.
1975.74-1560,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4208.867,4211.685,"So, you would have a plaintiff's case under Beavins?"
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,4211.685,4225.64,"We would have a plaintiff's case but as we stated in Ortiz to this court we quoted in the Amsterdam's article, there is no lawyer in the world that would take a case like that and that is why the Fourth Amendment require some protection for the innocent citizenry who travels north ward in the California."
1975.74-1560,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4231.925,4238.103,Counsel you should read some the petitions for certiorari in this Court and you would find that your statement is not supportive?
1975.74-1560,2,20134,charles_m_sevilla,,4238.103,4241.473,"I hardly written a few, Your Honor.[Laughing]"
1975.74-1560,3,35781,mark_l_evans,,4948.181,4948.854,I will make it brief.
1975.74-1560,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5020.611,5022.403,Thank you Mr. Evans.
