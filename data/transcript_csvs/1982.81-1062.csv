1982.81-1062,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,85.451,"I think you may proceed whenever you're ready, Mr. Frey."
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,85.451,89.495,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1062,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,217.975,224.629,"Mr. Frey, may I just ask, in this description are you describing the procedure under the Bank Secrecy Act or other forfeitures as well?"
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,224.629,238.279,"Well, Customs employs the... the Bank Secrecy Act itself has no procedural provisions, and they employ the general Customs provisions for the administrative remission process."
1982.81-1062,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,238.279,245.76,"Is... is... is your position that this case is typical of all forfeitures, or do we have a special problem under the Bank Secrecy Act in this case?"
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,245.76,246.12,No.
1982.81-1062,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,264.3,269.922,But generally we could consider it pretty much the same as say the seizure of a boat or an automobile and a narcotic?
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,269.922,273.233,"I don't think there are any material differences, yes."
1982.81-1062,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,331.929,335.708,What justification was presented for remission here?
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,335.708,355.606,"Well, in this case, as I understand it, the claimant asserted that she was not aware of her obligation to declare the money, because she believed that only money that had been acquired abroad would have to be declared."
1982.81-1062,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,359.168,366.789,"That she had carried it from the United States outside and then was bringing it back on the way to Canada, is that--"
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,366.789,367.164,Yes.
1982.81-1062,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,367.164,368.289,--That was the only justification?
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,368.289,379.706,"Well, I... I... actually the appendix does not contain the letter, and I have not read the letter of remission; so that is my understanding as to what her principal justification was."
1982.81-1062,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,653.548,657.984,What is the statute governing the... the statutory section governing the false statement count?
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,657.984,661.186,"1001, 18 U.S.C. 1001."
1982.81-1062,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,753.571,756.32,"Mr. Frey, before you get into your main argument, may I ask one other procedural question?"
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,760.412,761.24,Well--
1982.81-1062,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,761.24,763.786,--Cases other than those where there's delay involved.
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,766.269,768.58,--I think it's considerably higher.
1982.81-1062,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,768.58,769.44,Say it's 90 percent.
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,781.202,789.746,"Well, they have... they have a... they have a Bivens action possibly against the collector of the property."
1982.81-1062,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,789.746,793.681,"--What I mean, is there any routine statutory procedure for paying interest or anything else?"
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,793.681,793.993,No.
1982.81-1062,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,795.853,797.1,They may have a lawsuit is what they--
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,797.1,800.693,--They may... they may suffer an injury as a result of the delay.
1982.81-1062,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,800.693,802.927,"--And may have a Bivens-type claim, and that's... that's--"
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,802.927,806.582,"They may have a Bivens-type claim, although that has its own difficulties."
1982.81-1062,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,806.582,807.441,--Yeah.
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,807.441,809.424,I should say that under--
1982.81-1062,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,809.424,813.252,How... how about an action under the Federal Tort Claims Act or under the Tucker Act?
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,813.252,828.262,"--Well, Section 2680(c) of Title 28, which is a Federal Tort Claims Act provision, seems to bar any claim for delay... for damages due to a delay in connection with a Customs seizure."
1982.81-1062,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,949.526,952.759,Why do you say that's gone out of favor with some of the lower courts?
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,952.759,955.383,"--Well, it's been largely ignored in numerous cases."
1982.81-1062,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,970.909,974.813,"Yes, but if the Government has already seized the property and is holding it--"
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,974.813,977.485,"--Well, the statute of limitations--"
1982.81-1062,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,977.485,982.294,"--And so you've... it's sort of like you've started the case, in a sense."
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,989.759,990.946,--That is correct.
1982.81-1062,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,990.946,998.006,"Well, you could wait five years to start your action, but that doesn't say you can wait five years to seize the property."
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,998.006,1011.704,"Well, you could wait... it's clear that the statute of limitations contemplates the possibility or the likelihood that the property will have been seized because it's five years from the date of discovery of the offense."
1982.81-1062,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1011.704,1013.156,"Well, for example--"
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1013.156,1013.531,I don't--
1982.81-1062,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1013.531,1021.123,"--There's a statute of limitations in criminal cases, too, but you can't... can't arrest a person and then just wait five years to prosecute."
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1021.123,1050.048,"--Well, if... we... we make the point in our brief that if you were to analogize the seizure to the arrest of the person and apply the speedy trial analysis... which I assume if you could meet the speedy trial test you would also comply with due process requirements... that the claimant would not prevail in this case under the four factor speedy trial analysis; because while the length of the delay arguably would satisfy the requirements, she could not... there are good reasons for the delay."
1982.81-1062,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1050.048,1050.329,Right.
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1050.329,1055.045,There is no prejudice; and there never was a demand for the filing of a judicial proceeding.
1982.81-1062,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1055.045,1056.03,"Well, that's part of your argument."
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1056.03,1057.482,That is part of our argument.
1982.81-1062,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1057.482,1058.247,"Well, Mr. Frey--"
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1058.247,1060.341,I'm going to try to work it on in response to questions.
1982.81-1062,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1060.341,1062.497,--Now you know the best way you can.
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1077.131,1100.09,"Well, that's... we... we do concede that there... that the claimant, even though retrospectively title passed to the Government, at least at the time of the seizure, in our view, we do concede that in approaching this case the Court should recognize the existence of a property interest that requires some due process."
1982.81-1062,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1100.09,1107.213,A property interest that was seized that triggers some due process right to a hearing at some reasonable or meaningful time.
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1107.213,1108.103,In a meaningful time.
1982.81-1062,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1108.775,1114.881,"And it's your argument that the statute of limitations provides for the meaningful time, is that right?"
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1114.881,1142.027,"--Well, it is our argument that in general if their delay in instituting the action is not motivated by some invidious attempt to gain a tactical advantage that due process is satisfied by a hearing within the statute of limitations, taking into account the other remedies that are available to a person whose property has been seized if they wish to secure an earlier hearing on certain aspects of the matter."
1982.81-1062,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1142.027,1152.256,"Mr. Frey, isn't there a sort of a piece of paper that could be filed at the same time that the person is taken into custody which would protect the Government?"
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1152.256,1156.957,"Well, we think that is a very bad idea that is--"
1982.81-1062,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1156.957,1158.957,"But it is possible, isn't it?"
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1158.957,1168.563,"--It would be possible in most of these cases to file a complaint rather rapidly, but there are a lot of costs associated with that... a lot of costs, in our view."
1982.81-1062,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1168.563,1173.482,"Well, I know of one case in which all they did, they just filed a jeopardy assessment against the guy."
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1174.748,1179.308,"Well, now you're... you're in an area that I don't know very much about which is tax liens."
1982.81-1062,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1179.308,1187.274,"But I mean I'm just wondering about if you seize contraband, that's one thing, but this is good, solid money and it's not contraband."
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1187.274,1187.649,Right.
1982.81-1062,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1188.383,1190.538,"Except that it's over $5,000."
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1190.538,1191.772,Yes.
1982.81-1062,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1191.772,1208.202,"And I'm wondering if the Government, accepting all of your... what you say as being true, and it is... why there couldn't be some kind of thing... if you needed Congress, Congress could give it... of filing a piece of paper that would block this off."
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1208.202,1219.292,"Well, we do provide... I'm not sure in terms of filing something in court for the reasons that I will get into in my argument."
1982.81-1062,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1231.148,1231.226,That's money.
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1232.398,1242.317,"Well, but the same rules I think would apply if we seized an automobile or if we seized merchandise that's being brought into the country and there's some Customs violation."
1982.81-1062,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1242.317,1245.487,"Well, there's a lot of difference when you seize an automobile because of dope."
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1250.095,1250.439,No.
1982.81-1062,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1250.439,1253.343,The money is the crime itself.
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1253.343,1258.543,"Well, the non... the nondeclaration of the money is the forfeitable act."
1982.81-1062,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1267.525,1267.977,"Well, I know I don't understand--"
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1267.977,1275.115,--In cases where automobiles have been seized or other merchandise that's been brought in and improperly declared has been seized.
1982.81-1062,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1329.592,1338.76,"--Was there a statutory restriction on you're continuing to make the administrative remedy available after this suit was filed, or is that a matter of administrative policy?"
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1338.76,1341.4,"--I don't believe there has been a statutory restriction, but it is an administrative policy which I think reflects--"
1982.81-1062,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1341.4,1342.306,"Which... which could be changed, I suppose, then."
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1342.306,1342.681,--Hmmmm?
1982.81-1062,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1342.681,1343.947,That could be changed then if--
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1343.947,1357.644,"It could be changed, but... but... you see, what happens under the Court of Appeals decision is that Customs can't afford to conduct the administrative proceedings prior to the judicial proceeding, so it will have to go forward right away with the judicial suit."
1982.81-1062,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1369.842,1384.82,"--Mr. Frey, when we get into this subject of alternative remedies, what if... what if the Government let the statute of limitations run, say five years, in a case in which they had probable cause to believe they were entitled to the money or whatever might be seized, so there would be no Rule 41 remedy?"
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1394.004,1394.457,"Well, no."
1982.81-1062,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1400.454,1400.641,"But, supposing they don't?"
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1402.594,1405.203,"I can't... this has never happened, but I--"
1982.81-1062,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1405.203,1408.108,"I can't conceive of it happening, but does the citizen have a remedy if that should happen?"
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1408.108,1410.278,--I am certain... I am certain that they would have a remedy in that situation.
1982.81-1062,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1410.278,1411.169,What... what would it be?
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1411.169,1420.385,"Well, they have a remedy even before the five years if there's an unreasonable delay in bringing the forfeiture action, which is the equitable action under Slocum against Mayberry."
1982.81-1062,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1420.385,1423.477,Which is an action requiring them to institute a forfeiture proceeding.
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1427.037,1432.191,"Well, it would because the forfeiture proceeding would be instituted and judgment would be rendered for the claimant."
1982.81-1062,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1432.191,1434.175,After the statute had run?
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1434.175,1435.081,Yes.
1982.81-1062,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1453.277,1456.931,I have in mind the Treasure Salvors case last year.
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1463.258,1466.553,"--Well, I... I--"
1982.81-1062,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1466.553,1468.787,Where the initial seizure was supported by probable cause.
1982.81-1062,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1471.315,1477.532,"--Well, I'm not sure what the answer is."
1982.81-1062,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1689.713,1691.602,Very well.
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,1694.07,1697.428,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1982.81-1062,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1788.236,1790.406,"Well, is that a constitutional rule?"
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,1790.406,1808.149,"--Certainly, first of all, since the Government concedes that the remission petitions are to be decided under 19 U.S.C., Sections 1602, 1603 and 1604 have been interpreted by the various courts to apply to this situation."
1982.81-1062,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1846.524,1852.428,"Well, you're not suggesting that any First Amendment interest is involved in a certain amount of money, are you?"
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,1852.428,1852.647,--No.
1982.81-1062,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1904.876,1913.075,"Well, I suppose we don't have to decide that to resolve this case, do we, because the Government didn't wait that long, and you don't have to resolve that."
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,1935.723,1945.047,"--And this is where the facts become extremely important, and that's why the Government's continued assertion that the petitioner did not want a prompt hearing is totally belied by the record."
1982.81-1062,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2001.57,2003.117,"Well, where do we find that in the record, counsel?"
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2003.117,2006.46,"--It's in the Appendix, Your Honor."
1982.81-1062,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2040.024,2041.898,"Well, why can't they investigate both at the same time?"
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2041.898,2046.474,"Well, I'm not saying that Customs cannot investigate both at the same--"
1982.81-1062,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2046.474,2047.974,You say it's bad faith to do it?
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2047.974,2075.041,"--I'm not saying... it's bad faith to tell the attorney for a claimant that you are seriously considering a remission petition, get an interview of the claimant, when at the same time all you're trying to do is getting... is get an incriminating statement against the claimant to use in a criminal proceeding, and also induce the claimant not to ask for the forfeiture, judicial forfeiture proceedings because you're telling the claimant we are honestly going to consider your remission petition."
1982.81-1062,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2078.134,2079.884,"Well, now, is this all in the record?"
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2079.884,2081.257,"--Yes, it is all in the record."
1982.81-1062,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2081.257,2083.351,Do you cite appropriate places in your brief?
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2083.351,2083.866,"Yes, we did."
1982.81-1062,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2083.866,2086.474,Do you have a record citation?
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2087.474,2092.456,The entire civil forfeiture matter is in the Appendix.
1982.81-1062,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2092.456,2096.252,Do you have a page citation to the testimony that you're relying on?
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2096.252,2105.202,I believe it's at pages 53 to... 59 to 61 and 63 to 64 in the Appendix.
1982.81-1062,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2105.202,2105.889,Thank you.
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2111.105,2112.511,Could I have?
1982.81-1062,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2112.511,2113.838,Yes.
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2113.838,2116.337,"Well, first of all, the Government makes a big point of--"
1982.81-1062,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2116.337,2119.836,That's a very simple... could you or could you not?
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2119.836,2125.724,--If I wanted to go to the expense of filing an action to force them to file a forfeiture action.
1982.81-1062,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2125.724,2126.443,Most legal action costs money.
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2132.691,2135.549,Under that broad question the answer is yes.
1982.81-1062,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2135.549,2136.719,Did you?
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2136.719,2137.969,"No, I did not."
1982.81-1062,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2137.969,2140.328,"Well, how do you explain that?"
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2140.328,2141.141,Because--
1982.81-1062,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2141.141,2142.578,They said you delayed.
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2143.233,2144.201,"--No, I did not."
1982.81-1062,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2144.201,2148.746,Weren't you getting the... trying to get the Customs people to decide your case--
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2148.746,2150.98,What I was--
1982.81-1062,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2150.98,2151.634,--Without spending any money?
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2151.634,2153.291,--What I was trying to do--
1982.81-1062,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2153.291,2154.743,Without litigating.
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2154.743,2165.287,"--What I was trying to do was take advantage of what the Government was offering me and telling me they were going to treat in good faith; that is, the remission procedure."
1982.81-1062,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2170.536,2173.472,They lulled you... they lulled you into giving up your rights.
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2173.472,2175.549,--More than lulled.
1982.81-1062,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2177.736,2180.157,But didn't you go to law school to prevent people from lulling you?
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2180.157,2193.136,"--I also learned in law school and... that if the Government tells you something that they are doing that you supposedly can rely upon what they're telling you, and if they're lying to you that you have a recourse afterwards."
1982.81-1062,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2193.136,2196.259,"If the Government says they're going to do your work for you, you don't have to do it."
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2196.259,2200.305,I'm not saying that they were telling me they were doing their work for me.
1982.81-1062,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2208.848,2215.065,"Mr. Sherman, you appealed the felony conviction and won a reversal."
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2215.065,2215.767,That's correct.
1982.81-1062,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2215.767,2217.298,Has she ever been retried?
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2217.298,2217.814,No.
1982.81-1062,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2217.814,2219.172,Do you know why?
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2219.172,2225.419,"Well, the Government dismissed... it was on the Government motion that the criminal case was dismissed."
1982.81-1062,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2226.607,2233.884,"Mr. Sherman, neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals found bad faith on the part of the Government, did they?"
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2233.884,2245.333,"--Well, I believe that although the words ""bad faith"" were not used, the Court of Appeals found that there was absolutely no justification for the Government delaying in this case."
1982.81-1062,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2245.333,2251.643,"They found that the failure was unjustified but did not find bad faith, isn't that correct?"
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2251.643,2266.637,"Well, again, Justice O'Connor, they did not use the word 18-month delay in filing the forfeiture action without any valid justification whatsoever certainly be read--"
1982.81-1062,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2266.637,2270.307,"They just found it was too long, that's all, not bad faith, isn't that right?"
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2270.307,2274.134,"--Again, they did not use the words ""bad faith""."
1982.81-1062,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2306.575,2307.98,"Well, then I amend my question."
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2311.212,2314.461,"--No, I did not try to file any legal action."
1982.81-1062,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2404.863,2432.258,"Mr. Sherman, it sounds to me as though it's pretty logical for the Government agents, for the Treasury Department to investigate in connection with a remission petition whether there's some underlying criminal activity afoot; that that's an appropriate thing to do in deciding whether some administrative petition to return the money is appropriate to grant."
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2444.143,2455.702,"Your... Justice O'Connor, the Government concedes that if I would have filed no petition whatsoever within a 60-day period that very soon thereafter they would have been required to file a judicial forfeiture action."
1982.81-1062,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2464.995,2468.104,I didn't understand that to be a Government concession.
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2468.104,2468.884,--Yes.
1982.81-1062,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2471.509,2473.616,Show me where in the brief that's stated.
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2473.616,2478.16,--May I have my associate look for it while I--
1982.81-1062,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2478.16,2478.551,Surely.
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2478.551,2486.174,"--The... if you file no petition for remission, then Customs has nothing to consider, so all they do is have the money."
1982.81-1062,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2494.139,2497.794,"Well, maybe the next step would be the filing of a criminal prosecution."
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2497.794,2511.148,"--First of all, the criminal prosecution took place... the indictment was returned some nine months after the seizure of the funds, so there might be a question right there: Is nine months considered prompt?"
1982.81-1062,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2554.162,2555.661,"Well, what was she convicted of?"
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2555.661,2560.392,--She was convicted of 1001 which eventually was overturned on the appeal.
1982.81-1062,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2560.392,2561.704,"A more serious offense, right?"
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2562.423,2565.579,"Yes, but--"
1982.81-1062,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2565.579,2568.468,"The jury was satisfied of her guilt on that, I take it."
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2568.468,2579.574,"--Well, yes, because the court file which showed a prior criminal record was put into the jury room, and so the Court of Appeals held that they were obviously influenced by extrinsic matters, and so they reversed the conviction."
1982.81-1062,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2587.836,2590.615,"Well, they... they didn't really give her a clean bill of health either."
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2590.615,2591.818,"Well, they acquitted her."
1982.81-1062,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2606.329,2611.685,"Well, they didn't give her a clean bill of health as being guilty of making a material false statement to the Government."
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2611.685,2624.369,"Well, if you want to say that they did not give a clean bill of health because they were influenced by improper evidence put into the jury room, no, they did not give her a clean bill of health."
1982.81-1062,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2786.505,2788.505,How long did they hold it here?
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2788.505,2789.318,Eighteen months.
1982.81-1062,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2789.318,2793.065,"That's quite a ways off from five years, isn't it?"
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2793.065,2796.377,"It's also a lot of a ways off from a common understanding of the word ""promptly""."
1982.81-1062,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2796.377,2798.688,How about Lovasco?
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2798.688,2802.812,"Lovasco, I think as Justice White--"
1982.81-1062,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2802.812,2804.842,"It was 17 1/2 months, wasn't it?"
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2804.842,2821.711,"--Lovasco was a pre-indictment situation, and the Court, to give a little summary, has basically said nobody has a right to be arrested or indicted; that basically it's a prosecutorial discretionary decision as to when to proceed with a criminal case."
1982.81-1062,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2935.679,2938.724,You think you had no obligation to show prejudice?
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,2938.724,2943.175,I'm not saying that I have no obligation to know prejudice.
1982.81-1062,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3007.823,3012.726,"Well, do you suggest that there was any prejudice other than being deprived of the use of the money?"
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3012.726,3019.833,I am not suggesting that there was prejudice in the sense of being able to put on the defense of the case.
1982.81-1062,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3021.472,3024.488,"On this record there was no defense, was there?"
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3024.488,3026.252,"--Yes, there was a defense."
1982.81-1062,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3046.868,3049.712,"Well, I'm talking about... I'm talking about the physical evidence."
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3054.569,3056.038,--Not at all.
1982.81-1062,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3079.403,3080.418,"Well, Mr.... Mr.--"
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3080.418,3081.153,Sherman.
1982.81-1062,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3081.153,3086.932,"--Sherman, 19(a) where the... Judge Curtis' findings of law, he says,"
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3105.236,3109.343,"By way of stipulated testimony as to what claimant would say, yes."
1982.81-1062,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3121.496,3123.152,"Well, she had nothing to gain by being tried earlier."
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3124.807,3143.502,"Well, Your Honor, I would quote back to this Court many cases that say that to one who protests against the taking of his property without due process of law it is no answer to say in his particular case due process of law would have led to the same result because he had no defense upon the merits."
1982.81-1062,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3153.201,3155.014,"Well, when you come right down... when you come right down to it, what difference does it make?"
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3155.014,3159.964,"Well, then why... then why have Fourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, Sixth Amendment?"
1982.81-1062,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3167.025,3168.009,"Well, I'm not saying any way we want."
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3190.218,3207.618,"Not gives up... Your Honor, if I'm sitting in this courtroom and one of your marshall comes over to me and takes my wallet under some theory, and takes my wallet and takes it into his office and holds it for five years, and you're saying to me I have no rights to try to get that property back."
1982.81-1062,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3207.618,3209.35,"Well, I'm not really addressing that situation."
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3223.158,3229.5,"Well, you're accepting the fact that she had no justifiable belief in what she was doing."
1982.81-1062,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3229.5,3235.528,"I am accepting Judge Curtis' findings of fact made after a full evidentiary hearing, I take it."
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3235.528,3246.43,"Well, again, I would just quote to you that the end result is not the determining factor as to whether or not there's been a violation of due process."
1982.81-1062,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3256.223,3258.409,"Counsel, may I ask a question?"
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3278.214,3278.574,That's correct.
1982.81-1062,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3278.574,3281.4,Did you... did you prepare the stipulation?
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3282.634,3283.571,Yes.
1982.81-1062,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3285.337,3285.726,Right.
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3290.319,3290.944,No.
1982.81-1062,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3297.69,3302.704,But it was based upon an absolutely false statement made to a Customs officer.
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3302.704,3303.017,No.
1982.81-1062,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3316.542,3324.602,You're saying lying to a Customs officer is... is perfectly appropriate and--
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3324.602,3324.867,--No.
1982.81-1062,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3324.867,3330.082,--Therefore there was no... no one... that therefore the conduct of the Government was unlawful at that time?
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3330.082,3339.469,"If you lie to a Custom officer and fill out the forfeiture form, they can't... and I mean, excuse me, fill out the appropriate reporting form, they can't forfeit your property."
1982.81-1062,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3356.027,3359.774,"Oh, I understand the forfeiture is a different question, but we were talking about whether or not--"
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3359.774,3360.915,"But... but, Your Honor--"
1982.81-1062,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3360.915,3363.523,--The initial seizure was valid by the Government... Government.
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3363.523,3366.757,--That's not a question as to whether the seizure--
1982.81-1062,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3366.757,3367.678,"Well, that... that's the question I was addressing."
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3367.678,3368.132,--I'm sorry.
1982.81-1062,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3380.984,3383.577,"Well, wouldn't that have been... shouldn't that have been her answer?"
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3389.105,3397.962,"Well, that's what... you know, Your Honor, that's why people make mistakes, because they don't understand certain Customs forms, and in fact, she was acquitted on that very charge."
1982.81-1062,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3397.962,3399.931,--I didn't say anything about the Customs form.
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3399.931,3401.492,"Yes, that should have been her answer."
1982.81-1062,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3401.492,3407.412,"I said that she should have said... you know, it's to answer the truth, the whole truth."
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3407.412,3409.942,"Well, she believed that she was answering truthfully."
1982.81-1062,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3409.942,3411.989,And she was answering the whole truth.
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3411.989,3413.036,That's what she believed.
1982.81-1062,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3413.036,3414.505,That's what she believed.
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3414.505,3414.972,That's what she believed.
1982.81-1062,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3414.972,3415.675,And that's what you believe.
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3415.675,3418.205,"Well, that's what the jury believed."
1982.81-1062,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3418.205,3421.814,That's not what I asked.
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3437.573,3440.4,"No, I don't... I don't accept... I accept that she did in fact lose--"
1982.81-1062,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3440.4,3440.978,--Yeah.
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3440.978,3442.164,"--On the merits issue, but I'm saying--"
1982.81-1062,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3442.164,3444.368,And you're not asking us to review... to review that determination.
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3444.368,3456.986,"--Well, I'm asking you to review it in the sense that if we assume that the remission petition are subject to due process requirements, which I believe they are, that... and no reason was given in the remission--"
1982.81-1062,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3456.986,3458.33,"Well, aren't you just arguing even a guilty person is entitled to a fair trial?"
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3459.236,3460.001,--Exactly.
1982.81-1062,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3460.001,3466.03,"So you can assume for purposes of that argument that she's ""guilty"" in the sense that she loses on the merits in the forfeiture case."
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3466.03,3466.343,Yes.
1982.81-1062,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3474.153,3475.778,"Yes, but you're also... you're saying more than that."
1982.81-1062,1,43674,victor_sherman,,3479.807,3492.943,"Well, Barker v. Wingo says that even though it may be a harsh result for purposes of the Government to dismiss the action, that's the only remedy."
1982.81-1062,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3503.797,3504.922,"Thank you, Mr. Sherman."
1982.81-1062,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3508.233,3510.435,"Yes, I do, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1062,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3525.586,3527.788,What about Barker?
1982.81-1062,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3527.788,3537.064,"Well, I'm not sure that... I'm not sure that Barker is... is an analogous situation for purposes of remedy."
1982.81-1062,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3537.799,3543.953,"Well, are you arguing that even if there was unreasonable delay, the proceeding should not have been... the forfeiture proceeding should not have been dismissed?"
1982.81-1062,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3543.953,3547.467,"--Yes, definitely."
1982.81-1062,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3547.467,3548.217,"Well, what about Barker?"
1982.81-1062,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3548.217,3554.043,"Well, I don't think there... I think there the proper analogy is to Carey v. Piphus."
1982.81-1062,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3630.605,3632.23,What about Rule 41?
1982.81-1062,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3635.448,3636.011,"Oh, oh, yes."
1982.81-1062,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3648.583,3653.316,"--Well, 54(b) says that these rules do not apply to a civil forfeiture proceeding."
1982.81-1062,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3653.316,3656.409,"--Well, this is not... the Rule 41(e) motion is not a civil forfeiture proceeding."
1982.81-1062,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3656.409,3657.267,Right.
1982.81-1062,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3657.267,3659.86,The Rule 41(e) motion is brought to the time.
1982.81-1062,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3664.171,3664.359,Yes.
1982.81-1062,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3668.216,3668.731,--Not at all.
1982.81-1062,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3669.419,3670.294,"--It would be in a criminal cases, is that it?"
1982.81-1062,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3670.294,3671.073,--No.
1982.81-1062,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3679.289,3679.867,It's a proceeding in itself?
1982.81-1062,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3679.867,3680.507,--Hmmm?
1982.81-1062,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3680.507,3681.757,It's a proceeding in itself?
1982.81-1062,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3681.757,3682.945,"It's an independent proceeding, I believe."
1982.81-1062,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3682.945,3685.756,"Yes, but you only prevail on that if there's no probable cause, don't you?"
1982.81-1062,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3690.801,3700.983,"Well, that's why... that's why the need for a prompt judicial filing, which is in fact suicidal for the interests of the claimant, is very much reduced because there is probable cause in these cases."
1982.81-1062,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3700.983,3703.732,"--Well, if... I don't understand."
1982.81-1062,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3706.295,3708.575,If there's probable cause.
1982.81-1062,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3708.575,3709.949,And assume there is.
1982.81-1062,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3710.605,3721.74,"So the class of... when we... when we are making the due process inquiry, whether a meaningful... what the risk of error is in failing to provide a prompt judicial forfeiture action as opposed to a deferred one, we must--"
1982.81-1062,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3721.74,3725.614,--It's the risk measured by the difference between probable cause and preponderance whatever that is.
1982.81-1062,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3725.614,3727.004,--By the... yes.
1982.81-1062,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3727.707,3728.801,A clear and convincing--
1982.81-1062,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3728.801,3729.832,--Existence of an affirmative defense.
1982.81-1062,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3737.61,3742.873,"--We're talking about that small percentage in which you ultimately lose, which you say in your brief is 20 percent but on reflection you think is significantly less."
1982.81-1062,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3749.778,3749.996,"--No, no, no, no."
1982.81-1062,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3754.368,3755.774,--Of the litigated cases.
1982.81-1062,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3755.774,3758.742,"--Of the 25,000 cases, about two-thirds are settled."
1982.81-1062,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3766.363,3767.207,It's the litigated cases.
1982.81-1062,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3767.207,3768.332,--Of a few hundred litigated cases.
1982.81-1062,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3770.784,3771.752,"Thank you, gentlemen."
