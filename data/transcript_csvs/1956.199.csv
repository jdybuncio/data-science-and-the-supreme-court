1956.199,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,14.669,"Number 199, Earl R. Deen versus Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Company."
1956.199,0,39407,robert_lee_guthrie,,14.669,16.03,May it please the Court.
1956.199,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,16.03,20.386,Mr. Guthrie.
1956.199,0,39407,robert_lee_guthrie,,20.386,30.913,This is a case that arises under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.
1956.199,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,159.458,160.969,Place the babbitt where?
1956.199,0,39407,robert_lee_guthrie,,160.969,164.838,"In the new pot for melting, in the new -- new steel pot."
1956.199,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,164.838,166.756,Yes.
1956.199,0,39407,robert_lee_guthrie,,166.756,174.826,"Now, Your Honors, the steel pot weighed about 250 pounds."
1956.199,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,692.484,693.384,"But, Mr. Guthrie --"
1956.199,0,39407,robert_lee_guthrie,,693.384,693.541,"Yes, sir?"
1956.199,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,693.541,703.831,"-- how did that become an issue when you did not feel the question of the issues found in favor of the railroad were not an issue on appeal, were they?"
1956.199,0,39407,robert_lee_guthrie,,703.831,713.766,"I don't think so, Your Honor -- Your Honor but the -- the Court of Civil Appeals ignored my findings and only puts the findings in favor of the railway --"
1956.199,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,713.766,719.606,Naturally because the burden of proof was upon you to carry the risk of persuasion to the jury and --
1956.199,0,39407,robert_lee_guthrie,,719.606,719.628,Yes.
1956.199,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,719.628,722.345,-- you did and they made these findings in your favor.
1956.199,0,39407,robert_lee_guthrie,,722.345,722.5,That's correct.
1956.199,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,722.5,730.063,"Now, the question is limited, is it not then, to the findings what the jury made in your favor and are they adequate to support the judgment?"
1956.199,0,39407,robert_lee_guthrie,,730.063,732.033,"Yes, sir, I think that's correct."
1956.199,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,985.581,993.494,Mr. Hudson.
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,993.494,996.203,May it please the Court.
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1706.941,1714.269,"Will you tell me, how are we to read this determination as a finding of contributory negligence as a matter of law?"
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,1714.269,1716.558,"No, sir, a finding of no negligence."
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1716.558,1719.036,"Well now, I don't follow that."
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,1724.968,1725.52,"Yes, sir."
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1725.52,1727.936,It says that sufficient men were available.
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,1727.936,1728.408,"Yes, sir."
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1728.408,1729.063,Right?
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,1729.063,1729.425,"Yes, sir."
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1729.425,1743.182,"Then it does say if it does not include a finding that the babbitt could have been thus removed with reasonable safety, we need only to further determine whether the record shows that if Deen had used sufficient help, the babbitt could have been manually removed with reasonable safety."
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,1759.657,1760.017,That's right.
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1760.017,1764.529,"Now, why isn't that a finding of contributory negligence as a matter of law?"
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,1764.529,1767.294,"It's -- no, sir, it's not a finding of contributory negligent as a matter of law."
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1769.836,1779.492,"Well, all right, as a matter of fact whatever it is, it was a -- it was a finding not that the company was not negligent but that Deen's negligence was the sole cause of his injury, isn't it?"
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,1779.492,1780.22,"No, sir."
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1781.794,1784.062,"Well, it's -- well, let me ask you one other question --"
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,1784.062,1784.464,"Yes, sir."
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1784.952,1793.336,Determinations are not turned under the Federal Employers' Liability Act are they on intricacies of state practice or even on issue --
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,1793.336,1795.812,"I'm -- I'm sorry, sir, I missed the first part of that question."
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1795.812,1809.156,"I say, determinations under the Federal Employers' Liability Act are not made upon state procedural niceties nor indeed on state laws to negligence or contributory negligence of causation, are they?"
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,1809.156,1809.617,"No, sir."
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1837.867,1838.781,"Well, I understand that."
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,1867.583,1868.306,"No, sir."
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1868.855,1869.289,All right.
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,1869.289,1869.904,-- that's -- that's where I get --
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1869.904,1872.315,I know that's where I -- but I'm telling you my difficulty.
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,1872.315,1875.173,That's where I get involved in this special issue business.
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1901.789,1907.026,"Well, I might -- I'm not sure whether my notes are inaccurate but I think they are."
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,1920.448,1921.357,I think that's correct.
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1921.357,1925.442,Then they pick up what to me all relate to contributory negligence.
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,1925.442,1926.23,"No, sir."
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1926.23,1971.952,"The fourth one is that respondent did not fail to furnish one or more men in addition to the one who assisted the petitioner, that the respondent did not fail to give proper supervision of the petitioner, that petitioner's failure and -- or negligence in failing to obtain additional men that -- was a proximate cause that he was not negligent in the manner and method he used, that the respondent and its supervisory employee should have reasonably anticipated that he would do it the way he attempted to do it, that the sole proximate cause of his injury was not due to his own acts, and therefore that finding negligence on the part of the employer and contributory negligence on the part of the -- of Deen, they -- as the statute requires him to do, evaluate the two and arrived at the result they did."
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,1985.648,1986.407,"No, sir."
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2047.794,2049.116,"Well now, was that what they found?"
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2053.527,2053.801,"Yes, sir."
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2053.801,2056.324,-- in addition to the one who assisted the petitioner.
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2068.746,2069.147,"Yes, sir."
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2079.431,2085.012,"Were available but does that say that they were furnished, affirmatively that they were furnished?"
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2085.012,2089.52,"Well, I don't quarrel with Your Honor about the difference between available and furnished."
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2095.752,2096.819,"Well, he didn't as I --"
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2096.819,2099.266,"I mean they weren't -- they weren't forced on him, Your Honor."
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2099.266,2101.063,"Well, I think you want to know what's on my mind that what he (Voice Overlap) --"
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2101.063,2102.759,"Yes, sir, that's what I'm here for."
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2102.759,2104.668,"Well, I think -- what's on my mind is this."
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2125.75,2145.979,"Your Honor, what you got to understand to understand my position and the position the Court of Civil Appeals as second nature to us in the state court that you see I couldn't get an issue worded, do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant furnished sufficient number of help to do the work with reasonable safety?"
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2174.269,2186.005,"Well, isn't your difficulty -- I don't think of the name of the case but hasn't this Court already said that in actions under this Act, we're not going to be concerned with these intricacies and technicalities of state pleading?"
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2186.005,2186.44,Well --
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2186.44,2188.084,Problem of a --
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2188.084,2190.279,This -- I'm sure you have.
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2249.235,2266.684,"But -- but right after the Court says that there was a finding that sufficient men were available, then he goes on to say, ""We need only to further determine whether the record shows that if Deen had used sufficient help, the babbitt could have been manually removed to a reasonable safety."""
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2266.684,2266.912,"Yes, sir."
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2266.912,2270.5,"Now, isn't that related to Deen's own action?"
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2277.429,2280.471,"No, sir, because of this proposition."
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2297.103,2298.783,That was Mr. Justice Douglas.
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2298.783,2309.498,"Well, then Mr. Justice Douglas may remember in that case the -- there was a showing that on other ships they used ice chipper to get the ice cream out, it could be done with safety."
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2361.289,2367.897,"Well, actually all these other available workers were there because they were doing other jobs."
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2370.712,2371.045,"No, sir."
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2371.045,2371.161,And that --
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2371.161,2376.319,"They were -- they were there -- they were there, the records -- now, there where we got a jury finding of judgment."
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2380.195,2386.463,"Yes, but on -- on previous occasions, I gather, when this thing had been done, he was the one who would call upon these others, was it not?"
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2386.463,2387.378,"That's right, sir."
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2387.378,2389.358,"And in this instance, he didn't call upon them."
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2389.358,2389.989,"That's right, sir."
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2389.989,2397.677,"But they were there for any purpose of doing -- helping him to do his job, at least the railroad didn't assign them there for that purpose did they?"
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2397.677,2402.09,As a matter of fact the supervisory employees did not know when he testified.
1956.199,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2404.813,2413.479,"Well, then how could possibly they -- the finding that the railroad had furnished the man to do the job if they didn't even know he was going to do the job?"
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2413.479,2419.419,"Well, the -- the point is, Your Honor, there -- the way they operate there, there's bull gang they call in."
1956.199,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2512.008,2514.464,"Now, what about the finding in number 15?"
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2514.464,2515.056,I beg your pardon sir?
1956.199,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2515.056,2517.941,Finding number 15 in connection to this one.
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2517.941,2519.289,I don't remember it by a number judge --
1956.199,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2519.289,2533.888,"I said do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant railway company had supervised the (Inaudible) or whatever it is, should have reasonably anticipated that the plaintiff would perform the work which caused his injuries in the way and manner in which he did this (Voice Overlap) --"
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2533.888,2536.086,"Yes, sir, that's -- excuse me."
1956.199,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2546.366,2548.402,"Well, it says the manner which he did it."
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2548.402,2550.882,"Well, he did it by hand is distinct from some mechanical method."
1956.199,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2550.882,2554.542,"He did it without any help too, without the help you say that he suppose to have."
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2554.542,2557.804,"Yes, sir."
1956.199,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2571.415,2575.752,"What about this -- may I ask you this, I don't quite understand this number 13."
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2585.09,2586.682,"That's right, manually."
1956.199,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2595.266,2598.06,You suppose the jury understood that manually?
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2598.06,2603.23,"Well, they didn't, Judge, I argued pretty loud and long and I -- as I say, I can get --"
1956.199,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2603.23,2604.098,Did you ask for it?
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2606.395,2606.915,"Yes, sir."
1956.199,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2606.915,2607.661,Manually?
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2607.661,2608.667,"No, no, no, manually."
1956.199,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2613.033,2616.233,Why didn't you put manually in if that's what you meant?
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2616.233,2617.688,"I'd hadn't plead it that way, Judge."
1956.199,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2620.786,2624.56,"When you say we have to consider, it means manually?"
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2624.56,2626.352,"Oh, I don't say you have to, Judge, I don't --"
1956.199,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2626.352,2628.574,"Well, I -- I'm just -- I was trying to get just what it was."
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2628.574,2632.934,On that -- that's what it -- that's what it meant to me and that's what it meant to the appellate court.
1956.199,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2640.442,2643.088,"Well, the jury didn't have the word ""manually"" though."
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2643.088,2643.409,"No, sir."
1956.199,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2647.58,2658.304,"He also did it with one or more persons helping him, whatever all the circumstances are out there, I would have thought that meant (Inaudible) or maybe that has nothing to do with the findings."
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2658.304,2659.385,"Well, I don't think it gets us --"
1956.199,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2659.385,2660.717,Maybe it has no relevance.
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2660.717,2664.699,"I -- Mr. Justice Black, it doesn't have anything to do with where we are now."
1956.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2666.957,2669.514,"No, the red light comes on and your time is up."
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2669.514,2675.871,"All right, I'll -- let me take these last few minutes then to hit this issue of pleading."
1956.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2793.797,2795.465,"You may finish your sentence, Mr. Hudson."
1956.199,1,34588,luther_hudson,,2795.465,2797.929,They are all invented by the plaintiff on the witness stand.
1956.199,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2816.488,2823.493,"Mr. McCord -- Mr. Guthrie, I beg your pardon."
1956.199,2,39407,robert_lee_guthrie,,2823.493,2825.645,If the Court please.
1956.199,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2943.925,2945.743,"Did the jury found that against him, didn't it?"
1956.199,2,39407,robert_lee_guthrie,,2945.743,2946.194,Sir?
1956.199,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2946.194,2947.554,The jury found that in the charge again?
1956.199,2,39407,robert_lee_guthrie,,2947.554,2951.957,"Yes, sir, but they found the proper tools for us, Your Honor."
