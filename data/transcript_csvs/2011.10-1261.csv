2011.10-1261,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,0.0,8.52,"We will hear argument next in Case Number 10-1261, Credit Suisse Securities v. Simmonds."
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,11.389,13.674,"Justice Scalia, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1261,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,90.841,91.76,"Counsel, would--"
2011.10-1261,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,91.76,99.53,"On your first -- on your first point, you cite Lampf, but Lampf had two limits."
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,132.92,143.641,"Your Honor, with respect, it's certainly true that a two-pronged time limit underscores that the outer prong is a period of repose, but there are certainly no magic words that Congress has to use."
2011.10-1261,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,167.874,170.209,But what takes you out of that background rule in this case?
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,184.702,185.219,"--Sure, Your Honor."
2011.10-1261,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,185.819,186.57,The--
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,186.57,193.741,"--The key point, Your Honor, is that this Congress in the 1934 Exchange Act was carefully attuned to the issue of time limits."
2011.10-1261,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,230.333,230.766,--Right.
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,251.696,252.696,"Two things, Your Honor."
2011.10-1261,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,287.753,291.588,The problem is it reads like dozens of statutes of limitations.
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,316.538,317.255,"--Two things, Your Honor."
2011.10-1261,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,341.371,343.706,"Well, I could turn the argument around on you."
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,359.579,363.933,"--Again, Your Honor, I think one point, just to respond to that, and as well to Justice Ginsburg's question."
2011.10-1261,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,408.729,410.112,Is that -- is that true?
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,429.31,431.911,"Your Honor, I think we can't say that there is a bright-line rule."
2011.10-1261,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,444.802,457.979,"--Well, the problem is that the injury here is the defendant's conduct, meaning if the nature of the claim, as is here, is that someone has received a profit they are not entitled to, then the injury is the same."
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,463.633,464.733,--Clearly to the--
2011.10-1261,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,464.733,471.737,"--textually the nature of the claim here is the very injury, plaintiff's injury."
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,471.737,478.642,"--Well, Your Honor, again, one of the things about this statute that is kind of odd, it's a prophylactic statute that doesn't even require any injury."
2011.10-1261,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,483.327,488.081,"Well, disgorgement is injury, meaning that it's something that -- that you are taking away from someone else."
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,488.081,489.648,--But it's taking it away from the defendant.
2011.10-1261,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,492.566,501.172,"Tell me what logic there is in reading this as a statute of repose, other than your argument about finality and its importance."
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,501.172,501.722,I think--
2011.10-1261,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,501.722,522.671,"If we take your adversary's position that this statute of limitations was geared under an understanding that an insider would in fact make the requirements -- would file the statements required by 16(a), then it makes absolute sense to think of it as a statute of repose."
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,536.595,548.153,"--I think the key point, Your Honor, is to look at the 1934 Exchange Act as a whole, which includes not only this provision but also out-and-out fraud provisions that are for intentional, real hard-core insider trading."
2011.10-1261,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,588.03,590.146,"--Well, it -- it's not simply prophylactic."
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,628.855,634.007,"Your Honor, for the same reason that Congress would have afforded repose even to out and out fraudsters."
2011.10-1261,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,647.567,667.996,"Judge Posner, Mr. Landau, has a theory for why it is that fraud is treated differently from the 16(b) offenses, and it's that it's much more important to prevent strategic behavior involving timing in fraud suits -- the stock price goes up, the stock price goes down -- whereas in these suits damages are fixed."
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,673.984,677.536,"Well, like many of Judge Posner's theories, it's -- it's a very clever theory."
2011.10-1261,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,695.331,701.151,"Well, you have one theory, which deals with culpability; and he has another theory, which deals with strategic behavior."
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,714.909,730.352,"--Well, again, the only thing I will say on repose before -- and I would like to turn then, because we certainly don't need repose to win this case, and -- and while we think it is best characterized, this Court in Lampf had occasion to look at all of the, the various time limits and see how they all worked together."
2011.10-1261,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,755.219,757.404,"Of course, Lampf was a disaster, wasn't it?"
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,759.904,762.64,"Absolutely not, Your Honor."
2011.10-1261,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,774.698,777.666,"Before you turn away from the statute of repose, could I just ask you one more question--"
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,777.666,778.235,--Absolutely.
2011.10-1261,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,778.235,779.052,--on -- on that?
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,790.142,797.829,"Your Honor, they can find out in many ways, the same ways that any other securities plaintiff, including a fraud securities plaintiff, can find out."
2011.10-1261,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,838.823,841.373,What would -- what are the other filings that might disclose this?
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,841.373,845.393,"Well, Your Honor, again, like -- this case is a good example."
2011.10-1261,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,859.486,866.923,Is there a public document that a -- that a shareholder can look at to see whether an insider has traded within 6 months?
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,866.923,872.144,"Well, Your Honor, there is not a -- there is not a Form 4, which is a public document."
2011.10-1261,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,875.896,876.979,I didn't ask that.
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,882.683,885.818,"--Well, again, there may be SEC filings."
2011.10-1261,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,886.987,888.104,That's a big thing.
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,889.272,893.324,"--Well, no, there -- there are SEC filings that companies are required to make."
2011.10-1261,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,908.3,910.602,So what is the likelihood that a broker's going to turn you in?
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,910.602,911.702,There are whistle blowers.
2011.10-1261,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,912.804,915.906,"That's a very nice thing, but how likely is that?"
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,915.906,918.608,"--Your Honor, brokers have their own responsibilities."
2011.10-1261,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,923.843,928.897,How would the broker know that the -- that his principal didn't file a form he was required to?
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,928.897,934.635,"Well, again, the -- the broker may get suspicious if the -- a broker may actually be checking."
2011.10-1261,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,972.923,974.359,How about the Second Circuit rule?
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,974.359,988.883,"The Second Circuit rule is more of a notice approach that says that it -- but again, Your Honor, the problem with the Second Circuit's approach is that it doesn't reflect traditional background norms of equitable tolling."
2011.10-1261,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1098.104,1103.658,"Mr. Landau, if we were to agree with you on one or both of those two things, wouldn't the normal course be to remand?"
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1106.46,1112.514,"Our best argument, Your Honor, is that the district court in this case already decided the very issue here."
2011.10-1261,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1153.089,1156.71,We had to accept the plaintiffs' allegations as true.
2011.10-1261,0,19410,christopher_landau,,1171.236,1176.79,"--Correct, Your Honor, but you are entitled, in deciding that, to look at their own pleadings."
2011.10-1261,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1262.143,1276.336,"Justice Scalia, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1261,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1324.167,1329.554,"Well, if you were drafting a statute of repose, how would you phrase it other than the way this is phrased?"
2011.10-1261,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1329.554,1339.759,"I think normally what Congress does is it says there should be no jurisdiction after a particular time, because it's not trying to differentiate among the application of different equitable background principles."
2011.10-1261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1340.928,1350.467,"Yes, but we've -- we've said that, under our recent jurisprudence anyway, we would -- we would treat that as a statute of limitations."
2011.10-1261,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1355.105,1356.488,--Justice--
2011.10-1261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1356.488,1367.763,"Do you think whenever -- whenever we encounter a -- a statute of limitations that is -- is phrased in jurisdictional term, there can be no tolling?"
2011.10-1261,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1367.763,1379.136,"--I think, Justice Scalia, that where you have statutes that say there shall be no jurisdiction after a particular time, this Court has read them to cut off equitable tolling after that time."
2011.10-1261,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1401.584,1415.994,"Before you get to that, do you have an example of a -- a classic statute of repose that we -- I could look at to see how they should be phrased, and not one that says that there shall be tolling -- there shall not be tolling except in some circumstances, one that just says,"
2011.10-1261,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1419.478,1426.117,"You mean other than statutes as in Merck and Lampf, et al., where there were tiered structures?"
2011.10-1261,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1426.117,1426.484,Right.
2011.10-1261,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1428.834,1439.942,"I think that the statute in Beggerly was an example where the Court said, even though it runs from accrual, it incorporates a discovery rule and it sets a 12-year limit."
2011.10-1261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1494.946,1501.699,I don't -- I think you understate the -- the strength of the Petitioners' argument in -- in this regard.
2011.10-1261,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1532.221,1537.456,"Justice Scalia, I don't know what else to say except that that would overrule Exploration Company and Delaware State College."
2011.10-1261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1537.456,1538.122,That's what we said in Merck.
2011.10-1261,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1557.966,1564.62,"Well, that's right, but the -- the reason that that language created a period of repose was because of the structural inference."
2011.10-1261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1570.774,1577.364,"Well, but what if those three provisions had been -- you know, followed each other immediately."
2011.10-1261,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1593.123,1599.21,I -- I think the implication would be that in the others Congress created a period of repose by using very specific language to do that.
2011.10-1261,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1614.303,1618.955,If you extinguish the claim -- the statute of limitations doesn't terminate the claim.
2011.10-1261,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1632.014,1632.714,No question.
2011.10-1261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1635.049,1637.918,"Maybe -- maybe you'd better go -- well, go on."
2011.10-1261,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1659.681,1661.131,"--No, Justice Scalia."
2011.10-1261,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1681.195,1681.945,"But is that right, Mr. Wall?"
2011.10-1261,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1696.37,1697.222,--Absolutely.
2011.10-1261,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1718.22,1729.593,"But I think Mr. Landau's point -- it was a strong part of his brief, I think -- was that there was no reason why his clients would have thought that they had a disclosure obligation in the first place."
2011.10-1261,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1735.664,1753.309,"That just goes to Justice Ginsburg's point, I think, which is that where a plaintiff can sufficiently plead a section 16(b) case at the motion to dismiss stage to survive dismissal under Iqbal and Twombly, everyone agrees that if you've got a 16(b) potential violation, you have got a reporting duty under 16(a)."
2011.10-1261,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1766.784,1767.634,Now why is that true?
2011.10-1261,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1772.02,1773.02,--That's right.
2011.10-1261,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1794.87,1795.453,"No, I understand that."
2011.10-1261,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1810.996,1822.568,"I think the -- the breach of a duty, a statutory or common law duty, especially where that duty is designed to aid in the enforcement of a private right of action, is and has been considered by courts to be concealment."
2011.10-1261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1826.089,1827.939,"There are two different doctrines, I gather."
2011.10-1261,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1871.185,1874.169,"--Justice Breyer, I want to fight the premise."
2011.10-1261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1874.169,1878.138,"No, I'm making it for you -- I'm making your argument or I'm trying to."
2011.10-1261,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1894.083,1894.733,We have--
2011.10-1261,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1894.733,1901.487,But on the other hand his position leads to the plaintiff never being able to sue in borderline cases.
2011.10-1261,1,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,1902.672,1904.022,--You are absolutely right.
2011.10-1261,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1912.795,1913.895,"Thank you, Mr. Wall."
2011.10-1261,2,33262,jeffrey_i_tilden,,1922.751,1927.222,"Justice Scalia, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1261,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1976.652,1991.662,"Well, what about as a matter of language, whether or not 16b is a -- whether it's a statute of a repose or a statute of limitations, it tells you exactly when the time is supposed to begin to run, from the -- from the realization of the profit."
2011.10-1261,2,33262,jeffrey_i_tilden,,2006.172,2009.474,"We get here -- get there this way, Your Honor."
2011.10-1261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2088.742,2092.695,But I think you are arguing against the most extreme position.
2011.10-1261,2,33262,jeffrey_i_tilden,,2104.603,2110.907,"Your Honor, the -- there are several responses to that."
2011.10-1261,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2147.195,2158.67,"They need not go elsewhere, but when they have gone elsewhere and found out -- I mean in this case it was not just that you reasonably should have known it's that you did know."
2011.10-1261,2,33262,jeffrey_i_tilden,,2160.938,2162.172,"No, sir, you are not right."
2011.10-1261,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2162.172,2162.957,Okay.
2011.10-1261,2,33262,jeffrey_i_tilden,,2162.957,2172.58,We alleged in the claim a -- a conscious agreement between the underwriters and key decisionmakers at the issuer underpriced the IPO.
2011.10-1261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2186.489,2187.205,So that would be--
2011.10-1261,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2187.205,2188.839,Is that necessary to your cause of action?
2011.10-1261,2,33262,jeffrey_i_tilden,,2188.839,2190.274,A group plainly is.
2011.10-1261,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2194.426,2202.699,Tell me what was hidden from you in the prior filings in the academic literature that your adversary points to?
2011.10-1261,2,33262,jeffrey_i_tilden,,2215.59,2218.96,"Your Honor, I disagree with the premise, but let me work backwards."
2011.10-1261,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2258.601,2268.89,You mean to tell me that somebody's investing in the amounts that are invested here and they are not following the fact that this has been the center of securities litigation for years?
2011.10-1261,2,33262,jeffrey_i_tilden,,2268.89,2273.611,"--Your Honor, this is a -- not a garden variety 16b violation."
2011.10-1261,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2340.069,2361.583,"Could you answer what I consider a very strong argument on their side, which is Congress who creates a statute of repose for intentional conduct like fraud, why would they not create a statute of repose for what is a strict liability statute?"
2011.10-1261,2,33262,jeffrey_i_tilden,,2361.583,2368.589,"The fraud case is all about -- involve, Your Honor, someone who has reason to know that they have been defrauded."
2011.10-1261,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2386.217,2398.975,"One would think, if the 16b Plaintiff has really suffered no injury, it would be all the more likely that Congress would want a statute of repose."
2011.10-1261,2,33262,jeffrey_i_tilden,,2398.975,2413.035,"I don't believe, Your Honor -- the 1934 legislative history made it clear -- makes it clear that Congress was extraordinarily concerned about a broad sweep of misconduct in the '20s."
2011.10-1261,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2474.691,2477.108,"Maybe it's worked out, but I don't understand it."
2011.10-1261,2,33262,jeffrey_i_tilden,,2499.407,2500.307,Your Honor--
2011.10-1261,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2500.307,2502.192,"Otherwise it's tolled, period."
2011.10-1261,2,33262,jeffrey_i_tilden,,2505.327,2509.948,"--Well, we don't believe the congressional design contemplated tolling."
2011.10-1261,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2516.016,2518.318,"But there are people, you see, who don't know."
2011.10-1261,2,33262,jeffrey_i_tilden,,2542.649,2544.718,"It may be simple and fair, Your Honor."
2011.10-1261,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2604.257,2616.581,"--Mr. -- Mr. Tilden, is there any other context in which we would extend the statute -- or we have extended or any court has extended a statute of limitations without requiring that the plaintiff be reasonably diligent?"
2011.10-1261,2,33262,jeffrey_i_tilden,,2618.766,2631.074,"--I cannot -- I cannot, Your Honor, but I can also not point to a statute of limitations such as this one that follows immediately on an affirmative disclosure obligation imposed on the defendant."
2011.10-1261,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2769.982,2773.034,Or the SG's.
2011.10-1261,2,33262,jeffrey_i_tilden,,2773.034,2785.007,"--or the SG's, we would offer this: There is no reported decision in which Whittaker and Litzler will yield different results in our view."
2011.10-1261,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2795.949,2798.484,And it requires actual -- is that right?
2011.10-1261,2,33262,jeffrey_i_tilden,,2801.186,2801.703,"Yes, sir."
2011.10-1261,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2801.703,2807.857,"Does that make any sense, given the -- the class of individuals who are plaintiffs in 16(b) cases?"
2011.10-1261,2,33262,jeffrey_i_tilden,,2807.857,2808.723,We don't--
2011.10-1261,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2808.723,2820.832,"Somebody who -- who is found for purposes of litigation very often to have purchased the stock long after all of this takes place, so the lawyer who wants to bring this suit can just go out and find somebody who knows nothing?"
2011.10-1261,2,33262,jeffrey_i_tilden,,2821.982,2827.05,--The -- there is much I want to say in response to that.
2011.10-1261,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3018.737,3027.693,"The problem -- the problem I have with your argument is, it's a very strange statute of limitations."
2011.10-1261,2,33262,jeffrey_i_tilden,,3055.911,3060.164,"I grant you it could have said otherwise, Your Honor, but we--"
2011.10-1261,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3060.164,3065.551,But I don't know any other statute of limitations that achieves the result that you want that puts it that way.
2011.10-1261,2,33262,jeffrey_i_tilden,,3065.551,3074.824,"--Every other statute of limitations we can think of, Your Honor, involves a plaintiff who has reason to know of some harm, and incidentally, where it covers damages."
