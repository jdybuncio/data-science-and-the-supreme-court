1978.77-1724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,65.751,We’ll hear arguments next in Burks against Lasker.
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,74.719,80.715,Mr. Chief Justice and then may it please the Court.
1978.77-1724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,290.147,292.269,Has the value of those yet been ascertained?
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,292.269,296.285,"The exact value is not a matter of record, Your Honor."
1978.77-1724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,425.326,430.13,"This action was taken by a quorum, a lawful quorum of the Board, was it not?"
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,430.13,446.929,"Yes, it was Mr. Chief Justice and in that respect the plaintiffs at the time of motion to dismiss before Judge Walker, questioned the independence of these interested directors and Judge Walker promptly ordered discovery on the subject."
1978.77-1724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,610.464,629.733,"If all of the directors were directors at the time of the alleged erroneous action, negligent or wrongful action on the part of the corporation and the derivative shareholders sued them all and then he could in fact do exactly that --"
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,629.733,632.204,Arguably that is so Mr. Justice Stewart.
1978.77-1724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,632.204,633.227,[Voice Overlap] derivative suits then --
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,633.227,641.212,"Arguably that is so Mr. Justice Stewart, but that does not deal with the case such as here where there is a quorum that can pass on the matter."
1978.77-1724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,641.212,648.212,"That language is a little broader than facts of life, isn’t it?"
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,648.212,652.144,I pass on that one Your Honor.
1978.77-1724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,652.144,657.436,"Well, are you suggesting that what you read from is the Federal Rule?"
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,657.436,667.662,No I’m suggesting that that is the Rule of this Court which has been applied through the years and has guarded the interpretation in lower courts.
1978.77-1724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,667.662,671.519,Where would this Court get Rule like that?
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,671.519,683.7,"This Court was faced with the question, it is a pre-early case agreed, but it was faced with a question as to the powers of directors as a matter of General Corporate Law."
1978.77-1724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,683.7,689.354,"Because I would take it, you probably don’t agree with the United States' amicus brief in this case?"
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,689.354,691.13,With the United States Your Honor?
1978.77-1724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,700.579,701.65,But you wouldn't --
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,701.65,702.616,We do not agree.
1978.77-1724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,702.616,706.086,You wouldn't think there is any room for a Federal Rule in this case at all?
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,706.086,709.405,We can well understand the argument for a Federal Rule in this case Your Honor.
1978.77-1724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,709.405,713.438,"But now, how about, do you agree with the United States or not?"
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,713.438,719.991,Our first choice and the logical point of departure is that this is matter of State Law and we hold to that proposition.
1978.77-1724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,719.991,721.272,That’s what I want to know.
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,724.821,727.111,"No, that is not so Mr. Justice White."
1978.77-1724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,769.46,782.41,"I thought your argument and may be I’m just seeing the same thing in another way or maybe misunderstand your argument, was that, this is a matter of Delaware law where this place -- this company was incorporated."
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,782.41,783.143,Yes.
1978.77-1724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,783.143,794.63,Until and unless there is something in the Investment Company Act of 1940 or the Investment Advisers Act or somewhere else in Federal law that tell us that Delaware law shall not control?
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,794.63,796.865,That is exactly my argument Mr. Justice Stewart.
1978.77-1724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,796.865,803.414,"And upon your examination of the Federal laws, you find that there is nothing there to supersede Delaware law?"
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,803.414,805.395,That is our position Your Honor.
1978.77-1724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,805.395,807.848,So you disagree with United States then?
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,807.848,808.495,Well I think.
1978.77-1724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,808.495,811.732,"I mean that’s, your first preference is --"
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,811.732,813.042,Our first preference is United State law.
1978.77-1724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,813.042,814.966,As matter of argument you just don’t agree with it?
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,814.966,818.049,Correct but we believe that even under their argument --
1978.77-1724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,818.049,818.497,"Yes, I understand."
1978.77-1724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,818.497,819.197,We come out the same way --
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,819.197,823.731,-- we come out the same way that directors do have the power under the Investment Company Act.
1978.77-1724,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,823.731,824.754,Disinterested directors?
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,824.754,828.738,"The disinterested directors, absolutely Your Honor."
1978.77-1724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,922.387,928.627,"This statutory requirement of 40% disinterested directors came into the Act in the 19, what 70 amendment?"
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,928.627,930.762,I don’t have the answer to that immediately Your Honor.
1978.77-1724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,937.171,938.676,This formally on affiliated.
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,938.676,944.06,Correct and I believe that the 40% requirement preceded the 1970 amendments I would – that
1978.77-1724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,944.06,949.666,When did these directors -- these directors where not directors at the time of the purchase of the Penn Central.
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,949.666,955.317,That is correct Your Honor that is correct none of these five are on the board of that time.
1978.77-1724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,961.311,967.733,And there is no question is there that they meet the at least the statuary definition of being disinterested directors.
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,967.733,970.384,No question Your Honor that they meet not only that the statuary definition --
1978.77-1724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,970.384,972.503,In fact the word is --
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,972.503,974.845,-- Judge Walker did in fact find that they were disinterested.
1978.77-1724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,974.845,976.565,-- keeps telling what.
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,976.565,980.196,"Yes, I have addressed myself to the Act."
1978.77-1724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1110.978,1112.232,Whose quote is that?
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,1112.232,1116.143,That’s from the SEC brief at page 21 Your Honor.
1978.77-1724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1139.24,1160.148,"But the SEC both does and doesn't support your theory from what you have quoted it would seem to follow that where it is in the discretion, the unreviewable discretion of the independent disinterested directors or majority of quorum to make decisions on the behalf of the corporation."
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,1176.807,1181.473,Mr. Justice Stewart the SEC has a three-prong test.
1978.77-1724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1191.55,1192.511,-- in this case?
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,1192.511,1193.402,In this case.
1978.77-1724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1193.402,1197.397,So then it's incumbent upon the district judge to see if it was a reasonable decision?
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,1197.397,1200.505,Correct and I would address myself to the issue of reasonableness.
1978.77-1724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1200.505,1206.711,"It would seem to follow of what you are quoting to us that it’s not incumbent at all on anybody, if the directors have the power?"
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,1206.711,1213.268,I believe that classically under the business judgment Rule as it has been formulated in the cases in this Court that is so.
1978.77-1724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1229.863,1249.578,"It seems to me, it seems to me that a judge who was persuaded by your argument, that this is in within the unreviewable power of disinterested directors to make the decision, would have dismissed the case even if he or might well have dismissed the case would have even if he had thought that this decision might have been very unreasonable decision?"
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,1249.578,1258.691,"Mr. Justice Stewart arguably, arguably that is so, but I would call Your Honor’s attention to the Kramer case where they formulated a little differently from the SEC."
1978.77-1724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1281.509,1301.094,"It seems to me the logic of your argument and indeed the logic of the language of the SEC brief that's quoted to us, leads to a conclusion that would exclude any oversight by a -- by a Federal Judge of whether or not the decision was reasonable, however --"
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,1301.094,1307.444,Judge Walker also did point out in his opinion expressly that he found that this was a reasoned decision.
1978.77-1724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1347.843,1366.045,In that sense would you say it’s analogous to the law which permits six members of this Court to sit as a quorum and if six members are here for although minority less than majority of the full court and make a binding holding of the Court?
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,1366.045,1371.349,"I pondered that very analogy Your Honor under 28 U.S.C 1, which I reviewed the other evening."
1978.77-1724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1387.316,1392.543,"Six but a four, if those six decides something isn’t that holding in this Court?"
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,1392.543,1395.041,"Yes it is Your Honor, but if the quorum --"
1978.77-1724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1395.041,1405.183,It may be regarded as less significant at sometime in the future when on the context to that particular decision it makes the law of the case?
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,1405.183,1413.286,"Absolutely, no question about that Your Honor and the concept of quorum is embedded in corporate law in this county for many, many years."
1978.77-1724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1413.286,1415.44,And what does the Delaware Law provides again?
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,1415.44,1422.505,"Delaware Law 141 A, I believe provides that a quorum can transact the business of the board and it may be a minority."
1978.77-1724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1422.505,1423.09,But does it say.
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,1423.09,1432.632,Up to one it can be as little as one third if the by laws so permit and in the case of fundamental the by laws had a one third quorum.
1978.77-1724,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1433.655,1435.876,By laws say with the minimum of one-third.
1978.77-1724,0,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,1435.876,1443.16,"Exactly actually the five here where more than a quorum, four would have been a quorum, five actually acted."
1978.77-1724,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1508.384,1515.84,Mr. Ferrara.
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,1515.84,1518.937,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1978.77-1724,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1614.217,1632.132,"Mr. Ferrara you find this Federal limitation and requirement in fiduciary obligations imposed by the 1940 Act and in the general purpose of Congress, is that correct?"
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,1632.132,1634.996,"That goes to the heart of our authority, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1978.77-1724,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1634.996,1636.4,It says to be found somewhere – [Voice Overlap]
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,1636.4,1638.262,It doesn’t and I think that.
1978.77-1724,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1667.287,1670.354,"Your claim that any of those provisions were violated in this case, is there?"
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,1670.354,1676.054,"No, we don’t, but we do say that surrounding Section 36 A there are those other --"
1978.77-1724,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1676.054,1678.301,"The numbers, you find it in the numbers--"
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,1678.301,1680.006,That’s correct sir.
1978.77-1724,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1680.006,1694.439,But no problem about any of those things in this case on basis of the majority? There is full compliance whether or whether they are applicable or not?
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,1694.439,1709.174,"We recall Mr. Justice that Section 36 A of the Act, the general fiduciary standard prescribes breaches of fiduciary duty involving personal misconduct and the House and the Senate at the time they enacted those provisions in 1970 said --"
1978.77-1724,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1709.174,1714.56,"You wouldn't need -- you wouldn't need to the Congress to tell a State Court that, would you?"
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,1714.56,1715.601,"Well, you might."
1978.77-1724,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1795.343,1810.434,"Mr. Ferrara there are so many statutory provisions I may get them mixed up, but Section 36 A is Section 88 A-35 of -- that’s a same one in which authorizes the commission to bring certain kinds of litigation?"
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,1810.434,1811.106,It does indeed.
1978.77-1724,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1811.106,1813.195,Does it have anything to do with private litigation?
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,1813.195,1822.567,"Well, the issues that you’re implicitly raising Mr. Justice Stevens is whether there is an implied Right of Action under Section 36 A of the Investment Company Act."
1978.77-1724,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1844.694,1846.781,But you are really going one step beyond that.
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,1862.795,1878.299,Mr. Justice Stevens I’m sure that the day is going to come when myself or one of my successors are going to be here arguing the case that 36 A creates an implied Right of Action for private litigants under the federal -- under the Investment Company Act.
1978.77-1724,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1897.912,1906.865,"Granting all that, where is anything about who can settle such an action, place any limitations on the power to settle such an action."
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,1919.476,1922.041,Nothing in the Statute quite correct.
1978.77-1724,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1922.041,1926.33,"This isn’t right of a private remedy, it's a derivative law suit brought on behalf of the corporation?"
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,1926.33,1928.183,It is indeed and the posture --
1978.77-1724,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1928.183,1934.044,"Under no authority of the Investment Company Act of 1940, but under quite different authorization?"
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,1934.044,1940.533,"Well, the allegations containing violation of the Investment Company Act 1940 and the Advisors Act, two federal claims."
1978.77-1724,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2004.056,2005.521,You say findings unreasonable --
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2005.521,2006.229,I’m sorry.
1978.77-1724,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2006.229,2008.595,You say he then would have made findings on the reasonableness of --
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2008.595,2009.847,I think he would have we’re not --
1978.77-1724,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2009.847,2016.136,"We are still get the thing just, I don’t mean to take up too much time, but he could have acted just on the basis of State Law."
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2032.493,2044.041,"But the Investment Company Act of 1940 clearly details that not only prescribes the duties of Independent Directors are, but says that you can't even have Board of Directors unless 40% of them disinterested and then says --"
1978.77-1724,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2044.041,2047.704,"Right, but is there anything that says those directors can't settle a lawsuit, that's the problem?"
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2047.704,2057.274,"No, the question is not whether not they cancel the lawsuit, but whether in the process of settling the lawsuit they breached their fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the fund."
1978.77-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2067.485,2069.312,Where is the standard in the federal statute?
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2069.312,2072.677,The standard in the Section 36 A because all of the directors--
1978.77-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2072.677,2074.458,"Can you read it, can you read it --"
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2074.458,2080.054,Section 36A prescribes breaches of fiduciary duty based upon--
1978.77-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2080.054,2081.32,Breach of fiduciary duty.
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2081.32,2090.364,"Well, the statute doesn’t say what a breach of fiduciary duty it is, but the Congress and both the House and the Senate reports when they passed that Statute said what they thought it met."
1978.77-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2090.364,2105.434,"Well, I think -- I don’t still don’t think you have answered Mr. Justice Stevens that where is a -- what specifically in the Statue forbids or forbids a settlement unless you go through this ritual."
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2105.434,2108.246,"Let me, let me try once again."
1978.77-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2108.246,2119.461,"Because you know there is a question, just how specific must a Federal law be and in Cort against Ash the court said and I’m for sure you must be quite familiar with that statement in Cort against Ash that --"
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2119.461,2121.245,Indeed I am sir.
1978.77-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2121.245,2130.523,-- that except where Federal law expressly requires certain responsibilities and directives with respect to it the state law will govern internal affairs of corporation.
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2130.523,2131.672,You have raised two questions.
1978.77-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2134.392,2136.582,You can respond to Justice Stevens' question first.
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2136.582,2137.214,Alright.
1978.77-1724,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2188.489,2192.534,"Directors always have fiduciaries vis-à-vis the shareholders, there is nothing --"
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2192.534,2221.717,"But you know always -- you are quiet right Mr. Justice Stewart all directors are fiduciaries but here because of Section 36(a) I suppose you would say investment company directors are super fiduciaries, particularly disinterested directors, because there is no other Federal statute, not the Securities Act, not the Securities Exchange Act, not the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1934, 35 I’m sorry, no other Federal statute has express provision that says that these directors have to have a fiduciary duty."
1978.77-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2263.59,2266.017,Certainly you are putting quiet a gloss on it.
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2266.017,2268.022,A very modest gloss I would suggest.
1978.77-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2273.718,2281.122,"I don’t know, some Federal judge will think it’s a very mild veracity as to sit down and decide whether the judgment is reasonable."
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2281.122,2284.485,We are not asking that he substitute his judgment for that of the directors.
1978.77-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2284.485,2287.227,You are asking to do something that he wouldn’t have to do under State law.
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2287.227,2289.734,We are asking --
1978.77-1724,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2289.734,2318.658,"Well now since you emphasize that section so much and what the Congress intended, it's certainly not unimportant and this is in your own brief of page 21, the statement from the legislative history that it is not intended by the statute to shift the responsibility from managing an investment company in the best interest of the shareholders from the directors of such company to the judiciary."
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2318.658,2319.164,Clearly.
1978.77-1724,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2319.164,2323.852,"Now that have to thins out this gloss a little bit, doesn’t it?"
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2323.852,2330.793,"Mr. Chief Justice, it does thin it out a little bit and that’s exactly why we can’t be here fully supporting the Court of Appeals."
1978.77-1724,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2353.781,2364.555,"You are making the District Judge a super Director, you spoke of a super fiduciary, you are making him a super, super fiduciary."
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2364.555,2373.497,Mr. Chief Justice if the impression left by our brief is that we are asking a Federal District Court Judge to become a Director of an investment company then our brief reads incorrectly.
1978.77-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2374.956,2383.836,But you must concede that just under your formulation a District Judge could conclude this is an unreasonable decision by the directors and set it aside?
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2383.836,2395.819,"The District Court Judge could, the District Court Judge could consistent with, actually a line of authority that stretches back to 1917 in this Court’s case and in --"
1978.77-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2395.819,2399.19,"That, that’s a bootstrap, that’s a bootstrap --"
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2399.19,2406.429,The District Court judges all the time and in different kinds of context have to determine whether or not conduct is reasonable.
1978.77-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2409.36,2414.417,"So you are saying, yes a District Judge can under your formulation set it aside as unreasonable?"
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2414.417,2415.653,"Absolutely, but --"
1978.77-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2415.653,2417.123,You just say he always could.
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2417.123,2417.202,"No, no --"
1978.77-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2417.202,2419.157,Don’t you say on your formulations he may set it aside.
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2419.157,2425.265,I absolutely agree that a District Court Judge may set upside directors -- directorial action as unreasonable.
1978.77-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2426.231,2429.908,Even now a State Court wouldn’t?
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2429.908,2436.093,"The State court would have never reached the question, because the State court never considered the question; they considered something else slightly different."
1978.77-1724,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2436.093,2446.088,The State court would find the directors' action to be quiet consistent and would not set it aside and you suggest that under your formulation a Federal court could.
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2446.088,2455.083,No I say that if the State court viewed reasonableness as a criteria of its review then it could set it aside.
1978.77-1724,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2479.366,2482.207,"It looks like just one of them, we had one this morning."
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2506.869,2516.619,"A court I believe in passing upon a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, passing upon a directed verdict--"
1978.77-1724,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2516.619,2518.139,Other person should take the first one?
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2518.139,2518.594,"Yes, I believe that."
1978.77-1724,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2518.594,2519.939,On judgment NOV?
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2519.939,2520.622,That’s correct.
1978.77-1724,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2526.113,2530.843,Now you’ve raised the question of whether or not the evidence supports the verdict?
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2530.843,2538.01,"That’s correct in the minds of the, in the minds of a reasonable juror, isn’t that a standard that’s incorporated under the case law?"
1978.77-1724,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2540.257,2546.253,That’s a weighing of evidence and not a weighing of the reasonableness I submit to you.
1978.77-1724,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2550.379,2551.62,Mr. Ferrara.
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2551.62,2552.086,Yes sir.
1978.77-1724,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2552.086,2554.959,I like to ask you a couple of questions.
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2602.702,2607.015,"It’s a very difficult question, but let me try to respond it in two levels."
1978.77-1724,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2620.057,2624.127,That’s a question separate from reasonableness --
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2624.127,2631.371,I know it is but you asked I think two questions; one what would the District Court Judge have to do in terms of the record and two what we have to do in terms of satisfying the reasonableness standard.
1978.77-1724,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2685.546,2688.298,I would like to interrupt you here a minute.
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2690.584,2691.085,No.
1978.77-1724,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2691.085,2707.994,"Well wait a minute, the question would be in very summary terms whether or not the management had exercised the degree of care required of management in purchasing the Penn Central Commercial Paper."
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2709.476,2712.353,"I agree that’s -- under the state law claim, it’s correct."
1978.77-1724,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2712.353,2713.718,That’s right.
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2718.107,2718.363,That’s correct.
1978.77-1724,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2718.363,2722.723,-- might have a bearing on whether the independent directors exercised --
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2722.723,2723.409,That’s right.
1978.77-1724,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2723.409,2725.586,-- a reasonable judgment.
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2737.771,2739.272,The ‘if so’ is no.
1978.77-1724,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2766.954,2768.382,But you think he must look in to the merits?
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2768.382,2772.631,"We think that he at least, at least has to a look at the merits."
1978.77-1724,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2815.621,2820.676,"That would have been exactly what he should have said had Delaware law exclusively applied, you’d agree with it?"
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2820.676,2827.457,Had it -- it depends upon how you view the good faith requirement of Delaware law.
1978.77-1724,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2843.173,2844.796,No it is an issue in this case.
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2844.796,2845.715,It’s an issue --
1978.77-1724,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2845.715,2847.686,It’s very much an issue in this case.
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2847.686,2852.523,Would -- it’s an issue in this case only to the extent that you have to try to --
1978.77-1724,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2852.523,2858.103,If Delaware law exclusively applies to this case then it’s a very important to know what Delaware law is.
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2858.103,2870.731,"It is and under Delaware law, well I have not researched the Delaware cases, we would submit that within the notion of good faith under Delaware law there has to be some consideration given to the merits."
1978.77-1724,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2874.455,2879.793,Was there any claim here that the direct -- that these disinterested directors acted in bad faith?
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2879.793,2882.512,As a matter of fact the District Court judge found they acted in good faith.
1978.77-1724,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2882.512,2882.577,Exactly.
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2882.577,2884.132,But he did that without --
1978.77-1724,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2884.132,2886.0,And isn’t that the test to Delaware law?
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2886.0,2888.134,The Delaware law test is good faith but how?
1978.77-1724,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2888.134,2890.842,Exactly.
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2890.842,2901.342,"The issue is whether in determining that they acted in good faith, you can make that determination completely divorced at the merits of the actions and irrespective of whether you’ve --"
1978.77-1724,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2901.342,2906.04,They could be very badly mistaken but still be in complete good faith and wholly disinterested?
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2906.04,2907.435,If they are very badly --
1978.77-1724,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2907.435,2912.181,-- but at the same time make what somebody else would think would be an unreasonable decision?
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2912.181,2916.256,"When you put it that way though, this is the box that we get in."
1978.77-1724,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2917.761,2921.805,Your box I don’t know anything else here. [Laughter]
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2921.805,2935.928,"I’m sorry you are right the box that I get into, is that when you are dealing with an investment company and the disinterested directors of an investment company, unfortunately you may have to go that one extra step because of 36(a) it prescribes unreasonable conduct."
1978.77-1724,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2935.928,2948.603,That’s your claim that the penumbras of the 1940 Act put some limitation on what would ordinarily be as the provisions of state law.
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2954.35,2975.266,"Absolutely and again on the penumbra of question I agree there is a variety of sections which impact upon this, but penumbra doesn’t, I don’t think appropriately categorized, I’m sorry characterize 36(a) that talks in terms, at least in the House and Senate reports of unreasonableness."
1978.77-1724,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2975.266,2987.187,This much is clear is it not Mr. Ferrara that if your super fiduciary theory is correct and these directors have found to have acted unreasonably under 36(a) they would be personally liable to damages?
1978.77-1724,1,39286,ralph_c_ferrara,,2987.187,2990.521,They might be.
1978.77-1724,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3032.961,3038.43,Mr. Einstein.
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3045.821,3046.752,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1978.77-1724,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3182.457,3193.254,You are suggesting that this was negligence that was so gross as to arise to the level of the breach of trust.
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3193.254,3194.154,Yes I do Your Honor.
1978.77-1724,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3195.117,3198.759,In other words it was utterly stupid to do what they did or failed to do --
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3198.759,3201.781,I think it goes even beyond stupidity.
1978.77-1724,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3201.781,3204.342,And that was the basis of your derivative shareholders --
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3204.342,3206.263,That is absolutely right Your Honor.
1978.77-1724,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3206.263,3210.147,Which really -- only tangentially is -- it bears an issue here.
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3210.147,3218.523,Well as I’ll come to in a moment I do think that the merits of the action do very much bear on the issue here.
1978.77-1724,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3423.308,3427.089,"Now why would that be important, I just don’t understand you, what issue would that been relevant?"
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3427.089,3445.423,"That would go to the reasonableness Mr. Justice Stevens of the dismissal of the action, and I submit to you as a principle thesis here and one that has been overlooked and not mentioned up till now that this case is governed very much by Rule 23.1 promulgated by this Court."
1978.77-1724,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3445.423,3457.097,But Mr. Einstein if I understand that the SEC's position is there was full -- they do not challenge the fully informed character of the independent directors' decision?
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3457.097,3466.721,I don’t see how anybody on this record can assert with all deference to the SEC that the directors were fully informed.
1978.77-1724,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3474.655,3484.391,"Is it not quite clear that the restriction on discovery of which you complain would be more pertinent to the question of full information, than to the question of reasonable information, wouldn't it?"
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3485.623,3505.175,I think it’s relevant to both and I think the question of merits also is relevant because a decision to dismiss a case that has a weak merit might be supportable on very slim business judgment rules whereas if the case has strong merit you would need more to support dismissal.
1978.77-1724,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3505.175,3520.337,"It would seem to me maybe I miss something that, that if we were persuaded and I don’t know whether we should be or not, that the SEC is correct in saying the independent directors were fully informed, then we shouldn’t test reasonableness by their failure to get more information?"
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3520.337,3522.619,"If they were fully informed, they were fully informed."
1978.77-1724,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3532.344,3536.203,Did the District Judge make a finding on that point?
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3536.203,3541.653,I don’t believe he did Your Honor.
1978.77-1724,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3550.235,3551.857,He did find they were independent?
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3551.857,3563.72,"Yes Your Honor he did, and that finding was in affect overruled by the Second Circuit both I believe on the facts and on the law."
1978.77-1724,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3563.72,3566.143,He also found that they acted in good faith?
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3566.143,3567.159,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1724,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3567.159,3570.579,As I read the Second Circuit it didn’t overrule of finding a fact.
1978.77-1724,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3576.392,3579.073,Or all these directors had any power to do what they did?
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3579.073,3608.858,"Second Circuit Your Honor, the opinion I find somewhat ambivalent on this issue because if you look at pages A46 and 47 of the appendix where the opinion appears, Second Circuit clearly discusses the fact that these directors serve not only as directors on this fund's board but on a number of other boards where funds are managed by Anchor and received $11,000 to $13,000 per annum compensation."
1978.77-1724,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3608.858,3610.523,We’ll resume there at 1 o’clock.
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3610.523,3615.736,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1978.77-1724,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3643.712,3662.703,"What you’re saying would lead me to believe that you, if you want to you can file another derivative suit on behalf of the corporation grounded upon the wrongful action of these directors in making this business decision to settle this lawsuit."
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3662.703,3663.456,I don’t think that --
1978.77-1724,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3663.456,3667.062,"That’s where your claims would be appropriately tested out, isn’t?"
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3667.062,3671.333,"No, I think my claims can be properly tested out in the District Court which has a --"
1978.77-1724,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3671.333,3672.542,No it would be in the District Court.
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3672.542,3696.329,"No, on this action after all we are now six years since this action was filed and still in the preliminary procedures without ever having an answer filed or any discovery and I think that the claims can be tested out in the District Court, which can easily and under very familiar standards deal with all these questions."
1978.77-1724,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3696.329,3706.332,It’s generally the business of directors who are fiduciaries with respect to the shareholders to make these business decisions on behalf of the corporation.
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3729.167,3738.915,"Because they seek to exculpate the majority of the board from serious substantiated charges of wrongdoing, that’s why it is different."
1978.77-1724,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3739.344,3743.801,Their original action was brought on the -- for other corporation on behalf of the corporation?
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3743.801,3744.503,That’s right.
1978.77-1724,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3744.503,3747.325,And now these directors are acting on behalf of the corporation.
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3747.325,3749.636,But they’re seeking to exculpate fellow directors.
1978.77-1724,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3749.636,3760.671,"Whatever they’re seeking to do, they’re making a business decision for the corporation like any other business decision for the corporation, and if you think that they acted wrongly you can bring another stockholder’s derivative suit."
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3760.671,3761.509,I think that under the stand --
1978.77-1724,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3761.509,3763.332,-- on behalf of the corporation against them?
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3763.332,3773.356,I think that under the Standards of Rule 23.1 I don’t have to go through that procedure that I can present those arguments and have them considered by the District Court.
1978.77-1724,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3773.356,3778.761,In Rule 23 against dismissing or compromising that within the court?
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3778.761,3779.173,That’s correct.
1978.77-1724,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3779.173,3779.758,That’s 23.1.
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3779.758,3780.877,That’s 23.1.
1978.77-1724,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3780.877,3782.234,"No, it’s 23.1 it follows."
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3782.234,3786.501,"23.1, 23 is class actions, 23.1 is derivative actions."
1978.77-1724,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3786.501,3790.017,"The clause 23.1 says, as you need the approval of the District Court."
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3790.017,3791.11,That’s correct and the case –
1978.77-1724,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3791.11,3792.426,That’s the approval of the District Court.
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3792.426,3811.311,"But the case law first of all requires notice to the stockholders and the case law that has surrounded Rule 23.1 has made it very clear that the court has to consider the propriety of the dismissal of business judgment reasons, the merits of the action to make sure that dismissal is proper."
1978.77-1724,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3811.311,3820.841,And those cases all deal with dismissals by the shareholders who are suing on behalf of the corporation where the evils are quite different and that’s those are evils to which this Rule directed everybody knows that.
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3820.841,3864.903,"With all deference Your Honor, there are a number of cases which we have cited in our brief where a majority of a Board of Directors of a new board that has turned over during the course of a litigation has come into court to seek dismissal of a derivative action and in each of those cases and they are cited at pages 43 through 49, 50 of our brief, in each of those cases where a majority, a new and concededly independent majority came into the corporation, the court conducted a painstaking, extensive hearing to determine whether dismissal was appropriate."
1978.77-1724,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3911.426,3926.988,"Yeah, but in each case as I just reading it, I’m not familiar with it, I read the opinion Birnbaum against Birrel and Burger against Dyson as I read the description in your brief, the shareholder plaintiffs received something too, didn’t they?"
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3926.988,3930.356,"Yes, they did and the corporation received something."
1978.77-1724,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3950.156,3963.435,"Well, it is -- it is apparent then you’re the Rule, you are advancing would certainly I suppose a fortiori or not applied it to compromises."
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3963.435,3965.018,Yes.
1978.77-1724,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3965.018,3979.582,"If the directors wanted to compromise a suit and wanted to settle it, it could not do, they could not do so over the objection of the plaintiffs even if State Law would given them that power."
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3979.582,3982.778,I question whether Delaware Law gives the minority power.
1978.77-1724,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3982.778,3983.033,Yes.
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,3983.033,3992.159,"If there was a majority of directors that decide to do it, I think the court would have the obligation to examine the compromise to make sure it was fair and appropriate."
1978.77-1724,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3999.024,4005.644,Was there not under Delaware Law majority action here by a quorum of the directors.
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,4005.644,4011.018,"There was quorum action, it’s a minority, it’s 5 out of a 11 directors."
1978.77-1724,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4011.018,4013.371,"But that’s the Law of Delaware, isn’t it?"
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,4013.371,4019.328,But the Law of the Delaware says that a minority that a quorum can be a minority.
1978.77-1724,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4063.075,4065.739,"We don't have any of those hypotheticals, do we?"
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,4065.739,4087.713,"But I think that’s where there, that’s where the flaw is in my advisory’s position because Rule 23.1 and the decisions under both Federal and Delaware grant access to the courts that the Federal and State courts whenever a majority of the Board is charged with wrongdoing without the necessity of a demand."
1978.77-1724,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4112.298,4122.185,"Of course in a Federal Court, a derivative action unless there’s some Federal Statute that the State Corporation Law is going to govern it?"
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,4122.185,4129.147,That’s correct and the State Corporation Law of Delaware is in effect Rule 23.1 and a decision is under --
1978.77-1724,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4129.147,4143.56,"You wouldn’t think that, you wouldn’t think that -- do you think under 23.1, the District Judge could just say, “I’m just not going to approve the settlement because this is just by a majority of a minority quorum?”"
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,4143.56,4157.278,"I think The District Court -- well, I have serious question Your Honor about whether a minority has the standing or the power to bring the question before the board, before the court."
1978.77-1724,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4157.901,4161.357,Suppose it does and it’s clear under Delaware Law that it does.
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,4161.357,4162.344,Alright let’s assume that it has --
1978.77-1724,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4162.344,4166.781,Does a District Court just ignore that and say I’m not even going to consider it?
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,4166.781,4175.161,"No, the District Court would have to consider the application and weigh it on the merits, is the dismissal in the best interest of the stockholders."
1978.77-1724,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4345.252,4353.339,"The citations you gave I think some of us were not aware that you’re referring non-cited cases, so give me the Supreme Court cites again."
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,4353.339,4374.058,"McLeod versus General Electric 385 US 533, Patterson v. Alabama 294 US 600 and the Second Circuit case is Korn v Franchard 456 F.2nd 1206."
1978.77-1724,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4388.627,4390.495,(Inaudible)
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,4390.495,4400.198,"Well, what the case, what those two cases stand for; McLeod is a NLRB Case and Korn v. Franchard is a Class Action Decertification Case."
1978.77-1724,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4444.052,4450.903,Didn’t the District Judge I suppose thought he was complying with Rule 23?
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,4450.903,4456.751,"The District Judge rejected the position, the Rule 23.1 was applicable."
1978.77-1724,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4463.511,4466.958,You say that Rule 23 has nothing to do with it whatsoever?
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,4466.958,4469.067,That’s correct.
1978.77-1724,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4516.085,4527.07,"I don’t understand. If we agreed with you on 23.1 and the District Court refused to apply it, we think he should, why would we send it back (Inaudible)"
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,4527.07,4537.578,"Because when you look at the factors that Rule 23.1 requires Mr. Justice Brennan, consideration of the merits, the Court of Appeals has found there was merit."
1978.77-1724,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4554.455,4564.218,But in the first instance if you’re right as the 23.1 contemplate that the District Court shall make the initial judgment whether the 23.1 has been satisfied?
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,4564.218,4581.988,"Yes, but if you send it back to the District Court and the District Court refused against a dismissal and your view of the case today was that it had to be retained, it could not be dismissed, we just have an up and down procedure again without any reason or purpose."
1978.77-1724,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4581.988,4592.949,We might affirm a judgment we did that -- we might not have made in the first instance ourselves just because sometime -- it might rest on findings that are clearly erroneous?
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,4592.949,4608.254,"That is correct Your Honor, but I think in this case with the removal of Anchor the facts are so clear that they mandate only one result and that is the rationale and teaching of Korn against Franchard which I cited to the Court before."
1978.77-1724,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4610.331,4613.448,Do your class still own the shares of --
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,4613.448,4614.443,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1724,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4614.443,4616.024,-- in the fund?
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,4618.666,4621.379,I think about 200 each Your Honor.
1978.77-1724,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4621.379,4623.219,400 out of how many?
1978.77-1724,2,30109,joseph_h_einstein,,4623.219,4628.608,"Well, I know there is a 140,000 stockholders of the fund."
1978.77-1724,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4637.729,4640.146,Mr. Pollack.
1978.77-1724,3,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,4640.146,4644.172,"Mr. Chief Justice, and again may it please the Court."
1978.77-1724,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4746.568,4747.955,"No, it’s still functioning."
1978.77-1724,3,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,4747.955,4751.759,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1978.77-1724,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4751.759,4752.772,What’s the number of the footnote?
1978.77-1724,3,21376,daniel_a_pollack,,4752.772,4769.354,"21; Footnote 21 says although we suggest a remand, this Court could determine reasonableness if it wishes because that determination involves only the application of a legal standard to a documentary record."
1978.77-1724,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4834.907,4835.545,Thank you gentlemen.
