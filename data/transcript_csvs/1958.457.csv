1958.457,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,25.093,"Number 457, Horace Ingram, L. E. Smith, Mary Law et al., Petitioners, versus United States of America."
1958.457,0,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,26.368,34.835,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1958.457,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,63.327,64.285,Relating to what?
1958.457,0,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,64.285,68.846,"Wagering, wagers."
1958.457,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,81.594,83.508,How many were tried at the same time?
1958.457,0,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,83.508,84.426,26.
1958.457,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,84.426,85.814,26.
1958.457,0,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,85.814,91.071,"And, there were a group of them acquitted, some were convicted."
1958.457,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,91.071,92.549,How many lawyers for the defendants?
1958.457,0,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,92.549,99.793,They were approximately eight or nine counsel in the trial of this case.
1958.457,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,192.712,198.426,Didn't the Court of Appeals and the District Court find him to be a principal?
1958.457,0,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,198.426,213.189,"That, if Your Honor please, was because of the fact that the jury did convict him upon the substantive count of failing to pay the tax, as well as the felony conviction on a conspiracy."
1958.457,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,234.292,243.221,Did the evidence bear on the profit of the -- of the petitioners other than Ingram?
1958.457,0,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,243.221,243.8,"No, Your Honor."
1958.457,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,243.8,245.564,What their take was out of this profit and --
1958.457,0,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,245.564,245.794,"No, Your Honor."
1958.457,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,245.794,246.503,-- was charged?
1958.457,0,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,246.503,247.18,It did not.
1958.457,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,247.18,247.956,Nothing at all?
1958.457,0,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,247.956,248.785,Nothing.
1958.457,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,248.785,254.951,We don't know whether they got $10 a day or whether a sizable share in the profit?
1958.457,0,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,254.951,260.707,"Your Honor, there was no evidence that I can recall of that particular fact."
1958.457,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,325.715,335.525,"What -- what other testimony was there, except that interesting item that the income, or was it the gross, was reduced to $3,500 a day?"
1958.457,0,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,335.525,335.924,That was --
1958.457,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,335.924,340.605,What else was there bearing on the size of the operation?
1958.457,0,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,340.605,362.442,"I do not believe, if Your Honor please, that there was any other evidence as to the size of the operation with -- with respect to anything except that one statement, and that was a statement attributed to have been made by Ingram to one of the state investigators sometime, I believe, a year -- about a year before the actual raid was made on March 27th, 1957."
1958.457,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,373.032,385.17,"And you say there is nothing in the record to indicate what the -- what the monetary reward of Smith, Mary Parks Law, and Rufus Jenkins were."
1958.457,0,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,385.17,386.378,That's right.
1958.457,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,386.378,388.841,You say the -- the record is bad.
1958.457,0,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,388.841,391.785,The record is bad.
1958.457,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,391.785,397.452,"Whether they, being a very small -- whether they had a very small remuneration or whether they had a good-for-sized chair in it."
1958.457,0,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,397.452,399.089,"Well, that is completely solemn."
1958.457,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,416.323,437.776,"But was there anything in the record from which a jury could barely draw the inference that this was a -- this was a large-scaled money making enterprise and that the three people, three petitioners here, other than Ingram had an important stake in the profit making."
1958.457,0,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,437.776,438.824,"No, Your Honor."
1958.457,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,438.824,439.65,"Not a word, you say?"
1958.457,0,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,439.65,440.938,"No, Your honor."
1958.457,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,447.162,447.18,Was there --
1958.457,0,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,447.18,448.505,-- the compliant that we are making.
1958.457,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,448.505,462.505,Was there any other -- was there any evidence to indicate the relationship of those three that I've named to Ingram showing that they were -- that they must have been in the know both of what was going and what was done or what was not done?
1958.457,0,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,462.505,469.757,"Well, now, of course the Government contends that, in as much as this thing went on over a period of a year-and-a half or two years, that --"
1958.457,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,469.757,469.875,You don't --
1958.457,0,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,469.875,470.322,-- the showing --
1958.457,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,470.322,471.39,You don't deny that?
1958.457,0,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,471.39,471.867,"No, Your Honor."
1958.457,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,472.047,472.065,You guys --
1958.457,0,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,472.065,472.283,-- we don't deny that.
1958.457,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,472.283,473.519,-- are clear on that?
1958.457,0,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,473.519,474.705,"Yes, sir."
1958.457,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,476.33,484.033,"Because of that, is it suggested that, therefore, they must have known what Ingram was about?"
1958.457,0,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,484.033,486.296,"The Government contends that, Your Honor."
1958.457,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,499.797,504.815,"And it's one of your chief burdens to destroy that argument, is it not?"
1958.457,1,30123,j_dwight_evans_jr,,1475.778,1480.289,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1958.457,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2121.152,2121.37,"Well, isn't --"
1958.457,1,30123,j_dwight_evans_jr,,2121.37,2121.618,-- in --
1958.457,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2121.618,2137.959,-- isn't it conceded by the petitioners that the evidence was very clear to support a finding that there was a large-scale numbers operation going on and -- and an effort on -- by all parties concerned in it to conceal it?
1958.457,1,30123,j_dwight_evans_jr,,2139.326,2151.898,"Well, I thought it was but, in Mr. Asinof's answer to Mr. Justice Frankfurter, I thought he gave the impression that the only evidence of a large-scale operation was the $3,500."
1958.457,2,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,3410.44,3430.553,"In this case, the evidence, as outlined by the Government, still fails to show that any of these other persons had any pecuniary interest in this enterprise as a principal."
1958.457,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3605.042,3613.404,"Don't you say, Mr. Asinof, that, at most, what the evidence shows here is a conspiracy which is subsidiary to a subsidiary conspiracy?"
1958.457,2,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,3613.404,3613.414,That's right.
1958.457,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3613.414,3619.054,"In other words, that the basic conspiracy was to operate an illegal lottery, illegal under the laws of Georgia."
1958.457,2,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,3619.054,3621.603,Violation of the laws.
1958.457,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3621.603,3638.03,"And that a subsidiary to that conspiracy was to conceal the operation of that illegal activity, and that illegal conspiracy, and necessary to that subsidiary concealment conspiracy was not to pay the federal tax."
1958.457,2,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,3638.03,3673.232,"I would like to add to that, if Your Honor please, that this -- that this was actually stated by the Circuit Court of Appeals that the concealment was for the purpose of evading prosecution and punishment, and that if the concealment is merely for that purpose and not for the purpose of committing the crime itself, and I think I pointed that out in my brief, if that was the purpose of the concealment then, of course, it would be subsidiary and, being subsidiary, himself would not be sufficient standing alone to prove that there was a conspiracy to violate the federal law,"
1958.457,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3673.232,3683.8,"Well, Mr. Asinof, as I see it, there are two -- two different crimes here, of course, the state crime and the federal crime."
1958.457,2,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,3700.151,3700.658,"No, Your Honor."
1958.457,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3700.658,3700.796,"Well, it's --"
1958.457,2,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,3700.796,3702.191,"It's a misdemeanor also, but it --"
1958.457,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3702.191,3702.431,Yes.
1958.457,2,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,3702.431,3704.535,-- it willfully -- willfully evading and --
1958.457,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3704.535,3704.623,Yes.
1958.457,2,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,3704.623,3704.94,-- defeating --
1958.457,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3704.94,3705.357,Well --
1958.457,2,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,3705.634,3705.894,-- would be a felony.
1958.457,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3705.894,3707.928,"Yes, that -- that makes it a felony."
1958.457,2,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,3734.937,3735.145,Because --
1958.457,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3735.145,3737.947,Why is one subsidiary to the other?
1958.457,2,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,3737.947,3749.259,"Because the state -- the state violation would be -- would be inherent that these persons had violated the state law, but no evidence that these persons had violated the federal law independently of that concealment."
1958.457,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3789.246,3793.575,"Well, the operation was as flagrant as you indicate it was."
1958.457,2,43754,wesley_r_asinof,,3798.29,3810.814,"Well, of course, since this Court has passed upon a question in the Kahriger case, Congress has not seen fit to change the law so as to put these persons within the purview of the Wagering Tax Act."
