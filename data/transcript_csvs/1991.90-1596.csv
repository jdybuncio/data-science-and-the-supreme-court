1991.90-1596,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.558,"We'll hear argument next in 90-1596, Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Society."
1991.90-1596,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,55.135,58.003,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1596,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,180.734,185.285,"Mr. Solicitor General, I can't resist asking you this question as kind of a predicate to the whole argument."
1991.90-1596,0,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,189.506,190.672,I think it's somewhere in between.
1991.90-1596,1,43372,todd_d_true,,1642.458,1645.928,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-1596,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1678.399,1691.207,"Mr. True, you would agree, would you not, that if there is a choice of possible interpretations of this statute and one of them would make it constitutional and one not, we should choose the one which would make it constitutional?"
1991.90-1596,1,43372,todd_d_true,,1691.207,1712.22,"Yes, Your Honor, if that choice is available, but our point is that in this statute, this statute that Congress enacted, all of the indicia in the statute itself, in its history, all fit together and point to the conclusion that Congress was deciding these cases for a year in enacting this statute."
1991.90-1596,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1712.22,1715.172,"So there is only one way to construe the statute, in your opinion."
1991.90-1596,1,43372,todd_d_true,,1715.172,1716.608,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1991.90-1596,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1716.608,1734.153,You don't think that it could be constructed in the way I suggested to General Starr that it just deals with the congressional designation of certain lands within which timbering could be held or which... in which it could not be used for timbering for 1990.
1991.90-1596,1,43372,todd_d_true,,1734.153,1734.77,"Yes, Your Honor--"
1991.90-1596,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1734.77,1738.772,But leaving in place all the management and administration.
1991.90-1596,1,43372,todd_d_true,,1739.872,1740.274,--Yes.
1991.90-1596,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1763.755,1768.557,Is that designation at issue in the suits that are pending?
1991.90-1596,1,43372,todd_d_true,,1768.557,1769.826,"--No, it is not."
1991.90-1596,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1844.805,1855.847,"Well, maybe it was just an inartful means of identifying a list of statutes that it wanted affected."
1991.90-1596,1,43372,todd_d_true,,1855.847,1859.382,"--Your Honor, I don't believe it was an inartful means of identifying--"
1991.90-1596,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1859.382,1865.536,"Was this provision enacted sort of in the middle of the night at the last minute, or what?"
1991.90-1596,1,43372,todd_d_true,,1865.536,1869.338,--It is certainly an amendment to an appropriations act--
1991.90-1596,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1869.338,1869.788,Yes.
1991.90-1596,1,43372,todd_d_true,,1869.788,1875.058,--which itself indicates that this shouldn't automatically be read as an amendment to the substantive law.
1991.90-1596,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1905.494,1931.061,"Well, what if 318 had just expressly said, we hereby are amending the... and they list... they identify the statute, we're amending them so that they will not be violated if these... if... as long as there's compliance with (b)(3) and (b)(5)?"
1991.90-1596,1,43372,todd_d_true,,1933.93,1940.834,"First, Your Honor, of course you would have a different statute than the one before you, but again, you would use the same approach."
1991.90-1596,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1968.667,1969.919,"Well, of course you would."
1991.90-1596,1,43372,todd_d_true,,1986.713,1993.218,"What you would have there is a strong indicator that Congress is changing the law, and of course that's what this is all about."
1991.90-1596,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2007.978,2013.363,"Well, you've got a rule of construction."
1991.90-1596,1,43372,todd_d_true,,2013.363,2014.298,"That I agree, Your Honor."
1991.90-1596,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2026.272,2027.906,"Let me just interrupt, if I may."
1991.90-1596,1,43372,todd_d_true,,2046.4,2055.958,--It places... it adds the additional requirement of placing certain areas of the forest off limits to logging for a year.
1991.90-1596,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2056.741,2059.592,And doesn't that constitute a change in the law?
1991.90-1596,1,43372,todd_d_true,,2059.592,2061.077,"--That is an additional... yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-1596,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2082.192,2102.504,"Yes, but it says if you live... if you stay out of these areas, then the area that should be... that is going to be logged will not be subject to any challenge."
1991.90-1596,1,43372,todd_d_true,,2104.439,2116.847,--The second sentence that speaks of judicial review says that there will be no judicial review of the statutory standards in (b)(3) and (b)(5).
1991.90-1596,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2158.205,2159.907,But Congress frequently speaks that way.
1991.90-1596,1,43372,todd_d_true,,2173.864,2192.391,"--Yes, Your Honor, that is something that Congress can do, but it depends on the particular circumstances of the statute as to whether saying something like that is simply something that Congress has the power to do, or whether it's deciding a case."
1991.90-1596,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2193.26,2193.693,Wait.
1991.90-1596,1,43372,todd_d_true,,2212.889,2214.174,--That is correct.
1991.90-1596,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2214.691,2217.376,"Now, is that what you mean by deciding a particular case?"
1991.90-1596,1,43372,todd_d_true,,2217.376,2222.863,"--That has the effect of deciding a particular case, but it also--"
1991.90-1596,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2222.863,2226.481,"I know, but it was also the purpose."
1991.90-1596,1,43372,todd_d_true,,2226.481,2233.985,"--Well, it isn't just the purpose of that statute to decide the particular case."
1991.90-1596,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2235.504,2235.804,"Well, wait."
1991.90-1596,1,43372,todd_d_true,,2252.113,2267.558,"--If it were exactly identical to this case, it had the same claims under the same laws against the same agency actions, then you would again have Congress determining that those actions meet the requirements of the law."
1991.90-1596,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2267.558,2272.877,Just as if you had another prosecution in my hypothetical under the same law for the same offense.
1991.90-1596,1,43372,todd_d_true,,2272.877,2273.612,But I think that--
1991.90-1596,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2273.612,2278.348,All those cases are being decided by Congress' amending the law.
1991.90-1596,1,43372,todd_d_true,,2278.348,2287.537,"--The difference, I think, Your Honor, is that in your hypothetical, what you have is Congress saying we... you have indicators."
1991.90-1596,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2319.925,2322.175,"Well, I'm not sure that's a fair description."
1991.90-1596,1,43372,todd_d_true,,2349.694,2350.61,"Yes, Your Honor, that's--"
1991.90-1596,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2350.61,2365.87,"So if all that they were doing is making a congressional designation of more habitat area, then I suppose there's nothing the matter with their shorthand description in this statute."
1991.90-1596,1,43372,todd_d_true,,2365.87,2383.081,"--Well, they did make the designation, and they did preclude judicial review of that, but the areas that they designated are only a small part of the forest, and they haven't changed or specified what's to happen in the rest of the forest."
1991.90-1596,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2383.081,2388.485,I'm saying perhaps Congress didn't go on and say what was to happen in the rest.
1991.90-1596,1,43372,todd_d_true,,2395.389,2428.794,"If it didn't designate what is to happen in the rest of the forest, then it's the existing laws at issue in our cases that determine whether the actions the agency takes on those areas of the forest meet or don't meet the requirements of the law, and the only thing that tells us whether this statute in (b)(6)(A), where it says these actions meet the requirements of the law, attempt to tell the courts what actions outside the areas off limits meet the requirements of the law."
1991.90-1596,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2431.479,2462.118,"Mr. True, would you be making the same argument if 6(a), instead of referring at the end of that first sentence to, is adequate consideration for the purpose of meeting the statutory requirements that are the basis for the consolidated cases captioned, blah, blah, blah... instead of saying that... and I must say, I don't know why they said that... what if they had just copied the citations of the statutes, you know, gone to the briefs in the cases and just copied those same statutes?"
1991.90-1596,1,43372,todd_d_true,,2464.5,2474.858,If nothing else about the history or the structure or any other aspect of the statute is changed except that you have a listing--
1991.90-1596,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3357.828,3383.296,"Very briefly, Mr. Chief Justice, the first point is, in our reply brief at page 12 we enumerate a number of statutes passed by Congress that specifically refer to pending litigation and deems the settlement that is approved by the Congress of the United States to have been made in accordance with the Constitution and all laws."
1991.90-1596,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3383.93,3387.048,Are any of those deeming statutes appropriations measures?
1991.90-1596,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3394.202,3400.023,--These are claims against the United States as well as against States.
1991.90-1596,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3479.992,3482.594,"Mr. Starr, can I ask you one point of information."
1991.90-1596,2,33983,kenneth_w_starr,,3490.199,3491.132,"No, there is not."
