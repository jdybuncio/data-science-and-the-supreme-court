1959.214,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,121.176,122.402,May I ask --
1959.214,0,28822,julian_t_abeles,,122.402,122.65,Yes.
1959.214,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,122.65,130.383,"May I ask you, I'm not familiar with Ball with that -- of what you read, was that a generalized statement by that author?"
1959.214,0,28822,julian_t_abeles,,130.383,130.621,"Well, that --"
1959.214,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,130.621,133.593,It has assigned property that you haven't got in -- in essence?
1959.214,0,28822,julian_t_abeles,,133.593,138.132,"That's a page, Your Honor, they referred to and that's the only thing I could find on that page that has any reference to it."
1959.214,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,147.922,150.355,"I mean, does the author --"
1959.214,0,28822,julian_t_abeles,,150.355,150.565,They cite --
1959.214,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,150.565,161.63,-- derive this statement as a general proposition of -- of conveyable or assignable interest or that he derived that from the copyright legislation?
1959.214,0,28822,julian_t_abeles,,161.63,163.305,"I don't know where he got it from, if the Court please."
1959.214,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,163.305,164.141,"Well, I -- I'm not --"
1959.214,0,28822,julian_t_abeles,,164.141,168.133,"It just seemed to be an off-hand statement, I think on his own, I can't understand why you made it, if I may say so."
1959.214,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,168.133,170.558,But if it isn't -- it isn't so as the generality.
1959.214,0,28822,julian_t_abeles,,171.518,171.636,No sir.
1959.214,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,171.636,172.482,-- a generality.
1959.214,0,28822,julian_t_abeles,,172.532,172.941,"It isn't so, either --"
1959.214,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,172.941,176.185,"-- of the copyright, but not as -- as the property generally?"
1959.214,0,28822,julian_t_abeles,,176.185,178.359,"It's not so as to copyright, either if will point out."
1959.214,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,178.359,180.233,"Well, that's why -- that's why you're here."
1959.214,0,28822,julian_t_abeles,,180.233,181.491,"That's right, sir."
1959.214,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,181.491,184.034,But as to general proposition if certainty calls.
1959.214,0,28822,julian_t_abeles,,184.034,188.024,I can't understand why Judge Bryant said the same thing.
1959.214,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,191.899,195.909,"Well, there has been no decision on this particular question as I understood?"
1959.214,0,28822,julian_t_abeles,,195.909,210.13,"Well, in Fox Film against Knowles, if the Court -- this Court did say, that the -- the -- this -- this Section 24 clearly evidence the fact that the executor does represent the person of his testator."
1959.214,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,229.269,242.915,"I'm merely suggesting that this case at least as I understand the problems of it, cannot be decided by general problems of property law and certainly not by wrong propositions of property law."
1959.214,0,28822,julian_t_abeles,,242.915,244.396,"That's right, sir."
1959.214,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,244.396,246.24,It has to be decided.
1959.214,0,28822,julian_t_abeles,,262.922,263.279,Yes.
1959.214,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,263.279,267.621,That's certainly is a matter of wrong statement that one could find in the Ball.
1959.214,0,28822,julian_t_abeles,,267.621,271.701,"And Judge Bryant says approximately the same thing, may I respectfully say so."
1959.214,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,279.827,281.092,May I interrupt you another?
1959.214,0,28822,julian_t_abeles,,281.092,281.182,Yes.
1959.214,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,281.182,285.384,"What if Ladas, who's writing that, do happen to know, what does he say about this?"
1959.214,0,28822,julian_t_abeles,,285.384,287.697,"Ladas, well, yes."
1959.214,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,300.967,302.951,"But admit, he says the author."
1959.214,0,28822,julian_t_abeles,,302.951,303.879,That's right.
1959.214,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,303.879,306.075,"Here, his talks about an author disposing of rights."
1959.214,0,28822,julian_t_abeles,,306.075,306.562,That's right.
1959.214,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,307.231,308.457,It's a very different thing from the same defense.
1959.214,0,28822,julian_t_abeles,,308.457,308.714,Yes.
1959.214,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,309.673,313.404,"And you can't deal with property that may come into your possession, but you haven't got now."
1959.214,0,28822,julian_t_abeles,,313.404,314.21,"That's right, sir."
1959.214,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,314.21,315.378,It's just silly.
1959.214,0,28822,julian_t_abeles,,315.378,319.34,Yes.
1959.214,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,320.458,321.155,"Well, I --"
1959.214,0,28822,julian_t_abeles,,321.155,322.251,"Unless I say, if you still want to --"
1959.214,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,322.251,322.429,No.
1959.214,0,28822,julian_t_abeles,,324.812,325.089,Yes.
1959.214,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,325.546,326.175,-- (Voice Overlap) the way of the author.

1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,2192.944,2197.363,"Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Court."
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2285.189,2286.836,The statutes say that?
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,2286.836,2287.066,Yes.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2288.292,2290.426,"Now, did the statute say that?"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,2292.27,2293.905,"It's my recollection, Your Honor of the 1790 statute --"
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2293.905,2294.697,Well I'm -- I'm not questioning --
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,2294.697,2295.057,Yes.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2295.057,2295.897,-- I just want to know.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,2295.897,2296.045,Yes.
1959.214,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2310.004,2314.525,"In other words, if he didn't -- if he didn't survive there was not renewal right at all, in anybody, is that what your point?"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,2314.525,2315.653,That's right.
1959.214,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2322.945,2327.055,"That's the case then, as I understand it, where the right died with the person?"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,2327.055,2328.8,That's correct.
1959.214,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2340.213,2341.678,-- which expired at his death.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,2341.678,2342.716,That's correct.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2535.735,2540.823,"The executor haven't been named in the statute, there'd be no power of testamentary disposition."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,2540.823,2542.338,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1959.214,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2559.468,2567.151,"If -- if it's a power of appointment, it's nonetheless to the executor as such, is it not?"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,2567.151,2567.468,Correct.
1959.214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2584.086,2588.685,"Well, May I ask you, Mr. Rudin, by whom is it assignable, the executor's power?"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,2588.685,2592.815,"I think -- I think, the power of appointment, I think it is subject to an agreement."
1959.214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2609.655,2614.694,"I want to -- I -- I'm just interested, whom it would be that would assign it, this would be the author?"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,2614.694,2616.041,"That's not the complete answer, I think."
1959.214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2616.041,2616.401,I see.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,2616.401,2622.327,It would be the author under federal law but I think you then have to refer to state law under De Sylva-Ballentine.
1959.214,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2903.144,2903.194,"Well, the --"

1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2912.416,2913.701,All those contingencies.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,2913.701,2914.041,Yes.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2914.303,2916.206,Or we can't very well --
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,2916.206,2928.037,"We're not dealing -- in -- in reality, if Congress intends that renewal periods should only be dealt with in terms of vested rights that you can't assign futures."

1959.214,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2946.821,2954.847,"There's always a contingency at least hypothetically that there won't be a renewal right, isn't there?"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,2955.713,2956.901,(Voice Overlap) completely.
1959.214,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2956.901,2965.979,"I'm -- I'm thinking of the case of a man who dies without a widow and without a -- without children, without a will so, therefore without an executor and without next of kin."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,2968.145,2968.892,A street case?
1959.214,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2970.786,2972.124,Then there would be no right of renewal?
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,2972.124,2972.681,That's right and not to argue --
1959.214,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2972.681,2975.623,And no matter how much you tried to tied up in any assignment agreements --
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,2975.623,2975.691,That's correct.
1959.214,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2975.691,2977.086,-- that there certainly wouldn't be a right with a --
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,2977.086,2977.565,"Absolutely right, Mr. Justice."
1959.214,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2977.565,2978.683,Am I right about that?
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,2978.683,2986.349,And I didn't want to go into the prior case that was argued but you -- in effect you have this additional problem whether it's a vested right.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3018.855,3031.265,"Well, you don't think that really we can talk with any kind of issue in both reality that anybody can really be -- as on safe ground as if he talks about the intention of Congress on this question, do you?"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3031.265,3032.041,No.I do not believe so --
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3032.041,3032.241,Alright.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3032.241,3032.67,-- Your Honor.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3070.276,3086.062,"You can get some -- I mean, draw some inferences from the fact that when they came to reconsider the -- the copyright law in 1831, they omitted the then living, the assignability of then living."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3086.062,3086.821,"Then living, yes."
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3087.837,3090.789,That was -- that was cutout from the 1790 Act.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3090.789,3096.124,"And also the executors, administrators or assigns phrase as -- as a total phrase."
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3096.124,3100.226,"But if one were to lean heavily, I don't know how heavily."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3108.784,3109.124,That's correct.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3110.948,3111.607,Nobody.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3111.607,3112.894,And we've not -- we'll not be here at all.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3112.894,3117.227,"That then living was a change in Congress, it isn't arrived wide open."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3117.227,3117.255,Yes.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3117.255,3118.131,And to anyone.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3118.131,3121.415,But extended it only to -- as far as the widow or children.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3121.415,3123.569,"Well, that isn't quite it."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3127.659,3128.036,That's correct.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3128.036,3129.703,But she now has it.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3137.524,3137.901,"Correct, Your Honor."
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3137.901,3138.959,Alright.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3138.959,3156.568,"No question about that and we say that those in whose favor the author exercised his testamentary power of appointment on the third step of the copyright, 1909 Act, are not -- their rights are not defeated by a prior assignment of the right which never vested."
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3156.568,3166.096,"But, what Congress -- when Congress said, “We don't want that between the widow and the -- and the publisher, we prefer the widow.”"

1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3181.413,3187.102,"Well, if he chooses (Inaudible) so that, her rights in its (Inaudible) by the statute."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3187.102,3188.288,That's right and the children.

1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3204.75,3204.77,Yes.

1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3240.9,3241.796,"Well, but you --"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3241.796,3242.155,-- almost drawing that concession --
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3242.155,3249.08,"You get some -- you get some like the other way because there, they require them to be alive for everybody."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3249.08,3249.519,Yes.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3249.863,3250.669,They cut that out.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3250.669,3258.354,"They cut that out but here, Your Honor, they said the executor and they deliberately omitted the administrator."
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3273.3,3275.625,"Well, if -- you stated the significance a minute ago."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3275.625,3275.773,Yes.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3275.773,3277.368,Even testamentary disposition.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3277.368,3279.023,"I believe so, that's --"
1959.214,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3279.023,3279.241,Well --
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3279.241,3282.133,-- that's whatever help I could get from the congressional intent.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3282.133,3303.014,"But I'm suggesting that by requiring that the author be alive at the termination date that -- and one staff is deleted as it was in 1831, then it opens up in a way, the general problem that we have to face in Fisher against Witmark namely, whether this should be allowed at all."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3307.794,3308.97,Decided that and I --
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3308.97,3309.766,Alright.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3309.766,3311.021,-- I see no need to reargue it.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3311.021,3311.69,No -- no.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3313.636,3317.638,Nor do I think we need it for the position here.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3410.117,3423.358,"Well, I understood that Mr. Ladas dealt with the copyright problem but it was -- excited my curiosity of what Mr. Abeles read from Ball as a general proposition of property law which surely --"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3423.358,3427.398,"Well, I'm sure Mr. -- I -- I think, I must also come to Mr. Ball's defense --"
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3427.398,3427.406,Alright.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3427.406,3428.542,-- since we cited him.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3428.542,3432.512,"But not by citing -- but not by reporting that, I'm sure you wouldn't defend to that one."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3432.512,3432.75,No.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3435.113,3437.359,"Well, alright."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3437.359,3461.059,"It says, “If the author survives the first 27 years of the original term, a prior assignment of his expectancy is valid and enforceable but if he dies before the 28th year of the first term, the right to renew passes to his beneficiaries in the order on which they are mentioned in Section 23 of the Act, thus invalidating any previous -- previous assignment of his expectancy."
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3461.059,3465.538,"Well, does he go on and give the reason as to general law, the properties that you can't assign something you haven't got?"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3465.538,3466.674,"Well, he went on to what reasons --"
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3466.674,3467.181,And --
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3467.181,3473.676,-- were argued but points out that this Court sort of rejected those reasons in Fisher versus Witmark.
1959.214,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3481.524,3486.977,There were those of my brethren and he thought there were misconceptions in what this Court rules?
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3486.977,3495.669,"Well, I'm confessed with the fact that if the present members of the Court who voted in that case with vote we might find that were reversed, Your Honor."
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3497.084,3501.286,-- certainly personal data -- were certainly interesting (Inaudible) data.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3501.286,3507.791,"[Laughs] But if they were the same mind then perhaps over the time -- the point is the case has been decided, I think this is very persuasive."
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3523.467,3528.245,"I don't think any -- any bill relating to that subject would be considered around the clock, would it?"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3528.245,3528.465,No.
1959.214,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3716.69,3722.916,"May I ask you in this connection, Mr. Rudin please?"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3745.118,3745.278,No.
1959.214,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3753.128,3763.122,"Now then, appointment you say was that -- that the right to leave it to the executor was in the power -- a power of appointment?"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3763.122,3767.052,"I don't really think, I think the executor was the vehicle, was the man that held legal title."
1959.214,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3769.007,3769.045,Well --
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3769.045,3770.76,-- that's what the (Inaudible) case held.
1959.214,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3770.76,3771.946,"Well, now let's see."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3813.193,3814.87,I do.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3826.742,3829.317,Your in -- your interpolating if he'd be living.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3831.012,3833.295,But it says if he'd be living at the first sentence.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3833.295,3833.964,What?
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3833.964,3837.208,"In the first sentence of the Act, Your Honor, the statute, it says if he'd be living."
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3837.955,3838.921,"It says, yes."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3839.201,3842.772,And I'm -- so I feel that that's the rhythm of it and not an interpretation.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3842.772,3849.457,"Certainly, our first claim if he'd be living but you -- you don't carry that over to the other, you don't qualify that in the reference for the rest but he may do --"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3849.457,3853.297,I don't see how I could if he couldn't very well have an executor and still be living.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3853.297,3853.874,No.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3860.838,3863.348,"What -- but what if he make a disposition, that was the question."
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3865.294,3882.408,"That all depends how we construe the statute and you can't assume the conclusion and argue there from -- he hasn't got anything and those questions or the -- the statute doesn't give him something because the statute projects itself beyond his death, certainly, as to the wife and the children."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3882.408,3883.007,But the statute --
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3883.007,3885.52,"And as for the executor, it projects itself."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3889.101,3889.418,Yes.
1959.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3897.716,3901.077,"Well, does it -- does it at the end it says and asking for the will, his next of kin."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3901.077,3903.502,He may have disliked his next of kin tremendously --

1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3903.52,3905.125,"--if he didn't leave a will, they would get it, Your Honor."
1959.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3905.125,3905.432,Yes.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3907.618,3910.961,Then his next of kin would get it whether he liked it or not.
1959.214,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3910.961,3915.295,Then didn't something survive his death even though he left no widow or child.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3915.295,3915.914,Correct.
1959.214,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3920.413,3920.591,But --
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3920.591,3925.858,"Well, but that doesn't answer whether he may have disposed of that power by doing something in his life."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3927.665,3928.471,Yes.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3928.471,3933.392,-- all I'm saying is that the case is not disposable by that kind of logical reasoning.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,3933.392,3935.865,"I think, perhaps so, Your Honor."
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4002.806,4020.103,Am I to infer from what you said that the -- that the author could make a contract binding his executor with the creation of a right for specific performance by the assignee so far?
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4020.103,4020.47,No.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4023.704,4035.862,"Well, but by specific performance I mean that he could get a renewal that the executor would have to in his designated capacity as for the renewal and then transfer it, that's was I loosely called --"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4035.862,4035.94,I'd like to --
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4035.94,4036.946,"-- in effect, specific performance."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4036.946,4038.501,-- I'd like to answer that in three steps.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4049.655,4050.873,That question isn't here?
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4050.873,4052.717,"That question isn't here though, Your Honor."
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4054.354,4075.58,"All I'm saying is, I'm -- I'm interested in your argument that this could be accomplished by making an arrangement using a neutral term, an arrangement in the light of the author who predeceases his 28th year and yet have to be effectuated by the executor so that the assignee have to almost get the reality, namely the assignment."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4075.58,4085.657,"If -- if under particular state law he was able to buy the right to -- to inherit by will, if he was -- I could go to a man and say, “I will give you” and it's done."
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4108.484,4127.689,"Well, I should think it raises a number -- created a number of questions that we did not decide or face in De Sylva that you could so construe the copyright law that you could work out an assignment that after the author's death before his 28th year in some states not in other, that would give me a lot of trouble myself."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4127.689,4135.171,"Well, Your Honor, perhaps so and perhaps it should be a matter of state law -- a -- a federal law that is not assignable."
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4135.171,4150.0,"Well, we -- we have to catch all that out of the air in dealing with the question whether an author who dies before the 28th year can effectuate the contingency to fall into the hands of his or for shorthand called assignee."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4150.0,4152.435,It might be the next case this Court would have to decide --
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4152.435,4152.533,Well --
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4152.533,4153.479,"-- it's not present in this case, Your Honor."
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4153.479,4153.787,No.
1959.214,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4154.095,4155.162,"Well, is this case on all force with Fisher in your judgment?"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4155.162,4175.477,"Some all force with respect to the fact that in the Fisher case, this Court simply held that there was no restriction on the assignability of the future contingent right that a man could assign his renewal right prior to the time that vested."
1959.214,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4175.477,4175.535,Yes.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4175.535,4185.64,"But the Fisher case went on to recognize that if he died prior to the right vesting, the assignee took exactly nothing because the right didn't vest."
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4188.037,4190.948,The Fisher case decide this case by dictum?
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4190.948,4191.558,"No, Your Honor."
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4192.674,4194.009,Closely reprehensible then.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4194.009,4194.349,No.

1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4205.703,4206.332,I take it back.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4210.4,4211.298,I had hoped so in that --
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4211.298,4211.588,Yes.
1959.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4231.486,4232.562,Did I -- did I --
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4232.562,4237.64,I assumed it was -- it -- it has been so often quoted as having appeared in that opinion that I was almost made to believe.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4237.64,4242.628,Very responsible for all the misquotations by even eminent members of the bar.

1959.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4269.637,4272.362,And what about the assignment if he has a wife then?
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4272.362,4276.292,"Well, he would have to get it from the wife because if the wife would then get it, wife or children."

1959.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4329.775,4336.652,Is there any difference in that in practical effect in the claim of the executor?
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4336.652,4336.8,No.
1959.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4338.525,4342.445,The claim of the executor of course would be for whoever the beneficiaries are.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4342.445,4348.708,I believe the executor represents the first of the beneficiaries in this case and not the person of the testator.

1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4424.936,4425.243,Yes.
1959.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4449.351,4450.247,Or the next of kin?
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4450.247,4451.555,Or the next of kin.
1959.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4451.603,4457.429,"Well -- well, do I understand then that they say that it doesn't defeat the right of the next of kin?"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4461.399,4461.689,That's correct.
1959.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4461.689,4466.956,"If he makes a will, he somehow cuts off the beneficiaries even if they are the next of kin?"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4466.956,4474.748,"Yes, because here in this particular case, they had an assignment in the next of kin and they are not asserting their rights under that assignment."
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4474.748,4481.512,"But -- but you don't -- in your view doesn't give anything to the next of kin, does it?"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4481.512,4484.589,"In my view in -- in what under the facts stated by, Mr. Justice Black."
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4484.589,4485.385,No.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4487.481,4488.008,That's right.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4488.008,4494.064,--Because -- because the -- this -- because the testamentary disposition deter -- controls the whole disposition.

1959.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4496.377,4502.573,"Well that, suppose he had made his next of kin the beneficiary."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4502.573,4503.29,I believe that there's --
1959.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4503.29,4504.426,Would that make any difference?
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4504.426,4507.827,I don't -- it might have made a difference but not as a matter of copyright law.
1959.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4510.5,4511.057,I'm talking about --
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4511.057,4511.624,-- the instrument.
1959.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4511.624,4513.588,I'm talking about this law.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4513.588,4514.806,"But under this law, I don't think it would make any difference."

1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4517.089,4518.317,But they wouldn't take his next of kin.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4518.317,4519.243,They wouldn't --

1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4519.513,4520.16,That's the point.

1959.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4536.087,4537.263,What is the argument?
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4537.263,4546.584,"Because Congress could've well said that in the absence of a will, it should go to the Library of Congress for the benefit of buying books or general fund or for charity."
1959.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4553.7,4557.707,"But what about the executor, they only passed it to him if -- if he did exercise his testamentary --"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4557.707,4563.422,"I believe they passed it to the executor in his capacity, his illegal institution not beneficially."
1959.214,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4579.369,4584.078,You would have to make some distinction that's in light of the fact you don't get.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4592.343,4593.199,That's correct.
1959.214,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4593.199,4605.844,"Now, isn't that the mere name, you have a right to any -- any executor's requirements field, the exercise of the power of appointment in the sense you used that term."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4605.844,4606.014,Yes.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4607.639,4609.873,From any executor.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4609.873,4610.33,They --
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4610.33,4611.047,And that was --
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4611.047,4615.426,Name an executor and under the (Inaudible) case to designate who shall receive the benefits of that.
1959.214,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4615.426,4617.652,"Well, of course the executor appears on the will -- will --"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4617.652,4618.269,That's right.
1959.214,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4618.269,4623.956,"-- and with the power of appointment, the sanction here is that power to name (Inaudible)"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4623.956,4624.712,That -- that's right.
1959.214,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4624.712,4628.954,"Now, you mean that true, in just every case with an executor's name?"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4628.954,4629.054,Yes.
1959.214,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4629.054,4630.968,What's the difference between this and in the other (Voice Overlap)
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4630.968,4635.519,"Well, let me -- let me illustrate it directly with copyright law, Mr. Justice Whitaker."

1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4666.338,4666.967,Right.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4675.076,4678.959,But -- but isn't -- isn't that what the whole litigation is about?
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4678.959,4679.236,"Well, I at least --"
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4679.236,4681.382,-- maybe what you just said.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4688.007,4688.826,Correct.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4689.143,4689.453,-- discussions.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4689.453,4717.04,"And we respectfully submit that if Congress, if you look at the purpose, if -- if you have the widow and children first, why did the Congress say, executor and not at -- to his estate or not to his executor's administrators or assigns if they intended that the third class as I put it, was of the same nature of the first class that the only thing that stopped it from merging together was the second class, the widow or children."
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4727.992,4759.188,"Well, I -- I must say I can -- I can understand why you're here and the argument your making but I can't understand that I'm on the logic of compulsion to hold that because Congress said we are going to protect the man's wife and his children, but we also give him the right to cut them off if he wants that and we also give him the right respecting that to make such other disposition as he wants to make, cut out all his next of kin and everybody else."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4760.176,4762.571,I respectfully submit that is the position.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4762.571,4763.397,Well --
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4763.397,4764.974,Congress gave him two rights in Section 24.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4764.974,4782.138,"But It doesn't -- from that I can't -- you draw -- you say I'm on the logic of compulsion therefore to hold, that he cannot limit the -- that (Inaudible) power, the power to leave things by will or his protecting the wife and children."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4788.976,4790.493,"That's not quite what I've said, Your Honor."
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4790.493,4791.451,I didn't say you said that.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4793.389,4793.627,I thought -- I would like --
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4793.627,4800.761,"I did understand you to say that because of one and two, that sheds light on three, is that right?"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4800.761,4805.799,"I said, one and two would shed light if three is a different animal than one."

1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4840.729,4841.675,I agree with you.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4842.643,4843.571,"But right, we submit that rights --"
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4843.571,4846.925,That I also agree with you that I mustn't decide it your way.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4846.925,4847.811,No.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4865.774,4868.309,"Well, that's an -- that's a very different argument."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4887.566,4887.903,Yes.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4888.093,4890.756,"That argument, as he could've but you say he didn't do it."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4890.756,4891.233,I say he did not --
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4891.233,4891.552,Alright.(Voice Overlap) --
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4891.552,4892.87,-- do it under the facts in this case.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4892.87,4894.684,That is totally different --
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4894.684,4895.203,Yes.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4895.203,4904.259,-- but they carry your -- that they feel but all I'm saying that that does start with the proposition with the recognition that he could in his lifetime.
1959.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4913.734,4916.838,Do you agree to that?
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4916.838,4923.882,"I -- if I would agree to that, I might be deciding the fifth case that has to come before this Court because it's not before --"

1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4954.642,4955.939,I think that's a very fair statement.

1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,4971.943,4977.85,That phrase frightens me somewhat having been counsel of Hammerstein versus Superior Court shortly after leaving law school.

1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4997.813,4998.679,There's no need to worry.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5001.631,5002.12,Yes.

1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5021.845,5027.262,"Well, I might give you about 20 different ambiguities in Section 24 but not on before the Court at this time --"

1959.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5242.854,5244.321,"But, I'm asking him because I -- I'm --"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5244.321,5245.606,"Well, I can't say, Wit --"
1959.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5245.606,5254.582,"-- a little confused by quite different to my brother, I'm a little confused in that position by the statements you made."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5278.756,5280.231,"Well, Your Honor, can I give you this?"
1959.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5280.231,5285.36,And I find it far more difficult than I would maybe it's because I just said it in the other case.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5285.36,5285.757,Yes.
1959.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5286.785,5306.462,"On the -- somewhat believe that the mere fact if the case held there could be an assignment, does not mean now that I have to say that it also deprives the man of making a will which would designate someone else to receive it."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5309.983,5315.39,"Well, I don't think the Witmark case went so far because what I'm getting at is this."
1959.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5342.863,5344.979,I have no doubt about Black Acre.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5345.845,5346.045,No.
1959.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5346.811,5348.947,I'm thinking about this statute.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5348.947,5349.576,But this statute --
1959.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5349.576,5357.348,It gives certain people the right in all their name to do certain things and that's all I -- the Black Acre --
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5357.348,5357.715,I'll answer it --
1959.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5357.715,5358.663,-- couldn't get me anywhere.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5358.663,5359.621,"Well, may I attempt to answer this --"
1959.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5359.621,5360.639,(Voice Overlap) is what I don't understand.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5360.639,5362.873,"Mr. Justice Black, may I answer it this way."
1959.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5386.348,5387.406,"Now, that I understand."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5387.406,5394.435,"Now, Fisher versus Witmark said that the right he acquired if he lived was assignable prior to that vesting."
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5409.294,5409.693,"Well, Mr. Rudin."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5409.693,5410.921,-- of that right.

1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5443.306,5444.175,That's correct.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5444.175,5445.88,I -- I say that that --
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5445.88,5447.844,It there is assignment of that right to bequeath.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5447.844,5448.223,Yes.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5457.722,5458.331,"Well, if --"
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5458.331,5459.646,Isn't that right?
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5459.646,5459.966,Yes.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5470.421,5475.581,"If it's two reasons, one, it couldn't under the statute, the other is that it didn't."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5475.581,5479.312,I -- I respectfully submit on some (Voice Overlap) --
1959.214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5479.312,5485.308,I gather your position is you may defend the objections in your favor below in any grounds you can without regard to the questions of --
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5485.308,5489.086,"Well, certainly we did but we don't think we have to defend it because he hasn't raised it."
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5501.973,5513.018,"You can defend a judgement on any ground with reference to the -- to the decision of the case if you can't bring in on the questions presented, another issue not in the case."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5513.018,5514.442,I don't want to make my task any harder --
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5514.442,5514.542,Alright.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5514.542,5521.384,"-- than it is, Your Honor."
1959.214,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5577.476,5584.57,And that -- that so even though the author died prior to the beginning of the 28th year
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5584.57,5585.576,Yes.
1959.214,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5585.576,5588.249,And that was the situation in the Fox case.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5591.88,5592.736,Yes.
1959.214,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5595.489,5595.727,"Now, then --"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5595.727,5598.418,"-- he could exercise it prior to his death, the power of appointment."
1959.214,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5598.418,5609.324,Then does an executor at least normally take assets in his hands subject to valid contracts made with the testator?
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5609.324,5609.671,Yes.
1959.214,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,5611.258,5614.641,"Now, does that apply to copyrights, I don't know?"
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5614.641,5619.799,"It would apply to copyrights if that was the type of contract involved here, Your Honor, but it was not."
1959.214,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5671.594,5684.336,"It is fair to say, Mr. Rudin, if not, tell me so that the basic difference between you and -- and your brother forgetting about the terms of this particular instrument and forgetting about that -- that question."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5700.086,5700.852,That's correct.
1959.214,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5700.852,5703.747,Is that a -- is that a fair basic statement of the difference between --
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5703.747,5706.819,"It's a very short statement of it, yes.I -- I believe that sir."
1959.214,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5724.749,5725.318,Is the equivalent of an executor.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5725.318,5728.103,-- apply that thing and turn it over to his town (Voice Overlap) --
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5728.103,5733.38,The question isn't whether you or Mr. Abeles -- or you and Mr. Abeles' view what an executor is.
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5777.367,5777.405,Well --
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5777.405,5791.296,"And you have to decide what the shoes are and if you change the figure if there's a -- if -- if he has something which has disposable monetary value, then he can take care of it by his will."
1959.214,1,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5791.296,5799.291,My time is up and I would love to say further except I might just briefly say an executor does have rights under the Federal Employers Liability Act to cause of action.
1959.214,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5799.291,5801.397,He -- he has -- sure he has but he --

1959.214,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5803.171,5803.82,"Yes, yes."
1959.214,2,28822,julian_t_abeles,,5803.82,5805.257,-- to declare what these (Inaudible) decide that.
1959.214,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5805.257,5807.453,"No, no indeed you have more time -- yes."
1959.214,2,28822,julian_t_abeles,,5807.453,5820.692,"I'm sorry, counsel inadvertently said that in the Fisher case the -- the Court had mentioned the fact that the man had died and that depended upon whether or not he lived for the assignment to take effect."
1959.214,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5820.999,5821.758,He corrected that.
1959.214,3,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5822.365,5823.391,-- he doesn't say that all.
1959.214,3,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5824.497,5826.691,(Voice Overlap) and corrected that.
1959.214,3,36554,milton_a_rudin,,5826.691,5829.693,Until now you repeated again at the end perhaps --
1959.214,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5829.693,5832.565,"(Voice Overlap) But he did lived the 28th years, didn't he?"
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,5832.565,5833.234,Yes he did.
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5853.301,5865.269,"Well, may I ask you what your position means that your assignment would also cutoff the next of kin had there been no will?"
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,5865.269,5871.752,The -- that assignment would but the assignment of the company were not because we obtained assignments for the next of kin.
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5873.117,5873.297,"Well, I --"
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,5873.297,5874.912,But if I didn't get definitely so.
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5874.912,5879.301,"Suppose you had not had one, the man had died without a will."
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,5879.301,5881.936,Wouldn't be -- wouldn't -- my assignment wouldn't be effective.
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5881.936,5882.742,Would not be good?
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,5882.742,5883.86,No.
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5883.86,5885.128,Why?
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,5885.128,5885.376,Why?
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5890.065,5893.736,And also the statute says that he makes a will it's --
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,5893.736,5894.093,But I still --
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5894.093,5895.431,-- his executor gets it?
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,5895.431,5897.086,That's right.
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5901.156,5902.352,But the executor --
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,5902.352,5903.238,-- saves us to the shoes of --
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5903.238,5913.656,"And if he is -- in other words, if a man doesn't make a will, it goes to next of kin despite your assignment."
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,5913.656,5915.48,Unless I get a separate assignment.
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5915.48,5920.42,"Well, unless you get from -- I mean you -- you can't overwrite the rights of the next of kin."
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,5920.42,5921.199,"Of course, not."
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5921.199,5921.846,"Well, that's while you were --"
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,5921.846,5924.758,That's the reason I got it from the --
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5924.758,5930.121,"But if he does make a -- but if he does make a will, then it's no good."
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,5930.121,5931.726,"The assignment for the next of kin, correct."
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5931.726,5940.987,"Well, I'm -- the -- I'm not talking about next of kin he does make a will and decides he wants to give it to the next of kin and somebody else."
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,5947.472,5947.779,Yes.
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5981.628,5983.724,Well there are many -- many ways they could have made it clear.
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,5983.724,5984.49,That's true --
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5984.49,5984.55,But if --
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,5984.55,5985.568,And I think -- I think --
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5985.568,5992.452,"I -- I understand that here you say that in the first place, it would go to the widow and the children."
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,5992.452,5993.857,Definitely.
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5993.857,5995.452,No assignment could cut it off?
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,5995.452,5996.548,Definitely.
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5996.548,5998.582,The next class they make is an executor.
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,5998.582,5998.74,Right.
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5998.74,6003.319,You say that that is cutoff by society.
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,6003.319,6004.185,"Cutoff badly, sir?"
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6004.185,6006.441,"No, by your assignment to you."
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,6006.441,6007.088,No.
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6009.93,6014.671,"Well, does the -- is the will any good does -- does anybody get anything from it?"
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,6014.671,6014.869,Yes.
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6014.947,6016.302,The point of assignment you speak of.
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,6016.302,6024.565,"Yes we do because if it wasn't for the will, we wouldn't get it by appointing the executor, he really effectuates the disposition to us through the executor."
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6024.565,6026.978,But even though he didn't try to.
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,6026.978,6028.246,I don't know if he did or didn't.
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6029.222,6033.304,Did he name you as -- did the will name you as the beneficiary?
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,6033.304,6034.07,No.
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6034.07,6035.298,Alright.
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,6041.574,6042.011,"Yes, sir."
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6042.011,6044.766,Do you say that your assignment is no good against him?
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,6044.766,6046.79,"If there's no will, that's correct."
1959.214,4,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6046.79,6048.674,"Now then, let me ask you if I may sir."
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,6048.674,6048.824,"Yes, sir."
1959.214,4,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6048.824,6052.085,I want to get back to this administrator business.
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,6093.583,6095.278,"Well, I -- the Court could leave him."
1959.214,4,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6102.162,6103.248,You have to take it in a way --
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,6103.248,6103.496,I am.
1959.214,4,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6103.496,6109.103,"-- to keep any inconsistency of the statute and the statute full read is perfectly plain, isn't it?"
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,6109.103,6110.408,"I understand that, sir."
1959.214,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6110.408,6111.875,It's just plain language.
1959.214,4,28822,julian_t_abeles,,6111.875,6112.764,"That's right, sir."
1959.214,4,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,6114.369,6116.962,It is to me.
