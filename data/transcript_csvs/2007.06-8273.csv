2007.06-8273,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,4.592,We'll hear argument first this morning in Danforth v. Minnesota.
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,6.014,24.333,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In this case, the Minnesota Supreme Court held that this Court had prevented it from deciding for itself which State prisoners can go into Minnesota State courts to raise Federal constitutional challenges to their conviction."
2007.06-8273,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,50.48,55.042,"Well, I propose if the State of Minnesota really cared about this, it could have its own confrontation rule."
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,56.276,59.945,"--The State constitution, Justice Kennedy, has a confrontation clause."
2007.06-8273,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,72.642,75.126,That means the State isn't necessarily tied in knots.
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,78.907,84.31,"--The question in this case, Your Honor, I think, is that whether... is the question of whether it has to."
2007.06-8273,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,93.9,110.674,"Well, page 2 of your reply brief, the yellow brief, you take issue with the State, and you say the State is wrong if there is a decision either way on the confrontation clause and it's questionable under Federal law, we can review it."
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,114.36,115.875,Well--
2007.06-8273,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,115.875,117.187,That is the problem.
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,126.793,127.496,--Your Honor--
2007.06-8273,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,127.496,129.824,And that was the basis on which we decided Crawford.
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,129.824,139.583,"--Your Honor, it's simply a regime under which the State court, as it can in any number of other contexts, can choose to consider the merits of a litigant's claim."
2007.06-8273,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,152.86,157.748,"And you think that our holding in Teague was that it did, but we're not going to let you out of jail?"
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,157.748,158.607,I think--
2007.06-8273,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,158.607,168.604,"You think that's really what we said in Teague, that even though your constitutional rights were violated, we're going to foreclose the remedy of habeas corpus?"
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,177.976,187.829,"--Your Honor, what the Teague Court did was set up a procedural and a prudential limit on a defense available for the State in the particular form of habeas corpus."
2007.06-8273,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,187.829,198.263,"That issue is not a necessary part of your case at all, but you don't have to suggest that you could depart."
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,212.039,212.805,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2007.06-8273,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,226.361,230.532,"Well, Federal rules don't have minimums and maximums."
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,260.285,264.876,"Respectfully, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that's necessarily true."
2007.06-8273,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,281.09,283.479,"Well, how do you... I understand your point."
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,305.314,319.559,"--What we're arguing for, Mr. Chief Justice, is discretion in the State to disagree with the general policy rule that a court will not consider a new rule when considering the validity of a conviction on, in Teague's case, habeas or on collateral review."
2007.06-8273,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,319.559,330.382,"It's a general policy rule, but it may well, as in the Crawford case, as a good example, have affected this Court's initial determination to strike off in a new direction."
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,335.645,336.724,Well--
2007.06-8273,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,336.724,337.755,And I think it is--
2007.06-8273,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,337.755,339.676,--to that effect.
2007.06-8273,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,339.676,354.063,--Is it not a substantive determination of Federal law when you say that this constitutional change that we're making in this case or that we have made in a past case is not retroactive?
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,373.866,414.927,"--I think, Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy, if I could address your points in turn, on Justice Scalia's question about whether there was or was not a constitutional violation, if the Court is really holding that there was... that something... that there was no constitutional violation at the time Petitioner's conviction became final or at the time Mr. Bockting's conviction became final in the habeas case, then what the Court is really holding is that Crawford didn't just interpret the confrontation clause; it somehow changed the confrontation clause, that the confrontation clause meant... that the confrontation clause said one thing at one point and now says something else."
2007.06-8273,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,414.927,419.52,"I think that's exactly what Crawford means, and I think that's exactly what happened."
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,462.548,466.407,"But the question, Your Honor--"
2007.06-8273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,466.407,470.327,But your basic position is that we should not be making new law.
2007.06-8273,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,486.82,490.522,My position is we have asserted all that power in the world.
2007.06-8273,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,491.757,500.222,"But there is... there is... it's not as though we have a new rule, and we apply it from this day forward."
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,532.912,534.645,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it did."
2007.06-8273,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,549.451,561.322,"And during the period between Linkletter and Griffith, did the State... if the Supreme Court said that a decision was not retroactive, did State supreme courts feel free to apply it retroactively?"
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,561.322,565.758,"--It... there... there doesn't seem to be any case law on that point, Your Honor, that I'm aware of."
2007.06-8273,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,576.019,578.174,Can a State... can they pick... can a State pick and choose?
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,584.921,596.244,"--I think, when it... if you consider, Mr. Chief Justice, that the Teague rule is a procedural rule about who gets to make what claims, then I think the answer to your question is yes."
2007.06-8273,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,597.916,612.567,"Well, and if you think that the Teague rule is an assessment of the substantive... part of the substantive constitutional interpretation, an assessment about what the impact of Crawford is versus other decisions, then I guess they couldn't, right?"
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,612.567,616.113,"--Well, it depends on the impact in what... in what setting, Your Honor."
2007.06-8273,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,638.791,645.71,"Well, even... even outside of the habeas context, we... we decided a case, Hudson v. Walker, one or two terms ago."
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,687.365,690.067,"No, Your Honor."
2007.06-8273,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,722.366,727.583,"But... but you agree with me, then, that under your position, the State could apply an exclusionary rule."
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,727.583,729.675,"--Yes, Your Honor, it could under State law."
2007.06-8273,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,730.691,742.546,"Based on the distinction between right and remedy, a distinction that is... that in countless areas of the law we... we have said is... is an ephemeral one?"
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,742.546,745.982,"--Well, the... that is not based on that distinction."
2007.06-8273,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,783.138,793.134,"Mr. Butler, let me... this is a habeas case, but I assume the same issue could come up in a... in a direct appeal to the State Supreme Court."
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,807.253,817.749,"As long, Justice Scalia, as the State acknowledges that it is using State law to do so, that it is... that it is not mismanaging this Court's retroactivity jurisprudence."
2007.06-8273,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,821.138,833.007,"If it bases its decision on the Federal Constitution, and we have said that this Federal constitutional rule is not retroactive, what... what do they say on a direct appeal?"
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,833.007,835.272,On a... on a direct--
2007.06-8273,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,835.272,840.864,"And my next question is going to be whatever they say, when it comes up to us, what do we do?"
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,840.864,844.472,"--It would... it would depend on the facts of the case, Your Honor."
2007.06-8273,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,844.472,866.042,"I'm... I'm confused on this one, because I thought it was part of our retroactivity jurisprudence that the States must apply that new rule while the case is still in the pipeline, while it is on direct appeal, not that they... well, they just may, but they absolutely must apply it retroactively."
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,869.229,871.586,"That is, Your Honor, what Griffith says, and that's... that's what... that's--"
2007.06-8273,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,871.586,873.538,My case was not in the pipeline.
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,888.501,889.189,--My answer is--
2007.06-8273,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,889.189,889.72,Habeas or not?
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,889.72,892.891,"--My answer, Your Honor, is that if the... the--"
2007.06-8273,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,892.891,898.888,"If it comes up after... if the prosecution is after the Federal decision, of course, the decision has to apply."
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,898.888,900.918,"--Yes, I think that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-8273,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,918.551,921.66,Does your... does your approach apply to legislative enactment's as well?
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,942.776,956.004,"I think that's a... that's a somewhat different question, Your Honor, and it would... it would depend on if... if Congress passed a law that said no State court shall apply retroactively something or other--"
2007.06-8273,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,956.004,956.426,"No, no."
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,973.124,977.653,"--In the past, Your... I think... I think the short answer to your question, Mr. Chief Justice, is yes."
2007.06-8273,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,989.43,1001.252,"Well, your reliance on this ancient distinction between right and remedy... I mean if Congress says you don't have a remedy if it's retroactive, it's hard to say what kind of right you have."
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,1001.252,1009.233,"--If, Your Honor... think about the... the tax cases, for example, American Trucking and McKesson, the case... the companion case."
2007.06-8273,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1029.383,1031.694,"Sure, as a matter of State law."
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,1031.694,1032.038,Yes.
2007.06-8273,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1032.038,1036.394,But here you are arguing in favor of retro-application of Federal law.
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,1044.828,1051.075,"What... what we are relying on... we are relying, Mr. Chief Justice, on the substance of the Sixth Amendment, yes."
2007.06-8273,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1053.575,1053.747,No.
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,1078.111,1080.205,"That is absolutely my point, Justice Souter."
2007.06-8273,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1080.205,1089.95,"You are saying that, ultimately, the State's choice in this case rests upon a choice of State common law about procedure leading to remedy."
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,1089.95,1091.543,"It is not even just State common law, Justice Souter."
2007.06-8273,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1093.433,1093.668,No.
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,1109.787,1117.392,"Only, Mr. Chief Justice, if the Federal interest is so strong as to outweigh all of the State court interests."
2007.06-8273,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1126.482,1136.744,"That always assumes that that's a remedial question, and that the question is not was the Constitution violated at the time this act occurred."
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,1142.618,1144.944,"That's true, Justice Scalia."
2007.06-8273,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1157.189,1176.666,"But if you can say... it is a little odd that the State executive can say, yes, as far as we're concerned, we like the new law, or what was always the law but the Court wasn't perceptive enough to see that, we like it, so we're not going to raise Teague."
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,1182.397,1184.568,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-8273,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1189.692,1199.218,"I assume that the State executive can do that with respect to any Federal law that it's authorized to implement, simply choose not to, couldn't it?"
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,1201.577,1205.184,"No, Justice Scalia, respectfully, I don't think that's true."
2007.06-8273,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1230.598,1234.611,"You want us to write an opinion which begins with the sentence,"
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,1243.481,1248.011,"No, Justice Kennedy, I don't think that's what the opinion should start with."
2007.06-8273,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1276.077,1282.184,"If Crawford had been a decision of the Minnesota Supreme Court, is it clear what retroactivity rule they would have applied?"
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,1282.184,1284.434,"--No, Justice Alito, it's not."
2007.06-8273,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1294.977,1320.2,"Mr. Butler, if as you say Teague is, in effect, a comity rule, then what is your answer, in effect, to Justice Scalia's point that we make a decision when we come down with a substantive legal judgment about the Constitution, we make a decision as to whether the rule is retroactive or not?"
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,1350.954,1358.872,"The retroactivity analysis, Your Honor, when this Court makes a decision is that, as Justice Ginsburg suggested earlier, Griffith."
2007.06-8273,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1374.085,1374.71,"Alright, but let's be more specific."
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,1378.444,1379.567,--That it will apply.
2007.06-8273,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1379.567,1388.174,And it will apply to some cases that depend upon facts and have eventuated from trials that are--
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,1388.174,1389.407,--that are already finished.
2007.06-8273,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1389.407,1389.626,--Right.
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,1392.312,1393.047,"Yes, absolutely."
2007.06-8273,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1393.047,1416.256,"And if there is going to be some retroactivity, then I take it your position has got to be and is our substantive decisions are not so much retroactive or non-retroactive, but retroactively applied, to some extent, and not retroactively applied to others, and a State is free to apply it more retroactively than ours."
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,1418.364,1420.457,"That is the gravamen of our argument, Justice Souter."
2007.06-8273,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1420.457,1434.046,"So your answer to Justice Scalia is, I take it, not that the decision is retroactive or not, but there is a decision about the degree to which applications will be retroactive or not?"
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,1435.325,1436.043,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2007.06-8273,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1436.043,1445.415,"Then do you think the State is free to decide how and when and whether it will, quote, apply?"
2007.06-8273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1459.503,1464.096,You're overlooking what I understand to be the basic distinction you're drawing.
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,1510.765,1512.248,"I think that's correct, Justice Stevens."
2007.06-8273,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1513.873,1516.793,--it is the other way around which makes it problematic.
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,1531.646,1546.015,"--What I want to say, Mr. Chief Justice, is that if there is a violation of the test of the Sixth Amendment confrontation clause, this Court decides what remedies are required, what remedies for certain people and perhaps for other people what remedies are not required."
2007.06-8273,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1577.205,1583.813,"It's subject to the floor, that the floor that this Court sets, it must be retroactive to a certain extent."
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,1583.813,1585.078,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2007.06-8273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1606.272,1609.943,It is the same as the question of whether to apply the exclusionary rule.
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,1609.943,1610.536,It is.
2007.06-8273,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1610.536,1611.427,That was a remedial decision.
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,1626.437,1629.138,"In habeas corpus as well, Justice Stevens."
2007.06-8273,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1636.275,1646.381,"So you have to argue, and this is why I think the distinction has been rejected in so many other areas of the law, you have to argue that the remedy question is totally separate from an analysis of the right."
2007.06-8273,0,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,1667.357,1674.728,"We are not asserting, Mr. Chief Justice, that the State court has the ability to disagree with this Court's interpretation of the Federal Constitution."
2007.06-8273,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1782.263,1783.029,"Thank you... thank you, Mr. Butler."
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,1787.323,1800.428,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Federal law controls the retroactivity or non-retroactivity of new constitutional rulings."
2007.06-8273,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1804.458,1813.361,"May I ask you, just at the outset, when you use the term retroactivity, are you saying there was no violation of the Constitution before the decision, or there just is no remedy for it?"
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,1813.361,1825.855,"--Your Honor, I think in this... this Court has made it clear in the retroactivity area that retroactivity is a question of the substantive constitutional standard that will applies to a specific defendant."
2007.06-8273,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1830.681,1836.023,--one of the cases where the line is drawn when the expiration of the direct review has passed.
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,1844.161,1845.754,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2007.06-8273,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1859.593,1863.277,Is part of that because of what's involved in expectations?
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,1876.116,1882.505,"Yes, Your Honor, and the point is that the substantive rights and retroactivity are not two different things."
2007.06-8273,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1882.505,1888.519,And here the expectation... in Smith it was the expectation of people in the private sector.
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,1890.767,1892.048,"Exactly, Your Honor."
2007.06-8273,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1892.048,1910.899,"Then how do you... how do you reconcile that answer with the point that your brother made just before he sat down, and that is, taking standard Griffith analysis, the application of a so-called new rule is going to vary depending on how long it takes a person on direct appeal to get through the State court system?"
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,1933.421,1940.45,"Your Honor, two points: First of all, I think Griffith is very clear, that finality is that point."
2007.06-8273,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1976.592,1983.356,"I understand your... your point about finality, and finality has a well-known operative effect."
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,2028.338,2037.537,"--Your Honor, given the varied proceedings at the State level, that... that is inevitable no matter what time this Court--"
2007.06-8273,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2037.537,2042.255,"And if it is inevitable, I don't see how you can answer Justice Stevens's question the way you did."
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,2042.255,2058.716,"--Your Honor, the point in Griffith is that in terms of uniformity, this is... in terms of providing similarly situated people, the best the Court can do in this area is to cut... to make the point at finality--"
2007.06-8273,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2058.716,2072.976,"And the finality point in effect establishes a way of calculating the application of a rule in any given State in any given case, but it will not result in the uniform application of the rule."
2007.06-8273,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2073.539,2076.257,"Yes, that's correct."
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,2079.505,2080.036,--And--
2007.06-8273,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2080.036,2098.887,"But I think you can also explain that the reason it's correct is the Court probably would have liked to say yes, we're making up a new rule; the Constitution didn't use to say this; and this rule will apply from now on to all actions taken by individuals from now on."
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,2133.904,2139.075,"--Which, Your Honor, is Griffith and is defined by Federal law."
2007.06-8273,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2139.075,2146.477,"Can you give me an example of a case in which this Court candidly said, we're announcing a new rule which was not the law before?"
2007.06-8273,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2176.122,2178.215,I'm really glad to hear that.
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,2180.121,2189.367,"Your Honor, I think the point... this isn't Blackstone... Blackstone is not the only view here."
2007.06-8273,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2196.379,2200.066,Finality is a condition for fashioning the right remedy.
2007.06-8273,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2207.921,2211.264,Don't we call it a new rule in Teague?
2007.06-8273,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2211.264,2213.529,--expectations as being questions of remedy?
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,2213.529,2215.434,"--Excuse me, Your Honor."
2007.06-8273,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2215.434,2220.525,It seems to me that your... your answer to Justice Souter's question earlier should be that there is uniformity.
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,2233.131,2245.392,Your Honor... and that point is... the point of finality is a recognized point of what is necessary for the integrity of judicial decision-making.
2007.06-8273,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2245.392,2248.578,"That's sort of like defining order as random order, isn't it?"
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,2248.578,2251.17,"I disagree, Your Honor."
2007.06-8273,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2267.303,2267.522,And... and the concern is a concern not so much.
2007.06-8273,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2267.522,2275.208,"And the concern is not so much a concern not so much for the defendant here but for the States, isn't it?"
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,2291.043,2297.322,"Your Honor, the State's interest here can be vindicated by the State by applying State law."
2007.06-8273,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2297.322,2298.572,That's not the point.
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,2360.001,2384.509,"Your Honor, I'm here representing the State of Minnesota, and the intrusion that I'm concerned about in this case is a State court judge adopting some Federal optional... sort of Federal requirement, and applying it as opposed to using State law that can be reviewed and overturned and for which that State court judge is accountable to the citizenry of the State."
2007.06-8273,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2384.509,2389.818,"Well, I must say I have serious problems with your position in that regard."
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,2404.953,2408.779,"Your Honor, I think that it's difficult."
2007.06-8273,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2444.295,2450.48,"The question I have is, to go back, you said two separate things."
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,2563.544,2583.958,"Your Honor, the point I think is that this is a point that Griffith makes, that when your conviction becomes final, that your stake... if I can call it that... in changes in the law come to a close."
2007.06-8273,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2583.958,2585.895,I agree with that.
2007.06-8273,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2585.895,2601.138,"You are saying metaphysically this Court has no power to enunciate new constitutional rules metaphysically, but we have done so, and Teague is full of references to new rules."
2007.06-8273,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2638.139,2646.698,"In Crawford itself, it seems there was quite a bit of attention given to history long before the original interpretation of the clause."
2007.06-8273,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2652.352,2671.391,"You've adopted Justice Scalia's approach through your silence, and I'd ask you whether... whether... whether there isn't just a simpler explanation that doesn't require us to go into Spinonza, Immanuel Kant, or even Aristotle."
2007.06-8273,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2714.923,2731.586,"You wouldn't want to say that, Mr. Turner, because that would place you in the position of saying what we are telling people in these Teague cases is oh, yes, the Constitution was violated, but we don't want to hear about it."
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,2757.045,2759.451,Your Honor--
2007.06-8273,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2759.451,2761.028,I think you're handling these questions very well.
2007.06-8273,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2765.104,2768.056,"That was not a question addressed to you, Mr. Diamond."
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,2768.056,2784.159,"--Your Honor, I think that, in terms of Teague as a remedial limitation, first of all, I don't think this Court's retroactivity jurisprudence at all supports that notion."
2007.06-8273,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2822.175,2848.179,"You do recognize, though, that one of the propelling forces behind Teague and why we changed from the Linkletter regime was respect for State courts' processes and the resistance to the heavy hand of Federal habeas courts telling States what to do."
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,2867.469,2871.842,"Your Honor, certainly that was one of the things that was going on in Teague."
2007.06-8273,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2895.348,2913.247,"Isn't what you are saying is that the concern in Teague was not only with State court processes, but with settled expectations of those who are involved in the criminal system, particularly victims who are entitled at some point to rely on a conviction being final?"
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,2913.247,2914.872,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.06-8273,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2914.872,2920.682,We don't usually think of just of settled expectations as being questions of remedy.
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,2923.368,2943.376,"Your Honor, I think if you look at Justice Harlan's writing in Teague about the post-conviction... what should be the rule for post-conviction, you see he lays out very eloquently what those concerns are in terms of finality and uniformity in the post-conviction arena."
2007.06-8273,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2967.366,2970.459,--State executives can upset all those expectations.
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,2994.497,3006.256,"Your Honor, first of all, I think the State court is in a business... is in a different role in terms of enforcing the constitutional rights in that situation."
2007.06-8273,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3015.175,3040.914,"It is also difficult to see what Federal interest is vindicated when the State says we know we have to respect this... call it what you want... new precedent in cases still in the pipeline, and we don't have to if the case has reached a final judgment."
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,3048.427,3067.888,"Your Honor, that brings me back to the point where I started, which is that the Constitution doesn't... remember, we're using the Federal Constitution here as authority to do something that, for example, in this case the Minnesota Court would be otherwise unable to do."
2007.06-8273,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3083.758,3087.598,"Let me take the other point here, which is Justice Scalia's, which I think I understand now."
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,3124.334,3130.566,"--Your Honor, my point is that the State can take... the State can do that as a matter of State law."
2007.06-8273,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3152.463,3155.088,May I ask another sort of basic question?
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,3187.87,3194.462,"--Your Honor, let me--"
2007.06-8273,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3194.462,3196.335,Interpreting it the way you interpret it.
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,3196.335,3199.413,"--Let me try the first question, and then we will see where we go."
2007.06-8273,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3224.152,3227.964,Which qualifies for the Federal system.
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,3231.541,3236.633,"Your Honor, I disagree in terms of that that all applies only in the Federal system."
2007.06-8273,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3259.56,3259.857,No.
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,3285.19,3289.97,"Your Honor, I don't believe that that's what's going on in the Federal habeas statute."
2007.06-8273,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3292.109,3297.528,I agree when you are talking about what Federal court can do... administering a Federal habeas corpus.
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,3305.479,3311.898,"--Your Honor, I guess my source of confusion with your question is I don't understand Teague is a rule from Congress."
2007.06-8273,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3321.332,3323.863,"In Federal habeas corpus proceedings, yes."
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,3323.863,3326.285,"Your Honor, that's where the point of agreement is."
2007.06-8273,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3356.864,3357.864,The protection of this Court.
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,3363.503,3369.188,"--Your Honor, I think what... the problem with it is in the constitutional design itself."
2007.06-8273,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3424.448,3427.15,Suppose it is a knock and announce violation.
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,3437.613,3443.642,"--Your Honor, I think that if that remedy is grounded in State laws, the State of Minnesota could certainly do that."
2007.06-8273,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3448.985,3458.996,"Could a... could a State say: We know that Federal habeas, the Fourth Amendment, is out."
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,3495.403,3501.276,"Your Honor, I think the answer to that is probably yes, and the reason is different, though."
2007.06-8273,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3542.213,3545.367,"Mr. Diamond, let me ask you a question."
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,3568.341,3575.012,"Your Honor, I don't think the Minnesota legislature could... could go into the pre-finality area."
2007.06-8273,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3576.557,3584.883,"Can the Minnesota legislature say: Look, the... the Supreme Court of the United States has... has come down with some rules."
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,3599.689,3611.73,"--Your Honor, I think, in that instance, the Minnesota legislature... I see my time is up, but I think in that instance the Minnesota legislature is... is providing the minimum that the Constitution requires."
2007.06-8273,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3613.308,3613.714,So the answer is yes.
2007.06-8273,1,37837,patrick_c_diamond,,3613.714,3613.933,--that is yes.
2007.06-8273,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3613.933,3614.62,Yes.
2007.06-8273,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3614.62,3617.166,"Thank you, Mr. Diamond."
2007.06-8273,2,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,3619.775,3624.585,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.06-8273,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3686.153,3687.622,Why don't you finish your sentence.
2007.06-8273,2,17453,benjamin_j_butler,,3687.622,3694.259,"We are simply asking the Court to hold that if the State wishes to go beyond the minimum, they are free to do so."
2007.06-8273,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3694.789,3695.491,"Thank you, Mr. Butler."
