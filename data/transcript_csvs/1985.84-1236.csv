1985.84-1236,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.939,We will hear arguments next in Cabana against Bullock.
1985.84-1236,0,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,99.664,110.554,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, we are here today seeking a clarification of the Court's holding in Enmund versus Florida."
1985.84-1236,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,392.405,407.43,"Mr. White, has the Fifth Circuit since its decision in this case ever had presented to it the question of whether the state might go back and attempt to retry on this issue, whether that might be double jeopardy of some sort?"
1985.84-1236,0,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,407.43,407.964,"Yes, they have."
1985.84-1236,1,31489,joseph_t_mc_laughlin,,1614.397,1639.464,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, we seek affirmance of the Circuit Court's determination that Crawford Bullock could not lawfully be sentenced to death for capital murder where the jury was not instructed to find and did not find that he killed, attempted to kill, intended to kill, or contemplated the use of lethal force."
1985.84-1236,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1729.687,1737.691,How do you place in this whole panorama of the findings with respect to the overwhelming evidence?
1985.84-1236,1,31489,joseph_t_mc_laughlin,,1741.162,1754.986,"I am addressing the charge, Your Honor, but I also feel and will address the point that the Mississippi Supreme Court did not make findings with respect to the ability or the eligibility of Crawford Bullock to be sentenced to death."
1985.84-1236,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1789.559,1790.293,Eighty-one?
1985.84-1236,1,31489,joseph_t_mc_laughlin,,1790.293,1793.345,"--Eighty-one, Mr. Chief Justice."
1985.84-1236,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1902.982,1906.636,I am not quite sure what your point is about what you have just read.
1985.84-1236,1,31489,joseph_t_mc_laughlin,,1906.636,1908.836,"--My point, Mr. Chief Justice, is--"
1985.84-1236,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1908.836,1912.54,"They are merely stating a general proposition of Mississippi law, are they not?"
1985.84-1236,1,31489,joseph_t_mc_laughlin,,1912.54,1919.278,"--Yes, I believe that is correct, and they are not making the specific kind of finding required before someone may be put to death."
1985.84-1236,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1919.278,1923.996,What about the top of 117 and Page 81?
1985.84-1236,1,31489,joseph_t_mc_laughlin,,1923.996,1940.691,"Your Honor, that sentence at the top of Page 117 follows exactly upon their statement, if you will, of the law of Mississippi, namely that a person who aids and abets in the commission of a crime, here either the crime of robbery, of which the defendant, Mr. Bullock, was found guilty--"
1985.84-1236,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1940.691,1946.095,The statement from the court on Page 117 is not a general statement of law.
1985.84-1236,1,31489,joseph_t_mc_laughlin,,1953.165,1958.986,"--Your Honor, I don't think the Mississippi Supreme Court was purporting to review the evidence on the record before them."
1985.84-1236,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1959.386,1970.877,"Well, then, what did they mean when they said the evidence is overwhelming that appellant was an active participant in the assault and homicide committed upon Mark Dickson, and so forth?"
1985.84-1236,1,31489,joseph_t_mc_laughlin,,1970.877,1989.707,"--I think, Your Honor, they were simply restating the law of Mississippi that a person who aids and abets in the commission of a crime, and here the crime could either be robbery or the crime of capital murder, which does not require and did not require in this case that Crawford Bullock kill, attempt to kill, intend to kill, or contemplate the use of lethal force."
1985.84-1236,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2003.848,2007.217,Are we reading the same page here?
1985.84-1236,1,31489,joseph_t_mc_laughlin,,2007.217,2008.919,"Yes, Your Honor, I believe we are."
1985.84-1236,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2008.919,2009.935,May I read it to you?
1985.84-1236,1,31489,joseph_t_mc_laughlin,,2030.082,2043.573,"Your Honor, if they were purporting to state the fact, and the fact they were purporting to state was that Mr. Bullock killed, attempted to kill, intended to kill, or contemplated that lethal force would be used, they didn't say it."
1985.84-1236,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2063.469,2064.003,"No, they didn't say he was present."
1985.84-1236,1,31489,joseph_t_mc_laughlin,,2069.257,2072.159,"--Your Honor, he is a statutory participant in the crime because he was present."
1985.84-1236,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2072.159,2077.979,"--I think we need an interpreter here, because what I read in the English language here isn't what you are telling us."
1985.84-1236,1,31489,joseph_t_mc_laughlin,,2077.979,2087.501,"Your Honor, the Mississippi Supreme Court said that they accepted Crawford Bullock's statement of the facts, and indeed they based their statement of the facts upon them."
1985.84-1236,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2101.392,2103.46,Go back to 81.
1985.84-1236,1,31489,joseph_t_mc_laughlin,,2125.21,2139.034,"I would submit respectfully that that is a restatement of the law of Mississippi, and the law of Mississippi is that a person is deemed to be equally guilty with the principal, with the person who commits the crime, if he is present and he aids and abets in the offense."
1985.84-1236,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2154.46,2165.399,"Counsel, are you defending the Fifth Circuit's opinion?"
1985.84-1236,1,31489,joseph_t_mc_laughlin,,2165.399,2168.868,"Your Honor, yes, I am defending the Fifth Circuit's opinion, because it concludes--"
1985.84-1236,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2168.868,2176.806,"Well, it certainly never addresses the finding of the Mississippi Supreme Court or whatever you want to call those words."
1985.84-1236,1,31489,joseph_t_mc_laughlin,,2176.806,2180.008,--It does not address the description by the Mississippi Supreme Court.
1985.84-1236,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2180.708,2182.377,Do you think it should have?
1985.84-1236,1,31489,joseph_t_mc_laughlin,,2182.377,2186.931,"Well, Your Honor, perhaps in the perfect world it should have, but I think the point here is that there was no--"
1985.84-1236,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2186.931,2202.691,"Well, it seems to me this leads me to the other... suppose that there was no doubt that the Mississippi Supreme Court made the finding that Enmund, that you... even you would concede Enmund requires, that they made the finding."
1985.84-1236,1,31489,joseph_t_mc_laughlin,,2205.059,2206.359,"--Yes, Your Honor, we would be."
1985.84-1236,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2206.359,2210.028,So you would be saying that the jury must make the finding?
1985.84-1236,1,31489,joseph_t_mc_laughlin,,2210.028,2219.216,"I would be saying that the jury must make the finding, depending upon the facts of the individual case, the charge that is given to the jury, the nature of the crime--"
1985.84-1236,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2219.216,2228.424,"You would say an appellate court finding, even though it reads right on Enmund, just doesn't satisfy the constitution."
1985.84-1236,1,31489,joseph_t_mc_laughlin,,2229.191,2233.643,"--I would say, Your Honor, here, first of all, it doesn't satisfy Mississippi's own law."
1985.84-1236,2,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,3430.956,3434.475,Just a point or two to make some clarifications.
1985.84-1236,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3499.417,3509.956,"General White, could I just ask you, because I am a little confused on it, is it correct, as your opponent says, that the evidence is also clear that he was not killed by the bottle, but he was killed by the concrete block?"
1985.84-1236,2,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,3509.956,3513.491,He was killed by the concrete blocks being dropped on his head.
1985.84-1236,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3513.491,3515.708,Which happened after the striking with the bottle.
1985.84-1236,2,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,3515.708,3523.614,"Well, as a part, as a continuation after Bullock was injured by the bottle hitting his hand as he was hitting the man's head."
1985.84-1236,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3523.614,3528.25,Did Bullock have any part in the act of hitting with the concrete block?
1985.84-1236,2,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,3528.25,3531.702,The evidence does not show so.
1985.84-1236,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3531.702,3532.585,I see.
1985.84-1236,2,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,3540.058,3545.545,"Yes, he was the one who suggested the place to get rid of the body, the whole scenario after the crime of getting rid of the body."
1985.84-1236,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3545.545,3555.985,"Do you consider... I am sure there are very persuasive facts, and there are certainly very troublesome facts, but are they relevant to the Enmund issue, the post-death facts of the way they disposed of the body?"
1985.84-1236,2,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,3555.985,3561.722,"Well, traditionally, I think we look at someone's intent by their actions surrounding the crime."
1985.84-1236,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3576.13,3584.968,But I just want to be... you are suggesting that the post-death facts tend to substantiate the conclusion that Bullock intended the death to occur.
1985.84-1236,2,36909,marvin_l_white_jr,,3584.968,3585.687,"Yes, sir."
