1982.81-1044,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.544,We will hear arguments first this morning in United States Postal Service against Aikens.
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,11.059,34.049,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this employment discrimination case involves a claim of disparate treatment which is under this Court's decisions of claim of intentional racial discrimination, under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act."
1982.81-1044,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,368.602,373.99,"Mr. Wallace, when you say prima facie case, what exactly do you mean?"
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,379.144,400.855,"That is the way most of these cases arise, on a Rule 41(b) motion at the conclusion of the plaintiff's evidence, and that is what we mean here, what we are referring to here, and by and large what the Court has been referring to in its opinions in this field."
1982.81-1044,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,400.855,414.411,"And it is not inconsistent with that to say that if the employer puts on no evidence, or does nothing, there must be judgment for the plaintiff?"
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,414.411,415.786,It's not inconsistent at all.
1982.81-1044,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,415.786,426.297,"But isn't that what is required, under the existing rule under Title VII, that if the employer does nothing, judgment must be entered for the--"
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,426.297,429.343,That is what this Court said in Burdine.
1982.81-1044,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,429.343,431.655,"--Well, then it is something more than a motion to get by a directed verdict."
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,432.311,436.965,"Well, it is not really a directed verdict in these cases."
1982.81-1044,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,469.592,501.424,"The district court can also rule on a 41(b) motion at the end of the plaintiff's case that assuming that I were to believe the plaintiff's witnesses, there is enough to get by a motion... there is enough to enter judgment for the plaintiff if the defendant puts on no case, but he might nonetheless, if the defendant chose to put on no case, after having denied a motion at the close of the plaintiff's case, I should think still enter a judgment for the defendant when it came to his duty to weigh the credibility of the witnesses."
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,501.424,519.728,"Well, it's conceivable, Mr. Justice, although he would be more likely to be reserving judgment on whether the plaintiff has made out a sufficient case to withstand the Rule 41(b) motion."
1982.81-1044,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,526.443,538.329,"Well, as a matter of prudence, a trial judge might simply decide, might he not, that he would like the whole record there so that if there is an appeal it will be disposed of in one stroke?"
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,538.329,543.859,"He may very well, and that's essentially what happened in this case."
1982.81-1044,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,563.227,580.156,"Would not the obligation of the reviewing court be to decide... go on beyond that and decide whether, assuming arguendo that a prima facie case had been made out, that the preponderance of the evidence didn't support the plaintiff?"
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,580.156,593.011,"--Well, we read the district court's opinion in this case as passing on that question as well, because the district court did hear all the evidence, but the court of appeals disagreed with us."
1982.81-1044,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,623.53,638.836,"But in no other branch of the law where there's been a trial, where the plaintiff puts on evidence, the defendant puts on evidence, the judge enters findings of fact and conclusions of law, would something on appeal be talked about as failure to make out a prima facie case."
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,643.99,646.178,"I do not, Mr. Justice."
1982.81-1044,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,845.721,858.013,"So you think in McDonnell if there had been two applicants, one black and one white, both qualified, that the... just because the white was chosen would not make out a prima facie case?"
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,858.013,890.077,"--That is exactly our point, Mr. Justice, that there has to be a showing of something more than these four elements if the fourth element is neutralized, because the fourth element was a necessary part of what added up to the prima facie case as those facts were analyzed, because it was an element of an employer acting contrary to his apparent economic self-interest, and therefore put a burden of production on him."
1982.81-1044,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,906.696,925.001,"Mr. Wallace, is it the government's position that the plaintiff in this case would have met the burden that you say he should have met had he established that he was as qualified or more qualified than the person selected?"
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,925.001,946.368,"Well, in order to come up with something comparable to the fourth element here, to show that the employer was acting contrary to his apparent economic self-interest, one would have to say that that would be shown by his selecting someone less qualified than the plaintiff."
1982.81-1044,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,965.875,970.483,"Well, isn't the ultimate question the question of discriminatory intent?"
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,970.483,972.325,That is the ultimate question.
1982.81-1044,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,972.325,975.777,And what set of facts will justify in inference of--
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,975.777,977.308,Precisely so.
1982.81-1044,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,977.308,980.431,"--And in McDonnell it did, and you say here it does not."
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,980.431,1015.604,"That is our point, that... the fact that four elements were specified in McDonnell that added up to a prima facie showing has misled the court below into thinking that those are the only four elements one needs to analyze in a case of this sort, and even though the fourth element becomes neutralized by applying it to a different set of facts, the formula his been woodenly carried over to this different set of facts."
1982.81-1044,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1015.604,1024.616,"Mr. Wallace, does the government place any reliance on the fact that this case was a promotional decision rather than an original entry decision?"
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1024.616,1036.347,We don't really think that makes a difference from a situation where a new hire is made by selecting from among a group of qualified applicants.
1982.81-1044,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1036.347,1038.565,"Well, isn't there some difference at any rate?"
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1062.96,1130.122,"So long as there is a situation where the vacancy is carried in the initial hiring situation for any period of time where it would have been presumably economically advantageous to the employer to hire someone, then a prima facie case has been shown in our view, but if you have a situation where it is known that a vacancy will be upcoming in a period of weeks or months, and applications are being collected and scrutinized, and then a selection is made to replace the individual who is retiring or leaving by selecting from among the applicants, that doesn't show that the employer acted in some way contrary to his economic interests, and unless there is something more of a showing, we don't see that a prima facie case of discrimination has been shown by the mere fact that another qualified applicant was selected rather than the plaintiff."
1982.81-1044,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1132.417,1147.411,"Mr. Wallace, as I read Judge Wilkie's dissenting opinion, he was suggesting still a different test, and I wondered if you wanted to comment on his approach."
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1147.411,1177.258,"Well, we think that, you know, there is much food for thought in what Judge Wilkie wrote, but he as well as the other members of the court of appeals focused exclusively in this case on whether there had been a sufficient showing of the second element of the four elements in the McDonnell Douglas analysis, a showing that the plaintiff in this case was qualified for the job."
1982.81-1044,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1250.448,1269.58,"Well, Mr. Wallace, it seems to me that if this case... if there were proof in this case that the applicant for the position was more qualified, that would necessarily determine the fourth element, I would think."
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1269.58,1271.94,That is one way of showing that the employer--
1982.81-1044,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1271.94,1275.547,"And as you said before, it would not if he was just equally qualified, or less qualified."
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1275.547,1275.828,"--That is correct, but--"
1982.81-1044,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1275.828,1284.075,"So isn't the absence... This record doesn't show, or there are no findings on the relative qualifications."
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1284.075,1296.491,"--Well, there is a finding that there is no credible evidence that he showed that he was as qualified or more qualified than the applicant... than the successful applicants."
1982.81-1044,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1310.643,1311.688,The court of appeals didn't overturn that.
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1311.688,1312.673,--didn't overturn it.
1982.81-1044,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1316.812,1353.421,"Mr. Wallace, you say the court of appeals didn't overturn it, but they do say... the first of the two errors that they say the lower court made was that the majority on the first appeal rejected the district court's... it calls it a legal conclusion, I guess, but that the appellant's claim failed because he did not prove that he was as qualified or more qualified than the individuals who were promoted, and then earlier they had said that they had concluded he was more qualified, or as qualified or more qualified, and Judge Wilkie said they shouldn't have done that, that they were finding facts which they should, but weren't they implicitly saying that the finding was clearly erroneous?"
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1353.421,1355.717,"Well, one could--"
1982.81-1044,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1355.717,1358.498,"It's a little hard to understand, because they also talk about it as a summary judgment, I know."
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1358.498,1359.076,--Yes.
1982.81-1044,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1396.029,1397.216,It didn't use those words.
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1415.819,1424.892,"Well, ultimately, there must be a finding in a disparate treatment case of discriminatory motive."
1982.81-1044,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1478.934,1480.917,But the district court did more than that.
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1485.883,1487.367,"Well, that is not correct."
1982.81-1044,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1487.367,1487.977,--Do you think that is a correct statement of that law?
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1487.977,1490.445,That is not a correct statement of the law.
1982.81-1044,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1490.445,1493.849,"Well, then, what is the proper disposition of the appeal?"
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1495.364,1499.91,It--
1982.81-1044,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1499.91,1502.971,That is one element of his holding that the court of appeals said was erroneous.
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1502.971,1527.899,"--Well, perhaps... perhaps upon re-evaluation by the court of appeals, they would want a further finding made by the district court, although the rest of the district court's findings do not add up to a prima facie case regardless of whether the district court made a legal error in its discussion of the lack of evidence of discriminatory motive."
1982.81-1044,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1544.939,1555.013,"Except if the district judge thought it was necessary to have direct evidence of motive, it would seem to me that might permeate the rest of the... well, your view is that we could just disregard that finding."
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1555.013,1571.944,"--And the rest of the findings still do not add up to a prima facie case, and there is nothing left for the district court to resolve in his findings that could add up to a prima facie case, so that I don't see that that is critical to the district court's disposition."
1982.81-1044,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1571.944,1604.398,"Because there was evidence in the record... it is not necessarily recited in his findings... of a pattern of filling a vacancy... there were something like 20 or 25 vacancies that were regularly filled by a white person who had less education, less seniority, and less paper qualifications than the plaintiff, and I suppose it would be conceivable that one could draw an inference of discrimination from that circumstantial evidence, and yet the district court might have erred by thinking he had to have direct evidence of improper motive."
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1604.398,1619.563,"Well, that is conceivable, although he did specifically find that there was no credible evidence that the plaintiff was as qualified or more qualified than the persons actually selected."
1982.81-1044,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1621.876,1622.625,And you say that ends the case.
1982.81-1044,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1623.875,1646.865,"Well, in the absence of some other finding that would have shown that the selection more likely than not was the result of discrimination, and there is no other such finding, and the error that Justice Stevens is talking about, if corrected, it still would not amount to a finding that could add up to a prima facie showing."
1982.81-1044,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1650.802,1652.175,Very well.
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,1657.362,1676.244,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the real question before this Court is whether on this record the plaintiff has made a prima facie case, and we submit that he clearly did so in four different ways, and that the judgment should clearly be affirmed."
1982.81-1044,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1903.043,1919.365,"Mr. Greenberg, are those statistics really that dramatic, if you look at the period when the statute was passed, and assume you started with a disparity at least that bad and maybe even worse which would have been produced by conduct that may have been something we don't approve of, but was lawful at the time it took place?"
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,1921.348,1931.282,"--I don't think that's an adequate explanation, but the question is, have we made a prima facie case, and if there is indeed such an explanation, they are free to come across and make it, but--"
1982.81-1044,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1931.282,1937.623,"--But the question is whether those statistics are meaningful unless you know what the statistics were at the date the Act was passed, and does the record show that?"
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,1937.623,1947.494,"--The statistics were, as of, I think, 1974, and the Act was passed in 1964, made applicable to the Post Office in 1972."
1982.81-1044,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1947.494,1956.335,"So in the two-year period, you have to say that in the two-year period, there was a course of conduct that demonstrates that during those two years there was discrimination."
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,1956.335,1965.268,"Well, it may be, but I think the issue before this Court is, given such overwhelming statistics, is some explanation called for, and that is the issue on a prima facie case."
1982.81-1044,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1965.268,1971.469,"Well, if you had the same statistics a week after the Act was passed, would that make a prima facie case?"
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,1971.469,1972.907,If the same... a week after the Act was passed--
1982.81-1044,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1972.907,1973.311,Yes.
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,1973.311,1975.14,--would that make a prima facie case?
1982.81-1044,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1979.061,1979.794,But you think it clearly does two years afterwards?
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,1979.794,1985.354,"--This is two years after the Act was passed, and indeed, there may be a perfectly plausible explanation for it."
1982.81-1044,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1992.726,1999.334,"Well, Mr. Greenberg, is it often that in a disparate treatment case, the prima facie case is made out on statistics?"
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,1999.334,2000.472,Sometimes.
1982.81-1044,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2002.269,2003.284,Have you got some cases on that?
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2006.485,2018.762,"In Teamsters, there is... there is a long footnote which discusses the use of prima facie case... of statistics making a prima facie case in employment discrimination cases."
1982.81-1044,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2022.152,2032.835,--Does this record show what the breakdown was in management level personnel at the time the Act was passed?
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2032.835,2036.084,I don't know.
1982.81-1044,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2039.051,2046.032,Would you think that that was of some importance as to... to make a comparison?
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2046.032,2052.609,It probably was worse at the time of the... at the time that Act was passed than it was at the time of the filing of the complaint.
1982.81-1044,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2052.609,2054.498,But then what do they do about that?
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2058.871,2061.402,"Oh, I don't think anyone has suggested that."
1982.81-1044,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2067.867,2072.882,But doesn't that factor affect the weight of the statistics that you are suggesting?
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2072.882,2074.928,"Well, this plaintiff was applying for an opening."
1982.81-1044,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2075.803,2083.47,"The statistics don't bear on the immediate question of the opening, do they?"
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2083.47,2085.531,"No, they don't bear on that point."
1982.81-1044,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2101.26,2102.76,When were the openings?
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2109.898,2115.301,--I can't give you the exact date.
1982.81-1044,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2117.348,2121.782,"Yes, I assumed that, but you don't know where in that sequence?"
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2121.782,2124.688,I would have to check on the date of those three positions.
1982.81-1044,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2132.373,2137.09,"Greenberg, do you agree with the statement of the court of appeals,"
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2144.088,2148.82,In the sense of demonstrating the mental--
1982.81-1044,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2148.82,2151.365,Whatever sense the court of appeals used it.
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2151.365,2163.672,"--Well, I agree with it in the sense that it does not require the demonstration of a mental operation, but it can be demonstrated out of factual circumstances giving rise to an inference of that, yes."
1982.81-1044,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2163.672,2170.061,Are you giving rise to an inference that the individual was intentionally discriminated against?
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2170.061,2173.294,"Yes, giving rise to that inference, yes."
1982.81-1044,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2173.294,2182.509,That the reason he was denied the promotion was that the employer was discriminating on the basis of race?
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2182.509,2194.489,"Yes, you ultimately have to show that in the disparate treatment case, but you don't have to show that someone was thinking, you know, syllogistically thought that I am not going to appoint this person because he is black, and demonstrate that that is what went on in his head."
1982.81-1044,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2194.489,2195.036,Why not?
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2195.036,2199.691,Because that can be derived from external circumstances.
1982.81-1044,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2201.158,2208.593,"Doesn't the ultimate inference have to be that from this circumstantial evidence, we will conclude, or there is evidence to support--"
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2208.593,2209.389,Yes.
1982.81-1044,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2209.389,2212.014,--the inference that that is exactly what he was thinking about.
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2212.014,2212.935,"Yes, that's right."
1982.81-1044,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2212.935,2215.044,You don't need any direct evidence of--
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2215.044,2215.589,That's correct.
1982.81-1044,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2217.698,2219.713,--So you disagree with this statement of the court.
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2219.713,2225.336,"If it means what we have just discussed it means, yes, I disagree with it."
1982.81-1044,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2225.336,2225.899,Okay.
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2260.478,2262.649,If the judge doesn't believe the plaintiff's witnesses?
1982.81-1044,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2262.649,2272.379,"--Well, he doesn't choose to draw the inference from the... of a state of mind from facts which could support that inference but really don't compel it."
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2272.379,2280.876,"I think as a matter of law under McDonnell Douglas, Burdine, and Sweeney and the other cases, he is compelled to draw that inference if he believed... unless he disbelieves the witnesses."
1982.81-1044,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2280.876,2288.201,"Well, you think that if a witness simply testifies to facts which could support an inference, that the inference becomes mandatory?"
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2288.201,2292.511,I think that's what McDonnell Douglas says.
1982.81-1044,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2321.048,2325.545,"Well, then, you see Title VII litigation as being kind of unique, I take it, and not--"
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2325.545,2325.78,No.
1982.81-1044,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2325.78,2328.028,--the ordinary burden between the parties.
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2328.028,2333.526,Presumptions... I think presumptions arise and are deferred to in all branches of the law.
1982.81-1044,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2340.478,2345.914,But what other traditional rules of evidence would simply be a permissible inference in other branches of litigation?
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2353.629,2367.998,"Well, if the negative finding is based upon the fact that he disbelieves the witnesses, then the testimony is not worth anything, but if there is testimony which he believes and a demonstration of facts which he asserts to have occurred, then there is a presumption."
1982.81-1044,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2375.699,2397.128,"Well, suppose in a hypothetical case there had been three whites appointed to vacancies and no blacks, and there is testimony from the supervisor that this is how he went about filling those posts, and both of those situations are before the district judge on a Rule 41(b) motion."
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2417.104,2419.697,"Well, I would want to know what it was that satisfied him."
1982.81-1044,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2419.697,2433.05,"Well, that he gave an explanation as to why each of the whites were promoted in preference to blacks that satisfied the trial judge that it was not a discriminatory animus."
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2433.05,2454.541,"Well, now you are posing a case in which the trial judge was satisfied to the contrary, but if a black applied for a job or a woman applied for a job and was rejected, and the job was then filled by a member of a non-protected group, the rule in McDonnell Douglas, as reiterated in Burdine, which is... let me come to Burdine just for a moment."
1982.81-1044,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2485.888,2500.711,"Well, then, isn't there something perhaps inconsistent between McDonnell Douglas and Burdine and perhaps Fernco on the one hand and the principle that in a bench trial on a motion... Rule 41(b) motion the trial judge can weigh the evidence?"
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2500.711,2502.164,"Well, no."
1982.81-1044,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2597.796,2602.81,When did Beall go out of office in this sequence?
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2602.81,2604.232,"Seventy-three, I think."
1982.81-1044,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2612.713,2617.117,I would be interested in your other two ways of proving your--
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2617.117,2618.789,The prima facie?
1982.81-1044,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2618.789,2620.943,"--You went through two of them, didn't you?"
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2620.943,2623.973,"Well, I went through... I went through Beall."
1982.81-1044,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2625.035,2625.441,Right.
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2625.441,2630.049,"Then, this plaintiff was not someone who was merely qualified or only qualified."
1982.81-1044,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2661.755,2667.206,You have a problem then with the district court findings as well as with the court of appeals.
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2678.669,2679.482,"That's right, but that was one reason I--"
1982.81-1044,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2679.482,2680.404,And this one is not either.
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2680.404,2681.59,--this case is not properly here.
1982.81-1044,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2682.387,2683.574,This one is not either.
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2685.479,2686.667,These were uncontradicted.
1982.81-1044,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2686.667,2689.121,"But there's a contrary finding, isn't there?"
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2691.822,2707.799,Finding 17... Finding 17 I think rests upon a fundamental misconception of what the McDonnell Douglas rule requires.
1982.81-1044,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2718.639,2720.763,"But your third ground, I think is--"
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2720.763,2723.965,"I wasn't attempting to compare them, though I could do so."
1982.81-1044,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2723.965,2734.96,--Is your third ground that it is a prima facie case even if each of the other competitors for the same position was also extraordinarily well qualified and perhaps even better qualified than the plaintiff?
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2734.96,2736.289,"No, I don't think it gets into that."
1982.81-1044,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2778.1,2786.095,"Well, that is strange, then, that both the district court and the court of appeals said there was a lack of evidence as to relative qualifications."
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2786.095,2788.017,"Well, I don't know what they meant by relative qualifications."
1982.81-1044,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2807.604,2817.818,"Mr. Greenberg, it sounds to me in your argument as though you don't really disagree with the government's proposed test."
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2825.33,2833.498,"--Well, I have spoken about nothing but uncontradicted evidence so far, so I don't think there's any problem with findings of fact."
1982.81-1044,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2841.371,2843.448,"So accepting the government's test, you say--"
1982.81-1044,1,30616,jack_greenberg,,2843.448,2844.869,--I disagree with the government's test.
1982.81-1044,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3234.54,3237.898,Mr. Wallace.
1982.81-1044,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3237.898,3258.921,"We do not say that there is no possible way of reading this record to give rise to a prima facie case of discrimination, or that there is no possibility that the court of appeals could have overturned the district court's factual findings as clearly erroneous."
1982.81-1044,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3311.182,3322.176,So you think the plaintiff as part of his prima facie case is going to have to prove that he was more qualified than--
1982.81-1044,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3322.176,3323.613,"Well, that's one way of showing it."
1982.81-1044,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3323.613,3324.098,--That's one way.
1982.81-1044,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3324.098,3336.703,"That's one way of showing that the employer acted contrary to his economic self-interest, or a showing can be made through statistics or through direct evidence of discrimination, or through the carrying of a--"
1982.81-1044,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3336.703,3341.419,How would statistics show that he acted contrary to his economic self-interest?
1982.81-1044,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3341.419,3348.323,"--No, well, that is only... acting contrary to economic self-interest is only one way of showing a prima facie case."
1982.81-1044,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3350.431,3354.414,"Well, that isn't so frequent in disparate treatment cases, is it?"
1982.81-1044,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3354.414,3357.46,The statistical showing?
1982.81-1044,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3357.46,3359.599,To make a prima facie case by statistics.
1982.81-1044,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3359.599,3360.693,It is not frequent.
1982.81-1044,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3424.793,3434.304,So you may call a defendant's president or personnel manager or foreman or--
1982.81-1044,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3434.304,3436.522,In an effort--
1982.81-1044,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3436.522,3437.85,--and so all the evidence comes out on--
1982.81-1044,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3437.85,3449.813,"--And then the Rule 41(b) motion is made, and the question is whether the trier of fact thinks it more likely than not that discrimination was the motivating factor."
1982.81-1044,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3449.813,3453.421,"--Mr. Wallace, may I ask you one other question on your theory?"
1982.81-1044,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3477.599,3478.599,That is correct.
1982.81-1044,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3478.599,3480.894,There are other ways which he could prove it even under your view.
1982.81-1044,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3481.269,3485.315,"That is correct, and that was true in McDonnell-Douglas itself."
1982.81-1044,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3498.356,3504.635,So you do not ask for a rule that says the plaintiff must always meet this particular standard that this District Court seemed to apply.
1982.81-1044,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,3504.635,3506.993,"Precisely so, Mr. Justice."
1982.81-1044,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3506.993,3509.603,"Thank you, gentlemen."
