2001.00-1519,0,16899,austin_c_schlick,,10.585,12.982,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
2001.00-1519,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,111.741,128.75,"Mr. Schlick, you said we'd- this is an area in which one can use one's common sense, and I thought that what the Ninth Circuit was telling us was that some items in that list under all circumstances wouldn't cast suspicion."
2001.00-1519,0,16899,austin_c_schlick,,145.779,153.634,"The problem, Justice Ginsburg, was that the Ninth Circuit didn't admit of situations in which deceleration might be relevant."
2001.00-1519,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,173.527,175.317,But they weren- weren't talking about that case.
2001.00-1519,0,16899,austin_c_schlick,,189.704,195.364,"Justice Ginsburg, we read the court of appeals opinion as attempting to establish categorical rules."
2001.00-1519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,243.184,254.889,"I suppose it would be suspicious if i- if you're on a highway that has not only a maximum speed but a minimum speed, and and the car slows down twenty miles below the minimum when it when it sees a police officer."
2001.00-1519,0,16899,austin_c_schlick,,257.43,260.113,"No, it d- it ordinarily would not."
2001.00-1519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,260.113,268.726,And d- and do you think it's a normal reaction always to slow down when one sees a police a police car even if you happen to be going ten miles below the speed limit already?
2001.00-1519,0,16899,austin_c_schlick,,268.726,278.015,"It It may depend on the particular area, and that's that may be a question on which you would look to the law enforcement officer's experience and expertise."
2001.00-1519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,278.015,279.185,I don't do it.
2001.00-1519,0,16899,austin_c_schlick,,297.14,302.568,I I think your intuition accords wi- with common experience and the holdings of most courts.
2001.00-1519,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,302.568,309.173,"The There was a concrete record here of what this driver was doing, and he wasn't going ten miles an hour."
2001.00-1519,0,16899,austin_c_schlick,,311.881,332.0,"Justice Ginsburg, on page fifty seven of the joint appendix, Agent Stoddard testified that the extreme deceleration in this case, from about fifty to fifty five miles per hour down to about twenty five or thirty miles per hour, was not normal and did set respondent's vehicle apart from ordinary traffic on those roads."
2001.00-1519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,332.0,333.312,What was the speed limit on the roads?
2001.00-1519,0,16899,austin_c_schlick,,333.312,337.027,"uh Between twenty five miles per hour and thirty five miles per hour, Your Honor."

2001.00-1519,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,339.473,339.473,to...
2001.00-1519,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,339.701,341.163,an established speed limit?
2001.00-1519,0,16899,austin_c_schlick,,341.163,352.77,"Yes, Your Honor."
2001.00-1519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,352.77,362.354,"What what was the portion where where he slowed down? I mean, it was twenty five to thirty five? No."
2001.00-1519,0,16899,austin_c_schlick,,362.354,366.72,I I I don't know for sure.
2001.00-1519,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,366.72,372.998,But that's what he slowed down to.
2001.00-1519,0,16899,austin_c_schlick,,372.998,373.182,That...
2001.00-1519,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,373.182,381.952,"Well, That sounds a lot more reasonable then."
2001.00-1519,0,16899,austin_c_schlick,,381.952,388.239,"Again, Agent Stoddard testified that that sort of deceleration, that speed, was not common in the area, and it..."
2001.00-1519,1,43554,victoria_a_brambl,,1467.335,1571.158,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court I wanted to respond to the question that you asked, Mr. Chief Justice, about who should we give due weight to and who is going to know better, the officer in the field, the district court, or the court of appeals."
2001.00-1519,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1571.158,1585.409,All those that type of opinion seems to me contrary to our opinion in Sokolow where we said you just can't categorize these kind of factors and say that v- this kind of thing is never useful and something else is always useful.
2001.00-1519,1,43554,victoria_a_brambl,,1585.409,1592.479,I think that all the parties agree that the totality cannot have categorical rules because...
2001.00-1519,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1592.479,1598.758,"Well, then then certainly you you must you're not defending then some parts of the Ninth Circuit opinion."
2001.00-1519,1,43554,victoria_a_brambl,,1598.758,1643.229,"I think that some of the language that the Ninth Circuit used was inartful in that it made it sound if you take one sentence out of the whole opinion, it would make it sound like they were creating categorical rules."
2001.00-1519,2,16899,austin_c_schlick,,3261.422,3267.506,"Mr. Chief Justice, unless the Court has further questions, we submit that the judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed."
2001.00-1519,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3267.506,3271.617,Tell me.
2001.00-1519,2,16899,austin_c_schlick,,3271.617,3281.023,"Certainly, Justice Stevens."
