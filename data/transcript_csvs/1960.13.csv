1960.13,0,20742,donald_s_day,,499.496,529.779,"The options further provided that in the event that the wife lived beyond 20-year-period that she continue to receive a monthly income in the same amount which she had received during the prior 20 years and it was for the purpose of funding that contingent life annuity that the insurance companies set aside the $7,000 in the case of the North Western Policy and the $1,000 in the case of the John Hancock Policy."
1960.13,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,530.564,545.103,(Inaudible) the death of the primary (Inaudible)?
1960.13,0,20742,donald_s_day,,545.103,567.504,"If the death of the primary beneficiary of the period of the expiration of 20 years then actually with respect to the Northwestern policy only $17,000 of the $25,000 death proceeds of that policy would've been used and the insurance company would have put in their pocket the balance of the $8,000."
1960.13,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,567.504,570.254,Beneficiary could all be --
1960.13,0,20742,donald_s_day,,570.254,570.87,I beg your pardon?
1960.13,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,570.87,572.614,The Beneficiary could all be free?
1960.13,0,20742,donald_s_day,,572.614,576.815,"The beneficiary could be all free, that's correct."
1960.13,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,886.704,891.02,Were these funding provisions spelled out in the cost?
1960.13,0,20742,donald_s_day,,891.02,906.321,"Well, if there is no one no requirement in the policy that the -- that there be a segregation; there's no contractual obligation specifically set out in the policy that there be a segregation of the proceeds."
1960.13,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1073.125,1075.426,(Inaudible)?
1960.13,0,20742,donald_s_day,,1075.426,1076.788,For the actual segregation.
1960.13,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1076.788,1078.243,(Inaudible)
1960.13,0,20742,donald_s_day,,1078.243,1081.096,There was a segregation on the books of the insurance company --
1960.13,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1081.096,1082.039,It's not here.
1960.13,0,20742,donald_s_day,,1083.075,1084.7,"Yes sir, yes there is Your Honor."
1960.13,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1084.7,1087.444,So the only thing lacking is the provision to that effect?
1960.13,0,20742,donald_s_day,,1087.444,1098.365,"I believe there is Your Honor, there's a lacking of provision for that, there is lacking also of the -- it would be very truthful of the fact that the insurance company I believe is probably comingles for these facts."

1960.13,0,20742,donald_s_day,,1103.725,1115.235,They said is the bookkeeping factors of the insurance companies it is the actuary of practice I believe of the entire insurance industry with respect to all policies of this claim.
1960.13,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1115.235,1118.613,"Even that this provision they would have said apart, was it?"
1960.13,0,20742,donald_s_day,,1118.613,1120.414,I don't believe that would have Your Honor.
1960.13,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1123.421,1135.745,(Inaudible)
1960.13,0,20742,donald_s_day,,1135.745,1138.737,"There, in effect is what the Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Your Honor."

1960.13,0,20742,donald_s_day,,1172.892,1188.034,"Well, we believe Your Honor that the term “property” is used by Congress in the enactment of the marital deduction section should be liberally construed."
1960.13,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1237.515,1252.118,Is there (Inaudible)?
1960.13,0,20742,donald_s_day,,1252.118,1273.368,"That may -- I think probably Your Honor that the question was called to the attention of the file upon the realization of the -- of this practice when the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rendered its decision in the Ryder case, I'm willing to recognize that."
1960.13,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1273.368,1274.301,(Inaudible)
1960.13,0,20742,donald_s_day,,1274.301,1275.207,But I think --
1960.13,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1275.207,1282.371,But truthfully what was embodying in prior (Inaudible)?
1960.13,0,20742,donald_s_day,,1282.371,1283.415,"Well, I think this Your Honor --"
1960.13,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1283.415,1285.917,(Inaudible)?
1960.13,0,20742,donald_s_day,,1285.917,1288.028,"No, I don't think it's quite that Your Honor."
1960.13,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1319.957,1325.494,Your answer is not the practical of insurance company but that is been held (Inaudible).
1960.13,0,20742,donald_s_day,,1325.494,1327.47,I think that so Your Honor.
1960.13,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1356.848,1362.722,"In order -- in other words, to keep promises that were specifically spelled out they had to do what they did here?"
1960.13,0,20742,donald_s_day,,1362.722,1364.564,"Well, that's precisely our point."
1960.13,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1364.564,1368.197,(Inaudible)
1960.13,0,20742,donald_s_day,,1368.197,1373.101,Or in there but frankly the practice of the industry is to do what on the box that (Voice Overlap) --
1960.13,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1373.101,1375.767,"Well, I didn't understand that, you told that it was different."
1960.13,0,20742,donald_s_day,,1383.705,1391.111,"Yes Your Honor, we take the position that the insured actually bargained for this, that he could have elected another option but this is the option that he do."
1960.13,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1391.111,1397.559,(Voice Overlap)
1960.13,0,20742,donald_s_day,,1397.559,1404.32,"I think this carries up precisely the intent of the insured when he elected this option prior to the state, yes."
1960.13,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1412.116,1413.609,Mr. Kutz.
1960.13,1,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1413.609,1416.022,May it please the Court.
1960.13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1526.331,1530.482,"How, about the other kind of what do you suggest, tenants common or whatever it is --"
1960.13,1,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1530.482,1530.982,Tenants in --
1960.13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1530.982,1531.938,-- provide a half interest in (Voice Overlap) --
1960.13,1,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1531.938,1533.639,In tenants in common.
1960.13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1533.639,1536.113,-- which the mothers inherent?
1960.13,1,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1536.113,1536.557,That would be (Voice Overlap) --
1960.13,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1536.557,1537.12,That would --
1960.13,1,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1537.12,1546.13,-- that would qualify because the daughter would never take after the mother.
1960.13,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1665.783,1685.963,"But the same time or actually turn to page 61 from your brief towards the end, three lines from the bottom, the life stated the spouse which included (Inaudible) is deductable?"
1960.13,1,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1685.963,1688.229,I'm not sure I've found the place Your Honor.
1960.13,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1688.229,1690.116,In your brief page 61.
1960.13,1,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1690.116,1690.637,Yes sir.
1960.13,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1690.637,1692.49,That still on the same committee report?
1960.13,1,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1692.49,1695.534,Yes.
1960.13,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1697.624,1699.319,Three lines from the bottom.
1960.13,1,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1700.563,1700.908,Yes.
1960.13,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1700.908,1704.579,That's the (Inaudible).
1960.13,1,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1704.579,1708.798,It is if no one can take after it.
1960.13,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1708.96,1712.043,Somebody must -- somebody must take after life state?
1960.13,1,28596,i_henry_kutz,,1712.043,1713.623,No.
1960.13,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2022.829,2027.465,"Two policies, T-W-O, should that be?"
1960.13,1,28596,i_henry_kutz,,2027.465,2034.726,Neither the above policies -- referred to policies provide that the decedent did not request --
1960.13,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2034.726,2035.413,Yes.
1960.13,1,28596,i_henry_kutz,,2037.344,2051.083,That there'd be any segregation of the proceeds to the policy between the amounts computable for the terms certain and the amounts computable for the funding of the contingent life annuity.
1960.13,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2061.157,2066.654,Suppose there had been a provision or segregation does that make a difference?
1960.13,1,28596,i_henry_kutz,,2066.654,2080.748,I'm not -- I'd rather doubt that it would unless there was a complete provision for different premiums being paid for different properties.
1960.13,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2633.09,2638.168,(Inaudible)
1960.13,2,20742,donald_s_day,,2638.168,2654.557,"I think probably that the error of the Government's position is pointed out by counsel statement that there is only one property, since there was only one insurance policy."
1960.13,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2819.785,2826.334,I don't find (Inaudible) contrary?
1960.13,2,20742,donald_s_day,,2839.727,2840.102,That's correct.
1960.13,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2840.102,2845.719,"-- insurance company (Inaudible) , but if she died in ten years the daughter will get that?"
1960.13,2,20742,donald_s_day,,2845.719,2847.419,That's correct.
1960.13,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2848.38,2852.512,Why do we have (Inaudible)?
1960.13,2,20742,donald_s_day,,2852.512,2853.93,Because there's a further provision.
1960.13,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2853.93,2855.718,One property or two property?
1960.13,2,20742,donald_s_day,,2855.718,2883.257,Because there's a further provision Your Honor that the policy additionally provided that in the event that the wife lived longer than the 20 year period that she was to receive in addition to the fixed monthly payment for the 20 years a contingent life annuity in the same amount in which her daughter had no interest whatsoever and that is the second property which was created by this policy upon the death of the insured.
1960.13,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2883.257,2885.447,Is that the only property that she probably in their name?
1960.13,2,20742,donald_s_day,,2885.447,2886.955,There are two -- those two proper --
1960.13,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2886.955,2888.484,Before the last property?
1960.13,2,20742,donald_s_day,,2888.484,2889.148,That's right Your Honor.
1960.13,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2889.148,2892.494,Why do you have to call them --
1960.13,2,20742,donald_s_day,,2892.494,2893.075,We only talking --
1960.13,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2893.075,2894.787,You speak everything under what you call it.
1960.13,2,20742,donald_s_day,,2894.787,2902.076,They were only called properties Your Honor because that is the terminology which unfortunately as used by Congress in the patent of the statute.
1960.13,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2902.076,2915.179,(Inaudible)
1960.13,2,20742,donald_s_day,,2915.179,2916.827,"Yes, that's absolutely true."
1960.13,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2916.827,2922.93,"And absolutely ended it all again, when anybody else having an interest in her inheritance she doesn't qualify."
1960.13,2,20742,donald_s_day,,2922.93,2929.362,That's absolutely true Your Honor and with respect to the contingent life annuity only the wife has an interest though.
1960.13,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2951.183,2961.013,I suggest you mean that property in all that Congress will be the only word that it's used through the collocation of words in which property is one.
1960.13,2,20742,donald_s_day,,2961.013,2961.34,I think that --
1960.13,2,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2961.34,2968.649,And the question is whether the ingredient to the transaction satisfy that formulas upon.
1960.13,2,20742,donald_s_day,,2968.649,2972.006,I'm sure that so.
