1985.84-1803,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.324,You may proceed.
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,13.324,13.958,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1803,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,95.712,102.616,"Mr. Hermann, is there any time limit imposed on the exercise of this privilege or benefit?"
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,102.616,103.866,"No, I do not believe there is."
1985.84-1803,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,212.253,227.43,"Isn't the origin of that concept of taking care of their own, as you put it, something that goes back to at least the Civil War when the states raised the troops and sent them in, and of course that was true earlier?"
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,227.43,229.632,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1985.84-1803,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,280.398,285.017,"May I ask this question, does it apply to people who were drafted as well as those who enlist?"
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,285.017,286.468,"Yes, it does, Your Honor."
1985.84-1803,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,286.468,289.587,But you've said in that respect--
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,289.587,303.847,"As to people who are drafted, it certainly doesn't serve to encourage service in the military, but it does serve two subsequent functions of encouraging them to return to the state and encouraging them to engage in public service thereafter."
1985.84-1803,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,303.847,319.607,"--General Hermann, do you think that's really what the legislature had in mind when the people adopted this part of the Constitution, all of these rather fine-spun rationales for why the thing might pass a court test?"
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,328.462,350.142,"Certainly that's one of the major reasons why these statutes and these constitutional provisions have been enacted, but the standard justification given in most of the case law, Your Honor, for these statutes is fourfold, and two of those purposes... at least one of the major purposes always described is to encourage service in the military, and we do rely on that as a motivation."
1985.84-1803,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,350.142,352.561,You say it's given in the case law.
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,360.184,372.757,"I think the applicable standard here, again we submit, is the rational basis standard so that any basis which can be put forward to rationally justify the statute should be sufficient to sustain its validity."
1985.84-1803,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,783.241,792.397,"Is there anything in the record to support that statement, the statement that it does increase the numbers?"
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,792.397,794.147,"--No, Your Honor, there is nothing in the record."
1985.84-1803,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,799.133,800.835,It's just your statement?
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,800.835,802.402,That's correct.
1985.84-1803,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,847.048,850.602,You think that's the bright line between those cases and this one?
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,850.602,872.616,"Yes, I do, that in both instances, whether for a defined objective such as rewarding past military service or an undefined objective such as simple residence in the state, both enactments were entirely retrospective and served no incentive function of the kind that we're describing here."
1985.84-1803,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,878.953,884.906,"While I have you interrupted, does New York have difficulty in recruiting people for public service?"
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,884.906,887.608,"No, it doesn't, as far as I'm aware."
1985.84-1803,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,893.362,896.497,Are there long waiting lines to get jobs?
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,896.497,898.249,"It frequently does, yes."
1985.84-1803,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,898.249,905.82,"So that, your argument about wanting all these people back in public service rings a little hollow."
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,905.82,906.772,"Well, it's twofold."
1985.84-1803,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,923.531,928.852,"If the jobs are all full, it's a little hard to get in no matter how hard you work?"
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,928.852,941.843,"Certainly, one of the underlying justifications is not only that veterans should be compensated, but that they are an especially important, desirable part of the work force, and this--"
1985.84-1803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,941.843,945.564,And you give them an advantage over other people?
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,945.564,947.13,"--Yes, we do."
1985.84-1803,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,950.616,958.953,"So, that advantage would be true if someone comes from Puerto Rico too, that served in the Armed Services?"
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,958.953,961.905,That's true.
1985.84-1803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,998.43,1017.824,"But in terms of encouraging movement, coming back to New York and going to public service, if you granted this to all veterans you might attract other veterans that weren't born, and who didn't go into the service from New York, to move to New York and to go into public service there."
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,1017.824,1023.395,"That's correct, and New York does not attempt to discourage persons from doing so."
1985.84-1803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1023.395,1026.347,You don't give them this advantage?
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,1026.347,1028.949,"We don't give them this advantage, but neither does New York fence them out."
1985.84-1803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1028.949,1035.02,"But it would encourage this movement if you did, to give them that advantage?"
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,1038.655,1051.315,"Well, it would not give the incentive as effectively to those people who had been New York residents to come back home, if the preference were more widely available to persons from the other 49 states."
1985.84-1803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1070.443,1079.815,"I know, but shouldn't there be, in terms of their objectives shouldn't there be some difference between the two classes that you're comparing?"
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,1088.405,1110.02,"--Well, I think we would contend that it wouldn't serve it just as well but that the law would fail to... if that were the policy, the law would fail of its other purpose which is to encourage service in the military in the first place by New York residents, and the additional purpose, of course, of encouraging residents to return home."
1985.84-1803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1110.02,1122.178,Do you think the law should be upheld solely on the single purpose of encouraging service in the military by New York residents?
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,1122.178,1123.478,"We think that's sufficient, yes."
1985.84-1803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1132.434,1137.003,It just means that if you happen to be a resident on a certain time--
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,1137.003,1139.789,It is not a durational residency requirement.
1985.84-1803,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1139.789,1141.889,--But it is residence at a certain time?
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,1141.889,1153.847,"It's a fixed point residency requirement and indeed we think that's crucial in terms of the right to travel argument, because we believe New York's provision does not penalize the--"
1985.84-1803,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1153.847,1160.719,Doesn't that have its roots in the business of granting bounties as they did in the Civil War and earlier?
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,1160.719,1161.436,--I think it does.
1985.84-1803,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1161.436,1172.677,"No one would suggest that New York had any obligation to grant a bounty to somebody from New Hampshire to join the army, but they could limit it to their own?"
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,1172.677,1174.761,I think has historically done so.
1985.84-1803,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1174.761,1181.782,That suggests that if they do it after the event they can have the same limitation?
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,1181.782,1191.555,"I believe that's correct, although I believe New York's promise as a part of its Constitution is a clearly prospective one."
1985.84-1803,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1421.855,1428.642,"Mr. Hermann, I suppose that like all those rationality cases, there are inequalities here."
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,1467.203,1468.519,--He would be entitled to claim them.
1985.84-1803,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1468.519,1475.373,In contrast to the two respondents here who have lived in your state a number of years who are not entitled to them?
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,1475.373,1479.094,That's correct.
1985.84-1803,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1479.094,1482.313,It is unequal in application?
1985.84-1803,0,39471,robert_hermann,,1482.313,1484.413,"Well, it is differential in its application."
1985.84-1803,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1505.459,1514.148,Mr. Kimerling.
1985.84-1803,1,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1514.148,1518.069,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1803,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1685.31,1693.149,What inference do you draw from that fact that's relevant to the argument here?
1985.84-1803,1,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1693.149,1697.785,I think the inference is that this Court lacks jurisdiction.
1985.84-1803,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1734.476,1738.595,Who was the Attorney General representing?
1985.84-1803,1,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1738.595,1742.564,He is here in his ex officio capacity solely to defend the Constitution.
1985.84-1803,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1745.916,1747.467,Is he representing the State of New York?
1985.84-1803,1,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1747.467,1750.402,He is representing the State of New York in its effort--
1985.84-1803,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1750.402,1754.354,And it is the State of New York whose statute this is?
1985.84-1803,1,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1754.354,1759.858,"--That is correct, but what I think is instructive--"
1985.84-1803,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1759.858,1761.46,You make the jurisdictional argument in your brief?
1985.84-1803,1,33876,kenneth_kimerling,,1761.46,1762.91,"--No, we have not."
1985.84-1803,2,39471,robert_hermann,,3363.874,3365.174,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1803,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3488.372,3488.855,"Thank you, gentlemen."
