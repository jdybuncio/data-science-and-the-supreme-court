2012.12-357,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.57,"We'll hear argument this morning first in Case 12-357, Sekhar v. United States."
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,8.437,11.456,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-357,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,52.516,72.512,"If the jury had -- had returned the verdict which is at JA142, and it had marked that the attempt to extort was to extort the commitment, you might still maybe have some causation arguments, but I assume the property argument you're about to make is just irrelevant."
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,72.512,74.464,"Well, I don't think it's irrelevant, Justice Kennedy."
2012.12-357,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,97.83,110.387,Could -- could the case have been indicted -- has it been charged as one in which what they were taking was the commissions that would ultimately have been generated?
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,110.387,123.462,"Well, Justice Kennedy, it might have been possible to say that what was obtained here was money, but I think if the Government had prosecuted it under that theory, it would have to prove that somehow the Government paid too much."
2012.12-357,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,159.404,162.689,"Well, here, what the Petitioner wanted were the commissions, ultimately."
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,174.414,178.632,"--Well, I think the reason that they didn't charge that is probably practically twofold."
2012.12-357,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,197.243,197.61,I see.
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,197.61,198.029,So I think that's part of it.
2012.12-357,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,209.67,210.82,Mr. Clement--
2012.12-357,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,210.82,213.955,"Well, I took you away from your argument about intangible property."
2012.12-357,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,213.955,216.591,"--Mr. Clement, just along the same lines."
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,246.343,249.878,I would say that that -- I would say a couple of things.
2012.12-357,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,266.089,269.375,"Well, they want the investment with -- and the fees that come with the investment."
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,272.077,272.51,Right.
2012.12-357,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,289.955,298.478,Even -- even though they wouldn't have gotten the investment and they wouldn't have gotten the fees absent the -- the threat of force or -- or violence?
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,298.478,300.645,"Again, that would be my position."
2012.12-357,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,359.799,366.455,"But it's -- the coercion crime, at least under New York's definition, requires force."
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,386.084,388.202,"--I don't believe that's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.12-357,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,448.776,451.811,What is your definition of -- of property?
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,463.536,474.808,"I would say that for property to come within the terms of the Hobbs Act prohibition on obtaining property, it has to be alienable, transferable, moveable."
2012.12-357,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,494.305,509.232,"What about -- what about the mob goes to a grocer and says, you know, you're dead or something if you sell Cheerios, and the reason is because they have a monopoly, some other grocery who's connected has a monopoly."
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,514.068,515.385,I think--
2012.12-357,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,515.385,519.02,What he did was -- and he's -- he's not going to sell Cheerios.
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,519.02,520.372,--Right.
2012.12-357,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,526.276,534.299,"Now -- now, in fact, they're doing it to get money, and they do get money, but via the means of the other grocer."
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,571.222,582.946,"I think, at least as I understand your hypothetical, where the relationship between the two parties, basically the competitors, I would say that that's two distinct relationships."
2012.12-357,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,582.946,583.38,All right.
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,619.553,623.107,"Well, I think the answer to it is, it depends."
2012.12-357,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,625.892,626.959,And you haven't found anything on this.
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,628.927,633.795,"--Well, what -- what I would tell you is I think the assumption of most of the cases is that the person that is the pressure of--"
2012.12-357,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,633.795,634.83,Is the -- is the one?
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,634.83,637.247,--Is the person who's offering up the property.
2012.12-357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,637.949,640.399,Isn't that what the word “ extort ” means?
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,647.472,649.205,"--I think that's basically right, Justice Scalia."
2012.12-357,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,685.013,702.809,"But if you think the commitment is real cash, is a real contract, real cash, real property, right, then it wouldn't matter under that -- under what you just said, that the threat was made to the general counsel rather than to the final person who issued the money, isn't that right?"
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,702.809,708.194,"--I -- I don't disagree with that, Justice Kagan, but I think that's because they're all sort of agents to the same principal."
2012.12-357,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,714.247,714.616,Right.
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,719.168,719.718,No.
2012.12-357,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,720.168,724.638,"If you threaten the person who makes a recommendation to the person who writes the check, that's good enough."
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,724.638,725.605,"--Exactly, Your Honor."
2012.12-357,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,741.7,771.619,"Mr. Clement, what is -- I'm sort of trying to figure out why you're trying to get the word “ property ” to do the work of the “ obtain ” part of the statute, because when you answered Justice Alito you were using the terms of “ obtain ” to define property, which is in my mind a sort of strange way to do things, okay?"
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,839.263,840.247,Well--
2012.12-357,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,840.247,842.965,Why isn't the work in the “ obtain ” part?
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,842.965,854.44,"--Justice Sotomayor, I'm happy to have you rule in favor of my client on “ obtained ” or “ property ” and, as Scheidler II demonstrates, those terms are really kind of married together."
2012.12-357,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,887.244,890.88,So take the Government's definition that property is anything of value.
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,890.88,891.38,Right.
2012.12-357,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,891.38,892.182,All right.
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,905.306,906.658,Well--
2012.12-357,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,906.658,910.11,Then make your argument for me why this isn't an obtaining.
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,910.11,917.28,"--Well, what I would say is obtaining, as this Court made clear in Scheidler II, is not some metaphysical obtaining."
2012.12-357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,987.544,997.751,Suppose -- suppose that the person coerced here was a -- was a corrupt person and had put his recommendation out for bids.
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1008.19,1009.223,I don't--
2012.12-357,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1009.223,1018.748,"If -- if then somebody comes in and says, well, I'm not going to pay you the money, but I'll -- I'll break your knees if you don't recommend me, would that be extortion?"
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1018.748,1032.473,"--It would not, Justice Scalia, and I would say because -- the State of Louisiana in the Cleveland case, if there was a corrupt official who was putting those video poker licenses on sale on the on the sly, I don't think that would change the result there."
2012.12-357,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1085.273,1089.427,Why isn't that -- you focused on transferability when you began.
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1112.425,1114.893,"With respect, Mr. Chief Justice, I wouldn't think so."
2012.12-357,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1137.192,1141.36,"Well, but the lawyer's going to make recommendations in many other cases as well."
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1161.69,1164.492,"--Well, the confident -- I may not be understanding the hypothetical."
2012.12-357,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1183.604,1185.739,"Well, just let me make sure that I understand your position."
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1205.336,1208.504,"--I would say no, but I would say it's a much more difficult case."
2012.12-357,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1223.648,1228.252,"Well, but -- but that's a causation argument, not whether or not you received property."
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1228.252,1231.12,"Right, because -- but my point is simply that if the Government--"
2012.12-357,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1231.12,1242.242,"But so far as the property point in my hypothetical, if the recommendation leads to the contract and the contract leads to the commission and the commission means money in your pocket, that's property."
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1242.242,1243.011,--Yes.
2012.12-357,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1243.011,1246.129,"And so then we just have a causation argument, not a property argument."
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1246.129,1246.879,I think that's right.
2012.12-357,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1255.985,1261.823,"It has to be more property, more money, more money in return for less services or something than otherwise."
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1270.245,1270.662,"Right, exactly."
2012.12-357,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1274.863,1280.267,"What about -- you said transfer, sell, but there's also exercise."
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1307.084,1328.332,"Justice Ginsburg, I would say that what you've just articulated is exactly the Government's theory, and the problem is that I can use that same theory to take any autonomy interest and turn it into property that can be exercised, it can be obtained by somebody and then exercised by them in a way different from the way that the person would otherwise exercise it."
2012.12-357,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1352.113,1359.034,"Is this -- there is, I take it, no Federal crime that this conduct would fit?"
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1366.623,1374.043,There's -- there's no Federal crime and that's the result of a very deliberative decision by Congress in 1946 in enacting the Hobbs Act.
2012.12-357,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1430.832,1442.957,"And why did -- why did New York -- was the New York case dropped and the State officials urged the Government, the Federal Government, to make this a Federal case?"
2012.12-357,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1442.957,1444.657,"Well, I'd be happy to address that."
2012.12-357,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1516.005,1516.838,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1523.009,1524.775,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-357,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1559.332,1577.876,"Ms. Harrington, just to go back to Justice Kennedy's -- I mean, suppose -- was there a reason why it wasn't charged in what seems to me to be the simpler way, which is a threat was made in order to get an investment and in order to get fees to put in your pocket and -- and go away with, and that's extortion."
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1582.28,1587.184,"--Well, he was charged with attempting to obtain the commitment, which in most cases ends up being the investment itself."
2012.12-357,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1593.005,1596.54,Do you think there's an obstacle to charging a case that way?
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1604.277,1604.996,"No, that's what I'm saying."
2012.12-357,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1638.967,1667.469,"The obvious problem, which you might want to address at some point, is that -- that if you take your definition that this recommendation, legal recommendation, is property and the fellow said, you know, I'm going to fix you if you don't do it, if that's property, we're back to the honest services statute, because anyone in government and anyone in business, indeed everybody, has a job and those jobs always require you to do things."
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1680.377,1680.827,But--
2012.12-357,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1680.827,1692.102,"Now, that seems very far-reaching, hard to reconcile with the abortion case -- the abortion clinic case, etcetera, and it is easy to reconcile with the honest services case."
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1692.102,1692.985,"--Well, I guess I would have two points."
2012.12-357,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1699.524,1700.674,"Well, I mean, that sounds technical."
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1730.127,1730.86,--Whatever--
2012.12-357,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1730.86,1732.579,That seems very far-reaching.
2012.12-357,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1733.029,1744.386,"Just to add to Justice Breyer's question, it's -- suppose the secretary/typist is -- the stenographer is charged with typing the letter “ I do not recommend ” and they bribe her and she says “ I recommend ”."
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1758.729,1763.115,"--Well, I want to separate again the question of what is property and when property is obtained."
2012.12-357,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1798.604,1798.954,"--Yes, I understand that."
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1833.027,1833.761,Yes.
2012.12-357,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1833.761,1834.211,--Or the -- yes.
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1853.441,1862.646,"The ground is the general particularized meaning that the word “ property ” has obtained in the law, and including in New York cases construing the very law on which the Hobbs Act was based."
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1878.473,1880.858,What -- what is -- I have a property interest in doing my job?
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1898.387,1901.172,"Well, you can convey your labor to your employer in that sense."
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1909.694,1911.361,But I'm not talking about my labor.
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1915.765,1917.031,But that is your labor.
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1917.031,1918.9,It's not my -- not my labor in the abstract.
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1921.252,1925.554,But in this case what Petitioner was trying to take was the fruits of the general counsel -- counsel's labor.
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1930.208,1937.779,Can you cite me one -- one extortion case at common law -- or let me put it another way.
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1945.784,1950.069,"--I can't, because at common law the person--"
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1950.069,1951.586,"We -- we are using a common law term here, “ extortion ”."
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1951.586,1959.175,"--Yes, but it was a different crime at common law, because it only involved public officials taking money or other thing of value in exchange for doing something--"
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1959.175,1959.825,Whatever.
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1966.53,1976.569,"--I don't have an example of that, but what I do have are examples from the New York cases which were construing the New York State extortion law, and this Court has noted again and again that that's the basis for the Hobbs Act."
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1979.338,1980.588,What -- what's the closest New York case?
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,1980.588,1981.207,So I think there are two cases.
2012.12-357,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2000.169,2003.387,How was it -- could you tell us a little more?
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2004.787,2007.189,"--Well, in those cases the property wasn't taken."
2012.12-357,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2045.214,2056.588,"Ms. Harrington, go back to the Scheidler example, because that was a case where we said there was not extortion when there were threats of violence meant to close down an abortion clinic's operations."
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2073.467,2091.511,"We -- that's absolutely what we are saying, in the same way that we said that if the target of the -- if the -- if the protesters, excuse me, had been trying to get the clinics, if they had been trying to take over the clinics and get them to provide a different type of service, to get them to be a restaurant or to provide a different type of medical service, then they would have been obtaining the right of the -- of the clinic the right to run -- to operate their business."
2012.12-357,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2091.511,2105.002,"So -- so you think if -- if they targeted the -- the clinic's lawyer or the -- if the threats were, Don't shut down the clinic; instead, start delivering babies, that that would be extortion, whereas in the real case it wasn't?"
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2105.002,2109.973,"Yes, because Scheidler came out the way it did not because there wasn't property at issue, but because there wasn't an obtaining."
2012.12-357,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2112.675,2114.56,"Well, because there wasn't -- and there's nothing obtained either way."
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2120.198,2125.233,"But you are dictating the substance of what they are doing, and so you are obtaining their right to exercise their property right."
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2125.233,2128.685,"Well, that -- that's the problem with your New York cases as well."
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2149.633,2156.537,"It's true, but the New York courses -- the New York cases said that they were construing the word “ property ” to mean the same thing as used -- used in both places in the statute."
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2167.429,2174.182,"I'm not sure that obtainable property and -- and harmable property are one and the same thing, I'm really not."
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2174.182,2177.217,"--They might not be, but they are both -- but property is property."
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2220.563,2227.4,"You are -- you are contradicting what you yourself said a little bit before, which is that property means the same thing for both provisions--"
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2227.4,2228.4,"No, that's exactly what I'm saying."
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2228.4,2229.669,--for both the obtaining and the harming.
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2229.669,2230.352,That's exactly--
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2230.352,2233.954,"But it doesn't mean the same thing for the harming, because there is some property that can't be harmed."
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2233.954,2234.454,--Right.
2012.12-357,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2252.165,2273.948,"I -- I -- going back a little bit to Justice Breyer's question, how do you gain possession of someone's advice or how they do their job when it's not giving you a direct benefit; it's something that belongs to someone else?"
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2273.948,2281.952,--What you are doing is -- what happened in this case is Petitioner was attempting to obtain control over the fruits of the general counsel's labor.
2012.12-357,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2281.952,2284.32,"That's the problem, this obtaining controlled concept."
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2284.32,2284.82,"Right, so what--"
2012.12-357,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2284.82,2289.708,Because you're -- you're equating taking control with possession.
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2292.825,2299.496,"--Well, this Court has repeatedly said that property and exclusive control of property are just different aspects of the same thing."
2012.12-357,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2347.412,2355.333,"As I think about it in terms of the New York cases, as you write them up here, it sounds as if someone was trying to get control of a business."
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2378.698,2382.217,"Well, I mean, you might have an obtaining question if it's only 2 percent of the time."
2012.12-357,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2382.217,2382.919,"No, no."
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2398.095,2398.629,"Well, you should--"
2012.12-357,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2398.629,2401.897,--and -- and it seems to me that probably it is.
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2401.897,2405.749,"--Well, I guess -- I mean, it's sort of two -- two different kinds of responses."
2012.12-357,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2417.49,2420.342,"No, no, I'm not worried about copyrights or other intangibles."
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2420.342,2421.21,"--No, I understand."
2012.12-357,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2421.21,2421.56,That's not the issue.
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2421.56,2428.881,"But I'm just saying you want to look at something in the aggregate on a class-wide basis, and persons doing their job on a class-wide basis is something that is economically valuable to them."
2012.12-357,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2502.246,2505.298,"Well, yes, he would have ended up with something intangible in those hypotheticals."
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2510.452,2511.302,--But he wouldn't--
2012.12-357,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2511.302,2516.339,The -- the problem here is that there is no obtaining of anything that the person is getting from your theory.
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2516.339,2524.176,"--It's the same kind of obtaining here, because he wouldn't take the mowed lawn from the -- from the gardener, he wouldn't take a lack of leaking from the plumber."
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2540.454,2542.156,Why is that valuable to me?
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2555.964,2556.833,"Well, that's what I'm saying--"
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2556.833,2566.539,"It's only because I'm an honest person that I want to make the proper recommendation, but to say that it has any economic value that I recommend A rather than B?"
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2573.109,2577.579,--It has economic value because the lawyer's job is to give his advice in keeping with his client's best interest.
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2581.031,2589.102,"That's all very true and an honest lawyer should do that, but that doesn't prove that it's economically valuable for the lawyer to give the right advice rather than the wrong advice."
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2589.102,2589.387,--It is.
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2599.91,2600.31,"Oh, I see."
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2600.81,2602.112,That's economically valuable to him.
2012.12-357,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2642.939,2671.256,"Ms. Harrington, I guess I'm just confused, and this goes back again to Justice Kennedy's initial question, why it wasn't charged in a much simpler way where the property is not a right by a lawyer to do his job, which seems no other person can get, but where the property was the contract, was the -- was the investment and the fees, and the theory was that a threat was used in order to get that investment and fees."
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2682.314,2688.068,"Well, it was charged on several different theories, and one of the theories was that he was trying to gain the commitment to the investment."
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2709.397,2710.499,Is what--
2012.12-357,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2710.499,2715.701,"But you don't think that there's any reason why it, in a future case, it couldn't be charged just the way I said it?"
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2715.701,2719.439,I don't think -- I think it could have been charged that he was trying to get the money here.
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2719.439,2722.005,--Was that one of the choices the jury had?
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2722.005,2725.593,That he was trying to get commitment; that was one of the choices.
2012.12-357,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2733.949,2735.749,I didn't think they circled recommendation.
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2739.584,2745.32,"No, they circled -- it says the General Counsel's recommendation -- this is on the JA 142."
2012.12-357,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2745.756,2746.189,I'm sorry.
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2746.189,2747.956,--JA 142.
2012.12-357,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2786.231,2799.141,"It -- it does seem to me important that you can't give us a common law case because common law is extortion -- at common law is extortion, it's usually the other way around."
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2800.924,2802.926,It was always the official who was doing the extorting.
2012.12-357,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2802.926,2807.478,"At -- at common law, could anyone ever extort an official, or we just don't have those cases?"
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2807.478,2807.747,No.
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2831.778,2834.095,But not the obtaining of property.
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2834.095,2837.432,"But it wasn't -- I mean, it's true there weren't cases--"
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2837.432,2838.949,That's true.
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2840.551,2840.918,--I concede that point.
2012.12-357,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2854.376,2865.416,"You -- you point out, of course, that it was based on the New York law, but what do you do with the point that they did not carry forward the separate crime of coercion, which was in the New York law but not in the Hobbs Act?"
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2865.416,2867.868,"That's true -- I mean, it was a separate crime of coercion."
2012.12-357,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2882.128,2885.58,What do you do with the fact that the State authorities did charge it under coercion?
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2885.58,2886.58,--In this case.
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2907.076,2914.682,What do you think would be covered by coercion that wouldn't be covered by the Government's extortion theory here?
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2916.799,2918.418,Anything that doesn't involve property.
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2919.484,2919.92,"Well, for example--"
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2919.92,2922.955,"--So, trying to coerce someone to marry someone they don't want."
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2924.872,2926.074,--Why -- why isn't that property?
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2935.096,2937.632,--Because it's -- I think it's more properly viewed as a liberty interest.
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2942.7,2943.618,A lot of people marry for money.
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2944.685,2945.135,--It's true.
2012.12-357,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2977.023,2980.542,It seems to me you could characterize the right to work as more of a liberty interest than a property interest.
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,2980.542,2982.327,I think it's both.
2012.12-357,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2999.788,3006.942,So you draw a distinction between extorting someone not to go to work and extorting him how to do his job once he's at work?
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3006.942,3009.394,"Not on the basis of property, but on the basis of obtaining."
2012.12-357,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3023.238,3029.474,"Why -- why, just as long as we are idly speculating, didn't you use 18 U.S.C. 875,"
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3038.163,3042.632,"Well, we did use it, and he was -- I mean, there are five convictions under 875."
2012.12-357,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3055.623,3057.842,You don't have -- you don't have property in there.
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3059.494,3059.894,--That's--
2012.12-357,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3059.894,3074.003,"--is there some -- I mean, it just seems obvious you'd be in a much stronger position when you say that the recommendation not to buy or to buy a particular service from somebody is a thing of value."
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3074.003,3074.936,--That's true.
2012.12-357,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3080.59,3083.859,Have they in the Court been treated as a thing of value means property?
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3083.859,3086.894,--I think “ thing of value ” is a broader term than “ property ”.
2012.12-357,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3086.894,3088.346,So no.
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3088.346,3088.996,Right.
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3099.036,3108.224,"Well, it -- it at least makes available the argument that you don't have to go this far, that there are other provisions that would enable you to get to this person."
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3108.224,3110.176,"Well, again, I don't think we are going too far--"
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3110.176,3118.282,"So why -- instead of inducing us to define property so broadly that it's unrecognizable, as far as I am concerned--"
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3118.282,3126.369,"--But, Justice Scalia, you have already defined it this broadly in cases dealing with Section 20 of the Clayton Act, the Due Process Clause, the scope of a court's equity jurisdiction."
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3131.607,3136.411,"--We're talking about property for purposes of extortion, the common law crime of extortion."
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3136.411,3137.211,I hear what you're saying.
2012.12-357,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3145.267,3146.55,I don't think property is property.
2012.12-357,1,41442,sarah_e_harrington,,3170.215,3180.523,"But this Federal crime of extortion brings with -- brings with it the baggage of the New York State extortion law, and the New York cases said in that law the word “ property ” includes the running of a business and doing a job."
2012.12-357,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3234.074,3235.657,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-357,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3237.709,3240.061,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.12-357,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3395.263,3396.963,"Mr. Clement, when you finish--"
2012.12-357,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3396.963,3402.017,--And if I can just sort of put the point: They say all of that and they reject that argument.
2012.12-357,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3423.498,3439.542,"--Let -- look, I think if we take your argument to its logical conclusion, what you are telling us is, do away with the Second Circuit's Tropiano decision, and the large progeny of cases that come from it."
2012.12-357,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3474.882,3476.615,"Well, a couple of things, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.12-357,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3494.277,3497.212,"Oh, I think when I sat as a district court judge, I would have been insulted by that."
2012.12-357,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3497.212,3500.831,"--Well, it's not -- it's a good thing you're no longer sitting in that capacity, Your Honor--"
2012.12-357,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3500.831,3501.533,Okay.
2012.12-357,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3501.966,3502.883,--because I -- I certainly mean you no offense.
2012.12-357,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3537.706,3538.022,"Thank you, counsel."
