1972.71-889,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,36.464,"We will hear arguments next in number 71-889, Couch against the United States."
1972.71-889,0,32723,john_g_rocovich,,39.672,42.636,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1972.71-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,263.046,280.271,"Mr. Rocovich, does the record show whether these records were of a nature that the taxpayer would turn them over to her accountant say for a few days each year and then get them back or whether on the other hand they were more or less permanently in the custody of her accountant?"
1972.71-889,0,32723,john_g_rocovich,,280.271,292.426,"Well, I believe the accountant testified that the records had been delivered to him over a period of years, 55 on to for the purpose of preparing tax returns."
1972.71-889,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,319.344,328.523,"How about year in year out custody or possession of records, does the record of this proceeding indicated who had that?"
1972.71-889,0,32723,john_g_rocovich,,328.523,334.273,"I don't believe it does indicate that in complete, no sir."
1972.71-889,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,371.186,376.859,"You are giving a constructive possession theory, so far as the accountant is concerned, Mr. Rocovich."
1972.71-889,0,32723,john_g_rocovich,,376.859,378.951,Yes I am.
1972.71-889,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,398.672,402.768,You are asserting no Accountant-Client Privilege?
1972.71-889,0,32723,john_g_rocovich,,402.768,407.425,"No we do not assert an Accountant-Client Privilege, we will concede there is none."
1972.71-889,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,407.425,416.188,"How do you characterize the relationship between the accountant and the petitioner, agent?"
1972.71-889,0,32723,john_g_rocovich,,416.188,416.388,Yes sir.
1972.71-889,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,416.388,418.791,He is a independent contractor?
1972.71-889,0,32723,john_g_rocovich,,418.791,425.119,"Actually either agent or bailee, since regarded an agent for the specific purpose--"
1972.71-889,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,425.119,430.738,"How is he compensated, by the month, or by the job?"
1972.71-889,0,32723,john_g_rocovich,,430.738,435.642,"Well, he was actually just compensated by the job."
1972.71-889,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,457.87,460.413,He gets similar wage or allowance?
1972.71-889,0,32723,john_g_rocovich,,460.413,460.642,Yes.
1972.71-889,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,589.046,598.094,"I think that this is all premised on the assumption that seizing from a taxpayer, say his sales and purchase records would probably (Inaudible)."
1972.71-889,0,32723,john_g_rocovich,,598.094,598.79,"Yes, it is."
1972.71-889,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,603.123,604.771,Made in his personal hand?
1972.71-889,0,32723,john_g_rocovich,,604.771,609.616,These were made in her personal handwriting for her sole proprietorship restaurant.
1972.71-889,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,609.616,615.267,"But your position, does it depend on whether it's made in her personal hand, for her own use?"
1972.71-889,0,32723,john_g_rocovich,,615.267,620.891,No she could have typed it or something of that nature or I suggest the same would prevail if her --
1972.71-889,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,620.891,629.145,"What about if an employee has made a fault, what about invoices sent to her from sources?"
1972.71-889,0,32723,john_g_rocovich,,629.145,632.964,Well the government can obtain those --
1972.71-889,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,632.964,635.691,How about seizing them from her?
1972.71-889,0,32723,john_g_rocovich,,635.691,638.631,We would concede that they could seize them but those are not --
1972.71-889,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,638.631,641.026,How about bills that she sent out to her customers.
1972.71-889,0,32723,john_g_rocovich,,641.026,644.565,"No, she is (Voice Overlap)."
1972.71-889,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,644.565,647.218,So they could seize those from her?
1972.71-889,0,32723,john_g_rocovich,,647.218,649.904,Yes sir.
1972.71-889,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,649.904,656.235,So what category of material do you say is protected by the Fifth Amendment from seizure from her?
1972.71-889,0,32723,john_g_rocovich,,656.235,667.386,"Well, I think in this case as an example we had the gross daily receipt worksheet where she noted each one of her three shifts at the restaurant."
1972.71-889,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,668.776,672.334,But anyways if you figure those out from the other documents that you say could be seized?
1972.71-889,0,32723,john_g_rocovich,,672.334,672.616,No.
1972.71-889,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,685.654,689.799,Couldn't you seize if the waitress gives a check to somebody in the restaurant?
1972.71-889,0,32723,john_g_rocovich,,689.799,690.664,Yeah.
1972.71-889,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,690.664,702.114,"She presents that to the cashier, the cashier puts it somewhere -- I suppose you would say, you could seize that, wouldn't you?"
1972.71-889,0,32723,john_g_rocovich,,702.114,702.349,Yes.
1972.71-889,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1645.94,1649.5,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-889,2,32723,john_g_rocovich,,3290.726,3292.201,"Yes sir, that's correct."
1972.71-889,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3292.201,3302.829,"And isn't the thrust of the Fifth Amendment, the compulsion on the principle --"
1972.71-889,2,32723,john_g_rocovich,,3302.829,3332.137,"Well, Your Honor, we believe and contend that the rights and questions are personal, the human civil type rights to protect one's documents and the compulsion, directed against one's agent who is holding one's papers on his behalf is equivalent to directing that same compulsion against the person himself I think, essentially a principle agency."
1972.71-889,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3488.981,3499.05,Would the Fourth Amendment help you if subpoena summons were issued and it was properly grounded?
1972.71-889,2,32723,john_g_rocovich,,3502.488,3515.448,"Well, if your summon was properly granted, I think you assuming the problem, our position is the location or naked possession of these document is not the test as who owns them and against whom is this directed."
1972.71-889,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3515.448,3525.94,"We are just getting into your Fourth Amendment argument, if there is a valid warrant or a valid subpoena, the Fourth Amendment probably goes away."
1972.71-889,2,32723,john_g_rocovich,,3527.253,3535.851,"Yes sir, but we don't think that subpoena can be valid if it's directed toward the documents owned by the taxpayer."
1972.71-889,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3535.851,3536.41,Thank you gentleman.
