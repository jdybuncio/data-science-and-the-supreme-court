1973.72-1076,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,33.826,"We'll hear arguments next in 72-1076, Huddleston against the United States."
1973.72-1076,0,28116,harvey_i_saferstein,,41.552,44.385,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1076,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,107.579,120.805,"You don't attach any significance, I take it then to use by Congress of the broad term acquisition, instead of purchase or sale?"
1973.72-1076,0,28116,harvey_i_saferstein,,120.805,135.663,"Your Honor, we believe that the term acquisition was a term used by Congress to catch basically sales, it is quite basically the sales."
1973.72-1076,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,135.663,142.972,"Well then, its ordinary meaning -- in its ordinary meaning, what does the word acquire convey?"
1973.72-1076,0,28116,harvey_i_saferstein,,142.972,156.542,"Now, we believe that first of all, the use in other sections of the laws of broader terminology, such as deliver, would indicate that the term acquisition has a narrower meaning and is simply physical transfer."
1973.72-1076,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,181.472,191.483,"What about the clause there, it requires the pawnbroker to keep records of all ""disposition""?"
1973.72-1076,0,28116,harvey_i_saferstein,,191.483,202.631,"That is Section 9 the -- well, the pawnbrokers required to keep records as promulgated by the Department of the Treasury, and the --"
1973.72-1076,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,202.631,207.838,"That record includes -- is not restricted to sales, is it?"
1973.72-1076,0,28116,harvey_i_saferstein,,207.838,214.646,"Well, there is not -- the government contends that it is not restricted to sales that it includes dispositions of firearms."
1973.72-1076,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,223.898,227.394,"Well, they could have said sales?"
1973.72-1076,0,28116,harvey_i_saferstein,,227.394,227.877,That is true.
1973.72-1076,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,229.997,233.621,So they meant more that just sales.
1973.72-1076,0,28116,harvey_i_saferstein,,233.621,239.14,"They may well had meant more than sales such as a swap or a trade, a barter --"
1973.72-1076,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,239.14,241.719,You mean pawnshops swap and trade?
1973.72-1076,0,28116,harvey_i_saferstein,,241.719,248.973,"Yes, there was some testimony in one of the hearings before the -- one of the Senate Committees --"
1973.72-1076,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1610.816,1614.69,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-1076,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1668.036,1671.502,"But in this case, he didn't possess, he repossessed."
1973.72-1076,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1671.502,1679.249,"Well, Your Honor that's in the court below, the dissenter stated he didn't acquire, he reacquired."
1973.72-1076,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1693.345,1696.269,How about possess?
1973.72-1076,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1696.269,1702.999,"If I am forbidden to possess something, and I come in and say, ""Well, Your Honor I didn?t really possess it, I just repossessed it."""
1973.72-1076,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1716.815,1720.925,"Well, what about if he just left it there for safekeeping?"
1973.72-1076,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1720.925,1736.219,"Well, Your Honor, the question of safekeeping is of course not this question, but I think that in terms of what the word means, which is to come into control of, I think that we would probably have to include that."
1973.72-1076,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1783.231,1789.082,"And you don't agree that the purpose of the act was to stop people from getting guns, they didn't have them before?"
1973.72-1076,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1790.211,1793.699,"I find it very hard, Your Honor, to take that position."
1973.72-1076,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1839.744,1843.097,That's not in this case.
1973.72-1076,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1844.423,1850.868,"In this case, you have a person who is a felon, who is a previously convicted felon, who comes to the pawnbroker --"
1973.72-1076,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1850.868,1853.734,Who had it -- who had three guns?
1973.72-1076,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1853.734,1854.694,He previously had them.
1973.72-1076,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1855.388,1858.837,"He used the word of the statute, he possessed three guns."
1973.72-1076,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1858.837,1860.034,He possessed three guns.
1973.72-1076,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1860.034,1863.489,And he surrendered the possession for a period of time.
1973.72-1076,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1863.489,1865.939,"Right, and he now wishes to --"
1973.72-1076,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1865.939,1869.14,Resume his present -- his former status.
1973.72-1076,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1869.14,1875.273,"He wishes to come in to possession, which is the dictionary definition of acquire."
1973.72-1076,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1880.452,1888.113,I think it falls in the phrase of repossess?
1973.72-1076,1,20547,danny_julian_boggs,,1888.113,1889.433,Well --
1973.72-1076,2,28116,harvey_i_saferstein,,2918.606,2919.798,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.72-1076,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3027.278,3039.169,Wouldn?t it be true if a convicted felon went to a gun store to purchase a gun that it would be an open public record transaction?
1973.72-1076,2,28116,harvey_i_saferstein,,3039.169,3042.428,"In that case you will be required to fill out Form 4473, yes."
1973.72-1076,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3042.428,3046.688,But how does that help you owning -- that this was -- that this redemption was open and --
1973.72-1076,2,28116,harvey_i_saferstein,,3046.688,3049.17,"No, I am saying that the pawn isn't open."
