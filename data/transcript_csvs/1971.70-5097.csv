1971.70-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,24.734,"We’ll hear arguments now in Mcclanahan v. Morauer & Harzell, 5097."
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,27.503,32.636,Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.
1971.70-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,353.15,369.295,"Well, isn’t the -- doesn’t this case turn on whether the enterprise that took place in the judge’s chambers that this is judicial determination or a compromised settlement, isn’t that the heart of the case?"
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,369.295,371.552,Yes Your Honor.
1971.70-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,371.552,392.727,"It is the part of you thesis that if a judge suggests a figure of settlement, assuming that he did so here, that takes it out of the compromise area and makes it into a judicial evaluation, or judicial determination?"
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,392.727,394.241,"Well, yes in effect Your Honor."
1971.70-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,431.342,435.51,Are you suggesting that he had enough to decide the case?
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,435.51,436.458,I think yes Your Honor.
1971.70-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,439.059,447.645,Then why shouldn’t we have District judges dispose of all cases without trial on the pretrial statement?
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,447.645,462.782,"Well, I wouldn’t go so far as that Your Honor, by all -- as I’m saying that I think that he had as much information that is necessary to make a fair evaluation of the claim, and that a somebody at a later date wishes to challenge it."
1971.70-5097,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,482.668,485.589,Couldn’t neither party reject it?
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,485.589,490.364,"Yes Your Honor, they could reject it and go to trial."
1971.70-5097,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,490.364,494.717,Well you don’t normally reject judgments do you?
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,496.696,500.211,"Well yes Your Honor, but of course these other two cases as a matter of fact --"
1971.70-5097,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,500.211,503.634,"Well, Banks was remitted to the judge, he knew all the facts in the case."
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,506.704,509.989,"Well, yes Your Honor, but no one had to accept the remittitur figure, he could have gone to trial."
1971.70-5097,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,509.989,511.943,"But he had all the facts, didn’t he?"
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,511.943,513.533,"Yes Your Honor, he had all the --"
1971.70-5097,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,513.533,516.304,This judge didn’t.
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,520.373,523.464,I think Mr. Justice Marshall it’s a little more than just helping out.
1971.70-5097,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,524.159,528.459,Well what more?
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,528.459,544.205,"Well, he may not have had as many facts as you would have at a trial under ideal conditions, but I think there’s -- a many at trial that you would have just about as much information as he had."
1971.70-5097,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,544.205,553.522,"Well, suppose the judge has held this discussion in the library of a Court, would that be judicial?"
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,563.944,579.504,"Well, I feel Your Honor that he did have enough information before him where he can make an evaluation of it and enter into a consent judgment which was done in this instance."
1971.70-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,620.171,635.878,"Well, what you’re saying adds up to the proposition that when a judge, trial judge gets into the process of settlement, which up to now I thought was something to be encouraged."
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,647.164,659.022,"Yes, Your Honors, that probably the heart of what I’m saying, but ensuring these other cases Your Honor, have come up to what’s known to a judicial determination, and then they settle for a figure something less."
1971.70-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,664.118,681.483,"I’m talking about cases that go on everyday in every courthouse in the country to dispose of cases without trial by having the parties come into the judge’s chambers, and the lawyers have discussions back and forth and they finally reach the settlement figure."
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,685.458,686.968,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice --"
1971.70-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,686.968,689.47,"And it certainly one to be encouraged, doesn’t it?"
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,689.47,695.402,"I certainly feel that way, Mr. Chief Justice, and I -- that’s why I feel strongly about up to this point."
1971.70-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,695.402,716.676,"Well, but then you want in your argument though is, that can be reopened after both parties have agreed to it, months or years past, one party can come in and challenge the agreement, the settlement agreement and bring on a new trial all over again."
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,716.676,721.732,"No, Your Honor, I -- Mr. Chief Justice, I didn’t mean to relay anything of that nature."
1971.70-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,737.594,740.183,Wasn’t that done in the settlement of every case?
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,740.183,746.015,"Well not necessarily Your Honor, sometimes -- a praecipe I suppose that would be certainly close to the same thing as a consent judgment."
1971.70-5097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,746.015,761.448,"Well suppose in this instance, two lawyers had sat down, and written out a compromise agreement and exchanged of releases or whatever without taking consent judgment, you wouldn’t be here, would you?"
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,761.448,763.06,"If the two lawyers were getting along, Mr. Justice Brennan?"
1971.70-5097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,763.06,764.243,Yes.
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,764.243,764.975,No I think the --
1971.70-5097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,764.975,766.665,Then it wouldn’t be a compromise?
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,766.665,767.259,Yes.
1971.70-5097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,767.259,783.318,"But you say this was not a compromise agreement, but rather it was something that Judge Youngdahl suggested as an amount by which the case should be disposed of and it took the form then of a consent judgment, is that it?"
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,788.528,790.181,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1971.70-5097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,790.181,794.907,How do you -- I guess we’ve all been parties to these things.
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,805.834,808.843,"I don’t think a consent judgment to be reopened, I would --"
1971.70-5097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,808.843,814.886,"I know, I’m not to judge, no, the issue here is whether there was a compromise for the purpose of the statute, isn’t that it?"
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,824.545,840.185,"That is correct, it’s a -- it was a settlement, but I think that most all of these cases Mr. Justice Brennan that are really settlements and a -- you know all the New York cases cited by my opposing counsel involves settlements."
1971.70-5097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,840.185,842.16,"Well, compromising in the real sense."
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,842.16,842.565,"Yes, they did --"
1971.70-5097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,842.565,851.483,But is this the way this thing is done in the District that you add a consent judgments on these things instead of settlement agreement?
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,851.483,859.094,"Ordinarily there -- it would be a praecipe Mr. Justice Brennan, signed by both parties saying of a settlement dismissed, and usually don’t even put the figure down."
1971.70-5097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,870.377,878.645,"It’s quite a long while since I used to do this sort of thing, both as a trial judge and as a practicing lawyer, but where he had instant cases in that sort of thing."
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,889.686,889.977,Basically yes.
1971.70-5097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,889.977,900.857,"Well I must say, I never regarded those infant settlements as any less compromising or settlements because we had to take this form and edit them."
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,900.857,921.126,"I think this word compromise has been a -- its been rather or settlements had been rather -- whether abused in the interpretations under this act both in New York and here, because what I never could understand in these other decisions, it reach a judicial evaluation by a judgment and then they had settled it for a lesser figure."
1971.70-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,958.316,962.988,"But as Justice Marshall suggested, that’s a case where all the facts are in."
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,966.079,979.365,"I agree with that Your Honor, but what I’m arguing is I don’t -- for the purpose of encouraging settlement, I don’t think that its necessary in every instance to know every fact of a case."
1971.70-5097,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1000.258,1009.921,"But would you concede that if this case had been tried, and all the evidence had come in, there was always the possibility that the claimant might get nothing at all?"
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,1009.921,1012.749,I felt very strongly that way Your Honor.
1971.70-5097,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1050.861,1055.965,Who took the initiative for the meetings and Judge Youngdahl’s papers?
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,1055.965,1072.459,"Judge Youngdahl did a -- Mr. Justice Stewart, he called us into the chambers and he has quite a reputation in the District of Colombia for encouraging settlements, and he was quite forceful, I will say."
1971.70-5097,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1072.459,1074.661,"Did he just take the initiative, and so --"
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,1074.661,1075.598,Very definitely.
1971.70-5097,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1075.598,1099.158,"At least there is that significant distinction between the circumstances here, and a settlement worked out by counsel with no participation by a judge at all because there, the initiative has to come from one of the lawyers to the other and here the initiative came from the judge, is that right?"
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,1107.949,1125.171,"Yes, that was in the pretrial statement, gives the theory of defense, gives the facts that we all agree on, as I would and that of the course is part of the Court record in CA 189563 which is in the U.S. District Court down here."
1971.70-5097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1125.171,1127.254,You could have a jury trial in the state --
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,1127.254,1129.502,Yes Mr. Justice --
1971.70-5097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1129.502,1138.637,Was it Judge Youngdahl also who suggested that this form of reflecting the settlement rather than the praecipe?
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,1138.637,1139.784,The consent judgment?
1971.70-5097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1139.784,1141.026,Yes.
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,1141.026,1143.98,I can’t rightly recall who suggested that.
1971.70-5097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1146.431,1154.255,"What I am asking, was there any suggestion that that form might avoid the effect of the compromise provision in the --?"
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,1154.255,1158.986,"No, Mr. Justice Brennan, definitely it was on the subject of this man’s mental illness."
1971.70-5097,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1158.986,1160.06,Mentality?
1971.70-5097,0,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,1160.06,1162.074,"Yes sir, we --"
1971.70-5097,1,30642,james_c_gregg,,1252.531,1257.343,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.70-5097,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1575.314,1580.918,"Well you do have this statement that the $5,000.00 figure was Judge Youngdahl’s determination."
1971.70-5097,1,30642,james_c_gregg,,1596.345,1597.609,Yes sir.
1971.70-5097,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1597.609,1599.04,So you have that much indication --
1971.70-5097,1,30642,james_c_gregg,,1599.04,1600.038,"Yes sir, in other words it’s not a clear --"
1971.70-5097,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1600.038,1607.041,That should be -- there’s no determination of an evaluation at least by a man who is a United States District Judge.
1971.70-5097,1,30642,james_c_gregg,,1607.041,1624.427,"Yes sir, in other words, in this case it’s not as clearly one way or the other as some cases are, but it would seem to me that when a judge is evaluating a case for settlement purposes, he is considering a lot of things that he is not considering as a trial of defect."
1971.70-5097,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1692.048,1692.382,Thank you.
1971.70-5097,2,32820,john_louis_smith_jr,,1694.655,1707.076,"There is one thing that I wanted to mention when I was standing before and I -- forgot was, yesterday when I was researching these New York cases cited by Mr. Gregg."
1971.70-5097,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1801.058,1801.93,Thank you Mr. Smith.
