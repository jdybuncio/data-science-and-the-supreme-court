1979.78-6621,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,25.922,We will hear arguments first in Beck against Alabama.
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,30.417,33.937,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-6621,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,211.25,214.31,You went also to the Supreme Court of Alabama on the case?
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,214.31,215.711,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-6621,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,215.711,218.857,And what question did you raise there?
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,218.857,246.205,"The petition for writ of certiorari -- which, incidentally, was not originally in the record, but we had it sent up, a certified copy -- said that the statute violates the Constitution of the United States of America in that it violates provisions in the Constitution under the Eighth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States and is in fact a mandatory death sentence."
1979.78-6621,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,332.664,346.411,"Getting back to the facts, Mr. Klingsberg, I correctly or got the impression from you or your statement of the facts that your client was just along, just present."
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,352.524,355.553,"Yes, Your Honor, that is correct."
1979.78-6621,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,378.604,387.628,"Any evidence in the case about two knives being present, the one that was said to have been sharpened by Beck?"
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,387.628,392.341,"No, Your Honor, there was no such testimony."
1979.78-6621,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,485.704,486.666,Mr. Klingsberg --
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,486.666,486.909,Yes.
1979.78-6621,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,486.909,490.315,-- let me get back a moment to that earlier question I asked you.
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,523.214,535.052,"Yes, Your Honor, I disagree with that because of the petition for certiorari to the Alabama Supreme Court which explicitly refers to the Eighth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments."
1979.78-6621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,569.871,599.04,"Counsel, of course there are cases where -- we have had them here, and I have had more of them on the Court of Appeals -- where defense counsel prefer to have only the most serious presented to the jury and do away with lesser included offenses in the thought that the evidence is shaky enough that a jury will not convict of the most serious offense where they might opt for a lesser included one."
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,601.538,612.181,"I think there is no question, Your Honor -- and the question is not raised by respondent -- that this matter was raised very distinctly at the trial court level."
1979.78-6621,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,668.127,684.395,"To entitle a defendant to a lesser - included - offense charge, do you contend that there need be no evidence at all with respect to some lesser included offense as just as absolute right?"
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,684.395,690.452,"We contend that there had to be some evidence, and the state concedes that there was some evidence."
1979.78-6621,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,702.61,705.032,You say the testimony against him was circumstantial?
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,705.032,707.513,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-6621,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,707.513,721.31,"I thought you just also told us he admitted presence at the crime, the scene of the crime, and holding the victim at the time the victim was, as he says, murdered by someone else, not by him."
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,721.31,721.637,On the intent to kill --
1979.78-6621,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,721.637,724.193,"That is more than circumstantial, is it not?"
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,724.193,729.828,I am speaking simply of the intent issue.
1979.78-6621,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,729.828,741.284,"Are you saying that unless the defendant admits that he had the intent to kill, the evidence of his intent to kill is necessarily circumstantial?"
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,741.284,741.475,No.
1979.78-6621,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,776.172,779.902,But the jury is entitled to disbelief of petitioner.
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,779.902,782.96,"Oh, yes."
1979.78-6621,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,782.96,803.928,"But your point is that if they believed his testimony that he was just holding the man and that the other fellow did the cutting with the knife, then he should be found guilty, could be found guilty of some lesser included offense."
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,803.928,814.874,"That and if they also believed his testimony that both before and during the course of the crime, that he had no intent to harm or kill the victim."
1979.78-6621,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,814.874,817.366,I have trouble with this lesser.
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,825.217,827.177,"There were two, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1979.78-6621,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,836.454,845.206,You mean a man that holds a victim while he is stabbed can be acquitted of homicide?
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,845.206,856.643,"He can be acquitted of robbery with intent to kill, if the only basis for his holding was, as he testified, to tie up the victim rather than to cause him harm or kill him."
1979.78-6621,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,856.643,865.991,Is it not true under these cases the man could not have gotten stabbed if he had not been held?
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,865.991,867.937,That may be.
1979.78-6621,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,867.937,868.859,That is my problem.
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,868.859,870.371,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-6621,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,870.371,882.088,"Is not robbery with intent to kill by definition, if you succeed in the robbery, you are not going to kill the man?"
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,882.088,887.207,I do not think that is necessarily true.
1979.78-6621,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,887.207,895.043,"Under Alabama law, robbery with intent to kill means that you plan to first rob him and then kill him?"
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,895.043,898.688,I do not think it makes any difference what the order is.
1979.78-6621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1008.044,1016.385,"So far then, I take it, this is an argument that is not confined to death cases."
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1022.999,1027.011,That is what the Court held in Keable against United States.
1979.78-6621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1027.011,1028.045,Is that your argument?
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1028.045,1030.391,But it is not my argument.
1979.78-6621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1030.391,1031.439,It sounds like it is.
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1031.439,1031.92,Well --
1979.78-6621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1031.92,1033.371,So far it does.
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1034.76,1037.945,I think that it could be the argument.
1979.78-6621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1046.622,1048.183,You have just been going that far though.
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1051.199,1064.537,"The Court has said on many occasions, Mr. Justice White, that higher standards of due process are required in capital cases, that capital defendants should be accorded all procedural safeguards."
1979.78-6621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1068.999,1079.147,"I think you could certainly argue that if it is a capital case, the jury might be even less willing to convict of the greater offense."
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1079.147,1081.128,"Yes, but I think --"
1979.78-6621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1081.128,1088.143,Because it knows then that there would be a chance of the death penalty even though the jury would not impose it itself.
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1094.163,1106.943,"But there would also be, because this is a capital case and because the lesser-included-offense crime is so serious, there will also be a greater abhorrence of letting the defendant go free --"
1979.78-6621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1106.943,1109.767,Not just because it is a death case.
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1109.767,1119.553,"No, because in this case -- and I think probably in most death cases -- the next lesser offense down is going to be a very serious offense."
1979.78-6621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1124.899,1137.182,"I understand your argument, but I do not see why it is any more telling in a death case than in any other, and it might even be less."
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1137.182,1138.284,"If Your Honor please, there --"
1979.78-6621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1138.284,1139.831,Of course I know you disagree with that.
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1139.831,1140.565,There are two points.
1979.78-6621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1149.559,1155.923,"Therefore, the jury would be more reluctant to convict of the greater offense."
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1155.923,1174.432,"I think the court -- and the court has said -- should be more prone to apply higher standards of due process to do more to minimize the risk of error, to do more to assure that the jury's resolution of doubt is a reliable and accurate resolution of doubt."
1979.78-6621,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1285.989,1291.022,"The Keable case was not based on a constitutional holding, was it?"
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1291.022,1299.887,"The Court avoided the constitutional holding which, it said, would have been presented if it had not interpreted the statute --"
1979.78-6621,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1299.887,1301.418,The holding is not constitutional.
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1301.418,1321.289,"The holding is not constitutional, and there has not been a constitutional holding because every state in the union, going back many years--over a hundred years -- has required lesser included offenses."
1979.78-6621,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1326.663,1330.908,They have the requirement if the defense does not want them.
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1330.908,1346.489,"That is correct, Your Honor, and it is recognized as a right of the defense as a protection which the defense can have if the defense wants it under the applicable statute, the rules of procedure, or common law."
1979.78-6621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1346.489,1352.847,I think your response to my earlier question really was not responsive.
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1356.121,1357.311,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-6621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1391.436,1398.292,"Mr. Klingsberg, what specific provision of the Constitution have you been arguing about so far?"
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1398.292,1404.133,"We have been arguing so far, Your Honor, about the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause."
1979.78-6621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1404.133,1411.164,But just due process in general in terms of the accuracy of the verdict?
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1411.164,1412.224,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-6621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1412.224,1417.575,"Is it a deprivation of jury trial, or what is it?"
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1417.575,1421.394,"It is, one, the accuracy and reliability of the fact finding."
1979.78-6621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1427.312,1428.724,I just want to know what your claims are --
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1428.724,1432.005,Right.
1979.78-6621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1440.502,1442.932,"So, you say that is interference with the right to jury trial?"
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1442.932,1445.027,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-6621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1445.027,1454.508,As well as just generally it risks such inaccuracy that it is a violation of due process?
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1454.508,1454.994,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-6621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1455.586,1456.819,Are those the only two --
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1456.819,1468.487,I think it also takes away the right to have an impartial jury because the jury necessarily becomes biased by facing this appalling prospect of releasing a defendant --
1979.78-6621,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1468.487,1470.859,These are the only constitutional claims you are making?
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1470.859,1495.012,"No, we are also making a claim in regard to the Eighth Amendment in so far as I believe that we can look to the Court's post-Furman decisions for guidance on what should be the standards, the standards under the due process clause."
1979.78-6621,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1550.643,1556.349,"But it is up to the judge to conduct a separate sentencing hearing, I take it."
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1556.349,1558.189,"Yes, Your Honor, there is a separate sentencing in Alabama."
1979.78-6621,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1558.189,1560.665,And the judge determines the penalty.
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1560.665,1561.376,That is correct.
1979.78-6621,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1611.667,1635.554,"You do not think that due process is satisfied, I take it, by the fact that after the jury's verdict, the defendant, the accused has another shot at it if he can persuade the judge that the jury verdict was too harsh on the basis of the evidence."
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1635.554,1650.788,"Your Honor, I think the same standards which the Court has applied and the same careful scrutiny which the Court has applied to the sentencing stage of a death-penalty case should, in the case of guilt finding, also be applied."
1979.78-6621,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1650.788,1655.216,"But the jury's verdict is not final, is it, on the issue of life or death?"
1979.78-6621,0,21071,david_klingsberg,,1655.216,1662.043,"No, Your Honor, it is not.I would like to reserve time for rebuttal, if I may."
1979.78-6621,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1662.043,1663.695,Mr. Carnes.
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,1663.695,1666.074,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-6621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1820.461,1827.38,"Mr. Carnes, just so I understand the thrust of your comments, you are saying there is very strong evidence supporting the intentional killing here."
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,1827.38,1828.145,Overwhelming.
1979.78-6621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1828.145,1838.494,"Are you denying, however, the fact it would have been consistent with the evidence for the jury to have accepted some of what the defendant said and found a lesser included offense?"
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,1838.494,1840.874,"It depends on how you define the word ""consistent."""
1979.78-6621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1846.567,1847.739,Right.
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,1847.739,1854.389,"In terms of the Berra and Sansome rational or reasonable basis, there is a very real question."
1979.78-6621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1870.118,1877.554,"But had there not been this special rule for death cases, the defendant would have been entitled to a lesser-included-offense instruction as a matter of Alabama law."
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,1877.554,1878.022,No question about it.
1979.78-6621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1878.022,1879.889,I know you say not as a matter of federal constitutional law.
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,1879.889,1882.215,No question about it.
1979.78-6621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2066.842,2072.969,"Mr. Carnes, before you leave that last one, how does one know whether a jury -- say a jury acquitted a defendant."
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2080.281,2081.467,One would not know.
1979.78-6621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2081.467,2088.376,Then what is the legal significance of their ability to reach a totally meaningless and irrelevant conclusion then?
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2088.376,2098.701,"Your Honor, I was simply trying to stress that the jury was not permitted -- was not prevented from considering the fact that he may have just been guilty of a lesser included offense."
1979.78-6621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2119.728,2121.635,I really do not understand the force of the argument.
1979.78-6621,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2123.031,2125.655,How did the jury know about the lesser included offense?
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2125.655,2135.247,"They were instructed on the elements of first degree murder and first degree robbery as part of the higher crime, and they were told -- they were also instructed on intent not as clearly --"
1979.78-6621,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2135.247,2138.181,My question was the lesser offense.
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2140.86,2143.112,They are told.
1979.78-6621,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2151.313,2159.004,Did they say anything about the ingredients of any other offense?
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2159.004,2163.037,"Other than murder and robbery, no, sir, except the intent --"
1979.78-6621,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2163.037,2171.302,Then how could the jury have found him guilty of any lesser offense if they did not even know what the offense was?
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2171.302,2172.109,"Your Honor, if they --"
1979.78-6621,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2172.109,2173.735,Did you not say they could?
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2173.735,2175.806,They could not return a verdict convicting him.
1979.78-6621,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2175.806,2177.72,"But they could find it, you say."
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2177.72,2178.512,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-6621,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2178.512,2181.213,"And I am asking, how could they find it if they did not even know about it?"
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2181.213,2188.964,"If they found he was guilty of murder and of robbery but not of the intent element, then --"
1979.78-6621,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2188.964,2193.083,You consider murder plus robbery as being a lesser offense?
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2193.083,2194.568,No question about it.
1979.78-6621,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2194.568,2195.708,It is a lesser offense?
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2195.708,2198.811,It is lesser than the capital offense defined in Ritter.
1979.78-6621,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2199.987,2201.444,It is less than murder?
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2203.403,2203.892,"No, sir."
1979.78-6621,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2207.858,2208.942,"Oh, that is different from what you said."
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2208.942,2210.784,Ritter is the -- I apologize for --
1979.78-6621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2210.784,2216.901,"You do not have to show intent to kill, do you, in your felony murder statute?"
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2216.901,2218.053,"Intent to kill, no, sir."
1979.78-6621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2220.344,2224.411,And you do in your ordinary first degree murder statute.
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2224.411,2227.215,"Most -- well, felony murder is defined as one of the four --"
1979.78-6621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2227.215,2228.074,I know.
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2230.531,2231.44,No question.
1979.78-6621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2232.463,2235.854,"And in first degree murder, non-felony murder, you do."
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2235.854,2237.141,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-6621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2237.141,2237.829,"Do you not, in Alabama?"
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2237.829,2242.003,Yes.
1979.78-6621,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2377.522,2399.188,Are you saying that under the Alabama system the jury that had any inclination to find a lesser included offense or a lesser consequence would simply have returned a verdict as they did but with no recommendation on the death sentence?
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2399.188,2400.67,"No, sir."
1979.78-6621,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2404.561,2407.692,And there would be nothing for the judge to veto.
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2407.692,2410.36,That is not a permissible verdict form.
1979.78-6621,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2415.537,2418.006,What if they split?
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2418.006,2420.195,"If they split, there is a mistrial."
1979.78-6621,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2420.195,2423.923,Any one juror can refuse to vote for the death penalty?
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2423.923,2424.609,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-6621,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2424.609,2428.83,And then it will just be a new trial.
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2428.83,2445.399,"Yes, sir, which is a safeguard, the second safeguard in our statute, because the statute says if there is a mistrial either because of a failure to agree on guilt or innocence, or because somebody does not want to write, ""Fix the penalty at death"" --"
1979.78-6621,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2445.399,2449.994,"If all 12 of them do not want to fix the penalty at death, there is going to be a new trial."
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2449.994,2464.94,"There is a mistrial, and there is the possibility the reindictment option -- the statute specifically provides that after a mistrial because of the failure of the jury to agree, the state can go back and reindict on a non-capital lesser included offense."
1979.78-6621,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2529.535,2535.987,"Mr. Attorney General, what happens if the jury came in and said, ""We convict him of second degree murder""?"
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2535.987,2537.794,"The judge would say, ""No, you do not."
1979.78-6621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2597.616,2599.191,Of course he could not.
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2609.712,2611.279,Exactly.
1979.78-6621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2611.279,2618.052,--in a federal district court since that court had only the jurisdiction conferred upon it by the Congress.
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2618.052,2626.228,"And as the district court and court of appeals interpreted, he could not have been convicted of a lesser included; so, there was no way up until Keeble --"
1979.78-6621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2626.228,2626.814,Right.
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2626.814,2626.976,-- under that.
1979.78-6621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2626.976,2629.487,He certainly could not have been originally indicted for that.
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2629.487,2630.582,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-6621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2717.526,2726.058,"Mr. Carnes, could I go back to a problem that Mr. Justice Blackmun's question of your adversary has raised?"
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2763.514,2763.845,Not on the --
1979.78-6621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2763.845,2765.113,What state interest does the statute vindicate?
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2765.113,2768.245,The state interest is the purpose behind the statute.
1979.78-6621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2769.963,2771.037,"No, I do not want their contention."
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2772.973,2786.511,"Our contention is that the purpose of the statute is to reduce arbitrariness, capriciousness, and discrimination in sentencing even beyond the amount the Constitution would tolerate."
1979.78-6621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2786.511,2798.051,"But it seems to me in the example I gave you -- how does that reduce arbitrariness where you increase the gamble, the 50/50 case but where you could get a sure conviction in the -- I do not understand --"
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2798.051,2805.543,"The underlying judgment is that if there is a 50/50 gamble, that in itself is something of capriciousness or arbitrariness."
1979.78-6621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2846.818,2852.93,"Could one infer that maybe California -- or, rather, Alabama -- thought it was necessary to do this to comply with Furman?"
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2857.187,2865.047,"One could certainly infer that, particularly in view of the fact that there is no reported legislative history in the form of committee reports and hearings."
1979.78-6621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2865.047,2868.957,And Alabama's policy in non-death cases is directly to the contrary.
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,2868.957,2880.006,"Yes, sir, Your Honor, but as Furman posed, capital sentencing is different from all other sentencing either as a minimal constitutional requirement or as taking the values and policies of Furman even further."
1979.78-6621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2979.296,3001.823,"Well, now, Roberts against Louisiana in which that point was made, as I remember -- and the only one of those three cases in which that was made because only in Louisiana did the practice exist of requiring an instruction on lesser included offense in every single case, whether or not there was any justification for it."
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,3003.962,3021.194,"It is different, except when you take the Alabama common law rule or even the federal rule on a reasonable, rational basis, you are going to have -- all the defendant has to do to get a chance at jury emotion, jury prejudice, jury bias in his favor is take the stand and say, ""Yes, but I do not kill."
1979.78-6621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3052.31,3067.987,"There are some cases -- not only hypothetical cases, but real cases -- where it is either first degree murder perpetrated by this defendant or he is absolutely innocent."
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,3092.142,3092.577,"No, sir."
1979.78-6621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3094.802,3095.901,But they do exist.
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,3095.901,3110.799,"Yes, sir, and we point out two examples under the Alabama statute in Section 8 of our brief, one case of which is pending before this Court on certiorari, of Ritter v. State, one where the Alabama Supreme Court promulgated the elements or announced the elements."
1979.78-6621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3127.965,3128.685,Right.
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,3128.685,3131.073,And the same thing with the co-defendant case.
1979.78-6621,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3131.073,3138.344,"Clarify for me again, if the jury had made no recommendation of death, what was --"
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,3138.344,3142.464,The defendant would not be convicted of a capital -- that has never happened.
1979.78-6621,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3153.681,3155.493,There would be nothing for the judge to do then.
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,3155.493,3155.982,Nothing.
1979.78-6621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3173.478,3179.665,I thought you did suggest that the jury might disagree on the death penalty.
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,3179.665,3182.334,If they disagree on the death penalty --
1979.78-6621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3182.334,3185.417,They are violating their instructions if they disagree.
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,3185.417,3187.168,"Not necessarily, no, sir."
1979.78-6621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3187.168,3192.762,"They are told that if you find the defendant guilty, you must fix the death penalty."
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,3192.762,3194.707,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-6621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3194.707,3198.995,Is there any rule in that instruction for the jury to split on the death penalty?
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,3201.998,3204.686,One would not assume so from that.
1979.78-6621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3204.686,3207.09,I have Jacobs against State before me.
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,3234.52,3236.76,I think it reads --
1979.78-6621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3236.76,3238.312,What can the judge do?
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,3238.312,3239.697,It may mean shall.
1979.78-6621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3239.697,3246.521,What does a judge do if they bring back a verdict and they have not fixed a death penalty because one juror will not agree?
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,3252.39,3252.96,I do not know.
1979.78-6621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3268.439,3274.382,"If the jury just will not do it, then he either acquits them or has a mistrial."
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,3274.382,3278.282,"Right, in which case the prosecutor had better be thinking about reinducting."
1979.78-6621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3278.282,3283.062,"But the statute on its face seems to contemplate just such a possibility, does it not?"
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,3283.062,3285.454,The possibility of a mistrial?
1979.78-6621,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3285.454,3288.198,Of the jury not agreeing.
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,3288.198,3291.934,"Yes, sir, it does, and defense attorneys will argue that."
1979.78-6621,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3295.606,3315.983,"Mr. Carnes, in the appendix at page 9 at the last paragraph of the page, the trial judge, unless I misread the language of his instructions, he said, ""Ladies and gentlemen, all 12 of you must agree before you can reach any verdict in this case."""
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,3319.978,3321.63,"Yes, Your Honor, in this case he did."
1979.78-6621,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3361.52,3371.856,"On that point, General Carnes, are you familiar with any Alabama reported decisions treating of the situation where a jury found a man guilty of a capital offense but did not fix the penalty at death?"
1979.78-6621,1,22020,edward_e_carnes,,3371.856,3372.314,"No, sir."
1979.78-6621,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3470.561,3475.056,"You have a few minutes left, three minutes."
1979.78-6621,2,21071,david_klingsberg,,3475.056,3478.394,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-6621,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3618.659,3634.956,"But in the guilt-finding stage, does it not at least tend to eliminate the arbitrariness that was criticized in Furman if the jury is forced to fish or cut bait as to whether this man either committed a capital offense or did not commit it?"
1979.78-6621,2,21071,david_klingsberg,,3634.956,3651.781,"Not as Furman was subsequently interpreted and clarified in that where the jury is given instructions and told to act on the basis of standards, that is not something which Furman condemned, as the Court indicated in Gregg and the subsequent cases."
1979.78-6621,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3655.804,3658.864,"Yes, but that was with respect to the penalty."
1979.78-6621,2,21071,david_klingsberg,,3658.864,3659.579,"Yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-6621,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3663.779,3665.544,I know you do.
1979.78-6621,2,21071,david_klingsberg,,3668.128,3686.766,"I think that Mr. Justice Stewart, for example, in Gregg, when he was talking about why there should be instructions and why the jury should be guided and standardized on sentencing, said that the reason for that is because that is what juries always are asked to do at the guilt-finding stage."
