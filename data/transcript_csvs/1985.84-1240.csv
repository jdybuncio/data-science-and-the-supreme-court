1985.84-1240,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,75.131,Mr. Polly?
1985.84-1240,0,40154,ronald_glen_polly,,75.131,78.433,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1240,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,202.447,206.801,"Mr. Polly, what has happened to the state court action now."
1985.84-1240,0,40154,ronald_glen_polly,,208.868,212.353,--The state court action is set for trial November 4.
1985.84-1240,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,212.353,215.721,I see.
1985.84-1240,0,40154,ronald_glen_polly,,215.721,226.161,The court was guided in the Moses Cone case by the federal policy and law to not delay arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act.
1985.84-1240,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,401.173,413.898,What do you think the federal court should have done if Roberts had to come to federal court first?
1985.84-1240,0,40154,ronald_glen_polly,,426.122,440.596,"Justice White, I believe that the cases indicate that it would not matter if the same circumstances exist."
1985.84-1240,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,440.596,442.382,After the suit starts in the federal court?
1985.84-1240,0,40154,ronald_glen_polly,,442.382,443.132,Right.
1985.84-1240,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,443.132,449.451,Lake Coal starts a case of its own in a state court and then moves to federal court to dismiss.
1985.84-1240,0,40154,ronald_glen_polly,,451.653,460.693,The existence of the state action... It is assumed that Lake would file the state action as well after the federal action.
1985.84-1240,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,466.847,471.567,"So, in my example you would be arguing for the same result, mainly the federal court should dismiss the action."
1985.84-1240,0,40154,ronald_glen_polly,,471.567,474.536,"--So long as... Yes, Mr. Justice White."
1985.84-1240,1,18707,cleon_kilmer_combs,,1738.731,1744.885,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1240,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1814.612,1864.895,"Mr. Combs, aren't the concerns that are reflected by diversity jurisdiction satisfied fully by the option of removing a case that has been filed in a state court to a federal court under the removal power of the statute, and if it turns out that removal is not possible because of the absence of diversity, complete diversity in the state case, do you think Congress still intended that the defendant who can't remove should be able to exercise diversity jurisdiction in the federal court?"
1985.84-1240,1,18707,cleon_kilmer_combs,,1864.895,1870.449,"I certainly do, Your Honor, and I think this Court has so held in a number of cases."
1985.84-1240,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1873.984,1879.203,I am not sure that this Court has ruled on that actually.
1985.84-1240,1,18707,cleon_kilmer_combs,,1879.203,1900.801,"--I don't know of any instance where that particular factual situation has existed, but the rule of concurrent jurisdiction, the pending of parallel suits in state and federal court, has been in existence for further back than I would like to concede."
1985.84-1240,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1900.801,1923.315,"But, shouldn't we look at what Congress has addressed in the framework of the removal power and the diversity jurisdiction statute, look at them together, because Congress has spoken to both issues and don't they relate to each other?"
1985.84-1240,1,18707,cleon_kilmer_combs,,1923.315,1948.715,"I don't think so, Your Honor, because, as we pointed out a moment ago, lawyers are a rather ingenious group and many procedural situations can be developed to defeat diversity jurisdiction as was true in this case."
1985.84-1240,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1971.144,1978.317,"Well, what if removal had been possible under the circumstances of the case?"
1985.84-1240,1,18707,cleon_kilmer_combs,,2002.949,2037.855,"There we have the Microsoft case I believe it is and certainly... I think the action in Illinois would be permissible as concurrent federal jurisdiction, but we have a tool to deal with that and that is the right to transfer that case to the most convenient forum which I think it would be its return to Pikeville."
1985.84-1240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2112.236,2117.99,"Mr. Combs, can I ask you a question that related to what Justice O'Connor was asking you?"
1985.84-1240,1,18707,cleon_kilmer_combs,,2126.746,2127.746,"Yes, we do, Your Honor."
1985.84-1240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2127.746,2138.119,"Now, if you had been successful in persuading the district court of that effect at the time of your effort to remove, would you not have been successful in removing?"
1985.84-1240,1,18707,cleon_kilmer_combs,,2138.119,2139.886,"We think so, Your Honor."
1985.84-1240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2141.588,2152.444,"Then, does it not appear that the effect of what you have done is to get appellate review of the district court's... as you would say... erroneous decision on removal?"
1985.84-1240,1,18707,cleon_kilmer_combs,,2152.444,2177.012,"I suggest not, Your Honor, because if there is parallel federal jurisdiction, concurrent jurisdiction... This case is a case which was instituted in the federal court under a statute granting us a federal forum and the appeal is from that corner and not from the other."
1985.84-1240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2177.012,2192.771,"But, is it not true that... not probable at least that if the Court of Appeals had agreed with the district court's remand order and thought that these parties were genuine... there was a genuine separate lawsuit against the two subcontractors it would have decided the appeal differently?"
1985.84-1240,1,18707,cleon_kilmer_combs,,2201.544,2221.14,"I don't really think it does, Your Honor, because certainly the question of the subcontractors is... The main thrust of this case and this claim really is this contract--"
1985.84-1240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2221.14,2221.64,Right.
1985.84-1240,1,18707,cleon_kilmer_combs,,2221.64,2225.076,--between these two parties that we have before us here today.
1985.84-1240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2251.477,2255.512,"Well, what is troubling me... It seems to me that Congress is giving us conflicting signals."
1985.84-1240,1,18707,cleon_kilmer_combs,,2267.253,2268.438,That would be the effect.
1985.84-1240,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2286.817,2302.926,"Well, it wouldn't have been ridiculous, but it would, in effect, say that a decision on a question like this is lodged in the district court and not normally going to be reviewable and if you happen to lose maybe a different district judge would have decided it otherwise."
1985.84-1240,1,18707,cleon_kilmer_combs,,2309.829,2320.618,"I think that is true, Your Honor, and I would like to point out that the heavy burden was on Lake Coal Company."
1985.84-1240,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2420.216,2427.22,What if the stay in the federal court had not been granted?
1985.84-1240,1,18707,cleon_kilmer_combs,,2433.893,2435.659,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.84-1240,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2435.659,2446.034,Litigating the same issue in each court and whoever... whichever court arrived at judgment first would then conclude the other.
1985.84-1240,1,18707,cleon_kilmer_combs,,2446.034,2449.319,You would have the proverbial race to the judgment.
1985.84-1240,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2454.639,2458.924,"Well, does that seem to you like a sensible way to run a judicial system?"
1985.84-1240,1,18707,cleon_kilmer_combs,,2458.924,2464.661,"No, Your Honor, but we do have a federal system and--"
1985.84-1240,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2464.661,2474.684,"If you say no, it is not a sensible way to run a judicial system, then there must be something wrong with the doctrines you urging... and say that is what should have happened."
1985.84-1240,1,18707,cleon_kilmer_combs,,2474.684,2486.055,--I think the compelling issue is whether a litigant is entitled to a federal forum.
1985.84-1240,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2486.055,2493.728,You say he is entitled to a federal forum come hell or high water regardless of totally duplicative litigation in the state court.
1985.84-1240,1,18707,cleon_kilmer_combs,,2493.728,2501.049,"I suggest, Your Honor, that is a political argument as most of these things are and really addresses itself to the Congress."
1985.84-1240,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2501.049,2512.523,"And, you think Congress would have been deeply pleased with this spectacle of litigation, identical litigation, running its course both in the Kentucky state court and in the federal district court."
1985.84-1240,1,18707,cleon_kilmer_combs,,2512.523,2530.168,"I would hope the Congress would not be pleased, Your Honor, but then my remedy... the only remedy I know is to write my congressman because the jurisdiction of the federal courts is vested exclusively in the Congress."
1985.84-1240,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2531.936,2551.934,"Don't you think the congressman might respond and tell you we have spoken and we have written the removal statute and it is linked to the diversity statute and we have denied the right of appeal from an order under the removal power and that is it, we have spoken?"
1985.84-1240,1,18707,cleon_kilmer_combs,,2557.069,2569.645,"Your Honor, I don't read the diversity... The original diversity statute and the removal of diversity statute as being... You can choose one or the other--"
1985.84-1240,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2569.645,2570.911,"Well, read them together."
1985.84-1240,1,18707,cleon_kilmer_combs,,2581.619,2587.207,"--I am sorry, Your Honor, I am having trouble following your last question."
1985.84-1240,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2587.207,2591.225,"Well, it was more a comment than a question."
1985.84-1240,1,18707,cleon_kilmer_combs,,2593.094,2602.866,I am suggesting that the Congress has said you may remove if it is removable.
1985.84-1240,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2721.555,2726.542,"Mr. Combs, you said you thought constitutionally there could be no discretion."
1985.84-1240,1,18707,cleon_kilmer_combs,,2741.969,2747.306,"I think they could very well have done so, Your Honor, and maybe that is the answer."
1985.84-1240,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2750.408,2755.394,"But, at any rate, it is not any constitutional doctrine that you... Congress couldn't have achieved this--"
1985.84-1240,1,18707,cleon_kilmer_combs,,2755.394,2755.928,No.
1985.84-1240,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2766.684,2769.119,--Where do we find that in the Constitution?
1985.84-1240,1,18707,cleon_kilmer_combs,,2769.119,2780.26,You find it in the area where matters of jurisdiction are withheld and granted to the Congress.
1985.84-1240,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2806.161,2815.85,"So, in your view, cases from this Court like the Younger or Pullman abstention cases are all erroneously decided?"
1985.84-1240,1,18707,cleon_kilmer_combs,,2815.85,2817.652,"No, Your Honor, but--"
1985.84-1240,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2817.652,2821.504,And the Colorado River factors case as well.
1985.84-1240,1,18707,cleon_kilmer_combs,,2821.504,2854.225,"--Addressing that specifically, I view... Of course, Younger, Berford and the other abstention cases are bottomed on the concept of the separation of the federal government and state government and the operation of the state government, the non-interference, the non-intrusion of the federal government into the vital affairs of the state."
1985.84-1240,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3413.401,3422.59,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Polly?"
1985.84-1240,2,40154,ronald_glen_polly,,3422.59,3449.49,"I wish first to say again with respect to the piecemeal litigation issue and the finding by the Court of Appeals that Lake did not have an arguably valid claim against the subcontractors, and, therefore, there was no piecemeal litigation."
1985.84-1240,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3531.61,3533.562,"Your time has expired, counselor."
1985.84-1240,2,40154,ronald_glen_polly,,3533.562,3533.962,--Thank you.
1985.84-1240,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3533.962,3534.495,"Thank you, gentlemen."
