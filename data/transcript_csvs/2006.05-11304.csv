2006.05-11304,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.732,"We'll hear argument first this morning in 05-11304, Smith versus Texas."
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,7.669,10.309,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-11304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,40.0,43.592,Did they find it could or did they find that it did?
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,68.566,71.066,"I think, Justice Scalia, what the--"
2006.05-11304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,71.066,83.185,"So they are not contradicting the fact that the jury wasn't required to take it into account, but they are saying nonetheless, in our view, the jury did take it into account, and therefore, the error was harmless."
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,90.605,92.948,"--I think it does contradict your opinion, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-11304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,109.862,110.346,That's right.
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,131.87,148.986,"The matter in which the CCA posited that the jury could take it into account was the fact that on voir dire, the jurors said we can follow a nullification instruction and falsify our answers to the special issues in order to give effect to mitigating evidence."
2006.05-11304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,156.702,162.591,"Yes, but it seems to me it's one thing to use it for the purpose of saying the instruction was okay."
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,185.958,195.705,"I think what's contradictory, Your Honor, is that the notion that the nullification instruction would be an adequate vehicle was what this Court specifically rejected."
2006.05-11304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,195.705,197.782,They didn't say it was an adequate vehicle.
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,215.479,243.342,"And I would also add that when you actually look at the voir dire on which the CCA relied in which it said jurors express no discomfort, no hesitation about their willingness to falsify their answers to the special issues, the very first juror in this case, a lawyer, expressed exactly the kinds of discomfort that this Court feared and anticipated with the use of the nullification instruction."
2006.05-11304,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,243.342,251.306,"Well, Mr. Steiker, may I interrupt you or interrupt the course of your argument to get to a more preliminary point before you get down to details?"
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,268.473,273.954,"Justice Souter, we do not concede that, but nor do we rely on that as a basis for relief in this case."
2006.05-11304,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,283.342,284.888,"Well, I quite agree."
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,296.992,297.601,"--Yes, it was."
2006.05-11304,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,299.974,320.108,"Also on the same preliminary line of inquiry, are we in as good a position as the State court to conduct harmless error analysis, or can we or must we defer to the State court's harmless error analysis?"
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,320.108,326.37,I would say ordinarily this Court is not in as good a position as a State court to conduct harmless error analysis.
2006.05-11304,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,339.802,345.518,"You agree that the application of the harmless error analysis is a question of State law, though, correct?"
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,345.518,347.909,I do not agree with that.
2006.05-11304,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,362.622,376.053,"So that if there is an instruction given to the jury and it violates the Constitution, then we, as a de novo matter, can determine the harmless error, harmless error inquiry?"
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,376.053,378.286,"It's, it's certainly possible."
2006.05-11304,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,393.858,400.81,"Well, is the level of harmless error determined as a matter of Federal or State law when there is a Federal law?"
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,400.81,405.573,"Generally speaking, it's a matter of State law with some limitations."
2006.05-11304,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,405.573,406.151,Really.
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,412.492,418.724,"Well, on direct review, Chapman clearly says it's a Federal question what the standard of review may be."
2006.05-11304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,452.412,454.756,"And, and this was unpreserved error."
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,468.422,481.463,"And we... we argue that there are three independent bases, Federal bases for finding that the application of egregious harm in this case to be violative of Federal rights."
2006.05-11304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,497.567,512.544,"Yes, but that's a very generalized argument, and what he won on was a very specific point that, that this instruction in effect required, if they were going to give mitigating effect, required a jury nullification."
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,514.136,514.981,On that--
2006.05-11304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,514.981,518.698,He did not object... he did not object to that specific problem.
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,525.228,537.956,"--Everyone at trial understood that the special issues on the verdict form were unalterable, that Texas law required the legislature to specify what was on the special verdict form."
2006.05-11304,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,560.931,566.944,"What you're going to hear in a second, I'm sure, because I read it in the briefs, my understanding of the Texas point is slightly different."
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,594.48,595.542,There's nothing--
2006.05-11304,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,595.542,598.354,"--That's what you did, you didn't make the right objection."
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,623.764,625.983,"--I have special responses, Your Honor."
2006.05-11304,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,643.586,644.46,"Oh, you're there in a Texas court."
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,649.739,653.769,"The court, the Court of Criminal Appeals did not invoke this basis for saying that his trial objection was inadequate."
2006.05-11304,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,658.797,664.701,"They applied, they applied a legal standard, the egregious harm standard, that depends on failure of an objection."
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,670.605,671.09,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-11304,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,685.35,703.482,"The judge, the judge, I thought, told the lawyers what the charge would be, and I think also said I can't give a separate charge on mitigation because that's a job that only the Texas legislature can do."
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,710.699,712.808,It was the understanding of everyone.
2006.05-11304,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,731.973,740.703,"It sounds like you're arguing that the Texas court misapplied Texas law, and you want us to reverse their application of their own law about what is an adequate objection."
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,740.703,741.875,"No, Your Honor."
2006.05-11304,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,761.758,768.052,"Yes, but on the issue of whether there was an adequate... I thought you were arguing that, in fact, there was an adequate objection."
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,774.363,790.198,"I don't think it is an issue of Texas law, Your Honor, because the basis for the finding that it was inadequate was that he had to separately object to the nullification instruction as opposed to what everyone agreed he object to, was the inadequacy of the verdict form."
2006.05-11304,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,800.711,806.115,"May I, may I again interrupt you to just get the context of your argument?"
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,828.058,828.605,--That is correct.
2006.05-11304,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,828.605,829.12,Is my understanding--
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,829.12,829.745,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2006.05-11304,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,829.745,830.198,--Thank you.
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,830.198,831.885,I'd like to make it clear--
2006.05-11304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,831.885,833.853,"Do we make up our own procedural rules, too?"
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,845.646,847.786,--I don't think you need to make up--
2006.05-11304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,847.786,848.052,Why not?
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,848.847,861.748,"--It's a Federal question about what the nature of the claim is, and if the State's misunderstanding of the Federal claim was what was intertwined with its conclusion that it was an inadequate objection, that is a misunderstanding of Federal law."
2006.05-11304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,866.013,870.01,"That's... that's a little bit different from your, from your response to Justice Souter."
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,872.993,874.649,"--I believe our, I believe our right to be--"
2006.05-11304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,874.649,889.519,"--You don't assert that in every case when there is a procedural objection in a capital case or any case involving Federal law, Federal law will determine whether the procedural objection is adequate?"
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,889.519,890.315,"--I agree with that fully, Your Honor."
2006.05-11304,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,890.315,894.142,"But you do, but you do take that position with respect to a harmless error?"
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,894.142,898.951,I think that the question of whether an error can be deemed harmless is always a Federal question.
2006.05-11304,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,900.872,901.076,All right.
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,923.302,940.856,"Well, clearly Ake vs. Oklahoma holds that if the State invocation of the procedural rule is dependent on a judgment about Federal law, and that judgment is incorrect, it is not an independent basis for decision under the independent adequacy grounds."
2006.05-11304,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,940.856,955.475,"What about the case, the name of which I cannot think of, to the effect that requiring procedural action by the defendant which would simply be a useless formality and so on?"
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,955.475,956.085,That's Flowers.
2006.05-11304,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,956.085,956.647,It's Flowers.
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,977.03,978.544,"I agree with that, Justice Souter."
2006.05-11304,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,997.662,1000.864,"Why is that... just, why is that too burdensome?"
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,1005.143,1006.705,"--Well, he did--"
2006.05-11304,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1006.705,1013.374,"You're saying, there is a difference between saying it would have been futile and saying it's high and burdensome, and I'm just wondering what your specific point is."
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,1013.374,1038.192,"--My specific point is once he has made it plain... and this is all that Texas law itself says is required... once he has made it plain that he objects to a special verdict form which cannot allow for the consideration of mitigating evidence, and this Court's holding is that that is precisely the error in this case, that no supplemental nullification instruction could correct, he has plainly made clear what his objection was and there was nothing else he could do."
2006.05-11304,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1038.192,1041.347,"May I, may I ask this question about your position?"
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,1050.609,1053.014,We believe it is the latter.
2006.05-11304,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1066.244,1069.742,"It wouldn't be preserving the Chapman standard if it was Federal collateral review, would it?"
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,1069.742,1070.709,--No.
2006.05-11304,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1079.081,1081.706,"It's preserved error on direct review, isn't it?"
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,1099.948,1115.801,"I think that the CCA's position and Respondent's position is that Almanza applies dually on direct review and post conviction, and that that's that's their explanation for why the State court didn't impose a procedural default on State habeas."
2006.05-11304,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1134.247,1142.056,"Well, but it didn't have to reach the harmless error question after it made an erroneous determination that there was no error at all."
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,1148.601,1149.802,--I think it is changing its position.
2006.05-11304,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1160.362,1169.233,"Wouldn't it be normal exercise of judicial restraint to say, we don't have to reach out and decide whether this error was harmless if we've already decided there's no error at all?"
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,1169.233,1173.154,"--I think it would not be in the case of State habeas, for this reason."
2006.05-11304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1188.896,1202.986,"Well, I just don't... you say whenever, whenever a court decides the case on the merits instead of using an intervening procedural objection, the procedural objection is waived."
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,1202.986,1206.155,"No, I do not make that, I do not make that broad argument, Your Honor."
2006.05-11304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1219.948,1228.552,"Especially in capital cases, courts don't like to say, oh, you know, yes, you may be innocent but there's this procedural objection."
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,1230.489,1232.348,--I'm afraid that's not my experience with the court of criminal appeals.
2006.05-11304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1232.348,1234.269,"--Well, it's my experience with a lot of courts."
2006.05-11304,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1234.269,1250.434,"And it's a very bad... I think in the long term in the broad category of cases, it would be a very bad solution for defendants, because what's going to happen, once a court's determined there's no error at all, it's much easier for them to say, oh and by the way if there was it's harmless."
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,1267.536,1286.342,"In the vast majority of cases, Chief Justice Roberts, the courts in Texas take that approach, which is if there is a procedural impediment to the case they flag that procedural impediment, rule on alternative grounds, and I think that is good evidence that in this case when four justices urged a procedural element--"
2006.05-11304,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1286.342,1290.059,"Why, why, why do you say there are a lot of cases where it doesn't matter?"
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,1350.565,1351.97,"--I think that's exactly right, sir."
2006.05-11304,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1351.97,1353.002,Why wouldn't that be the case?
2006.05-11304,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1353.642,1354.719,I'm sorry.
2006.05-11304,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1354.719,1357.782,--Suppose the State--
2006.05-11304,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1357.782,1365.357,Isn't there a difference between waiving it as a procedural bar and waiving it as an objection to the proper standard of review?
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,1365.357,1372.916,"We don't think it's a difference, Your Honor, because we think the underlying fact, the adequacy of the trial objection, was what obtained."
2006.05-11304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1374.448,1378.695,"Who gives the State court the power to, as you say, waive that objection?"
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,1391.971,1393.766,"--I think ""waiver"" might not be the right word."
2006.05-11304,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1393.766,1394.11,Well--
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,1394.11,1405.403,But it's clear that if the State court does not rely on a procedural impediment when the case goes into Federal habeas that impediment cannot be reintroduced in the case as a separate ground of decision.
2006.05-11304,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1405.403,1415.602,"But even if it is, logically anterior to consideration of that procedural impediment is a particular ruling on the merits and the State court didn't make that merits."
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,1434.5,1450.791,"I think that the concerns for judicial economy in this case would have dictated that if the State court believed that the trial objection was inadequate, it would have rested its decision on that ground to essentially preclude merits review of that Federal constitutional issue."
2006.05-11304,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1450.791,1461.834,"Otherwise you have a Supreme Court decision that the State court can say, thanks, thanks, that's very interesting advice, but we... there was a procedural default here."
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,1469.097,1472.862,I think it's a special risk in State habeas when the--
2006.05-11304,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1472.862,1484.684,"Well, it would be a special risk if you, if you, if you allowed them to raise the bar, allowed a State to raise a bar to consideration of the issue."
2006.05-11304,0,32794,jordan_steiker,,1559.544,1565.994,"--Well, we would take the CCA at its word that the Almanza standard's appropriate."
2006.05-11304,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1580.52,1581.395,"Thank you, counsel."
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1587.066,1588.658,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2006.05-11304,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1629.048,1632.063,I take it that is not an issue before us?
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1632.063,1638.216,--It is an issue that on the reply brief Petitioner has essentially conceded.
2006.05-11304,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1649.367,1661.175,"But the Penry error, even if not structural, is not subject to harmless error review and you could say that that distinction is possible because Penry has a built-in harmless error or a harmful error component."
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1665.345,1699.597,"It is not in this case because of Petitioner's concession, but Petitioner's concession has serious consequences because the only ground upon which Petitioner can prevail in this Court is that the State court's application of harmless error violated the United States Constitution and by giving up his structural error argument he gives up virtually any basis to lay out why that would violate the U.S. Constitution, not simply why it was incorrect but why it is unconstitutional for the State court to apply that doctrine."
2006.05-11304,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1699.597,1702.612,"It's a question of waiver, part of it."
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1744.579,1746.751,"Justice Breyer, I do not disagree with you."
2006.05-11304,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1746.751,1750.266,"Okay, there's no such case and therefore this would be the first."
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1750.266,1752.265,But that's not what happened here.
2006.05-11304,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1752.265,1752.905,Right.
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1752.905,1763.463,I do not disagree with you that if the State court had concluded for Petitioner on a State ground TO begin with and after being reversed revisited that conclusion--
2006.05-11304,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1763.463,1763.869,"No, no, no."
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1798.714,1801.369,"--Justice Breyer, there is no suggestion--"
2006.05-11304,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1801.369,1802.666,And I say this would be the first.
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1802.666,1808.725,--That's not what happened here and so we are not urging that ground to support what the Court of Criminal Appeals did.
2006.05-11304,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1831.201,1832.42,I'm making a mistake here.
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1852.832,1856.269,That is not exactly how the State court and State law does it.
2006.05-11304,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1866.795,1875.245,"Yes, but Mr. Cruz, is it not true that if he did fail to preserve the objection then there should have been a procedural bar to the case going forward?"
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1875.245,1877.104,--There is not a procedural bar--
2006.05-11304,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1877.104,1878.478,Why is that?
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1878.478,1886.788,--because the State Court of Criminal Appeals has chosen to forgive failure to preserve for purposes of procedural default and subsequent habeas rights.
2006.05-11304,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1886.788,1902.719,"In other words, they are saying that the failure to object does not constitute... would constitute a procedural bar if we elected to treat it that way, but we've decided not to, but we're nevertheless going to rely on the failure to object to justify a higher standard of review on harmless error?"
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1902.719,1904.717,"That's exactly correct, Justice Stevens."
2006.05-11304,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1904.717,1908.935,Is there any precedent for that ambivalent use of a potential procedural bar?
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1908.935,1923.554,"Let me suggest it's not an ambivalent use, but rather what the Court of Criminal Appeals has held, in the Black case it held that Penry I was so novel that the State courts would excuse a failure to preserve for purposes of procedural bar."
2006.05-11304,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1927.896,1938.454,"General Cruz, none of this went on in the opinion and there were four judges of that court who said there's a procedural bar here, end of case."
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1951.386,1958.399,"Justice Ginsburg, you're right that in Smith I, the Court of Criminal Appeals, the majority did not explain why there wasn't a procedural bar."
2006.05-11304,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1984.169,1990.136,"The simple question is the procedural objection, as the four judges suggested, could have precluded consideration--"
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,1992.558,1993.026,Correct.
2006.05-11304,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1993.026,2000.164,"And the court said we're going to go ahead and consider it, and then when it turns out that they got it wrong and there was error they had to apply harmless error review."
2006.05-11304,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2023.857,2026.075,"Mr. Cruz, would you clarify one thing for me?"
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2034.024,2036.727,In Black they said exactly what you say.
2006.05-11304,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2036.727,2037.101,How about in this case?
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2037.101,2041.287,In this case they didn't... they didn't say because longstanding CCA precedent made clear that--
2006.05-11304,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2041.287,2043.177,"Well, you're assuming there's longstanding precedents."
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2049.503,2061.936,"--It is conceivable, but I would suggest the more reasonable inference is they followed their long line of precedents that said we're not going to interpose, as the Chief Justice suggests, a total bar to raising these claims."
2006.05-11304,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2078.335,2084.551,But you're assuming that they decided to be more lenient rather than assuming that they may have actually decided and rejected the procedural bar.
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2084.551,2084.895,--Well--
2006.05-11304,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2084.895,2087.472,"That's at least possible on this record, is it not?"
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2087.472,2090.315,--They did not say one way or the other the first time.
2006.05-11304,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2090.315,2090.533,No.
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2142.404,2158.834,"The most reasonable explanation for that, Justice Souter, I would suggest is at the time of Smith III the Court had not decided Hood, which means it had not concluded that Penry II was also so novel that it would forgive failure to raise it."
2006.05-11304,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2158.834,2171.188,"Isn't the consequence of that, though, that for purposes of this case there was no clear State bar at the time in question and therefore, they cannot apply it now?"
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2181.372,2192.429,"That would arguably be the case if on remand the Court of Criminal Appeals had applied procedural default and refused to consider the case... the claim, but not what it did."
2006.05-11304,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2192.429,2192.726,Okay.
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2215.217,2220.715,"Respectfully, they are altogether separate concepts that procedural default is a total bar to the courthouse."
2006.05-11304,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2220.715,2231.726,I can understand that they would be separate concepts if there were a rule or if there had been a rule in place at the time he was going through his State habeas that so said.
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2240.223,2240.956,But Black had.
2006.05-11304,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2240.956,2241.8,--Pardon me?
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2241.8,2244.097,Black had and Almanza had.
2006.05-11304,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2244.097,2245.689,"Black being... help me out, Black?"
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2245.689,2249.845,Black is what excused the failure to raise Penry I for novelty.
2006.05-11304,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2254.561,2261.559,"But that goes to Penry I, and this is then an objection both to Penry I and based on Penry II."
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2261.559,2262.166,--But the--
2006.05-11304,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2262.166,2262.745,So it's--
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2262.745,2268.195,--But the Hood... the Hood decision with respect to Penry II is being forgiving to criminal defendant.
2006.05-11304,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2279.02,2279.987,--You're right.
2006.05-11304,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2279.987,2284.267,"But did they cite that case in this case, in this opinion in this case?"
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2284.267,2284.705,They absolutely cited Almanza.
2006.05-11304,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2284.705,2287.156,"Speaking of that case, can you give me any citation?"
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2318.894,2326.516,"Respectfully, Justice Breyer, that is not what we are urging, and I'm very glad you asked that question because I'd like to clarify what we are urging in our brief."
2006.05-11304,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2329.406,2332.264,"In other words, there's no case, there's no case in Texas law which says what I just said?"
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2332.264,2334.185,I don't know if there is or not but our--
2006.05-11304,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2334.185,2334.841,You can't say.
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2334.841,2342.056,"--Our argument is not based on the timing of the objection, so it has nothing to do with when he did or didn't raise his objection."
2006.05-11304,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2342.916,2344.352,I thought it was because he didn't raise it again in the trial.
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2344.352,2345.368,--That is not--
2006.05-11304,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2345.368,2346.508,What is the argument?
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2346.508,2376.308,"--The argument is that he made a different objection, a substantively different objection, because what he filed was an argument that the Texas death penalty was unconstitutional on its face across the board and as applied to him, and he made a conscious strategic choice which is, when the judge presented a charge to the counsel and said do you have any objections, do you have any suggestions, is there any way I can change it, he could have done what Penry's counsel did."
2006.05-11304,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2386.71,2386.96,No.
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2400.876,2406.797,"Justice Kennedy, he was categorically wrong about that, and that fundamentally--"
2006.05-11304,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2406.797,2407.311,Really?
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2407.311,2408.077,--Yes.
2006.05-11304,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2425.259,2426.009,What instruction?
2006.05-11304,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2430.226,2431.802,Was it the nullification instruction?
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2431.802,2436.926,"That's what the Court of Criminal Appeals has said Penry I said, a deliberateness instruction or a catch-all instruction."
2006.05-11304,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2443.189,2446.766,--Is your instruction... I think this is of some importance.
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2486.625,2489.404,"--Justice Ginsburg, that is in fact what the judge did here."
2006.05-11304,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2519.22,2527.687,"And so the jury, what they take into the jury room is something that says these are the two questions that you must answer."
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2527.687,2532.09,"But they also have a written charge, so they get a written charge with the instruction."
2006.05-11304,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2532.09,2538.62,Which tells them that the only way that they can give effect to mitigating evidence is if they answer one of those questions falsely.
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2538.62,2549.208,"But this Court said in both Penry I and Penry II that if the trial judge defined deliberateness appropriately, even under the old special issues, that it could solve the problem."
2006.05-11304,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2549.208,2556.237,"But in this case the judge said I'm going to give the nullification instruction, and the attorney said, and I think quite properly, he said that won't work."
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2556.237,2563.297,"But what the attorney... the attorney didn't say that won't work because it puts jurors in an ethical quandary, it causes them to violate the oath."
2006.05-11304,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2602.092,2631.128,"General Cruz, how can you make that assumption when the kind of mitigating evidence that has been considered possible within these special questions, the... the... in the Graham case where the reputation of this young man, he was sweet, gentle, kind, God fearing, and so the murder that he committed was an aberration."
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2649.324,2653.354,"--Respectfully, Justice Ginsburg, the evidence was precisely that he had been sweet and kind."
2006.05-11304,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2673.111,2676.797,"When you say 90 percent, you're talking about argument time, aren't you?"
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2676.797,2677.547,--I'm talking--
2006.05-11304,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2677.547,2687.745,"Your answer to that is, there were several hundred pages of records from school and the testing that went on in school that indicated there was something seriously wrong with this guy."
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2687.745,2688.777,--Well... and it's interesting.
2006.05-11304,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2707.035,2707.332,All right.
2006.05-11304,1,38986,r_ted_cruz,,2739.038,2751.204,"--Justice Souter, not only was it a very small part of the presentation, but in closing argument defense counsel explicitly pointed out to the jury that... and let me read from defense counsel's closing:"
2006.05-11304,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2791.797,2793.141,"Thank you, Mr. Cruz."
2006.05-11304,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,2794.999,2803.902,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2006.05-11304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2873.296,2877.966,"Are you talking about both collateral review and direct review, or just collateral review?"
2006.05-11304,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,2877.966,2880.325,--I'm just talking about collateral review right now.
2006.05-11304,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2942.535,2945.941,"In, in this case suppose the following circumstance."
2006.05-11304,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,2952.047,2952.969,--Right.
2006.05-11304,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2952.969,2962.558,"--there was an error of Federal constitutional law, search and seizure or confessions or something, and now we send it back."
2006.05-11304,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3027.611,3034.248,"I'm not aware that the Court has expressly addressed that precise question, which I think is--"
2006.05-11304,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3034.248,3036.466,Have you ever seen it in a State?
2006.05-11304,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3041.557,3041.901,--Yes.
2006.05-11304,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3041.901,3042.589,--Where?
2006.05-11304,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3044.135,3052.491,"Well, our amicus brief, Your Honor, cites, cites dozens of cases in which, in which States have addressed Federal--"
2006.05-11304,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3052.491,3053.865,"No, no."
2006.05-11304,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3097.067,3100.689,"Or plain error, as applied in the Federal cases under Alano."
2006.05-11304,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3100.689,3103.33,"Yes, that's possible."
2006.05-11304,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3103.33,3122.29,"Is there some reason, Mr. Schaerr, why that would be more egregious when the Federal constitutional question has been answered by a Federal district court than it is when the Federal constitutional question has been answered by the State supreme court?"
2006.05-11304,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3144.968,3146.031,--I'm sure it does.
2006.05-11304,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3146.031,3160.353,"And I don't know why it's any worse, any worse when you do it to a Federal district court's determination of what the Federal Constitution says than when you do it to the State supreme court's determination of what the Federal Constitution says."
2006.05-11304,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3160.353,3160.822,That's right.
2006.05-11304,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3160.822,3168.163,I guess the reason would be that there is a problem with enforcing Federal constitutional standards.
2006.05-11304,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3190.607,3201.586,"Right, and the question is whether the State is free in that circumstance to apply a State harmless error standard or if it has to be required to apply a Federal harmless error standard."
2006.05-11304,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3226.061,3230.529,Is there any special Federal harmless error standard that applies to unpreserved error?
2006.05-11304,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3230.529,3234.01,"I think it's the Alano standard, at least in the Federal--"
2006.05-11304,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3234.01,3235.573,"Well, that's for Federal, that's in the Federal courts."
2006.05-11304,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3238.305,3238.79,"--No, no."
2006.05-11304,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3239.445,3241.648,"Well, we haven't had the issue before us, have we?"
2006.05-11304,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3243.663,3245.193,"That's why I'm here, that's right."
2006.05-11304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3245.193,3247.553,This question is a little different.
2006.05-11304,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3252.565,3258.501,"Well, then the question would be is there some Federal law reason why they have to."
2006.05-11304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3260.703,3276.54,"In other words, if for example the higher standard only applies to unpreserved error and the record clearly establishes and the several State judges confirm there was no unpreserved error, then would there not be a duty to apply the lower standard?"
2006.05-11304,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3276.54,3280.819,"--There may be under State law, it's not clear why that would raise a Federal issue."
2006.05-11304,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3280.819,3288.13,"And if the State follows the rule in just one exceptional case before the Federal court, can the court said, hey, you're not following your regular rule?"
2006.05-11304,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3288.13,3293.487,"Well, there may be a due process objection to that, but here the only objection--"
2006.05-11304,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3293.487,3300.062,Is there no Federal interest in ensuring that there is a full and fair implementation of a Federal right?
2006.05-11304,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3307.418,3312.199,"--Well, that may be one reason why we have Federal habeas proceedings."
2006.05-11304,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3312.199,3318.289,"Well, that reason would apply equally, however, to determinations of Federal rights by State courts."
2006.05-11304,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3318.289,3318.742,That's correct.
2006.05-11304,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3318.742,3343.841,"And I think everybody understands that State courts do this all the time, and indeed a good way to do an end run around what, what, what the other side in this case seems to want is simply for the State supreme court to find a violation of Federal law so that it doesn't get to a Federal court and then have the State lower court apply whatever harmless error standard it wishes, which would be a crazy system."
2006.05-11304,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3343.841,3344.107,That's right.
2006.05-11304,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3344.107,3361.849,"So if you're going to adopt this rule, this rule would have to be adopted not only for references back to the State court from a Federal decision, but you would surely have to apply it to all State determinations of Federal law, and I don't really know what authority we would have to require lower State courts to do that."
2006.05-11304,2,26148,gene_c_schaerr,,3361.849,3371.892,"Well, that's, that's exactly right and especially in the habeas context it would be, it would be extremely intrusive and invasive for this Court to attempt to do that."
2006.05-11304,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3407.783,3409.033,"Thank you, counsel."
2006.05-11304,3,32794,jordan_steiker,,3411.455,3427.308,"I'd like to return to the record in this case because I think once it's clarified what the nature of the evidence was in this case it's clear that this Court could find that the error was harmful under any standard, including the egregious harm standard."
2006.05-11304,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3524.471,3530.234,"What about General, Mr. Cruz's comments that this was a minor point in counsel's summation before the jury?"
2006.05-11304,3,32794,jordan_steiker,,3530.234,3538.278,"--It is true that this evidence was presented as only one page of his closing argument, but that was because of the problem in this case."
2006.05-11304,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3582.385,3588.805,Is this argument an assertion that the Texas State court was wrong in its determination of this question of Texas State law?
2006.05-11304,3,32794,jordan_steiker,,3588.805,3591.162,His argument--
2006.05-11304,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3591.162,3593.069,"No, your argument right now."
2006.05-11304,3,32794,jordan_steiker,,3593.069,3594.974,--I'm sorry.
2006.05-11304,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3595.692,3601.19,Is your argument an argument that the Texas State court was wrong on its ruling under Texas State law harmless error.
2006.05-11304,3,32794,jordan_steiker,,3601.19,3603.391,No.
2006.05-11304,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3661.666,3662.557,"Thank you, counsel."
