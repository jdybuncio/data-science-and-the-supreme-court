2002.02-281,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.981,"We'll hear argument now in No. 02-281, Inyo County, California v. the Paiute-Shoshone Indians of the Bishop Community."
2002.02-281,0,31308,john_d_kirby,,14.433,17.649,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-281,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,73.572,81.894,"Counsel, did the tribe offer to accept as consent by the employees their employment forms?"
2002.02-281,0,31308,john_d_kirby,,81.894,84.264,"--Your Honor, I am prepared to answer that question."
2002.02-281,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,87.269,87.69,I see.
2002.02-281,0,31308,john_d_kirby,,94.835,109.615,"There was not any means of solving it at the time, Your Honor, because the Federal regulations that govern the public welfare act at question, title 45, part 205, prohibits the information from being disclosed."
2002.02-281,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,109.615,110.843,"Okay, thank you."
2002.02-281,0,31308,john_d_kirby,,110.843,112.353,It is--
2002.02-281,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,112.353,116.001,That goes for... they had asked for edited copies.
2002.02-281,0,31308,john_d_kirby,,133.062,140.942,"--Yes, Justice Ginsburg, because the information that's precluded from being distributed is the names of the individuals who are being investigated."
2002.02-281,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,241.319,243.549,Is California one of the 280 States that has jurisdiction?
2002.02-281,0,31308,john_d_kirby,,243.549,246.669,"Yes, Justice Kennedy, California is a Public Law 280 State."
2002.02-281,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,350.717,362.601,"Mr. Kirby, here what happened I... as I understand it, was that a search warrant was served on the tribe itself, and so I think that's what your argument should probably be addressed to."
2002.02-281,0,31308,john_d_kirby,,368.093,369.361,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2002.02-281,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,380.882,382.022,"Well, that's true of most search warrants."
2002.02-281,0,31308,john_d_kirby,,382.022,382.755,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2002.02-281,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,382.755,386.107,"I mean, the person served doesn't have to do anything except let them search."
2002.02-281,0,31308,john_d_kirby,,386.107,396.63,"Yes, Your Honor, the point being... the point being that the search warrant did not hail the reservation or the tribe into court for the purpose of responding to a civil judgment for the purpose of--"
2002.02-281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,396.63,398.899,What... what was the tribal property at issue?
2002.02-281,0,31308,john_d_kirby,,398.899,402.595,"--It was common payroll records, Justice Scalia."
2002.02-281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,402.595,403.943,Were they records of the casino?
2002.02-281,0,31308,john_d_kirby,,403.943,408.596,"They were records of the commercial business operated there, yes, the casino."
2002.02-281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,408.596,410.423,Where were they kept?
2002.02-281,0,31308,john_d_kirby,,411.923,418.612,"Your Honor, they were kept in back of the casino, as I understand it, in an outbuilding that was secured by a padlock."
2002.02-281,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,418.612,432.527,Would you... would you draw a distinction between the subpoena of the records of the commercial operation and a subpoena of the records of the... of the government records of the tribe itself?
2002.02-281,0,31308,john_d_kirby,,432.527,435.672,"Yes, Justice Scalia, there could very well be a distinction there."
2002.02-281,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,485.739,486.011,But that--
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1263.236,1270.301,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-281,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1289.166,1299.709,"Well, but even so, let's assume there's a serious felony having been committed involving a crime of violence where employees of the casino are implicated."
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1309.658,1312.786,--In the first place--
2002.02-281,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1312.786,1317.363,That seems... that seems to me a very disruptive proposal for... for orderly law enforcement.
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1317.363,1326.705,"--Well, Your Honor, nothing in the position that's being urged here would preclude a State from proceeding against individual tribal members and searching their own--"
2002.02-281,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1326.705,1330.536,"No, but the suggestion was that there'd be a lot of cooperation between the tribes."
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1335.262,1341.843,"--Well, and... and if that's the case, they would not need to share the information with the tribe, but they could proceed against the individual tribal member."
2002.02-281,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1341.843,1341.993,"No, no."
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1377.506,1379.716,"No, that's not the case, Justice Breyer."
2002.02-281,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1388.678,1389.366,But if there... it's not--
2002.02-281,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1389.366,1390.506,--In the 280 jurisdiction?
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1390.506,1401.951,"--Even in the Public Law 280 jurisdiction, Justice O'Connor, because there are Federal statutes, as you're well aware, dealing with firearms, narcotics, racketeering and so on that could often be used in this sort of situation."
2002.02-281,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1415.569,1417.034,"Well, Ms. McDowell, let's talk about their being sovereign."
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1445.081,1446.652,"Well, of course--"
2002.02-281,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1446.652,1448.027,--where suit is allowed.
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1471.58,1478.752,"--Well, in the Kiowa case, Your Honor, the Court extended tribal sovereign immunity to commercial off-reservation activities of a tribe."
2002.02-281,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1512.368,1518.891,I think there was a dissent in that case that made the point that Justice Scalia has been pursuing.
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1526.713,1527.757,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2002.02-281,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1527.757,1532.778,And I think you are urging that 1983 is not available--
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1532.778,1534.102,That's correct.
2002.02-281,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1534.102,1536.536,--to the tribe either as plaintiff or defendant.
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1557.36,1575.008,"It's generally been understood, Your Honor, although not specifically addressed in a decision of this Court, that the Supremacy Clause and the Federal jurisdictional statutes provide a right of action for injunctive and declaratory relief when a party is claiming that State action is precluded by superseding--"
2002.02-281,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1575.008,1576.215,Are you saying it's a kind of Bivens action?
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1576.215,1579.32,--It may be that.
2002.02-281,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1603.502,1606.99,Is... is there a problem on an Ex parte Young theory here?
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1618.027,1624.165,I think you're referring to a situation where a State would sue the tribe.
2002.02-281,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1624.165,1627.022,"Well, they... that's what's going on."
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1629.959,1630.995,That's correct.
2002.02-281,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1644.728,1646.842,"Well, is that Ex parte Young?"
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1646.842,1647.798,No.
2002.02-281,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1657.31,1657.375,Right.
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1666.247,1671.252,"--Well, it is when one is considering the tribe's suit against the petitioners."
2002.02-281,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1671.252,1679.911,"Well, if... if the... what is the Federal... basis for Federal jurisdiction of the tribe's suit against the petitioners if 1983 is not available?"
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1679.911,1684.533,"Well, the jurisdictional basis is section 1331, Federal question jurisdiction, Your Honor."
2002.02-281,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1684.533,1690.085,But surely the Federal law that the case arises under is not 1331 itself.
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1713.4,1724.108,"From the Supremacy Clause, Your Honor, because the tribe's Federal common law immunity supersedes the State enforcement of a State search warrant against it."
2002.02-281,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1724.108,1727.276,This is such an obvious way to raise this kind of issue without that.
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1733.096,1738.085,"Yes, but a search warrant is obtained in an ex parte proceeding, Your Honor."
2002.02-281,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1739.273,1745.301,"Well, I mean, can't you just resist a search warrant and say, no, I think it's an unlawful warrant and go right to the State court and appeal it?"
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1745.301,1746.42,"--No, you can't, Your Honor."
2002.02-281,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1746.42,1749.021,Everybody just has to follow this.
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1751.351,1752.071,"No, there's no procedure for that."
2002.02-281,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1758.841,1760.46,--May I ask--
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1760.46,1761.368,So that's not an optimal procedure.
2002.02-281,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1761.368,1767.684,--May I ask you a question about your theory that the tribe is not a person within the meaning of 1983?
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1775.633,1778.821,"That's correct, Your Honor, and that's because the term person--"
2002.02-281,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1778.821,1779.876,And isn't that assumption plainly wrong?
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1788.872,1797.439,"--Well, it... it is not necessarily the case that a tribe could not act under State law, Your Honor, because, for example, with jointly administering--"
2002.02-281,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1797.439,1799.629,"But in the normal course of events, it wouldn't be acting under State law."
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1800.753,1803.562,"--That's correct, or it may be acting under Federal law."
2002.02-281,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1803.562,1811.733,"So in the normal course of events, the fact that it might not be a defendant wouldn't shed any light at all on the question of whether it could be a person for plaintiff purposes."
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1811.733,1817.785,"Well, generally, Your Honor, the Court has applied the interpretive presumption that the term person doesn't include a sovereign."
2002.02-281,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1823.988,1829.544,"Well, but a citizen, an ordinary citizen, could be a person for plaintiff's purposes but not necessarily a defendant."
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1829.544,1832.736,"Well, that... that may indeed be the case, Your Honor."
2002.02-281,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1860.062,1864.979,You think that's so when... when what you're doing is getting the records of a casino?
2002.02-281,1,17846,barbara_b_mcdowell,,1866.52,1867.491,That's correct.
2002.02-281,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1876.593,1878.052,"--Thank you, Ms. McDowell."
2002.02-281,2,38958,reid_peyton_chambers,,1882.134,1886.82,"Thank you, Mr.--"
2002.02-281,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1886.82,1889.265,Are you Mr. Peyton Chambers or Mr. Chambers?
2002.02-281,2,38958,reid_peyton_chambers,,1889.265,1890.015,"--Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2002.02-281,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1890.81,1891.503,Very well.
2002.02-281,2,38958,reid_peyton_chambers,,1891.503,1892.196,Thank you.
2002.02-281,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1988.0,1988.062,May I just interrupt--
2002.02-281,2,38958,reid_peyton_chambers,,1988.062,1989.41,"--Certainly, Justice Stevens."
2002.02-281,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1989.41,1990.087,--on the corporate point that was brought up earlier?
2002.02-281,2,38958,reid_peyton_chambers,,1995.385,2000.342,"The... the tribe is not taxable under the Federal income tax laws, Justice Stevens."
2002.02-281,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2004.078,2005.625,So there are no taxes on the earnings.
2002.02-281,2,38958,reid_peyton_chambers,,2005.625,2006.845,There... there are no taxes.
2002.02-281,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2012.639,2015.675,But it is owned by a corporation rather than by the tribe itself?
2002.02-281,2,38958,reid_peyton_chambers,,2015.675,2021.08,"--Well, Justice Stevens, it's operated by a corporation that was chartered by the tribe."
2002.02-281,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2026.103,2029.487,"Well, who owns the real estate that the casino is located on?"
2002.02-281,2,38958,reid_peyton_chambers,,2030.651,2032.853,"--No, the tribe, Justice Stevens."
2002.02-281,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2043.404,2043.935,How about the slot--
2002.02-281,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2043.935,2045.147,--But this... what you're saying is true of all--
2002.02-281,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2045.147,2045.904,--How about the slot machines?
2002.02-281,2,38958,reid_peyton_chambers,,2048.639,2051.344,"They'd be tribal property, Justice Stevens, and operated--"
2002.02-281,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2051.344,2052.668,"Well, what does the... does the corporation own anything?"
2002.02-281,2,38958,reid_peyton_chambers,,2052.668,2055.297,"--No, I don't believe so, Justice Stevens."
2002.02-281,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2064.994,2067.51,You're... you're sure that it doesn't own... what does it do?
2002.02-281,2,38958,reid_peyton_chambers,,2074.692,2084.608,"--It... it operates the gaming facility rather than having the tribal political leaders, Justice Scalia, engaged in the day-to-day operation of the... of the gaming activity."
2002.02-281,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2085.261,2094.781,"But if... if what was formerly tribal government has now been so infused with a commercial character, that it seems to me calls tribal immunity into question generally."
2002.02-281,2,38958,reid_peyton_chambers,,2094.781,2098.205,"--Well, let me try to persuade you it doesn't, Justice Kennedy."
2002.02-281,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2122.762,2129.327,How is that different from any foreign country that wholly owns a corporation engaged in... in business?
2002.02-281,2,38958,reid_peyton_chambers,,2150.023,2157.935,"--But, Justice Breyer, there of course the country, the legislature, or the government of that country could decide what to do with its revenues."
2002.02-281,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2157.935,2184.375,"And they're all for... well, what is... so tell me precisely what is the difference between the casino and, let's say, the state of... the Government of Finland which happens to own a shipping business 100 percent and the revenues and profits from that shipping business go entirely to health care, parks, other things for the people of Finland."
2002.02-281,2,38958,reid_peyton_chambers,,2191.808,2193.446,"There are two differences, Justice Breyer."
2002.02-281,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2253.176,2255.557,Why aren't you relying on Kiowa County?
2002.02-281,2,38958,reid_peyton_chambers,,2260.73,2272.567,"--Justice Ginsburg, as you pointed out, there was a dissent there, but a difference in Kiowa County is that you had a tribe engaged in the commercial operation outside the reservation."
2002.02-281,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2277.38,2279.551,That's a fortiori for you I would think.
2002.02-281,2,38958,reid_peyton_chambers,,2317.816,2334.368,"--I hope I can persuade you that it does, Justice Scalia, that... that... the sovereign immunity basically covers funds and property and the operation of a tribal or any government, whether it's the Federal Government, a State government, or a tribal government."
2002.02-281,3,31308,john_d_kirby,,3351.534,3353.241,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
