1963.19,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,17.062,"Number 19, Harold Fahy, Petitioner, versus the State Of Connecticut."
1963.19,0,24292,francis_j_mcnamara_jr,,18.748,26.934,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,1650.956,1675.818,"Mr. Chief Justice Warren and members of the Court, the State of Connecticut does not question the state must contained in the petitioner's brief as to the statutes involved, the statement of facts, and therefore will not reiterate those."
1963.19,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1814.527,1821.219,(Inaudible) he had taken the paint.
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,1821.219,1824.967,Not at that time Mr. Justice White no.
1963.19,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1824.967,1825.356,What do you mean --
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,1825.356,1829.257,There is -- do you mean at the time he went into the garage?
1963.19,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1829.257,1829.881,Yes.
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,1829.881,1832.211,There is no evidence that the boys knew it at that time.
1963.19,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1832.211,1835.957,"But they know by the time that, two hours later that they arrested them."
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,1835.957,1836.845,Yes.
1963.19,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1836.845,1846.808,And did they know at that time that the paint has been seized or is there any evidence in the record about it?
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,1846.808,1851.265,"It's in the best of my recollection, I did not try this care Mr. Justice White."
1963.19,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1877.563,1880.096,Sounds like Wong Sun.
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,1880.096,1895.555,"Well, Justice -- these two men -- I think Arnold was just staying at his house as a guest and they were in different bedrooms, as I understand the evidence and that's what Fahy said."
1963.19,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1906.998,1908.796,Did they go to arrest them in the house?
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,1908.796,1912.136,"Yes, yes Mr. Justice White, yes they did."
1963.19,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1954.116,1955.664,This is at the front door.
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,1955.664,1958.795,"Yes it was, or just inside and --"
1963.19,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1958.795,1962.84,"And after the officers said, we've got the paint and the brush?"
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,1962.84,1977.383,"Mr. Justice Brennan I can't go that far, I am not -- I don't have that evidence at my finger tips, but I would conclude that they probably told them why they were there and why they had a right to go into the house."
1963.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2035.043,2038.2,You don't challenge the finding of the Supreme Court.
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,2038.2,2039.668,No I do not Mr. Justice
1963.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2039.668,2042.52,(Inaudible) the search and seize.
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,2042.52,2044.68,I admit that.
1963.19,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2300.363,2304.397,"Well, well these facts were essentially admitted at the trial through --"
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,2304.397,2306.606,"Yes Mr. Justice White, yes they were."
1963.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2397.088,2405.719,Did they prove at the trial that the paint that was in this automobile was the same paint that was on the building?
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,2405.719,2428.489,"Yes Mr. Justice Warren, they did by putting on a police officer who had taken the paintbrush and just a little small and about two-inches wide and went back to the synagogue, and he matched the width of the paintbrush with the width of the broadness of this upper end of the swastika and it was the same colored paint."
1963.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2428.489,2433.459,How would they approve that if they didn't have this unlawfully obtained evidence?
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,2433.459,2440.23,"Well, Mr. Justice Warren this is my own personal observation, now because you know I did not try this case."
1963.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2440.23,2440.633,Yes.
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,2440.633,2451.378,And I would think that it wouldn't be necessary to obtain a conviction to introduce that type of evidence.
1963.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2454.501,2465.055,"Well, that I suppose is a part of the evidence that the Court refers to as being overwhelmingly against the defendant."
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,2465.055,2472.36,"Well, I thought that overwhelmingly against the defendant referred to evidence aliunde of the paint and the paintbrush."
1963.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2493.046,2506.521,Is it not reasonable to suppose that these young men might not have made those admissions if they had not known that the paint and brush were in the hands of the police?
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,2506.521,2511.835,"Alright, well there were two instances Mr. Justice Warren where admissions were made."
1963.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2575.546,2598.09,"But what, what have you to say to the argument of counsel that if it had not been for this unlawfully obtained evidence and the results that you obtained from it by gathering other evidence, that it's possible they wouldn't have been obliged to take this stand."
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,2605.305,2617.301,"Our respective answer, Mr. Justice, Chief Justice Warren is this that that line of reasoning never came into existence until after the Mapp decision."
1963.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2660.751,2672.075,"Yes, but at the trial, at the trial before they made these admissions themselves, they did object to the introduction of that evidence."
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,2672.075,2689.418,"On the ground -- the ground for the objection was that that has not been connected up to me, that's the grounds, and I would assume that from that position that as soon as it was connected up with him, well then that objection became invalid."
1963.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2689.418,2711.467,"Well, but they weren't enabled to pursue that, were they, that was the initial, that was the initial question, now how far they would have gone in cross-examination to prove what kind of a search it was, no one knows, because the Court have said, well now it makes no difference, it makes no difference how we obtain it."
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,2715.439,2716.122,"Correct, at that time we do not."
1963.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2716.122,2726.623,"So, they couldn't, they couldn't go any farther, they had to recognize the evidence, because it was in there before the Court."
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,2732.036,2736.52,Now to answer to that I go back to my own participation in this matter.
1963.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2767.738,2769.936,"Well, I think it's very frank to be fair of, to do that."
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,2769.936,2774.051,"Yes, well that's the -- the records will substantiate to that Mr. Chief Justice."
1963.19,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2774.051,2775.632,We have the transcript here --
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,2775.632,2777.65,Yes.
1963.19,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2778.538,2783.944,The transcript speech of the --
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,2783.944,2787.116,"I believe so, yeah I have my own transcript right here, but I was looking at --"
1963.19,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2787.116,2791.094,The transcript to follow these events may have some follow-ups.
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,2791.094,2794.973,"Well, Mr. Justice Clark I remember this."
1963.19,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2847.616,2848.989,We have it -- we have it right here.
1963.19,1,32140,john_f_mcgowan,,2848.989,2853.05,"Well fine, well fine all right, that I didn't know of thank you, all right."
1963.19,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3094.185,3095.409,Anything further gentlemen?
1963.19,2,24292,francis_j_mcnamara_jr,,3095.409,3098.31,Nothing further Your Honor.
