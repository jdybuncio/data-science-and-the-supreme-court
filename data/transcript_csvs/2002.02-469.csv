2002.02-469,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.641,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 02-469, The Black & Decker Disability Plan v. Kenneth Nord."
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,11.5,14.553,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-469,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,53.351,62.066,"Now, the Secretary has adopted some requirements of explanation of reasons where the physicians differ in their views."
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,65.254,88.054,"--The Secretary has adopted regulations, which were effective in January 1 of 2002, which require a plan administrator to obtain the opinion of an expert medical professional to... to advise him regarding medical opinions and to be able to provide an expert medical opinion to the claimant if he requests it."
2002.02-469,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,92.597,100.705,And is there a requirement to give reasons if there is a difference of views between the treating physician and the expert?
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,100.705,100.92,No.
2002.02-469,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,114.037,117.494,And this claim was denied?
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,117.494,118.281,This claim was denied.
2002.02-469,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,118.281,120.642,Were the reasons given in this case?
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,120.642,122.214,"Yes, they were, Your Honor."
2002.02-469,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,173.992,186.671,"And... and under the Secretary's rules, if there is in fact a conflict of interest, it can be weighed in making that ultimate resolution by the court?"
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,186.671,187.223,--No.
2002.02-469,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,206.951,210.685,This Court has suggested that a conflict of interest can be weighed.
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,210.685,213.567,--This Court said that in Firestone v. Bruch.
2002.02-469,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,297.804,300.25,You didn't tell us... you didn't--
2002.02-469,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,300.25,302.23,"--As to your case, what... what difference does it really make?"
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,310.509,311.627,I didn't mean to--
2002.02-469,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,311.627,324.59,--and... and in Regula seems to set up a two-tier system or a dichotomy of an administrator who is a fiduciary and an administrator who's not.
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,335.561,336.514,--There's no question about that.
2002.02-469,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,344.781,351.997,"But I take it your point is that in... in either context, the treating physician rule is inappropriate."
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,351.997,352.76,Absolutely.
2002.02-469,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,360.97,362.236,Am... am I--
2002.02-469,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,362.236,375.24,"--If you are correct in... in that regard, it would go back to the Ninth Circuit and there would still remain the question on which you didn't seek review, and that is, just how do you handle this conflict of interest?"
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,378.814,383.193,"I believe that that's correct, Your Honor."
2002.02-469,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,416.117,429.309,"But their analysis would be different in one respect, I take it, and that is in... in the case as they considered it first, the... the refusal to follow a treating physician rule was taken itself as evidence of conflict."
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,430.084,430.306,Yes.
2002.02-469,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,448.082,449.628,So the result might be different.
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,449.628,454.364,--I... we would certainly... we certainly intend it to be different if... if we can.
2002.02-469,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,454.364,456.022,Did... did they say presumptively void?
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,466.455,470.524,The... the test in the literature is called the presumptively void test.
2002.02-469,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,478.096,479.11,I don't care what they call it.
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,493.685,496.186,"Yes, and in that sense it would... they would be void."
2002.02-469,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,519.2,524.222,But we take the case on the theory that that's governing in this case?
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,524.998,525.807,Yes.
2002.02-469,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,525.807,526.914,--seek... seek review of it.
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,529.541,530.18,That's correct.
2002.02-469,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,534.605,540.788,"It is difficult for me to get to the thing when I have a kind of basic confusion in my mind, which I have."
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,597.038,598.753,"--Thank you, Justice Breyer."
2002.02-469,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,626.202,627.951,What could it consist of?
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,627.951,636.315,--It might consist in an ERISA case of some direction from the president of the company to the trustee to cut back on benefit costs.
2002.02-469,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,636.315,636.728,I see.
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,636.728,644.054,That would be... then he would not be representing the... the members of the plan and he would be breaching his fiduciary duty.
2002.02-469,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,644.054,658.622,"What if there's no such directive, but the plan is set up in such a fashion that it's employer-funded and the higher the benefit costs are, the... the more the employer pays, and hence the less profits the employer has?"
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,658.622,660.059,That's... I'm sorry.
2002.02-469,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,660.059,668.169,Is that just a potential conflict of interest or is that an actual conflict of interest when the plan administrator is... is an agent of the employer?
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,668.169,675.757,"Under this Court's rule... or decision in Firestone and in... under the Ninth Circuit's decision, that is only a potential conflict of interest."
2002.02-469,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,681.022,684.981,"It's using conflict of interest in a... in a strange sense, it seems to me."
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,684.981,687.049,It... well--
2002.02-469,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,687.049,688.436,There's certainly a conflict of interest there.
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,704.148,706.24,--That is a potential conflict of interest.
2002.02-469,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,706.24,708.66,It seems to me they're not really talking about a conflict of interest.
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,718.89,727.059,And I think that should be the... the criteria that the court has to look for in each of these cases to decide whether the trustee is actually conflicted or not.
2002.02-469,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,727.059,729.513,Can we get back to the question that you did raise?
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,747.917,749.733,There is a... I'm sorry.
2002.02-469,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,749.733,749.887,Yes.
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,749.887,762.971,There's a tremendous difference in the Social Security standard as formulated by the regulations of the Social Security Administration and the Ninth Circuit's treating physician rule in Social Security cases as formulated by the Ninth Circuit and ERISA cases.
2002.02-469,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,835.651,853.876,"But I take it, you would not be happy with... if we said, well, the Ninth Circuit went too far, but it should be set up just like the Social Security because, as I understand it, this employee did get Social Security disability."
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,853.876,856.363,"Well, we don't know that for a fact, Your Honor."
2002.02-469,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,877.434,883.159,"So that's... that is open to him to refile and say, look, I've got Social Security?"
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,883.159,883.674,Yes.
2002.02-469,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,899.191,911.231,"I suppose there's something to be said for the proposition that if you have this private system, you don't necessarily want to bring in all the bureaucratic trappings of the Social Security review process."
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,911.231,918.858,"Well, I think that's absolutely right, because one of the congressional purposes in ERISA is to encourage employers to adopt voluntary disability plans."
2002.02-469,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,934.952,948.952,But... but you... you would acknowledge that the Social Security determination is evidence for the plan administrator to consider even though it's using a... a mandated standard of respect for the treating physician's determination which does not exist under the plan?
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,948.952,950.245,--I think it is evidence.
2002.02-469,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,959.755,960.89,But he'd make... make the same decision.
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,980.175,981.917,It might or might not be.
2002.02-469,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,990.583,994.939,It's a different record before the Social... the ALJ.
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,994.939,995.498,That's correct.
2002.02-469,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,995.498,996.253,It's later in time.
2002.02-469,0,34952,lee_t_paterson,,996.253,999.637,"With the permission of the Court, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time."
2002.02-469,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,999.637,1001.614,"Very well, Mr. Paterson."
2002.02-469,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1003.411,1020.848,"Ms. Blatt, did the Secretary consider adopting a rule like CA9 has imposed?"
2002.02-469,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1020.848,1022.728,"No, Justice O'Connor."
2002.02-469,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1032.652,1033.201,Yes.
2002.02-469,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1037.529,1046.511,"--They didn't consider a treating physician rule, but what the Department of Labor did do was impose a series of requirements to ensure fair and accurate decisionmaking."
2002.02-469,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1059.709,1063.936,"The question was when they did that, did they even think of the treating physician rule?"
2002.02-469,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1068.543,1069.199,No.
2002.02-469,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1118.646,1125.44,Maybe the Ninth Circuit was trying to spark for ERISA the same thing that the courts did for Social Security.
2002.02-469,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1142.837,1156.627,"It began with the courts, and they... most of them did impose some requirement and some outright rejected it because they thought Congress had entrusted the ALJ as the finder of fact with the responsibility to weigh conflicting evidence."
2002.02-469,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1194.413,1202.844,Does the... do the Department regulations have some sort of a threshold test for whether there's a conflict of interest or is that just not addressed?
2002.02-469,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1202.844,1203.501,No.
2002.02-469,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1216.066,1224.582,"And Firestone, as I recall, just recognized that the plan administrator can wear two hats, be employer some times and... and a fiduciary at others."
2002.02-469,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1224.582,1225.419,That's right.
2002.02-469,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1239.007,1246.82,So Firestone was using conflict of interest in... in a different sense from the sense in which it was used here.
2002.02-469,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1246.82,1254.085,"The courts have differed widely, in the wake of Firestone, of what this Court meant in Firestone."
2002.02-469,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1270.19,1284.115,"By which it means not evidence that he was instructed to... to keep down costs, but the mere fact that the employer is both the funder of the plan and responsible for administration of the plan."
2002.02-469,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1284.115,1285.001,--That's correct.
2002.02-469,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1285.001,1285.852,That alone is a conflict.
2002.02-469,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1285.852,1291.369,That's the type of conflict that can be considered as a factor in conducting whether there's an abuse of discretion.
2002.02-469,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1304.557,1307.371,What does treating physician evidence have to do with a conflict?
2002.02-469,1,34099,lisa_schiavo_blatt,,1309.107,1309.265,--Nothing.
2002.02-469,2,35034,lawrence_d_rohlfing,,1452.41,1456.354,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2002.02-469,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1498.194,1507.502,"In Firestone... is... is it a conflict of interest if I set up a trust for my children to pay their college education, and then I have to make decisions."
2002.02-469,2,35034,lawrence_d_rohlfing,,1532.665,1538.098,--Only if the trustee's continued employment is... is contingent upon your satisfaction.
2002.02-469,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1538.098,1547.682,"But if it is, if... if I say you're a trustee, I can fire you when I want, then the courts, just in that... like Scott on Trusts and so forth, would say that's a conflict of interest?"
2002.02-469,2,35034,lawrence_d_rohlfing,,1547.682,1552.426,Because you retain too much control over the... the disposition of the trust corpus.
2002.02-469,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1562.519,1562.947,"No, I understand that."
2002.02-469,2,35034,lawrence_d_rohlfing,,1568.243,1580.624,"--The more egregious case, Your Honor, would be the facts of... that would be similar to the facts of this case is if the balance of the trust reverted to the trustee if they didn't spend all the money on your children's education."
2002.02-469,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1582.893,1588.115,"And then... then classical trust law, Scott on Trusts, says that's a conflict of interest and... and what happens?"
2002.02-469,2,35034,lawrence_d_rohlfing,,1591.477,1601.264,"--Well, Scott on Trusts, the Restatement of Trusts, all refer to those decisions as voidable at the election of the beneficiary, and the court would review that decision de novo."
2002.02-469,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1601.264,1609.219,"Mr. Rohlfing, the... the petitioner didn't raise any question about the... the conflict of interest."
2002.02-469,2,35034,lawrence_d_rohlfing,,1633.163,1633.31,Yes.
2002.02-469,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1633.31,1634.914,--since it's the only question that's raised.
2002.02-469,2,35034,lawrence_d_rohlfing,,1634.914,1636.134,"Yes, Your Honor."
2002.02-469,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1657.3,1661.717,"Well, why... why isn't it a thumb on the scales when it requires substantial evidence to... to rebut?"
2002.02-469,2,35034,lawrence_d_rohlfing,,1663.37,1666.608,"--It... it doesn't require rebuttal, Your Honor."
2002.02-469,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1669.756,1679.569,"Well, whatever term you want to use it, unless you've got substantial evidence to override the treating physician's opinion, the treating physician's opinion is supposed to control, and that sounds like a thumb."
2002.02-469,2,35034,lawrence_d_rohlfing,,1679.569,1698.814,"I think that this Court's jurisprudence and the jurisprudence of other courts in other contexts have stated that concepts of abuse of discretion, arbitrary and capricious, and substantial evidence, are really very similar concepts and there are very fine, thin lines between those concepts."
2002.02-469,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1725.85,1729.193,Is it clear that that's what the Ninth Circuit means by substantial evidence?
2002.02-469,3,34952,lee_t_paterson,,2995.925,3011.714,"It's at L36, L37."
2002.02-469,4,35034,lawrence_d_rohlfing,,3011.714,3012.327,"Thank you, Mr. Paterson."
2002.02-469,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3019.165,3021.018,36 and 37 of?
2002.02-469,4,35034,lawrence_d_rohlfing,,3021.018,3023.542,"--Yes, in the large petition lodging."
2002.02-469,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3074.004,3083.322,"As I understand that question, it... it asks him assuming he can't do his job for one-third of the day, can he do his job?"
2002.02-469,4,35034,lawrence_d_rohlfing,,3099.391,3100.6,Significantly interferes.
2002.02-469,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3100.6,3101.781,"Yes, all right."
2002.02-469,4,35034,lawrence_d_rohlfing,,3101.781,3102.298,Well--
2002.02-469,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3102.298,3103.948,"I mean, I'd give the same answer."
2002.02-469,4,35034,lawrence_d_rohlfing,,3109.908,3124.034,"--In... in asking a... a question of a vocational expert or a human resources specialist, assuming the person suffers from moderate pain, could they perform their job, then we've left it up to the witness to answer the question, what does moderate mean?"
