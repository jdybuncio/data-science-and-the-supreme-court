1984.83-1452,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.689,"Thank you gentlemen the case is submitted, we will hear arguments next in Marrese against American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons."
1984.83-1452,0,19509,charles_w_murdock,,92.76,93.71,Thank you.
1984.83-1452,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,194.827,199.779,"Mr. Murdock, in your amicus brief on behalf of the State of Illinois, you say,"
1984.83-1452,0,19509,charles_w_murdock,,210.587,218.173,"Actually, we are more concerned about the effect that this case will have on enforcement proceedings."
1984.83-1452,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,264.721,268.356,It will just drive all plaintiffs to federal court.
1984.83-1452,0,19509,charles_w_murdock,,268.356,273.993,"That's right, and that is why from a policy standpoint you are going to increase the work load of the federal court."
1984.83-1452,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,273.993,278.664,So your concern isn't just that the state is a potential antitrust plaintiff.
1984.83-1452,0,19509,charles_w_murdock,,281.449,282.249,Yes.
1984.83-1452,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,282.249,289.955,I suppose you would like to be able to have your own state courts enforce your own state antitrust act.
1984.83-1452,0,19509,charles_w_murdock,,289.955,306.398,"Well, not only our antitrust act, Your Honor, but the decision, we believe, also is unworkable because it assumes that when you bring... when you file your first suit, you know what you have, and that simply is not the case."
1984.83-1452,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,640.032,645.25,Does the state take a position on the correctness of the Fourth Circuit's decision in the Nash County case?
1984.83-1452,0,19509,charles_w_murdock,,645.25,668.532,"Your Honor, the Fourth Circuit's decision may be right in the result but wrong on the reasoning, since it involved, first of all, a settlement, and arguably out of a settlement of a claim you can assume a waiver, although... actually were the documents that gave rise to the settlement."
1984.83-1452,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,682.256,688.16,Mr. Sawyier.
1984.83-1452,1,36614,michael_t_sawyier,,688.16,707.638,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case presents the basic question whether the plurality opinion of the Seventh Circuit was correct in making what Justice Potter Stewart referred to as a completely unprecedented expansion of the res judicata doctrine for extremely dubious reasons."
1984.83-1452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1040.336,1062.186,"Does this federal interest extend so far as to preclude a sort of issue preclusion if the same facts have been litigated in a state court action, albeit where you could not have litigated the federal claim, if that nucleus of facts has been litigated and the state court has made factual determination."
1984.83-1452,1,36614,michael_t_sawyier,,1062.186,1086.801,"Your Honor, the petitioners do not take a position on that issue except to point out that in the case of the previous state court actions that are here concerned, there were no determinations of fact, there were no determinations of law except for a determination that a technical pleading requirement of Illinois common law that has nothing to do with the antitrust laws was not satisfied."
1984.83-1452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1097.775,1102.494,So you don't have to deal with the Nash County decision one way or another?
1984.83-1452,1,36614,michael_t_sawyier,,1102.494,1127.711,"We believe that just as the states of the Seventh Circuit have stated, the Nash case and for that matter the Derish case, in fact support our position because of the material differences between the Illinois antitrust statute and the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act as well as the fact that no antitrust action was in fact brought in the state courts."
1984.83-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1145.773,1154.111,"Well, the plurality at least thought that Section 1738 just wasn't applicable in this case, didn't it?"
1984.83-1452,1,36614,michael_t_sawyier,,1154.111,1155.111,"Yes, it did."
1984.83-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1155.111,1158.663,What if we... you think that it is.
1984.83-1452,1,36614,michael_t_sawyier,,1158.663,1164.567,"Your, Honor, we believe that Section 1738 is generally applicable."
1984.83-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1172.423,1175.875,Suppose we agreed with you and disagreed with the Seventh Circuit in that regard.
1984.83-1452,1,36614,michael_t_sawyier,,1202.859,1213.067,--The Seventh Circuit did not get into the question of state preclusion law.
1984.83-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1213.067,1213.467,It didn't.
1984.83-1452,1,36614,michael_t_sawyier,,1213.467,1214.35,That is correct.
1984.83-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1219.638,1226.125,"If we disagreed with the Seventh Circuit on the applicability of 1738, why should we go any farther?"
1984.83-1452,1,36614,michael_t_sawyier,,1226.125,1236.932,"--Because, Your Honor, there is an overriding federal rule of nonpreclusion which avoids the necessity to get into these questions of state preclusion law."
1984.83-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1236.932,1254.477,"I know, but I thought that if 1738 is applicable, the preclusion claim in the federal court has to be decided on the basis of how the state court would."
1984.83-1452,1,36614,michael_t_sawyier,,1254.477,1282.311,"In general, that is absolutely correct, Your Honor, but in Kremer v. Chemical Construction Corporation, this Court pointed out two exceptions to the general rule of Section 1738, and the petitioners believe that the more important of those exceptions is not the implied statutory exception, although in Brown v. Felson that implied statutory exception was clearly indicated."
1984.83-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1296.638,1304.844,"Yes, but your position is that under state law there would be no preclusion in this case."
1984.83-1452,1,36614,michael_t_sawyier,,1304.844,1306.46,"--Absolutely, Your Honor."
1984.83-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1306.46,1311.414,"I mean, if you follow their principle of preclusion, that you wouldn't get preclusion at all."
1984.83-1452,1,36614,michael_t_sawyier,,1311.414,1312.598,That's correct.
1984.83-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1312.598,1321.955,"If you are right in that regard, why, we don't have to talk about what the federal rule would be, do we, if we disagreed on 1738."
1984.83-1452,1,36614,michael_t_sawyier,,1321.955,1349.106,"Your Honor, we believe that this Court should decide this matter on the basis of a federal rule so that it is not necessary in administering the various grants of exclusively federal jurisdiction to inquire into state preclusion rules, although, to be sure, the petitioners are unaware of any state's claim preclusion rules that would call for the preclusion of a claim that could not possibly have been raised in the previous tribunal."
1984.83-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1357.026,1358.561,You mean as a federal rule.
1984.83-1452,1,36614,michael_t_sawyier,,1358.561,1359.994,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1359.994,1361.763,Of preclusion... of nonpreclusion.
1984.83-1452,1,36614,michael_t_sawyier,,1361.763,1362.563,Of nonpreclusion.
1984.83-1452,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1376.537,1376.737,You said that.
1984.83-1452,1,36614,michael_t_sawyier,,1376.737,1395.181,"Unless the parties have received a full and fair opportunity to litigate it in the previous proceeding, then surely the initial litigation of an entire claim no aspect of which could have been litigated in the prior proceeding may never be precluded."
1984.83-1452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1446.716,1455.572,"Mr. Sawyier, under your theory of this federal rule that goes... it is bigger than 1738, I guess, is the way you are putting it."
1984.83-1452,1,36614,michael_t_sawyier,,1486.108,1500.534,"Your Honor, the petitioners are not opposed to the application of issue preclusion as to issues of fact from a state court proceeding to an exclusively federal antitrust proceeding."
1984.83-1452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1598.114,1604.085,"Mr. Sawyier, as I read your petition, there are only three questions presented."
1984.83-1452,1,36614,michael_t_sawyier,,1606.387,1608.489,"--That is certainly correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1452,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1617.261,1629.485,"Well, wouldn't it be more consonant with our rules if we rule with you on the res judicata point to reverse and remand the Seventh Circuit and let them decide whether one is contingent upon the other."
1984.83-1452,1,36614,michael_t_sawyier,,1629.485,1658.505,"The petitioners certainly are prepared to point out to the Seventh Circuit the fact that Judge Bowers' concurring opinion was a concurrence only in the result, and that Judge Bower was one of the members of the majority in Roland Machinery Company in which the Seventh Circuit emphasized the rule of discretion in the strong sense as to discovery orders such that the test is whether any reasonable person could agree with that."
1984.83-1452,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1680.085,1681.001,Mr. Griffith.
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,1681.001,1708.319,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, during the four years that this case has been pending in the District Court and the Court of Appeals, this Court has issued a series of opinions dealing with the application of the full faith and credit statute, Section 1738, to res judicata cases where a prior state court judgment is being asserted as a bar in a later federal court action."
1984.83-1452,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1849.642,1856.379,"I suppose we could remand on that question because the court below didn't deal with it, did it?"
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,1856.379,1861.95,"--The plurality opinions did, Your Honor."
1984.83-1452,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1868.77,1878.662,Can you cite any Illinois case holding that a subsequent claim is barred by a prior proceeding in which that claim could not have been raised?
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,1878.662,1884.816,"I cannot cite any case which says the opposite, Your Honor."
1984.83-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2097.271,2105.691,Suppose we disagree with respect to the applicability of Section 1738.
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2120.434,2127.374,"Well, that... maybe I don't understand, but if you decide that 1738 doesn't apply, that--"
1984.83-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2127.374,2127.924,--Does apply.
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2127.924,2128.69,"--Oh, I am sorry."
1984.83-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2137.413,2138.03,"Well, suppose we did it."
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2138.03,2144.585,--defined... I think the plurality opinions defined what the Illinois claim preclusion law is.
1984.83-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2144.585,2149.887,He didn't write the plurality?
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2149.887,2150.922,He did not write the plurality.
1984.83-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2152.005,2157.492,What do you think he said the Illinois claim preclusion law is or was?
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2157.492,2167.682,He said that the Illinois law would bar further litigation in Illinois between these parties resulting from the--
1984.83-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2167.682,2173.751,Even though the second claim couldn't have been raised in the first?
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2173.751,2181.857,"--That's right, that's right, because this is one... the action... the language could not have been raised."
1984.83-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2186.761,2189.647,What was the vote in this case below?
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2191.113,2193.432,Five to four.
1984.83-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2193.432,2194.432,Five to four.
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2200.569,2203.871,"That's... yes, I think that is true."
1984.83-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2203.871,2204.14,Yes.
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2204.957,2208.775,"No, I think 1738 is applicable, and I think if you apply it--"
1984.83-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2208.775,2212.211,"Well, if that is so, what do you think the four people would say?"
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2215.678,2217.947,--That's correct.
1984.83-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2217.947,2228.505,"Well, now, if we disagree with Judge Posner, I would think then there would be a majority that would approach the case on the basis of what is the state law."
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2228.505,2231.957,"I think you are right, Your Honor, because Judge--"
1984.83-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2231.957,2235.742,"We don't know what the people who joined Judge Posner would say about state law, do we?"
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2235.742,2238.461,"--Well, we know what Judge Flamm would say."
1984.83-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2238.461,2239.73,"Yes, Flamm, yes, but nobody else."
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2239.73,2241.146,That is one out of five.
1984.83-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2241.146,2242.765,But that is not quite enough.
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2242.765,2243.832,That's true.
1984.83-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2314.028,2325.086,"Was this decision below, was that before or after Migra?"
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2325.086,2327.686,It was about three or four days before.
1984.83-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2327.686,2328.538,Right.
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2328.538,2331.656,That is correct.
1984.83-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2335.624,2347.332,It may have been that we should have vacated and remanded on Migra rather than taking the case for plenary consideration.
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2350.951,2351.736,That's right.
1984.83-1452,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2354.136,2360.157,You are not inviting that result.
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2360.157,2371.446,"Well, no, obviously, I would like to see the case decided now along the lines I have said, although I am not really fearful of that."
1984.83-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2379.452,2389.157,What do you think about your colleague's suggestion on the other side that there is an exception to 1738?
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2389.157,2391.259,Because of exclusive jurisdiction?
1984.83-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2391.259,2400.965,"Well, because of the overriding federal interest and that... yes."
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2402.484,2403.05,All right.
1984.83-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2408.304,2409.238,You don't think there is a--
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2409.238,2412.44,--I think that there is an interest.
1984.83-1452,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2465.057,2474.846,"--If he wants to present a lot of evidence by hearsay and it is barred by the federal rules of evidence, he loses on the application of those rules of evidence just as someone would in any other case."
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2474.846,2477.798,That's correct.
1984.83-1452,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2633.184,2637.369,"They have a problem if they are simply substituting for the plaintiff in this case, don't they?"
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2663.52,2675.644,"Well, in this situation... in other words, you are supposing that after the petitioners file this action in federal court, that the state then wanted to join it for some reason."
1984.83-1452,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2675.644,2688.654,"Let's posit a state antitrust law, and then the state sues to recover damages under the state antitrust laws, and loses for some reason or other."
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2705.949,2711.436,"Well, I am not so sure, in view of what the Court said in Migra, that they can't go in two courts."
1984.83-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2759.167,2763.052,"Yes, without prejudice, but what if it is just decided?"
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2763.052,2763.469,Well--
1984.83-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2763.469,2781.247,"What if it is just... two concurrent suits, one of them is... whichever one is decided first is going... may at least affect some issues in the other suit."
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2781.247,2782.783,--That's true.
1984.83-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2782.783,2789.019,"And finally preclude, they will issue preclusion based on whichever case finished first."
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2792.721,2798.125,"Unless, of course, that was... but that is what claim preclusion is all about, I submit, Your Honor."
1984.83-1452,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2804.112,2817.27,But don't you agree that one effect of this decision below is that plaintiffs may more often take their whole ball of wax to the federal court than to start a state case?
1984.83-1452,2,20880,d_kendall_griffith,,2817.27,2818.956,"Yes, and I think another effect is--"
