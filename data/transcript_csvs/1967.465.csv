1967.465,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,8.196,"Elijah Edwards, Petitioner, versus Pacific Fruit Express Company."
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,9.351,12.555,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1967.465,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,262.172,264.318,Who services the cars themselves?
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,264.318,268.296,"In this instance, Pacific Fruit Express services its own cars."
1967.465,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,377.262,380.739,Who makes the necessary repairs to the car?
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,380.739,397.392,"Pacific Fruit Express maintains several repair shops of its own, in which it repairs its own cars and cars of other car companies, rail companies, and the like if paid the standard rates set by the American Association of Railroads."
1967.465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,535.134,547.574,"Mr. Werchick, any employees of Pacific Fruit touched these cars after they leave the premises?"
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,547.574,550.076,"Well, in one sense yes, Mr. Justice Marshall."
1967.465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,550.831,551.647,Physically touched.
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,551.647,552.359,Yes.
1967.465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,560.642,565.461,And those facilities are owned and operated by Pacific Fruit?
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,565.461,566.857,That's right.
1967.465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,566.857,573.7,"Well, did they ever touch the car or property that is not the property of Pacific Fruit?"
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,573.7,576.135,"As far as I know, they do not."
1967.465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,576.135,579.401,Then how did they get in commerce?
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,579.401,582.142,How does Pacific Fruit Express get in commerce or how --
1967.465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,582.142,587.427,"How did the employees, they're not in commerce are they?"
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,587.427,589.291,"The employees themselves, yes, Your Honor."
1967.465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,622.176,631.303,"But if there was a switching accident, it would be an employee of a railroad that would be injured, wouldn't it?"
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,631.303,632.899,Not necessarily at all.
1967.465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,637.01,653.399,"I'm talking about when they're on the line of the Southern Pacific, and one of these cars injures an employee, it would be an employee of the railroad."
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,653.399,658.927,"Well, I couldn't say whether that would always be the case or not."
1967.465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,658.927,661.25,"Well, it wouldn't be a Pacific Fruit employee."
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,661.25,672.877,"I -- each -- it ordinarily, as I understand it at least in California Pacific Fruit Express has its own yards which are adjacent to or part of other railroad industry set up."
1967.465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,680.096,681.526,My man is off of that --
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,681.526,681.715,By --
1967.465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,681.715,684.632,"-- he's on the line of the Pacific, Southern Pacific railroads."
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,684.632,697.298,"My understanding is that there would be no reason for a Pacific Fruit Express employee to be out on the tracks in the middle of Kansas or what have you as the train is moving from here to -- from San Francisco to Chicago, from here to Chicago."
1967.465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,697.298,699.401,That's one to point his wording.
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,699.401,715.66,"I would -- if I may add to that statement Mr. Justice Marshall, I think that it's important to consider the decisions of this Court and other courts which should be confirmly established in the area of terminal, belt and yard companies."
1967.465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,752.072,759.866,"Well, Pacific Fruit says that these yards are huge and your area is small."
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,759.866,760.186,Well --
1967.465,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,760.186,762.417,I'm not saying I agree with them.
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,762.417,768.147,They also say in their literature that their yard in Roseville is 1 1/2 square miles.
1967.465,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,782.472,782.679,How was the --
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,782.679,783.53,They own --
1967.465,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,783.53,783.816,Excuse me.
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,783.816,784.619,Excuse me.
1967.465,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,784.619,786.296,How was the employee injured?
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,786.296,789.131,"In this case, the employee was injured while he was operating a motor vehicle."
1967.465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,823.447,842.496,"Well Mr. Werchich, in any event, whatever may have been the employee's duties and whatever he may have been doing at the time he was injured, your hurdle is to bring this company within the phrase common carrier by railroad under the statute, is it?"
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,842.496,842.932,Yes.
1967.465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,842.932,852.374,"Instantly, may I ask you or I gather that another employees of this company injured at work at some time, are they covered by Workman's Compensation now?"
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,852.374,863.885,"It is my understanding that this company is covered by California Workman's Compensation statute but also by the Federal Railway Labor Act, Federal Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act and Federal Railroad Act."
1967.465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,863.885,875.337,"Yes but for injuries on the job, at least up till now I gather, employees of this company have had to resort to state workman's compensation, have they?"
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,875.337,876.975,"Yes, although --"
1967.465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,876.975,890.776,"And if you're right that the -- this company is a common carrier by railroad, they'd no longer be covered by state workman's compensation but would be remitted to their remedy under the FELA, is that it?"
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,890.776,892.578,That's correct Mr. Justice Brennan.
1967.465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,897.165,898.457,I'm not suggesting you do.
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,901.361,902.424,Yes (Voice Overlap) --
1967.465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,902.424,908.226,"These employees for work connected injuries have had to turn to state workman's compensation, is that it?"
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,908.226,909.921,That's correct sir.
1967.465,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,911.197,934.478,"Mr. Werchick, I understood you say that from the time the carriage of these perishable articles started until the time they were delivered whether they were in the terminals of the Pacific Fruit Express or whether they were in route."
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,953.714,957.915,"Mr. Chief Justice, it's my understanding that they either do the repairs or pay someone for them --"
1967.465,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,957.915,958.101,"Yes, but that's --"
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,958.101,962.547,-- but repairs are not provided free to them or assumed it by somebody else.
1967.465,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,962.547,962.562,Yes.
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,962.562,963.084,That's my understanding.
1967.465,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,963.084,965.206,That's their responsibility.
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,970.379,972.472,Or some other car repair --
1967.465,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,972.472,972.585,Yes.
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,972.585,975.032,"-- company whoever might do car repairs at that area, yes."
1967.465,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,975.032,977.309,"Yes, I assume that's right."
1967.465,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,977.309,979.292,How long have they been operating?
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,979.292,989.148,"This company was -- went into operation six months after the first Employers' Liability Act was passed in 1906, and that Act was declared unconstitutional."
1967.465,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,989.148,993.94,And they've been -- being paid for injuries by compensation ever since?
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,993.94,997.591,"Well, I don't -- I think California adapted the Compensation Act early in the 20s."
1967.465,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,998.795,1001.801,Have any of them ever covered under the FELA?
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1001.801,1004.329,"No, there have been attempts in the lower courts."
1967.465,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1029.673,1033.882,Have there been any legislative efforts to get them included under the FELA?
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1033.882,1037.361,"Not refrigerated car companies, no."
1967.465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1045.267,1052.799,"Well, what are the standards by which you suggest we should gauge whether this company is a “common carrier by railroad”?"
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1052.799,1061.16,"Well I think first of all, Mr. Justice Brennan, you could just take the phrase itself if they're a common carrier and they act by means of rails --"
1967.465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1061.16,1063.939,"Yes, but the language is common carrier by railroad, is it?"
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1063.939,1065.513,That's right.
1967.465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1092.204,1097.111,"Well, and you said -- you say, ""All you have to show was that it's a common carrier because it does use railroads""."
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1097.111,1098.418,"Right, either it uses nothing but --"
1967.465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1098.418,1101.23,"Well, now how -- why do you say it's a common carrier?"
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1101.23,1105.474,It is certainly common or public in its structure.
1967.465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1109.064,1113.305,Is this -- is it a business regulated by the ICC?
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1113.305,1116.853,"Its rates, in a sense, essentially they regulate it."
1967.465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1117.012,1123.749,"Well, these are -- are the rates of this company or the railroad rates that are regulated, which?"
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1123.749,1132.594,The contracts between the railroads and the so-called private car companies must be filed and approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission and do not become effective until approved.
1967.465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1152.253,1158.516,"Well, is this company obliged to provide these cars to every railroad that commands them?"
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1158.516,1164.179,They so indicate in their affidavit which is filed that they will provide these cars to any railroad.
1967.465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1164.179,1171.606,"Oh, I know, but are they obliged by law to provide the Penn Central with some of these cars if the Penn Central needs them?"
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1171.606,1175.004,I believe this may be more by custom in the industry.
1967.465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1186.536,1188.553,Are they licensed as common carriers?
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1188.553,1191.979,I don't believe so.
1967.465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1210.232,1219.469,"Well, ordinarily there wasn't -- there was something rather defined about how you bring a carrier within the classification of common carrier?"
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1219.469,1220.041,No.
1967.465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1220.343,1221.049,Was it?
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1221.049,1230.096,"The only language of this Court on that subject, Mr. Justice Brennan, has been the statement that they need not hold themselves out to the public at all and can still be a common carrier."
1967.465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1279.498,1286.539,"Well I am -- didn't we have a -- we had a terminal case, I forgot the name, I think it was (Inaudible) or another one."
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1286.539,1287.084,Pardon?
1967.465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1287.084,1287.163,Where are the words they --
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1287.163,1288.27,Three years ago?
1967.465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1288.27,1304.817,Where a railroad employee was injured on a dining car or something while the car was in the terminal and the injury was brought about because one of the terminal switching engines have struck the dining car.
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1323.165,1326.578,"It doesn't come immediately in my mind, Your Honor."
1967.465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1334.12,1334.559,"Well, is that (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1334.559,1336.282,-- its refrigerated service.
1967.465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1336.282,1352.122,"All that it seems to happen here is that the railroads want -- they want to provide a refrigerated car service, instead of manufacturing or buying their own refrigerated cars, lease them or how do they get them?"
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1355.315,1373.38,"Precisely, instead of buying them themselves because they would be legally obligated to do and servicing and operating them and controlling them and maintaining them and repairing them and building them themselves, they've setup a separate company to do this under a separate incorporation, but is doing nothing but the business of the railroad is legally compelled to do."
1967.465,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1373.38,1379.131,You mean all -- that sorts of equipment to railroads are under the same rule?
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1379.131,1380.25,No.
1967.465,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1380.25,1382.915,What makes these under that -- under?
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1382.915,1386.109,"That -- Mr. Justice White, this company is a common carrier."
1967.465,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1386.109,1388.584,"Well, I know you keep saying that, but what --"
1967.465,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1388.584,1389.739,That's what you have to prove.
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1389.739,1389.98,It --
1967.465,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1389.98,1398.254,"That's the question, and what distinguishes this lessor of equipment from other lessors of equipment to railroad?"
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1398.254,1405.689,The degree of involvement in the interstate transportation of goods is essentially what it is.
1967.465,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1431.21,1433.958,Are freight forwarders subject to FELA?
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1433.958,1437.124,"No they're not, not generally unless they were to -- separate terminal operations."
1967.465,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1437.124,1452.181,"Well, they have to obliged to the public, to their services are very widely and they collect the shipments and divide them up, assemble them and put them on -- and all the railroad does is carry them?"
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1452.181,1453.522,Yes Your Honor but as I pointed out in my brief --
1967.465,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1453.522,1457.411,Would you be making the same argument about that?
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1457.411,1463.508,"No, as I put it on my brief, they stand in the relation of -- to the carrier as basically a shipper."
1967.465,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1488.615,1492.224,Are there any other operations to which this principle would apply?
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1506.026,1517.711,"I think Mr. Justice Fortas that it's done more -- with my understanding and I'm not as informed in that area, I'm talking at the top of my head but I think it's done more by standard lease to the line haul carrier."
1967.465,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1519.579,1529.05,So far as you know this would -- the application of this principle for which you're contending would be confined to this company?
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1529.05,1533.594,That it might overlapping to the area -- I see that as a transportation service --
1967.465,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1533.594,1536.679,By the common carriers.
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1537.42,1537.685,Alright
1967.465,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1537.685,1544.519,"But those two – under that, those are the only ones to which you can think of to which this would apply?"
1967.465,0,17263,arne_werchick,,1544.519,1544.766,Yes.
1967.465,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1555.287,1558.124,Mr. Corrigan.
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,1558.124,1561.643,"May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice."
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1569.553,1571.526,"Before you start, do you remember that name of the case that I'm trying make --"
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,1571.526,1573.538,"Yes, the case is Sinkler versus The Missouri Pacific."
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1573.538,1574.866,That's right.

1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1580.575,1584.355,Thank you very much.
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,1584.355,1589.081,"Our position is this, if it please the Court."
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1633.932,1635.361,Has that been challenged before this?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,1636.915,1673.891,"This problem [audio abruptly cut 27:17 - 27:43] trying to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps by saying -- because what he's doing looks like railroading, it must be railroading."
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1673.891,1679.04,"Well, now what -- is that -- reading here, I -- now I recall it but we said in Sinkler it was."
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,1699.573,1704.397,"The respondent in that case, Justice Brennan, had a non-delegable duty."
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1713.337,1718.272,And you can't turnover -- you can't escape it by turning over operational activities to somebody else.
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,1718.272,1719.138,That is correct.
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1719.138,1725.671,And you say that's not what's done here under this arrangement between this railroad and the respondent (Voice Overlap)?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,1725.671,1726.399,In our case here?
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1726.399,1726.8,Yes.
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,1726.8,1729.733,"No, that's not what's done."
1967.465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1732.312,1737.426,"But how about these railroads, some of them have their own icing operations."
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,1737.426,1739.285,Yes sir.
1967.465,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1739.285,1745.95,Are they under FELA?

1967.465,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1757.112,1757.561,Well --
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,1757.561,1762.324,I would assume that they come under the Act because they are employed by a railroad.

1967.465,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1849.219,1850.704,-- workman's compensation laws?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,1850.704,1852.301,They all come under workman's compensation.
1967.465,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1852.301,1853.175,In every state?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,1853.175,1855.199,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.465,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1935.234,1936.336,Within who's shop?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,1936.336,1937.017,Its own shop Your Honor.
1967.465,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1937.017,1938.0,Its own shop.
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,1938.0,1940.14,These locomotives never leave the shop.
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1990.198,1999.593,"Tell me Mr. Corrigan, when the Railway Express Agency, I don't think it's any longer just confined to Railway Express, I think that they do general express business now."
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2009.385,2010.817,Yes sir.
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2010.817,2013.617,"Now, they used to have cars, do they not, their own cars?"
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2013.617,2014.594,Yes sir.
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2014.594,2017.539,And did they sometimes have their own employees working on their cars?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2017.539,2018.87,Yes sir.
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2018.87,2021.205,And were there employees within or without the FELA?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2021.205,2023.229,"No sir, they were not within the Act."
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2035.348,2038.861,Was no question that Railway Express Agency was a common carrier?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2038.861,2039.58,That's correct.
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2039.58,2041.495,But it was not a common carrier by railroad.
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2041.495,2043.492,That's correct.
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2043.492,2046.453,And is that -- was that uniformly the holding as to Railway Express --
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2046.453,2046.858,That's correct.
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2046.858,2047.803,Agency employees?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2047.803,2048.833,Yes sir.

1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2056.277,2058.213,"That's in the brief, Your Honor."
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2275.553,2277.162,How about the Safety Appliance Act to get to the (Voice Overlap) --
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2277.162,2283.926,"The Safety Appliance Act does not apply, Mr. Justice Brennan to this kind of company for this reason."
1967.465,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2309.346,2314.301,But suppose the railroad does carry it and it has defective brakes --
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2314.301,2314.994,Yes sir.
1967.465,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2314.994,2318.849,-- which are in violation of the Safety Appliance Act.
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2318.849,2319.284,Yes sir.
1967.465,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2319.284,2321.65,Would the railroad be liable for an injury?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2321.65,2322.704,Yes sir.
1967.465,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2322.704,2323.708,The railroad itself?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2323.708,2325.424,Yes sir.
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2325.424,2332.626,The -- would it be liable to an employee of your company who happened to be aboard the car --
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2332.626,2332.98,With the railroad sir?
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2332.98,2334.39,-- of your company at the time?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2334.39,2335.706,Would the railroad be liable to my company?
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2335.706,2336.714,Yes.
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2336.714,2337.488,"That year,--"
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2337.488,2338.738,My com --
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2338.738,2340.645,"Well, let me ask you this way first."
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2356.628,2357.552,"No, I know --"
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2357.552,2359.715,You never did.
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2359.715,2362.349,"No, in the yard, they are right in the yard --"
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2362.349,2362.381,Yes.
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2362.381,2366.86,"-- where they're icing the car, the answer is yes.But once it leaves the yard, they don't ride the train sir."
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2366.86,2372.835,"Alright, now suppose you had a defect in violation of Safety Appliance Act in the yard?"
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2372.835,2373.498,In the Yard?
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2373.498,2375.611,Yes.
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2375.611,2377.487,We do not come under the Act.

1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2396.162,2397.031,Yes sir.
1967.465,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2397.031,2401.097,Would the railroad be liable to the person who was injured?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2401.097,2403.733,PFE employee is injured in the yard?
1967.465,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2403.733,2406.184,"Any employee, it's on this -- doing his work."
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2406.184,2407.247,Yes sir.
1967.465,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2407.247,2408.986,And there's a defective brake.
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2408.986,2410.071,Yes sir.
1967.465,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2410.071,2413.193,Would anybody be liable?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2415.022,2421.505,"The comp -- the Pacific Fruit Express, Justice Black, would be responsible to its own employee under California workman's compensation."
1967.465,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2421.505,2423.499,"Yes, but what about the railroad?"
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2423.499,2423.875,The railroad --
1967.465,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2423.875,2426.645,Is not that a non-delegable duty?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2430.367,2439.682,"If the railroad is at that moment hauling or has taken the car in its possession, the railroad then is liable to its own employees for such defects and --"
1967.465,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2439.682,2445.741,But would not be liable to the others if they were there on the basis that it's a non-delegable duty?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2445.741,2450.501,The non-delegable duty Mr. Justice Black runs only when it's your own employee.
1967.465,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2456.382,2459.113,"May I ask this question, Mr. Corrigan?"
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2502.614,2504.943,I don't know the answer to that but I have to say --
1967.465,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2504.943,2505.304,"Well, it's a (Voice Overlap) --"
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2505.304,2506.696,-- if you followed the logical --
1967.465,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2506.696,2506.719,To put it (Voice Overlap) --
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2506.719,2512.033,-- extension of my argument that if a railroad leased all of its equipment --
1967.465,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2512.033,2512.435,Yes.
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2512.435,2530.258,"-- to someone else, I think what would happen at that point Mr.  Chief Justice is that the railroad couldn't -- then would be turning over its operational activities that the totality of its operation."
1967.465,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2532.788,2547.418,But it may not -- if it doesn't test to a lesser degree that it can do that and relieve itself of responsibilities that it otherwise would have.
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2547.418,2547.621,I think that --
1967.465,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2547.621,2549.293,Now this is a pretty big operation here.
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2549.293,2550.205,Yes sir.
1967.465,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2556.038,2557.411,Where would that point be?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2557.411,2558.322,I don't know sir.
1967.465,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2565.373,2591.84,"Well, I suppose if they can do this with the Pacific Fruit Express which has -- what is something around 35 or 40% of all of this kind of traffic in the country, if it could do it for this one, it could do it for all of them who are in that same business and could it relieve itself in that whole classification with business by -- in a arrangement of this kind?"
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2591.84,2594.071,"If it was limited, I believe it could, Your Honor."
1967.465,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2594.071,2599.688,"Well, and then suppose they decided they do it with the oil business, could they do it that way?"
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2599.688,2600.421,"Well, as I say --"
1967.465,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2600.421,2618.604,"And then if they did -- could do that, could they do it with general cargo until they had made arrangement of this kind where they weren't liable for anybody's employees unless shared some of the responsibilities of the federal law?"
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2618.604,2626.271,"Well, I believe -- carrying my argument towards extension, they could do it to a certain degree."
1967.465,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2658.402,2664.353,"Well, I know, but we have to judge it by what possibilities of the Act are completely."
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2664.353,2670.631,"Now, I would like to go on though, because I was telling the Court about these cases that occurred --"
1967.465,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2670.631,2682.222,"Mr. Corrigan, I'm sorry to interrupt you again but I'm concerned because there is a short difference apparently between you and petitioner's counsel."
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2694.582,2705.331,"No, what I think I said Your Honor is that we have to maintain our equipment so that it satisfies the requirements of the Federal Safety Appliance Act, because a railroad --"
1967.465,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2705.331,2708.35,I thought you said just the opposite?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2708.35,2712.109,"I said we weren't liable under the Federal Safety Appliance Act, Your Honor."
1967.465,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2712.109,2717.281,"Well, you're subject to its terms as a matter of law not in terms of business partisans."
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2717.281,2720.156,"No, not as a matter of law we are not."
1967.465,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2726.434,2732.112,So that I should read this it is required in petitioner's brief in terms of a business matter?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2732.112,2733.426,Yes sir.
1967.465,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2733.426,2739.158,"And next, your petitioner's counsel says that your client is subject to the Railway Labor Act, is that right?"
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2739.158,2740.579,That's correct.
1967.465,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2740.579,2741.726,Railroad Retirement Act?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2741.726,2742.881,That's correct.
1967.465,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2742.881,2744.844,And the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2744.844,2746.373,That's correct.
1967.465,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2746.373,2746.436,"All right, thank you."
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2746.436,2753.237,"This is very important to my case and that's what I was just getting into now, Mr.  Justice Fortas."
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2880.334,2892.725,"Well, now Mr.  Corrigan, I've read this 12 to 14, wasn't that colloquy limited to the Pullman Company employees and express company employees with those --"
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2892.725,2893.466,Yes Your Honor.
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2893.466,2897.275,"I mean, was there any special reference to refrigerator car company in for it?"
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2897.275,2904.532,"No sir, but Your Honor -- Mr.  Justice Brennan I believe when you read that it has to be read in the context of the history I set forth."
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2904.532,2905.524,Yes.
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2905.524,2908.549,They knew about refrigerator car companies.
1967.465,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2969.901,2981.777,"We decided this case with the petitioner, would this -- would it automatically take all of these employees and all the states of the union out of the Workman's Compensation Act?"
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,2981.777,2984.887,It would Your Honor under this Court's decision.
1967.465,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3064.113,3065.794,What did the Winfield Case decided then?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3065.794,3078.623,The Winfield Case decided that the remedy for an employee of a common carrier by railroad is the FELA and it is exclusive.
1967.465,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3078.623,3080.752,Is that all it held?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3080.752,3082.452,"I believe so, Your Honor."
1967.465,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3082.452,3085.973,"Exclusive, is that just against the employer or?"
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3085.973,3087.179,"Yes, yes Your Honor."
1967.465,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3088.229,3098.074,"Yes, but that will -- could it be exclusive so far as the employer is concerned but not as against the third person?"
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3098.074,3099.077,Yes.
1967.465,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3119.277,3122.054,Am I wrong in thinking if the Winfield case --
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3122.054,3123.047,What's that sir?
1967.465,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3123.047,3132.2,Am I wrong in thinking that the Winfield case has been subjected to pretty severe criticism since that time?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3132.2,3134.17,I can say that I have found none.
1967.465,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3140.313,3142.252,And I'd like to ask you this one more question.
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3151.317,3152.53,No sir.
1967.465,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3152.53,3158.402,"So that I would suppose, maybe your best answer to that would be that you don't have that case."
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3164.308,3173.097,"Because in Sinkler it was acknowledged when -- that this man worked for the Missouri Pacific Railroad, a common carrier by railroad."
1967.465,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3174.427,3177.913,"I thought we held, I maybe wrong, I had read it."
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3187.175,3191.58,"No, he sued his own employer, if I have the Sinkler Case in mind."
1967.465,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3191.58,3192.49,Yes.
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3192.49,3193.368,Now there's one other thing --
1967.465,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3193.368,3195.173,There was another one decided right after.
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3197.279,3197.516,No.
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3197.516,3198.883,Sentilles I think?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3198.883,3203.519,There is another point I want to make here because the question was asked by the Court and is one of the --
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3203.519,3208.207,"Well actually, I gather looking at Sinkler."
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3218.443,3219.521,Right.
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3219.521,3228.374,"And the problem was whether the terminal company was an agent of the Missouri Pacific within the word agents in the Act, wasn't it?"
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3228.374,3228.934,"Yes, but you don't even --"
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3228.934,3232.154,And we said that the railroad couldn't delegate --
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3232.154,3233.398,Right.
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3233.398,3236.549,-- the operational activity there involved --
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3236.549,3236.959,Right.
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3236.959,3245.075,-- to another company and escape liability to its employee injured by the negligence of an employee of the other company --
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3245.075,3245.855,Right.
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3245.855,3246.371,-- wasn't that it?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3246.371,3246.679,Right.
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3250.766,3257.143,"Well here as I understand it though, here what we have is not so much that."
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3268.31,3268.776,Yes sir.
1967.465,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3268.776,3270.296,"That's the kind of problem this case, isn't it?"
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3270.296,3274.283,"Yes, but that reason is the next point I wanted to get to and it's this Your Honor."
1967.465,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3309.542,3312.316,Well Parden was whether a state owned railroad.
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3312.316,3313.327,Right.
1967.465,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3313.327,3316.48,"Was for the purposes of FELA common carrier by railroad, --"
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3316.48,3316.707,Correct.
1967.465,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3316.707,3317.232,-- isn't that it?
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3317.232,3325.765,"That's the correct analysis of Parden, but they choose not to follow that analysis.That was what Parden turned on."
1967.465,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3328.13,3331.47,You may finish the sentence that you are on.
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3331.47,3333.87,I just wanted to say this then if I can finish this sentence.
1967.465,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3333.87,3334.513,Yes.
1967.465,1,29410,john_j_corrigan,,3334.513,3338.459,They make a quotation from Parden and they say this in their brief.
1967.465,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3384.74,3387.391,Mr.  Werchick.
1967.465,2,17263,arne_werchick,,3387.391,3400.994,"I'd start to point out that under California Public Utilities Code 211 which is cited in our brief, the word common carrier under California law specifically includes refrigerator and car renting corporations."
1967.465,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3496.016,3502.807,"Well, what do you do with the Railway Express and the Pullman and the freight forwarders and all those?"
1967.465,2,17263,arne_werchick,,3502.807,3504.059,Taking the two cases that --
1967.465,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3504.059,3505.976,I mean how are those different from this (Voice Overlap)?
1967.465,2,17263,arne_werchick,,3505.976,3507.735,They don't operate by railroad.
1967.465,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3512.579,3525.22,"Well, Railway Express as I recall it used to have any number of its own cars, owned by it, carried by the railroads, and manned by Railway Express employees."
1967.465,2,17263,arne_werchick,,3525.22,3529.339,"In the Railway Express case, it's discussed I think from the Fifth Circuit, I'm not sure Your Honor."
1967.465,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3536.032,3537.213,How about the Pullman Company?
1967.465,2,17263,arne_werchick,,3537.213,3542.525,The Pullman Company is an anachronism as far as the Robinson versus Baltimore & Ohio Case.
1967.465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3567.238,3572.253,"Well, what does Pacific Fruit Express carry by rail?"
1967.465,2,17263,arne_werchick,,3572.253,3575.988,"Among other things, they carry three million tons of ice every year."
1967.465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3575.988,3576.059,On rail?
1967.465,2,17263,arne_werchick,,3576.059,3579.861,"They use for their own purposes.Yes, and they load and unload it at their yards and --"
1967.465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3579.861,3583.437,And how many miles of track do they have?
1967.465,2,17263,arne_werchick,,3583.437,3587.974,"That's not in the record, enough to fill up one and a half square miles in Roseville anyway."
1967.465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3587.974,3590.869,One and a half square miles of rail?
1967.465,2,17263,arne_werchick,,3590.869,3593.783,We know that there's an -- there's rail running back and forth and I could only guess --
1967.465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3593.783,3594.129,So that's (Voice Overlap) --
1967.465,2,17263,arne_werchick,,3594.129,3596.481,-- how much rail there is at Roseville alone.
1967.465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3596.481,3599.137,That makes them a carrier by rail.
1967.465,2,17263,arne_werchick,,3599.137,3599.34,Well --
1967.465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3599.34,3602.256,Pacific Express.
1967.465,2,17263,arne_werchick,,3602.256,3603.689,"Yes, Your Honor."
1967.465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3619.112,3622.742,The terminal does more than wash cars.
1967.465,2,17263,arne_werchick,,3640.517,3640.983,Again I can only --
1967.465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3640.983,3641.616,Is that right?
1967.465,2,17263,arne_werchick,,3641.616,3645.883,I -- not as I read the McCullough decision in that particular instance.
1967.465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3655.404,3665.933,What's the difference between a fruit expressed car and Pullman car insofar as being moved by rail?
1967.465,2,17263,arne_werchick,,3665.933,3668.209,I think they're both carriers in the transportation service by rail.
1967.465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3668.209,3670.659,"Oh, then you disagree with the Pullman case?"
1967.465,2,17263,arne_werchick,,3670.659,3671.737,Robin -- with the Robinson case?
1967.465,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3671.737,3672.252,Yes.
1967.465,2,17263,arne_werchick,,3672.252,3676.346,"Insofar as it might be assumed to hold that, yes."
1967.465,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3699.95,3712.713,"Mr.  Werchick, if we decide with you, do we wipe out the protection of all these 4,000 employees under the Workman's Compensation Acts of all the states of the Union?"
1967.465,2,17263,arne_werchick,,3712.713,3719.661,"Yes Mr. Chief Justice, but you bring them within the federal social legislation that covers this railroad industry in terms of pension benefits --"
1967.465,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3719.661,3720.223,I was just --
1967.465,2,17263,arne_werchick,,3720.223,3720.532,-- and injury benefits --
1967.465,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3720.532,3722.416,I was just asking if that is a--
1967.465,2,17263,arne_werchick,,3722.416,3722.629,-- but yes.
1967.465,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3722.629,3723.369,-- is the alternative.
1967.465,2,17263,arne_werchick,,3723.369,3724.829,"Yes, that's the alternative to workman's compensation."
1967.465,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3724.829,3726.662,I see.
