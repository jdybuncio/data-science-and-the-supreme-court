1971.71-227,0,41452,samuel_huntington,,24.772,28.41,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.71-227,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,381.008,398.438,"Mr. Huntington, you told us earlier that the Commission moved on several related fronts in attacking this basic problem, one adjusting the per diem and another requiring that the debris be removed from cars before they were returned."
1971.71-227,0,41452,samuel_huntington,,408.456,410.223,"No, it hasn't no."
1971.71-227,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,410.223,411.386,There have been hearings by --
1971.71-227,0,41452,samuel_huntington,,411.386,418.414,"There have been hearings but nothing has, no final action has been taken place."
1971.71-227,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1220.195,1227.883,"Mr. Huntington, how much paper work would you want to have to go through to get an exception under Rule 19?"
1971.71-227,0,41452,samuel_huntington,,1227.883,1236.454,"Under Rule 19, I believe the -- you would have to most like -- well, I am not sure this has been worked out."
1971.71-227,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1317.556,1321.489,"Very well, Mr. Huntington."
1971.71-227,1,36781,max_o_truitt_jr,,1324.196,1327.38,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.71-227,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1807.834,1811.845,These rules 1 and 2 go back how far?
1971.71-227,1,36781,max_o_truitt_jr,,1811.845,1818.448,"I believe the present per diem in Car Service Agreement, Mr. Justice Stewart, goes back to about 1920."
1971.71-227,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1827.325,1828.345,Basic structure --
1971.71-227,1,36781,max_o_truitt_jr,,1828.345,1837.961,"It is a -- it's a -- it isn't a set of instructions really, it's a statement of preference."
1971.71-227,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1886.049,1903.719,"Well under the wording, or am I wrong, under the wording of Rules 1 and Rules 2 as adopted voluntarily by the association and its members that, the Southern Pacific or whatever your road was, wouldn't have been free to do that?"
1971.71-227,1,36781,max_o_truitt_jr,,1903.719,1907.852,"Well the rules, although they may read on their face as flat --"
1971.71-227,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1907.852,1909.267,"In fact, the common law of the --"
1971.71-227,1,36781,max_o_truitt_jr,,1909.267,1910.944,"In fact, the common law of the railroad --"
1971.71-227,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1910.944,1912.317,They weren't appeared.
1971.71-227,1,36781,max_o_truitt_jr,,1912.317,1936.622,"-- is such that they have been always allowed to make common sense transportation officer good judgments about whether violation of the rules is going to move the freight and in fact, in 1967, when the current version of the AAR Rules was adopted, it was a good faith, a standard of good faith diligence was written into the rules expressively."
1971.71-227,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1942.964,1945.706,Even though its literal words might imply other way?
1971.71-227,1,36781,max_o_truitt_jr,,1945.706,1947.198,"Yes sir, that is correct."
1971.71-227,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1947.198,1961.482,"But these rules voluntarily agreed upon have not prevented box cars, freight cars, from sitting empty in one part of the country for long periods when they are desperately needed in another parts, isn't that true?"
1971.71-227,1,36781,max_o_truitt_jr,,1961.482,1964.787,"I believe there is some evidence of that in the record, Mr. Chief Justice, yes."
1971.71-227,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1964.787,1966.032,The Commission has found that in --
1971.71-227,1,36781,max_o_truitt_jr,,1966.032,1968.832,I believe it did find that.
1971.71-227,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2263.517,2275.945,"Very well, thank you Mr. Truitt."
1971.71-227,2,45404,william_m_moloney,,2277.183,2280.674,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.71-227,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2668.049,2676.624,"Mr. Moloney twice you've said for all practical purposes, this say infers for me, the reservation in part, is there any reservation?"
1971.71-227,2,45404,william_m_moloney,,2676.624,2688.351,"Well, I have to make reservations for certain things that were pointed out such as the New Haven Railroad, which we think is a very unusual situation."
1971.71-227,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2722.46,2726.686,What was the genesis of the order?
1971.71-227,2,45404,william_m_moloney,,2726.686,2732.054,The genesis of the order to return the cars to the owners.
1971.71-227,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2748.288,2752.39,Nobody wanted any change in the status quo?
1971.71-227,2,45404,william_m_moloney,,2752.39,2758.692,"No one that I know of, and I say that I mean no significant group of shippers."
1971.71-227,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3116.132,3119.738,"Mr. Huntington, you have about 9 minutes left."
1971.71-227,3,41452,samuel_huntington,,3119.738,3122.691,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.71-227,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3183.442,3189.147,Well how can you -- I am little puzzled this to how you can separate the two things.
1971.71-227,3,41452,samuel_huntington,,3189.89,3190.496,"Well I think, I think --"
1971.71-227,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3190.496,3200.076,you have (Inaudible) cars then there is and that create a pressure for more cars to meet the same demand?
1971.71-227,3,41452,samuel_huntington,,3200.076,3217.696,"Well the -- what -- I think if we look at in terms of the short range effect and the long range effect, clearly, if you are interested only in the short-term then you will want to load whatever cars are available with whatever freight to go anywhere."
1971.71-227,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3278.997,3291.485,"Mr. Huntington what type of evidence was submitted to the Commission in support of its finding that there is an acute shortage of cars, and from what sources did the evidence come?"
1971.71-227,3,41452,samuel_huntington,,3291.485,3315.5,"Well the evidence came from first from submissions to the Commission by the railroad showing that over a ten-year period from 1955-1964, the total number of freight cars in the nation had decreased particularly with respect to plain boxcars and the total aggregate capacity had also decreased."
1971.71-227,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3315.5,3318.095,Had the demand increased during that period?
1971.71-227,3,41452,samuel_huntington,,3318.095,3321.492,"The demand had decreased, but at a much lower level."
1971.71-227,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3381.549,3388.853,Was the Commission motivated to act by complaints from shippers or did it act on its own motion?
1971.71-227,3,41452,samuel_huntington,,3388.853,3392.63,It acted -- it initiated this investigation on its own motion.
1971.71-227,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3543.105,3545.014,"Thank you Mr. Huntington, thank you gentlemen."
