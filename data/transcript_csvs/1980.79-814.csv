1980.79-814,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.169,"We'll hear arguments next in Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. August."
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,102.788,104.192,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-814,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,195.407,217.633,"Now this was a Title VII lawsuit, and I know the parties to some extent and the amici to a greater extent, emphasize that it was a Title VII lawsuit, but do you think or do you not that that makes any difference with respect to the meaning of Rule 68?"
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,217.633,220.633,"I think it does not make any difference, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,227.583,231.253,"And whatever it means, it means the same thing in any federal lawsuit."
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,231.253,234.924,"--That is our position, yes, Justice Stewart."
1980.79-814,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,234.924,251.104,"What do you think the Rule 1 effect may be, if any; does the concept of Rule 1 pervade all of the rules?"
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,251.104,263.208,"I think indeed it does, Mr. Chief Justice, and as I understand it, Rule 1 says that all the rules shall be construed to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action."
1980.79-814,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,263.208,271.909,Do you think that embraces the idea that good faith offers are... that an offer must be a bona fide offer?
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,271.909,291.182,"I think the idea of good faith offer or a bona fide offer or a genuine offer or a reasonable offer has absolutely no application under Rule 68, any more than it has application as to what is a reasonable ransom request for a kidnapped child or Iranian hostages."
1980.79-814,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,291.618,292.259,Well rules are rules.
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,292.821,293.774,--the concept is applicable.
1980.79-814,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,293.774,299.959,--deal with ransom for kidnapped children but they do deal with offers.
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,299.959,316.155,"That's correct, Your Honor, and in the case of Rule 1, it says justice is one of the three aspects that we should be looking to, and in the case at hand, in May of 1977, defendant offered this plaintiff the judgment."
1980.79-814,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,328.806,330.009,The same result if you had offered a penny?
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,330.009,336.085,"--If the ultimate judgment was nothing, yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,351.923,354.327,Would you say a bad faith offer was just?
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,354.327,358.357,"--I don't think there's any such thing as a bad faith offer, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,371.04,382.082,"Well I thought your point was, Mr. Kovar, that by definition any offer that is higher than what the plaintiff eventually gets, is reasonable."
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,382.082,383.269,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,383.269,384.408,Effectively considered.
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,384.408,385.486,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,385.486,391.516,And it's only then that Rule 68 is even imaginably applicable.
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,391.516,392.531,"That is our position, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,533.662,538.611,"That is true, Mr. Kovar, that she was terminated--"
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,538.611,539.908,Yes sir.
1980.79-814,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,539.908,541.236,--and she was non-white--
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,541.236,542.157,That's correct.
1980.79-814,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,542.157,546.983,--and a majority of the stewardesses for Delta Air Lines were not terminated and were not non-white.
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,546.983,548.249,That's correct.
1980.79-814,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,548.249,552.59,"So, to that extent she made a prima facie case."
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,552.59,566.695,"I don't believe, Your Honor, with all due respect, that that would create a prima facie case; that the mere fact that an adverse employment decision affected a member of a protected minority does not, in my opinion, create a prima facie case."
1980.79-814,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,569.007,572.459,Did Washington against Davis have any implications about that?
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,572.459,583.843,"It is my recollection, Your Honor, that that involves a different level of what constitutes a prima facie case in terms of governmental actions as distinguished from private."
1980.79-814,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,583.843,585.389,That's why I said--
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,589.107,591.434,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,623.546,629.543,"Mr. Kovar, on this point, I noticed the trial lasted 25 days, was it?"
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,629.543,630.074,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,630.074,638.102,"And I don't, maybe I just don't remember, but do we have an idea of what the costs you propose to assess against the plaintiffs come to?"
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,638.102,653.347,"No sir, we do not, there was never a bill of costs submitted to the Court because of the denial of our Rule 68 motion, and all references to costs in the briefs, for that reason, are extra records, there is no reference in the record, to-wit--"
1980.79-814,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,653.347,657.299,"They would cover things like transcript costs, I suppose, at the very least?"
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,657.299,666.201,"--Well, inasmuch as no bill of costs was submitted, I don't know what particular costs the defendant would be submitting to the Court, nor--"
1980.79-814,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,666.201,669.153,Is there any reason you would ask for less than you are statutorily entitled to?
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,669.153,677.212,"--Without conferring with my client, I would not know of any reason offhand, but I certainly couldn't say."
1980.79-814,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,677.212,679.258,"I mean, it's probably several thousand dollars?"
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,679.258,683.022,"Yes, I think there's--"
1980.79-814,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,683.022,685.1,"Do you know, for example, whether you are seeking attorneys fees?"
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,685.1,686.13,--I do not know that.
1980.79-814,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,686.13,700.515,"But you would take the position, I take it, that as a matter of statutory law you would be entitled to ask for them as costs under the Title VII case; to that extent, this may be a different Title VII factor may make a difference have."
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,700.515,712.806,"Well I believe that I've seen the number of 40, I've seen the number of 75 different pieces of litigation which called for the possibility of attorneys fees as being imposed in certain actions."
1980.79-814,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,784.64,791.122,"In this respect, you don't have to defend the idea of a $1.00 offer, do you?"
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,793.169,794.73,$450.00--
1980.79-814,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,794.73,795.261,$450.00.
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,795.261,795.949,--plus costs.
1980.79-814,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,795.949,797.37,"--plus costs, so that--"
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,797.37,801.291,"That's correct, Your honor."
1980.79-814,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,825.296,826.843,--Mr. Kovar--
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,826.843,828.156,"Yes, Mr. Justice?"
1980.79-814,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,828.156,833.95,"--what, in your offer, what did the term costs include?"
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,836.152,837.573,Well it included--
1980.79-814,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,837.573,839.182,Did it include attorneys fees up to that point?
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,839.182,840.151,"--No, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,845.93,853.957,"In round figures, would you give us some idea of what the costs would mean, $10, $50, $100?"
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,853.957,860.579,"At that point there were of course some filing fees and there was one, I believe, one deposition."
1980.79-814,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,860.579,864.624,"So that, as I understand that--"
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,864.624,869.107,"Whatever costs the Court might attribute in those, would include the additional costs."
1980.79-814,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,869.107,880.165,"--There is an assertion here that counsel spent up to the time of your offer some 39 hours, and that her hourly rate was $50."
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,881.165,891.269,"It's not in the record, Your Honor, we did... we did very much question the inclusion of that in the presentation to this Court."
1980.79-814,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,903.811,928.459,"Well and also, I take it, if this were not a Title VII action, but simply a personal injury action, and not a contingent fee action, an attorney could have put in 1,000 hours, thinking that he had a real blockbuster of a lawsuit and declined your tender, and gotten a defense verdict from the jury."
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,928.459,932.08,"That's quite possible, Your Honor; that's quite possible."
1980.79-814,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,969.38,971.534,"Mr. Kovar, let me interrupt."
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,995.665,1006.302,"Well my comment, Mr. Justice Blackmun, would be that that certainly is one of the situations in which the rule would apply."
1980.79-814,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1050.473,1057.954,"Well if the discretion is not exercised the prevailing party is awarded costs, isn't he, under Rule 54?"
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,1057.954,1064.185,"--Yes, the rule says of course, the prevailing party should receive costs except--"
1980.79-814,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1064.185,1065.06,Except where otherwise ordered.
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,1065.06,1065.529,--Yes.
1980.79-814,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1100.749,1105.31,"Mr. Kovar, I take it from your answer that you don't buy the Dodge remark?"
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,1105.31,1106.06,I do not.
1980.79-814,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1106.06,1124.676,"Is it not correct that under your view of Rule 68, if a defendant, defense bar routinely made a $10 settlement offer in every case, that would have the effect of taking away the discretion of the judge under Rule 54 if the defense had ultimately prevailed?"
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,1128.019,1130.3,"I believe that's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1143.139,1153.273,"If that is a correct reading of the rule, how do you explain the fact that it's taken so long for the defense bar to realize that rule was there, and had that potential benefit?"
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,1153.273,1156.46,"That I think is very difficult to understand, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1161.973,1171.642,I suppose it's possible that they read the words Mr. Justice Blackmun's suggestion a moment ago.
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,1171.642,1183.401,"--Or it may well be that they relied upon the courts, the federal courts, following Rule 54(d) rather than exercising discretion and denying costs to the prevailing defendant."
1980.79-814,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1373.888,1384.384,"I take it that what you're saying is that if the system wants a good faith component in the rule, the rule should be rewritten?"
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,1384.384,1386.32,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1413.498,1414.217,Very well.
1980.79-814,0,22631,e_allan_kovar,,1414.217,1414.654,Thank you.
1980.79-814,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1414.654,1418.807,Ms. Vance.
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,1418.807,1427.726,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-814,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1493.139,1506.461,"Ms. Vance, am I to understand that, by your emphasis on the fact that this was a Title VII action, that the construction you urge of Rule 68 is applicable only in Title VII cases?"
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,1506.461,1516.192,"The construction... what I am saying is that the cost provisions in Title VII is what applies in this case, not--"
1980.79-814,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1516.192,1516.817,Not Rule 68?
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,1516.817,1517.66,--That is correct.
1980.79-814,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1520.908,1524.501,"And that Rule 68 is what, simply inapplicable in Title VII actions?"
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,1524.501,1524.844,--That is correct.
1980.79-814,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1526.968,1533.872,"But your proceeding is an action in the federal courts, is it not?"
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,1533.872,1535.918,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1535.918,1544.383,"So how do you get around the provision of Rule 1, that these rules shall apply to all suits in the federal courts?"
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,1544.383,1558.424,"These rules shall apply to all suits in federal courts, but I submit that in the application of those rules, it was not the intent that the cost provision of Title VII be disturbed."
1980.79-814,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1562.579,1569.405,"This wasn't the basis for the judgment below, was it?"
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,1569.405,1572.669,"No, Your Honor, the judgment below--"
1980.79-814,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1572.669,1574.715,"And you are seeking to support it on another ground, then?"
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,1574.715,1576.309,"--Yes I am, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1576.309,1580.291,And wouldn't this give you more relief than you got below?
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,1581.166,1582.79,"No, I don't believe it would, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1593.02,1594.721,Yes.
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,1605.937,1606.857,"In Title VII cases, that's correct."
1980.79-814,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1606.857,1612.309,"And that the Court below would have thought it would, it was applicable if there was a fair offer?"
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,1612.309,1617.183,It said that the offer was not reasonable--
1980.79-814,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1617.183,1617.745,Well that's--
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,1617.745,1618.495,--And I submit that one--
1980.79-814,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1618.495,1620.697,--That's on the assumption that 68 applies?
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,1620.697,1621.963,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1621.963,1626.352,"That's a considerably different result, if we sustained your--"
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,1626.352,1626.54,I understand that.
1980.79-814,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1633.975,1637.363,--Did you argue below that 68 did not apply to Title VII actions?
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,1637.363,1639.066,"I don't believe we did, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1639.066,1641.175,"Well did you argue that way in your brief, here?"
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,1641.175,1642.378,"Yes, we did, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1643.454,1648.764,Then your point two is by its terms Rule 68 applies only to plaintiffs who prevail?
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,1648.764,1650.718,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1657.964,1658.824,Right.
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,1658.824,1663.478,--which is their... the cost provisions of Title VII is the applicable--
1980.79-814,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1663.478,1670.148,"I understand that, but I didn't... as I read your brief, I didn't realize you were completely abandoning the application of Rule 68 to your case."
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,1670.148,1672.802,"--No, Your Honor, I am not abandoning it."
1980.79-814,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1688.171,1690.513,Then you defend the Court of Appeals decision?
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,1690.513,1691.935,"Right, that's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1691.935,1700.541,"Well I just, may you raise the argument you are now making?"
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,1700.541,1701.728,"I believe so, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1701.728,1704.149,"That it does not apply, even though you have not raised it until now?"
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,1704.149,1709.147,"I raised it in my brief, Your Honor, yes I believe it further supports the argument."
1980.79-814,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1752.191,1768.95,"Well what if this had been an anti-trust case, that took you exactly the same amount of time, 25 days, and it consumed exactly the amount of time in attorneys fees?"
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,1772.839,1784.944,"No, I would think that Rule 68 would apply, but I think the question of whether the offer of $450... whether that offer was reasonable would have to be raised."
1980.79-814,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1920.529,1925.684,So you say a take nothing judgment then is not a judgment less favorable?
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,1925.684,1927.964,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1972.586,2004.714,"But would it make any sense, so far as the drafters of Rule 68 are concerned, to say that if the plaintiff prays for $10,000 in damages and gets only $8,000 in damages and has been offered that amount previously, then the defendant gets costs; but if the plaintiff gets nothing, the defendant is not allowed costs?"
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,2004.714,2019.786,"You see what would happen if you allowed the rule to operate that way, is it will totally destroy any of the discretion contained in Rule 54(d) with respect to the defendants that prevail."
1980.79-814,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2075.92,2086.259,"Well then why do you need Rule 54, if Rule 68 is interpreted the way you say it should be?"
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,2086.259,2095.349,Because Rule 68 applies to where a party prevails but wins less than the offer.
1980.79-814,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2124.509,2134.989,But Rule 54 allows the District Court to disallow costs to the prevailing party in its discretion.
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,2134.989,2136.364,"For special reasons, that's right."
1980.79-814,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2140.94,2166.54,"So without 68 at all, the District Court could have disallowed costs here, if... finding that the prevailing party for any number of reasons, was not entitled to them."
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,2166.54,2167.788,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2213.755,2226.782,"Well if there's... suppose this is a class action and there are 100 thousand people in the class, an offer of a penny to each of those 100 thousand people is not an insubstantial amount of money."
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,2226.782,2239.901,"Then, Your Honor, I submit that the Court, if the Court's going to apply the rule, then the Court has to address the question of whether the offer was reasonable."
1980.79-814,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2426.467,2434.932,"Ms. Vance, may I ask whether the record shows that fee arrangement with plaintiff's counsel was a contingent fee arrangement?"
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,2434.932,2439.665,It does not show... the record does not show.
1980.79-814,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2453.472,2454.409,You file this prior to trial?
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,2454.409,2462.624,"You file it at the time you begin the lawsuit, at the time you file your complaint, you are required to file any contingent fee arrangement."
1980.79-814,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2462.624,2465.28,If it's not in the record I suppose that's the answer.
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,2465.28,2465.702,That is correct.
1980.79-814,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2465.702,2466.874,It's in the public record.
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,2469.17,2470.123,Filed in the District Court.
1980.79-814,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2470.826,2473.605,Well may we judicially notice if you tell us about it?
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,2473.605,2476.996,"--I don't know, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2524.101,2531.675,"Before you sit down though, since the... whatever statement you filed is a matter of public record, that we can notice, will you tell us what it is?"
1980.79-814,1,42199,susan_m_vance,,2531.675,2532.238,Yes.
1980.79-814,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2554.838,2556.541,Very well.
1980.79-814,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2556.541,2564.788,Mrs. Stillman.
1980.79-814,2,23204,elinor_hadley_stillman,,2564.788,2567.115,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-814,3,22631,e_allan_kovar,,3382.959,3386.536,"Frankly, Your Honor, I do not believe I will require all of the time--"
1980.79-814,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3386.536,3387.02,Very well.
1980.79-814,3,22631,e_allan_kovar,,3388.551,3389.722,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3389.722,3391.581,May I ask you a question at the outset?
1980.79-814,3,22631,e_allan_kovar,,3399.154,3401.763,"We were unaware of it until today, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3401.763,3406.84,Was that because you didn't look at the record or because it wasn't there when you made the offer?
1980.79-814,3,22631,e_allan_kovar,,3406.84,3411.729,"It was not my understanding that it was available as a matter of open record, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3411.729,3415.102,Is that the general practice at the Chicago bar?
1980.79-814,3,22631,e_allan_kovar,,3415.102,3429.347,"It is, to my knowledge, Your Honor, it is not a matter of public record as to what the fee arrangements are between clients and... I frankly was unaware of it until counsel announced this morning."
1980.79-814,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3429.347,3430.986,That's not the rule in Virginia.
1980.79-814,3,22631,e_allan_kovar,,3430.986,3434.422,"I'm afraid I'm unacquainted with that, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3434.422,3438.498,"You're not professing surprise, are you?"
1980.79-814,3,22631,e_allan_kovar,,3438.498,3449.448,"I am not professing surprise that there was a contingent arrangement between counsel and plaintiff, I assumed that, but I was unaware of what the arrangement was until this morning."
1980.79-814,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3513.453,3518.045,Except insofar as the word obtain may have some coloration.
1980.79-814,3,22631,e_allan_kovar,,3518.045,3525.666,"--I think the only other place that the word obtain is used in the rules, to my knowledge, is in Rule 56 having to do with declaratory judgments."
1980.79-814,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3539.599,3542.613,"Generally, obtain is to get something that you've sought."
1980.79-814,3,22631,e_allan_kovar,,3542.613,3548.33,"--To obtain a judgment, which may be for you or against you, it is a judgment."
1980.79-814,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3552.343,3557.42,Let's hear a response to the claim that your offer did not cover costs.
1980.79-814,3,22631,e_allan_kovar,,3557.42,3560.792,We submit that the offer specifically did include costs.
1980.79-814,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3589.766,3599.058,"So your $450 of costs, except for attorneys fees, were to be covered in addition to the $450?"
1980.79-814,3,22631,e_allan_kovar,,3599.058,3600.167,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1980.79-814,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3719.526,3720.088,Thank you counsel.
