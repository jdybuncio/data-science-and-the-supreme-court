2013.11-965,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.67,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-965, Daimler AG v. Bauman."
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,8.873,17.026,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.11-965,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,50.262,51.95,Do we have to reach that question?
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,59.087,60.478,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2013.11-965,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,60.478,65.21,"Now, are there -- were there California cases that disregarded the -- the corporate forum?"
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,65.21,68.708,California respects the corporate forum.
2013.11-965,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,78.142,84.343,"But the jurisdictional inquiry is conducted on the basis of the California statute, isn't it?"
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,84.343,90.075,"It is, but at the same time, the California statute extends to the limit of due process."
2013.11-965,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,95.729,96.213,I see.
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,105.71,106.569,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2013.11-965,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,106.569,120.002,"There's nothing in the Constitution, is there that would prohibit a State from adopting a rule that a parent is responsible for any acts of a wholly-owned subsidiary?"
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,120.002,139.243,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there may be a constitutional limit; certainly to the extent that, say, California adopted a rule that said for purposes of some sort of liability, we are going to disregard the corporate forum, I think that could pose due process concerns to the extent that it is purporting to override, say, the corporate law of Delaware."
2013.11-965,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,139.243,158.487,"Well, even on a prospective basis, your brief talks about notice and fairness and predictability; but if California said going forward, this is the rule that we're going to apply, is there any constitutional problem with that?"
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,158.487,160.956,"I -- I still think there would be, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.11-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,186.522,188.444,We permitted that in Container Corp.--
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,188.444,188.99,"--I beg your pardon, Your Honor?"
2013.11-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,188.99,201.86,--We permitted that in Container Corp. We permitted California law to tax the parent California corporation for the earnings of all its foreign subsidiaries.
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,205.375,214.512,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, typically this Court has applied a less rigorous due process standard in the tax cases than it has in the personal jurisdiction cases."
2013.11-965,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,233.848,247.217,"We would never get to this question if you hadn't conceded that there is general jurisdiction over the U.S. subsidiary, over -- what is it -- MBUSA."
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,247.217,252.356,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I respectfully disagree that we conceded the point below."
2013.11-965,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,268.239,273.487,"But if there were nothing to attribute, then that would be the end of it."
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,281.781,282.578,"--Yes, it would."
2013.11-965,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,286.686,295.261,But you didn't -- we can't resolve it that way since you -- you didn't challenge the general jurisdiction over the subsidiary.
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,295.261,298.666,"--Well, again, we did not argue that point."
2013.11-965,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,301.276,302.276,Mr. Dupree -- I'm sorry.
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,302.522,311.522,"--I was going to say, Your Honor, at the same time, I do think that that notion, that MBUSA was subject to general jurisdiction in California, was necessarily part of the Ninth Circuit's holding."
2013.11-965,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,317.802,331.545,"And, Mr. Dupree, even if you waived that point, if I understand it correctly, you did not waive the point that even with all attribution in the world, there still is no general jurisdiction over Daimler."
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,341.181,343.103,"Justice Kagan, that is exactly right."
2013.11-965,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,343.103,362.126,"So in that sense, it really doesn't depend on the attribution standard, all these hard questions of is it an alter ego test or is it an agency test and how does the Constitution relate to State law, because we could apply any test we wanted, and there still wouldn't be general jurisdiction over Daimler in California."
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,362.126,366.311,"Justice Kagan, that certainly would be an acceptable route for this Court to resolve the case."
2013.11-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,388.82,388.914,Is that a reasonable--
2013.11-965,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,388.914,397.208,How do foreign -- foreign countries resolve this attribution question?
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,408.642,415.559,"By and large, Justice Scalia, most other countries respect the corporate forum and that includes parent/subsidiary relations."
2013.11-965,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,415.559,416.512,By and large?
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,417.7,432.521,"I'm not aware of anyone who disrespects it; and, in fact, our amici talk at length about how California's exercise of general jurisdiction in this case would not be appropriate in virtually any other nation."
2013.11-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,435.988,437.285,How do we deal with that?
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,503.447,509.023,"Well, I think the way this Court should deal with the Ninth Circuit in this case is simply to reverse it, Your Honor."
2013.11-965,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,509.023,516.16,I understand that that's what you would like as the bottom line.
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,517.098,525.876,"The chain of reasoning, Your Honor, is simply that California, like all States, generally respects the corporate form, certainly with regard to liability determinations."
2013.11-965,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,544.508,562.142,Suppose -- but suppose we had a case of an accident on a California highway injuring California people and they sued charging that the Mercedes Benz was defectively manufactured.
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,568.718,581.899,"--If it were the case Your Honor hypothesized, I think there may well be specific jurisdiction available, depending on whether Daimler purposefully availed itself of the California forum."
2013.11-965,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,581.899,582.852,And what does that mean?
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,585.585,586.445,Right.
2013.11-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,625.945,626.537,--Counsel--
2013.11-965,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,626.537,633.785,"Well, there was injury in the forum and it was caused by defective manufacturing abroad."
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,637.893,642.485,"Well, certainly courts have exercised specific jurisdiction in that situation."
2013.11-965,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,655.042,662.726,"Well, how -- how would you answer Justice Ginsburg's question if you were writing the opinion in your favor?"
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,673.363,674.268,Well--
2013.11-965,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,674.268,678.298,"If you're going to answer the hypothetical in an opinion, how would you -- what would you say?"
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,678.298,686.935,"--Well, I think I would go back to what this Court has articulated, first of all, is the standard for specific jurisdiction, which is purposeful availment or purposeful direction."
2013.11-965,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,688.56,704.948,"Well, Daimler has purposely availed itself of California jurisdiction by establishing the sub that -- that operates there by establishing Mercedes U.S., that it operates there."
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,704.948,706.439,"--Well, Mercedes--"
2013.11-965,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,706.439,712.071,So -- so creating a subsidiary is not availing itself of jurisdiction?
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,712.071,722.471,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, I think in some cases a subsidiary's work could give rise to specific jurisdiction, but I think that's not necessarily true across the United States in all cases."
2013.11-965,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,722.471,722.952,I agree.
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,735.323,751.863,The answer I would give is that in Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical the foreign parent could be subject to specific jurisdiction if it purposefully availed itself of the forum and that very well could be an inquiry that turns on the subsidiary's activity.
2013.11-965,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,751.863,760.782,"And my question is whether or not by creating Mercedes U.S., Daimler didn't purposely avail itself of the forum?"
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,760.782,762.314,"I don't think it did, Justice Kennedy."
2013.11-965,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,762.314,762.876,Because?
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,762.876,776.371,"Because I don't think there is any evidence in this record that suggests that by creating a subsidiary that does business generally, it was purposefully targeting California."
2013.11-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,776.371,777.152,--Mr.--
2013.11-965,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,777.152,777.886,Mr. Dupree--
2013.11-965,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,777.886,797.785,"If we agree with you -- if we agree with you that the test should be whether the subsidiary is an alter ego of the parent, would that depend on the -- the law of the particular State in which the suit is brought or would it be based on some general understanding of alter ego liability?"
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,797.785,811.436,"Justice Alito, I think the best test would be to look to State law for guidance, precisely because that is the law that commercial actors throughout our country typically would look to, to determine whether or not they might be in a veil-piercing situation."
2013.11-965,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,811.436,817.87,"That would mean that due process would mean something different potentially in California and New York, for example."
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,819.355,819.465,"Well, I'm not sure, Your Honor."
2013.11-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,834.584,843.642,"--Where else have we done it in the personal jurisdiction context, define the limits of the due process, Federal due process in accordance with State law?"
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,843.642,844.72,Well--
2013.11-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,844.72,849.905,"Didn't we create tests in International Shoe, in Burger King separate from State law?"
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,849.905,857.638,"--The test this Court created in International Shoe, I think, is probably best characterized as a Federal common law test."
2013.11-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,876.192,889.499,So what do we do with all the amici briefs that points to countless articles that talk about the corporate veil-piercing as the most arbitrary of State laws out there?
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,889.499,891.248,"--Well, I'm not sure--"
2013.11-965,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,891.248,898.901,"I don't know how -- how corporations get any sense of comfort from a law that's so irrationally applied, according to some."
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,898.901,904.743,"--Well, I think some of the amici, candidly, may overstate the purported confusion."
2013.11-965,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,934.153,939.135,"Counsel, I've been looking for the text of the California jurisdiction statute."
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,941.572,942.76,I believe it's--
2013.11-965,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,942.76,944.024,Is it in your brief?
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,949.163,951.162,"--Well, we'll provide the cite to Your Honor."
2013.11-965,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,951.943,952.24,I don't want the cite.
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,953.959,955.849,--I will--
2013.11-965,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,955.849,957.567,That's what briefs are supposed to have--
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,957.567,958.27,--Right.
2013.11-965,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,958.597,962.362,--all -- all of the significant statutes that -- that relate to the case.
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,962.362,963.19,--Right.
2013.11-965,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,967.844,969.61,I don't have the California Civil Code.
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,971.717,973.309,It is in the briefing.
2013.11-965,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,981.37,986.523,But it does -- it does provide for the exercise of jurisdiction to the limits of due process.
2013.11-965,0,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,986.523,987.851,"That's exactly right, Justice Ginsburg."
2013.11-965,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,999.661,1001.207,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.11-965,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1010.188,1013.187,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.11-965,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1043.627,1053.327,Could you tell me why we just don't rely on the tests we apply in the tax cases?
2013.11-965,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1095.795,1121.378,"But in the instance you're talking about in taxation -- and this is related to a question the Chief Justice asked -- the due process clause does not itself prohibit a State or the Federal government from attributing substantive liability, for example, from a -- from a subsidiary to a parent, or, in the case of taxation, of choosing to look at the entire enterprise of which the parent corporation is the head."
2013.11-965,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1131.062,1131.203,California--
2013.11-965,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1131.203,1139.512,"--reflect a general determination that in all circumstances, the acts of the nation or the acts of a subsidiary should be attributed to the parent."
2013.11-965,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1142.575,1159.333,"Well, in the situation of individuals, does the -- does the due process rule regarding taxation of individuals by a State align with the -- the ability of somebody to sue that person in the State?"
2013.11-965,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1183.917,1184.573,No.
2013.11-965,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1184.573,1186.198,--claim that arises against them anywhere?
2013.11-965,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1186.198,1187.055,No.
2013.11-965,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1236.865,1257.591,"Mr. Kneedler, what do you think about this, that -- you know, as I've been looking through these cases, it seems to me that all these attribution issues and the conflict about attribution arises because courts generally have an improperly broad understanding of general jurisdiction and don't quite understand the distinction between general and specific jurisdiction."
2013.11-965,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1271.054,1272.492,Probably not.
2013.11-965,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1307.039,1308.039,But that was -- that was conceded.
2013.11-965,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1318.989,1319.001,--Yes.
2013.11-965,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1319.001,1322.3,And a party can always consent to jurisdiction.
2013.11-965,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1322.3,1322.8,Yes.
2013.11-965,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1348.991,1357.77,"Just as a way of getting you to state your general theory of the case, let me ask you: Do you have a recommendation as to whether or not we should remand this case?"
2013.11-965,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1365.376,1367.0,It -- it does not.
2013.11-965,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1368.656,1369.843,And that is because?
2013.11-965,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1369.843,1370.656,--Yes.
2013.11-965,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1418.26,1430.115,"Under tradition, if you have the universe of agent and principal, an independent contractor, is the subsidiary of the latter or is it something -- is it some third -- some third animal?"
2013.11-965,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1430.115,1433.911,"I think -- I think in this case -- again, we don't have any reference to -- at all--"
2013.11-965,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1433.911,1441.096,"Generally, if you have a -- a corporate parent and a subsidiary, do we usually think of a subsidiary as an agent?"
2013.11-965,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1441.096,1442.111,"--No, you do not."
2013.11-965,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1442.111,1443.939,Do we think of it as -- what do we think about it as?
2013.11-965,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1446.438,1447.922,It's an independent entity.
2013.11-965,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1468.788,1473.161,"Well, you don't -- you wouldn't have any doubt, would you, in the hypothetical that I pose."
2013.11-965,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1491.123,1507.18,"I -- I would think so, particularly given the -- given the agreement in this case which obligates Daimler to market throughout the 50 States, and the volume of sales that are directed to the United States, some major portion of which is expected to be and intended to be in California."

2013.11-965,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1529.561,1530.029,Right.
2013.11-965,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1534.59,1535.325,What would have to be--
2013.11-965,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1535.325,1535.871,If I could make a point.
2013.11-965,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1535.871,1544.931,--What would have to be true for MBUSA to be Daimler's agent with respect to general jurisdiction?
2013.11-965,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1550.225,1555.644,I think -- I think MBUSA would have to be acting on behalf of Daimler.
2013.11-965,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1580.166,1582.978,"--I mean, in most agency relationships, titles stay with the principal."
2013.11-965,1,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1594.441,1599.938,"--Well, I -- under this agreement, MBUSA is -- acts independently."
2013.11-965,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1601.892,1612.637,It seems an odd thing to say given the page and a half that the lower court went through on the various ways in which Germany controls this subsidiary.

2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,1713.082,1713.519,That's right.
2013.11-965,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1719.768,1725.953,"Yes, but, Mr. Russell, it's usually -- it doesn't lead to good results when you assume something that is obviously in error."
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,1752.535,1755.971,"Well, that might be a reason then for this Court to dismiss this case as improvidently granted."
2013.11-965,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1760.72,1764.5,"Really, suppose I think that this was crying out for an en banc."
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,1779.79,1780.665,That's right.

2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,1788.74,1792.005,That's because Petitioners didn't raise that question en banc.
2013.11-965,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1794.145,1795.222,And they didn't raise these--
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,1795.222,1796.379,--And they did not raise these questions.
2013.11-965,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1796.379,1801.548,"But, Mr. Russell, they did talk about Daimler wasn't subject to general jurisdiction."
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,1833.364,1837.065,"Well, with respect, Justice Kagan, it's not as easy as you seem to think it is."
2013.11-965,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1861.492,1862.539,What was the year of that decision?
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,1862.539,1863.477,That was 1898.
2013.11-965,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1864.226,1868.366,"Yes, but the thinking about jurisdiction has changed enormously since then."
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,1868.366,1876.971,"--But my point is that this Court in Perkins, which is quite a long time after International Shoe, cited to Barrows as an example of a paradigmatic example."

2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,1976.058,1979.212,"--Because Petitioner, again, didn't make that argument, either."
2013.11-965,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1979.212,1982.274,--Now we're -- look at the odd thing.
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2062.023,2078.095,"This case has been litigated on the interpretation of the California statute that says that California intended, notwithstanding what rules it applies for liability, to exercise personal jurisdiction to the furthest extent permitted by the Constitution."
2013.11-965,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2098.198,2104.897,"So you think, in other words, that California has abolished -- I mean, California says there is no corporate insulation?"
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2113.161,2116.347,California wants to go as far as the Constitution would permit.
2013.11-965,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2116.347,2118.394,The answer then to my question is yes.
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2128.53,2130.825,"Not that there is unlimited liability, but that the exercise--"
2013.11-965,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2130.825,2133.231,"Well, you can bring a lawsuit, unlimited liability."
2013.11-965,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2133.231,2133.901,"Well, Mr.--"
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2133.901,2136.619,--Because the statute at issue doesn't speak to liability.
2013.11-965,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2138.76,2145.881,"--Mr. Russell, is it clear that the California law regarding corporate liability would apply to all of your claims?"
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2145.881,2147.584,No.
2013.11-965,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2147.584,2149.021,"You have Federal claims, you have Argentine claims; isn't that correct?"
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2149.021,2151.894,That's correct.
2013.11-965,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2151.894,2153.191,But California law controls personal jurisdiction.
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2159.548,2161.609,"No, it certainly wouldn't."
2013.11-965,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2164.421,2182.866,"Well, but why should we -- now that the Federal claims are out -- I mean, when you started the suit you had a claim under the Alien Tort Statute, you had a claim under the Torture Victims Protection Act, but now those Federal claims are out and we are left with a claim under California law and Argentinian law."
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2192.003,2200.015,"Well, certainly we agree that if this case were remanded to the district court it would have discretion to refuse to exercise supplemental jurisdiction."
2013.11-965,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2200.015,2218.383,"Wouldn't it be arbitrary for it to exercise personal jurisdiction when there is no Federal claim and the case involves foreign plaintiffs injured abroad, allegedly due to the activities of a subsidiary operating abroad?"
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2218.383,2220.96,"Ultimately, we don't think so."
2013.11-965,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2269.504,2276.626,"Yes, but that test that you just -- the sufficiently purposeful availing, those are all specific jurisdiction questions."
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2276.626,2277.689,--With respect--
2013.11-965,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2277.689,2279.439,And not general jurisdiction questions.
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2279.439,2281.827,"--With respect, I don't think that's correct."
2013.11-965,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2293.524,2302.037,And Goodyear distinguished the two by saying general jurisdiction means it's equivalent to residence for an individual.
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2321.28,2326.169,I understand that there are very serious and important questions with respect to what it means to be at home in a State.
2013.11-965,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2341.021,2355.203,"Well, I understood the concession as being, that if Mercedes were the only corporation involved in this dispute, there would be specific -- sufficient contacts."
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2356.734,2358.437,That is--
2013.11-965,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2358.437,2362.326,I'm -- I'm not so sure that this concession is that troublesome for Daimler.
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2362.326,2362.826,--No.
2013.11-965,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2370.995,2372.932,So how does that answer the question about Daimler?
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2372.932,2375.18,"--Well, because there's been one forfeiture as well."
2013.11-965,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2377.444,2378.444,There has been one--
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2378.444,2379.631,"--Forfeiture, as well."
2013.11-965,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2389.346,2390.831,"Well, any claim arising anyplace in the world."
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2390.831,2392.299,That's right.
2013.11-965,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2405.638,2415.664,--But I think their concession is quite consistent with the proposition that the distinction between parent and subsidiary is meaningful for jurisdictional purposes.
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2439.154,2441.872,--That's right.
2013.11-965,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2451.355,2471.158,"Mr. Russell, does it not follow from -- from your argument that a Federal court should entertain a suit against the shareholders of a foreign corporation when that foreign corporation has sufficient contacts in California?"
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2471.158,2472.236,"--No, I don't think it does."
2013.11-965,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2472.236,2472.923,Why--
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2472.923,2477.281,But the question ultimately is whether it's fair to say that the defendant has sufficiently benefitted from--
2013.11-965,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2477.281,2479.545,--Why is it any less fair?
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2479.545,2486.825,"--Because unlike a shareholder, a parent company enjoys not only the economic benefits of the subsidiary's activities--"
2013.11-965,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2486.825,2487.84,Don't the shareholders?
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2487.84,2488.215,--They enjoy a partial.
2013.11-965,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2497.883,2498.539,Don't the shareholders?
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2498.539,2499.258,"--No, they don't."
2013.11-965,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2507.255,2510.645,"Well, I can't see a distinction."
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2519.985,2520.813,"Well, I don't think--"
2013.11-965,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2520.813,2523.437,--if you're the Ninth Circuit.
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2523.437,2524.828,--I don't think that's right.
2013.11-965,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2546.739,2552.081,But if you go -- if you go back to the -- to the foundation case of International Shoe.
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2590.113,2591.363,--That's right.
2013.11-965,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2623.801,2624.738,"That is my problem, and I don't know what to do."
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2683.67,2691.526,"Well, Justice Breyer, if you think -- if you think that the -- the proper resolution of a case like this turns on issues that were not preserved below and have not been argued here, then you can do one of two things."
2013.11-965,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2691.526,2692.213,--What?
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2692.213,2700.772,You can dismiss the case as improvidently granted or you can decide the case on the assumptions upon which it's been litigated and make clear that you're doing that.
2013.11-965,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2700.772,2714.329,"Well, another thing we could do is we could say we've decided now two cases that seem to bear on this, and one is Goodyear and the other is Kiobel; and we could say we'll send it back for consideration of this case in light of those."
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2714.329,2721.358,We would have no problem with that if you made clear that it was open to us under remand to argue that they didn't preserve these arguments.
2013.11-965,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2723.046,2724.123,You just--
2013.11-965,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2724.123,2724.951,I'm sorry.
2013.11-965,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2724.951,2726.404,--You mentioned Kiobel.
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2730.216,2737.68,"We are not prepared to concede that at this point, although we recognize we have an uphill struggle to fit ourselves within the exception that's been left."
2013.11-965,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2752.596,2772.791,"If this is as -- as Justice Breyer and I seem to think, a question of State law, don't you think it's extraordinary that the Ninth Circuit could make such a significant holding on -- on California law without -- there is a certification procedure in California, isn't there?"
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2772.791,2774.385,"There is, although--"
2013.11-965,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2774.385,2796.563,"So why -- why wouldn't they have asked the California Supreme Court whether -- whether this jurisdiction statute was meant to alter corporate law or, you know, tort law, or, you know -- just imagine any change in law that would bear upon jurisdiction, and all those changes must be assumed to have happened."
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2802.435,2802.87,--Sure.
2013.11-965,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2805.029,2806.215,Is it too late to ask it now?
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2806.215,2809.089,--It wouldn't be if you sent it back.
2013.11-965,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2860.459,2883.731,"If we assume for the sake of argument that there isn't a preservation issue regarding this in-home -- this at-home question, why shouldn't the rule be that unless a corporation is incorporated in the jurisdiction or has its principal place of business in the jurisdiction, the -- the acts of the subsidiary are not attributable unless it's an alter ego."
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2900.958,2903.644,"--Just to be clear, there are two parts to that rule."
2013.11-965,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2924.329,2926.172,What is the additional thing?
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2926.172,2937.434,"--That we will only apply that rule if the contacts, if I understand Justice Alito's proposal, we only apply that rule if the contacts in the State are through a subsidiary."
2013.11-965,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2952.506,2976.573,"You did say in your brief that recognizing that other nations are highly critical of our expansive, one-time expansive, notion of doing business as a basis for general jurisdiction, you say that that shouldn't be taken into account as a basis for constitutional decisionmaking."
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,2995.379,3008.843,"I don't know that you can't take it into account at all, but I will say that the constitutional test is whether it's consistent with traditional notions of fairness and justice, meaning traditional American notions of substantial fairness."
2013.11-965,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3008.843,3025.928,"Mr. Russell, how would you make the argument, and again with Justice Alito, sort of putting these waiver questions aside for a second, a German corporation incorporated in Germany, headquartered in Germany, 2.4 percent of its sales are in California."
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,3044.748,3046.388,I would say a couple things.
2013.11-965,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3054.526,3056.275,It's 2.4 percent of its sales.
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,3059.228,3070.159,--But the problem is a corporation shouldn't be jurisdictionally better off simply because it's bigger than its competitors who are smaller and therefore necessarily do a bigger portion of their business in a smaller number of places.
2013.11-965,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3094.853,3102.913,"If it is subject to general jurisdiction in California, is it subject to general jurisdiction in all 49 other States?"
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,3102.913,3110.128,I think there would still be a question of whether -- they would be able to raise the arguments that they haven't raised in other jurisdictions.
2013.11-965,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3118.78,3126.45,"So everybody is subject to general jurisdiction in like California and New York and Florida because they are big markets, but no worries about, you know, Delaware?"
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,3126.45,3128.433,That may be the result.
2013.11-965,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3128.433,3129.999,That's a bad example.
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,3131.109,3140.574,That may be the case if -- the Court has always recognized that doing business is enough.
2013.11-965,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3173.076,3176.216,Isn't that exactly what Goodyear held?
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,3176.216,3177.293,--No.
2013.11-965,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3189.459,3204.454,"There would hardly be room for a decision next to Goodyear that says, oh, for general jurisdiction purposes it's enough that you have some subsidiary operating in the State."
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,3215.371,3219.182,"Well, again if I can just respond to that idea."
2013.11-965,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3235.021,3237.784,But people can be only one place at a time.
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,3237.784,3239.205,--But they go a lot of places over time.
2013.11-965,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3269.115,3276.129,"If this 2.4 percent figure is important, wouldn't we get into impossible line-drawing problems?"
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,3278.519,3281.689,"Well, you do get into line-drawing problems in this area."
2013.11-965,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3284.626,3289.047,"You think it should be billions of dollars, right, that percentage, right?"
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,3289.047,3290.672,I think billions of dollars is enough.
2013.11-965,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3290.672,3294.263,So we've got to pick a dollar amount rather than a percentage.
2013.11-965,2,33951,kevin_russell,,3294.263,3295.935,"Well, you have to pick some metric."
2013.11-965,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3318.597,3320.674,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.11-965,3,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,3324.142,3326.33,Just a few brief points.
2013.11-965,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3354.882,3355.507,Do you really care how we do it?
2013.11-965,3,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,3370.892,3373.203,"--Well, Justice Sotomayor--"
2013.11-965,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3373.203,3379.669,The other side -- neither you or the other side have argued that there isn't a reasonableness component.
2013.11-965,3,42633,thomas_h_dupree_jr,,3389.931,3392.664,"--Well, yes, Your Honor, I think we do."
2013.11-965,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3543.284,3543.465,"Thank you, counsel."
