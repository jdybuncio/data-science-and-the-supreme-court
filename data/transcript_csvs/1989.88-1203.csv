1989.88-1203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.946,"We'll hear argument now in Number 88-1203, Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. v. Richard Sperling."
1989.88-1203,0,32665,john_a_ridley,,10.298,15.02,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,81.045,86.238,"Would they... would the Plaintiffs eventually have been able to get that by discovery anyway, do you think?"
1989.88-1203,0,32665,john_a_ridley,,86.238,97.155,"Your Honor, that is uncertain, and of course, the district court here entered its order exclusively on the basis of facilitating the solicitation of claims."
1989.88-1203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,97.155,99.208,Without treating it as a discovery matter yet.
1989.88-1203,0,32665,john_a_ridley,,99.208,100.588,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,121.912,123.555,Did you say they did three things?
1989.88-1203,0,32665,john_a_ridley,,124.556,127.856,"Well, Your Honor, the court did three things--"
1989.88-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,127.856,132.241,"It ordered the names, it ordered the... it authorized the notice--"
1989.88-1203,0,32665,john_a_ridley,,132.241,132.972,--That is correct.
1989.88-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,134.174,134.654,--And what else?
1989.88-1203,0,32665,john_a_ridley,,134.654,141.059,And it put its imprimatur on the notice which was to be sent out.
1989.88-1203,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,141.059,145.651,Did the Plaintiffs pay for the notice?
1989.88-1203,0,32665,john_a_ridley,,145.651,148.284,They would have paid for the notice.
1989.88-1203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,156.191,158.825,"Mr. Ridley, we have a good microphone system here."
1989.88-1203,0,32665,john_a_ridley,,161.179,163.049,I apologize for the Court.
1989.88-1203,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,202.245,212.851,"Mr. Ridley, you don't refer, I think, to Rule 16 of the Federal Rules in your brief."
1989.88-1203,0,32665,john_a_ridley,,228.742,248.787,"Your Honor, there has never been a suggestion as I recall it in the papers below that that rule would govern the situation, and I submit that that would be a rule which would involve the regulation of the action by the district court, as opposed to the facilitation of the joinder of new parties not necessary to the action into the action."
1989.88-1203,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,286.902,295.117,"Would they then, do you think, have any information bearing on ADEA?"
1989.88-1203,0,32665,john_a_ridley,,295.117,297.188,"I am sorry, Justice, I did not hear."
1989.88-1203,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,297.188,299.071,"Would they have any information, do you know?"
1989.88-1203,0,32665,john_a_ridley,,299.071,301.252,The potential opt-ins?
1989.88-1203,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,301.252,301.582,Yes.
1989.88-1203,0,32665,john_a_ridley,,301.582,302.594,May have information.
1989.88-1203,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,304.766,305.635,Uh-huh.
1989.88-1203,0,32665,john_a_ridley,,305.635,310.49,But that does not make them necessary parties to the action.
1989.88-1203,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,310.49,340.571,"Well, if they had information sufficient so that a discovery order were issued requiring the... the employer to divulge the names and addresses of all the affected employees, and if that is a given, in other words, would the court not then have power to condition the discovery request on the transmission of notice that the court approved?"
1989.88-1203,0,32665,john_a_ridley,,340.571,351.707,"Justice, we submit that there is nothing in the rules which would provide for disclosure for this purpose, and the purpose was expressly--"
1989.88-1203,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,351.707,364.727,"No, no, I am assuming, because Mr. Justice Brennan asked you if these other parties might not have some information, I am assuming that in a case, a court would find that the names and addresses of all the affected employees are discoverable."
1989.88-1203,0,32665,john_a_ridley,,364.727,365.488,--Your Honor--
1989.88-1203,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,365.488,377.388,"Could the court then, as a condition to its discovery order, impose restrictions setting forth the kinds of statements that should be made to the employees if a mailing went out?"
1989.88-1203,0,32665,john_a_ridley,,377.388,395.007,"--Justice, I believe that if there were a discovery order which was appropriate under the federal rules governing discovery, I think that the court would and should enter a protective order against the utilization of that information for the purpose of solicitation."
1989.88-1203,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,395.007,398.152,"Well, is that consistent with our Shapero case?"
1989.88-1203,0,32665,john_a_ridley,,407.468,407.898,"No, Your Honor."
1989.88-1203,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,426.072,438.378,"But you just answered my question by saying that you think the court, if the names and addresses of all the employees were disclosed by discovery, could prohibit the use of that list for solicitation."
1989.88-1203,0,32665,john_a_ridley,,444.114,454.88,"--Your Honor, I believe that the Plaintiffs could use a list which they got for valid purposes of discovery to obtain information from non parties."
1989.88-1203,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,463.006,467.149,"Well, I won't take too much longer, but I am assuming that it is properly discoverable."
1989.88-1203,0,32665,john_a_ridley,,483.77,498.38,"--Justice, only if the court has a basis for believing that that discovery would be used for solicitation purposes would the court then, I believe, find it appropriate to enter the protective order that it not be used for that sole purpose."
1989.88-1203,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,532.432,540.279,I think Justice Kennedy's question is perhaps directed to the at least implication of your statement that solicitation is a bad word.
1989.88-1203,0,32665,john_a_ridley,,540.279,540.669,"Oh, no."
1989.88-1203,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,553.889,564.444,"--[inaudible] the court, that is... to get the names and addresses of the people even though those people may have information that would be useful--"
1989.88-1203,0,32665,john_a_ridley,,564.444,566.237,"--That is correct, Justice."
1989.88-1203,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,1797.295,1805.621,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1859.456,1863.099,"The courts can do anything that, that is, is not barred."
1989.88-1203,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,1863.578,1864.509,"That is our position, Your Honor."
1989.88-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1864.509,1865.51,--That is the rule we operate.
1989.88-1203,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,1872.406,1891.049,"We would agree that the Roche approach is incorrect, but we are prepared for purposes of the argument today to play into Roche's rules that we have an affirmative obligation and we have met our affirmative obligation, and that there... and that there is affirmative standing in the statute and in the rules and in the legislative history for what we propose--"
1989.88-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1891.049,1903.538,"Suppose... suppose a court has before it a case involving a train wreck, in which there are a lot of injured people, no special statute governing this train wreck like the Age Discrimination Act."
1989.88-1203,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,1927.834,1928.926,--I'd like to add to that question two parts.
1989.88-1203,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1943.609,1943.969,--Now--
1989.88-1203,1,34447,leonard_n_flamm,,1943.969,1945.309,And for that reason--
