2004.04-70,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,0.0,11.6,We will now hear argument in two different cases: Exxon Mobil against Allapattah and Ortega against Star-Kist Foods.
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,16.225,20.062,"Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-70,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,220.188,247.309,"Mr. Phillips, before you proceed to going on to (b), the... you have set up a dichotomy between a Federal question case where, as long as you have a Federal question claim in the case, you qualify within those words, of which the district courts have original jurisdiction."
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,316.04,336.352,"--I... I don't think that's the right conclusion to draw from those cases, Justice Ginsburg, because what happened is by the time that... those cases got to this Court, the jurisdictional problems had been solved and the Court was faced with a question... with what I perceive to be purely a remedial question, is what do you do in terms of trying to put the omelette back into the egg at that point when the litigation has gone forward."
2004.04-70,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,347.126,348.119,I thought the Court said that--
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,348.119,348.285,--and continues--
2004.04-70,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,348.285,350.72,--I thought the Court didn't say they were ignoring it.
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,352.827,369.007,"--Well, it... it's curable in the sense that you can eventually excise out portions of the case, but what you cannot do is... is allow the case to go... it remains still jurisdictionally barred to proceed forth with parties who are not properly before the court."
2004.04-70,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,389.729,390.638,They didn't start over in Caterpillar.
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,390.638,391.547,I'm sorry.
2004.04-70,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,391.547,399.266,"The Caterpillar didn't start over and Newman-Green wasn't detected till appeal, but the appeals court didn't say start over."
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,399.266,406.508,"No, I understand that the Court's ultimate remedy in both of those cases was not to do a do-over, but you also have to remember... I mean, I think there are two questions here."
2004.04-70,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,435.469,437.615,"But why can't it make an adjustment in this case, Mr. Phillips."
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,437.615,438.442,"--I'm sorry, Justice Stevens."
2004.04-70,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,438.442,441.043,Why can't it make an adjustment in this case?
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,441.043,444.015,"The... well, the... and the question is what adjustment should it make."
2004.04-70,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,449.382,450.785,But why is that the minimum?
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,456.646,475.472,"And that takes you back to what the district court ruled in Zahn and... and, in effect, what this Court affirmed in Zahn, which is that there's a fundamental difference between sort of finding a single, individual plaintiff and saying, you know, this person, if you could just excise that claim, drop it under rule... that person under rule 21, that fixes it."
2004.04-70,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,481.871,491.259,"Well, but you do have cases where a complaint is filed seeking to be a class action and then the district judge does not certify the class and the case, nevertheless, goes forward."
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,492.828,499.144,"--Well, that would... one of the alternatives on the table... I think it is appropriate... is for the Court to excise the class action allegations--"
2004.04-70,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,499.144,499.621,Right.
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,499.621,504.701,--and dismiss the entirety of the class and proceed forth solely in the name of the four individual plaintiffs.
2004.04-70,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,504.701,504.905,"Well, maybe."
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,511.321,513.45,I think the Court has the authority to do that.
2004.04-70,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,540.283,557.084,"I don't... I don't follow that entirely, Mr. Phillips, because the... Exxon lost at... at this trial, and preclusion doctrines... that means that Exxon had one full and fair opportunity to defend."
2004.04-70,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,577.229,586.434,"In other words, you'd have the same issue of preclusion problems if you had done the case from the beginning the way you contend it ought to have been done."
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,586.434,590.621,"Well, I... I think the case should never have been allowed to go forward except with the named plaintiffs."
2004.04-70,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,591.076,599.809,"But I mean, Justice Ginsburg's point is you... you... even with a... a few properly named defendants, you're going to have the same issue preclusion problem."
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,599.809,605.836,"Well, not... but... but it's a much more complicated issue preclusion problem because the question is, is there jurisdiction?"
2004.04-70,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,610.212,624.701,"Well, if it's under the language of section 1367, I think it makes more sense to say the court has original jurisdiction over the action, but lacks original jurisdiction over the defective claims."
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,630.524,631.472,--I... I would--
2004.04-70,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,631.472,645.672,And I hope you will address the fact that Congress very recently has enacted legislation that makes all this in the future at least non-objectionable.
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,645.672,648.661,"--Well, it doesn't eliminate it completely, Justice O'Connor."
2004.04-70,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,659.336,660.262,"Right, and it's not retroactive."
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,660.262,661.11,--But it's not retroactive.
2004.04-70,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,706.647,711.226,Unless 1367 effectively overturned Zahn.
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,711.226,712.135,--And--
2004.04-70,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,712.135,713.084,It was enacted later.
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,713.084,729.885,"--It clearly was enacted later, but my point here is that I think the language... when the Congress both in (a) and (b) harkens back to in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, it's clearly not trying to amend 1331 or 1332."
2004.04-70,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,729.885,742.517,"Well, it's not... the weakness in your point, I think, as I... as I understand it, which is a very optimistic assumption, given the complexity here--"
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,742.517,744.624,I hope that's not a criticism of the writing.
2004.04-70,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,744.624,753.995,--is... is that you want to read (a) as if it applies to arising-under jurisdiction and not to diversity jurisdiction.
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,768.667,769.394,No.
2004.04-70,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,769.394,771.995,"If you add that plaintiff, you don't get the original... that's not right?"
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,771.995,773.071,"No, that's not right, Justice Breyer."
2004.04-70,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,773.071,773.41,All right.
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,773.41,776.043,"The... the... you know, the traditional case."
2004.04-70,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,783.118,783.352,Yes.
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,783.352,786.696,That is a civil action of which district courts have original jurisdiction.
2004.04-70,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,791.525,792.184,Yes.
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,792.184,805.355,You bring in the insurer in a third party... in a third party claim under rule 14.
2004.04-70,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,818.003,823.693,"So... so, in... in other words, in that situation, it's a third party claim by the defendant against another person."
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,823.693,824.047,Yes.
2004.04-70,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,825.267,827.003,So that's then... that does fall within (a).
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,827.003,828.322,--Absolutely falls within (a).
2004.04-70,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,828.322,832.492,And then (b) knocks it out insofar as the plaintiff wants to assert a claim.
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,832.492,832.781,Exactly.
2004.04-70,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,832.781,835.093,But that person can assert a claim against a plaintiff.
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,835.093,835.464,Exactly.
2004.04-70,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,837.322,838.27,"So that, you say, is the answer to what I was going to ask--"
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,838.27,839.179,Which is?
2004.04-70,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,839.179,841.63,--which is why didn't they just use the word 1331.
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,849.227,849.582,Right.
2004.04-70,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,849.832,850.254,All right.
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,850.254,851.068,There's another one that fits--
2004.04-70,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,851.068,861.349,"So the other thing, of course, is if these three professors who wrote this had... had figured this out so well, why in heaven's name didn't they at least write an article about it so we'd know what we were doing?"
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,861.925,869.151,"--Well, my guess is if they did, you probably wouldn't want to rely on it as the authoritative source for interpreting the language of the statute in any event."
2004.04-70,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,869.151,882.897,"--What you're saying, Mr. Phillips, I think is that 1367 does nothing with regard to what was in the old days at least 1367(a), what was called ancillary jurisdiction."
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,888.72,890.122,Pendent party jurisdiction.
2004.04-70,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,890.122,905.809,"So... so you could have appendant parties, but what was once known as ancillary jurisdiction, applicable in diversity cases, was not changed at all by 1367(a)."
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,907.955,908.576,"Well, no."
2004.04-70,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,935.697,939.206,"But whether you... whether you call it codify or anything else, there would be no change."
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,975.078,998.195,"The only way I would just... you know, the only point I would make with respect to that is that I do think that in Finley this Court's opinion cast some doubt on the entire pendent and ancillary jurisdiction doctrines, and I think that 1367(a) is clearly designed to... to eliminate that issue going forward because it says there is a role."
2004.04-70,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1041.458,1056.13,"So what... what is the language in 1367(a) that effects any... any change in diversity jurisdiction, what was once called ancillary jurisdiction?"
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1057.683,1058.548,"--Well, I... I would go back--"
2004.04-70,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1058.548,1063.749,"You may... you may say that there's a confirmation of what was, but there's no change."
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1063.749,1078.505,"--Well, it just depends on whether you accept as a given that the third party claim and other multi-party litigation was clearly going to fall within the Court's ancillary jurisdiction without the benefit of an express statutory provision granting that authority."
2004.04-70,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1083.44,1084.926,I thought that's what Kroger was about.
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1092.168,1092.728,--Right.
2004.04-70,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1092.728,1096.793,But that you did not need diversity between the defendant and the third party defendant.
2004.04-70,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1096.793,1105.071,"Right, but the... the question is what was the statutory authority for that part of... for the first part of ancillary jurisdiction, which is the bringing in of the third party defendant."
2004.04-70,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1110.811,1113.306,Mr. Long.
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1122.7,1124.186,"Yes, Justice Stevens."
2004.04-70,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1220.575,1229.12,And then you say the civil action has to give... be diverse as to all claims.
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1229.12,1231.266,"Well, yes."
2004.04-70,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1237.005,1237.832,Over every claim... every claim in the class.
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1237.832,1238.169,--Yes.
2004.04-70,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1238.169,1243.692,"Now, in... in City of Chicago, we did not give that meaning to the term civil action."
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1247.203,1247.984,Exactly.
2004.04-70,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1247.984,1252.321,But then I would say then you're asking us to interpret civil action differently in two statutes.
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1252.321,1253.452,"No, I don't think so."
2004.04-70,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1280.018,1286.705,"No, but they also use the term, civil action, and it seems to me that your interpretation of the two differs if... if the City of Chicago--"
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1286.705,1287.243,--Well--
2004.04-70,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1287.243,1287.986,--is... is correct.
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1287.986,1289.556,"--Well, but I think it's the same answer."
2004.04-70,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1352.237,1358.803,"Then what you're saying is that this statute, as far as class actions go, changed nothing."
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1358.803,1364.603,"--Well, of course, our case is not a class action, but... but we would say that--"
2004.04-70,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1364.603,1368.484,"Or party joinder, which is your case."
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1368.484,1369.022,"--Or... yes, exactly."
2004.04-70,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1387.06,1391.518,Strawbridge has become less hallowed in light of the new congressional enactment.
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1393.997,1395.855,--I didn't bring--
2004.04-70,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1395.855,1397.091,Class Action Fairness Act.
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1397.091,1398.577,--Class Action Fairness Act.
2004.04-70,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1412.656,1422.565,"Well, I understand in 2005 Congress doesn't necessarily express what was before, but it... it seems to me there's an institutional judgment that Strawbridge is not that hallowed a... a principle."
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1422.565,1435.569,"--Well, I... I think you could fairly say the... the new statute reflects a judgment by Congress that in these class actions of national importance, which meet certain requirements, minimal diversity should be sufficient."
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1486.754,1490.925,"What... what is the... can you... this is something I should know, but I don't know."
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1522.997,1523.619,"Yes, but that--"
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1523.619,1523.991,--against a third party.
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1528.077,1529.275,--The way... the way this was understood to work--
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1529.275,1529.73,Yes.
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1529.73,1536.667,"--and it's in... and this is the answer to the point that, well, there can never be any supplemental jurisdiction on our view in a... in a diversity case."
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1547.691,1547.996,I understand that.
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1548.184,1560.982,"--Well, before... this... this is exactly an excellent example because it's one of the few things that was clearly changed by 1367, and it was changed in the direction of narrowing the... the jurisdiction."
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1570.436,1570.641,Yes.
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1570.641,1573.242,--but they were coming in on their own... that was allowed.
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1576.686,1576.957,Okay.
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1583.273,1583.506,Yes.
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1584.266,1584.654,"He can do it, though."
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1584.654,1585.502,--It... it would be allowed.
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1586.495,1586.988,And what about under rule 19?
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1586.988,1590.21,"Under rule 19, the rule was that you couldn't do it even if--"
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1590.21,1590.582,You could not?
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1590.582,1595.123,"--You could not, and the idea was this was getting too close to the Kroger problem--"
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1595.123,1595.988,And rule 20 you could not?
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1595.988,1597.102,--Could not.
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1597.641,1599.043,And rule 24 you could.
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1599.043,1604.039,--The Kroger problem is if you... you certainly couldn't put in these nondiverse parties in the initial complaint.
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1661.542,1665.629,"The difficulty, I guess, is that I'm having is let's imagine rule 19 or 24."
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1665.629,1666.538,--Okay.
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1666.538,1672.566,"Now, you're saying that is an instance where, if you bring the party in and he destroys diversity, you're out."
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1674.711,1680.49,"Well, what would happen is... I mean, you wouldn't get to that stage, Justice Breyer, because you wouldn't let the... the court would not let the party in."
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1680.49,1680.861,Okay.
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1680.861,1682.347,And sometimes you have to dismiss the case--
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1682.347,1693.083,"So there... before this statute, there never is going to be a circumstance in which you bring in a person under rule 19 and diversity is destroyed."
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1693.083,1695.722,"--Right, because you won't let them in."
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1698.134,1698.694,Okay.
2004.04-70,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1700.43,1702.659,"I don't understand what you mean, sometimes you'll have to dismiss the entire case."
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1702.659,1706.374,If... if it turns out that the party is indispensable under rule 19.
2004.04-70,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1706.374,1707.012,"Oh, is indispensable."
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1707.012,1723.092,"Then... then what's confuse... now, we look at 1367(b) and it says the district court shall not have supplemental jurisdiction over a claim by the plaintiff against a rule 19 person who is brought on the defense side."
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1723.092,1724.001,Right.
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1724.001,1730.03,"Where the inconsistent... i.e., it would be nondiverse, but you said there couldn't be such a situation."
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1730.03,1732.38,"Well, I... I may have misspoken."
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1760.494,1769.865,"Michigan plaintiff against Iowa defendant, necessary party, Michigan defendant, rule 19."
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1778.782,1783.157,"--I think that... well, I think that's correct, if the... at least if the plaintiff was trying to bring it in."
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1786.834,1787.105,All right.
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1788.237,1789.101,--give you the exactly right--
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1789.101,1791.413,--because it's very easy to me to reach the outer limit of my understanding.
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1791.413,1793.188,"--Well, it would be easy for you to reach it with me."
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1808.215,1809.785,You could have before this statute.
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1809.785,1810.106,Right.
2004.04-70,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1912.446,1913.355,But not all.
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1917.813,1918.101,Yes.
2004.04-70,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1918.101,1918.845,The defendant--
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1918.845,1919.383,Yes.
2004.04-70,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1919.383,1920.226,--can have a--
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1920.226,1936.76,And I'm thinking again this all... I think this all traces back to Owen Equipment in this rationale that we're not going to allow evasion of the requirements of complete diversity in matter-in-controversy by the plaintiff.
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1980.106,1980.461,No.
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1982.335,1982.911,Yes.
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1982.911,1985.429,--under rule 14 joined another person.
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1985.429,1985.801,Yes.
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1985.801,1987.824,And then person X wanted to join--
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1987.824,1988.296,Yes.
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1988.296,1990.032,--that part of the action--
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1990.032,1990.237,Yes.
2004.04-70,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1990.237,1992.921,"--that could be a 19, 20, or 24."
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,1992.921,1993.104,Exactly.
2004.04-70,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2109.083,2122.458,"--If we descend from the level of parsing the... the statute to what's going on in these cases, in your cases I take it there was an injury to a child."
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2122.458,2123.035,--Yes.
2004.04-70,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2123.035,2126.75,And that qualifies under the amount-in-controversy.
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2126.75,2127.372,Yes.
2004.04-70,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2127.372,2137.896,"And her mother or sister and, I think, father wanted to come in and... and bring claims that were entirely derivative of the injured child's claim."
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2137.896,2138.889,That's correct.
2004.04-70,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2138.889,2148.548,"And on your reading of 1367, there's the... the... there's no accommodation for that."
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2164.44,2173.152,"Well, I mean, it's not... it's... that is the rule of Zahn and Clark that has been the rule for many decades."
2004.04-70,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2194.821,2201.797,"Well, what a legislature might think, well, now this Finley has... we've been... taken care of that."
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2248.98,2251.292,"Well, you've made a number of points."
2004.04-70,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2263.552,2275.895,"But if you... does it make sense to have a rule that says we're going to ignore the citizenship of the members of the class for diversity purposes, for diversity of citizenship?"
2004.04-70,1,39797,robert_a_long_jr,,2286.67,2294.639,"Well, in... in the class action context... and again, my case is not a class action... I frankly can't explain how you reconcile Ben Hur and Zahn."
2004.04-70,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2465.537,2467.478,"Thank you, Mr. Long."
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,2472.679,2476.106,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-70,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2606.609,2608.572,Are you talking about a claim mover?
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,2609.398,2618.853,"Any claim, Your Honor, that's brought in in a third party practice, any claim that's brought in an additional party claim is part of the same civil action."
2004.04-70,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2723.537,2746.117,"I imagine that if you filed a claim and the plaintiff was a class and the class contained a number of people who did not meet the jurisdictional minimum and they file a claim against a defendant in a diversity suit, I imagine the first thing the judge would say would be, I've read Zahn and we don't have jurisdiction over this action."
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,2746.117,2746.367,Indeed.
2004.04-70,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2747.686,2749.422,"Yes, that was prior to the statute."
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,2774.601,2775.073,--I'd--
2004.04-70,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2775.073,2777.862,"And since that's what the statute says, that's what it means."
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,2777.862,2778.045,--Well--
2004.04-70,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2778.045,2786.944,It means that this kind of a situation does not fall within 1367(a) because there was not jurisdiction over that action.
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,2793.427,2798.75,"--Isn't it interesting, Your Honor, that what drove 1367 was this Court's decision in Finley?"
2004.04-70,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2812.662,2812.828,"No, no."
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,2824.345,2826.408,"--Justice Breyer, I... I agree that--"
2004.04-70,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2826.408,2826.863,All right.
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,2833.839,2834.461,--Let... let me tell you--
2004.04-70,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2834.461,2838.297,But... but I... I want to know what is the answer to that point.
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,2838.297,2839.662,"--Well, I... I was going to agree and disagree."
2004.04-70,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2888.209,2889.324,"--Mr. Stearns, there's a difference."
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,2898.612,2906.208,"Indeed, Your Honor, but if their argument was correct, that the civil action bundled the claims, as they suggest, then Zahn was wrongly decided."
2004.04-70,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2933.801,2940.472,"I think they... what... the argument that I heard was not that all the claims have to be aggregated, but that they can't get in the door."
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,2940.472,2943.156,"--Their... well, Your Honor, respectfully, Congress created two doors."
2004.04-70,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2981.96,2994.426,"But I don't see... where I'm starting from this... because at some point I'd like you to get to the... the virtue of their position in my mind at the moment is, one, it is consistent with the language, which says civil action, not claim."
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3015.685,3015.885,--Well--
2004.04-70,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3015.885,3018.736,"So at some point, I would appreciate your addressing that."
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3018.736,3020.798,"--Well, and I appreciate that, Your Honor, because let me start with the first premise."
2004.04-70,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3048.334,3052.505,The Federal... the Federal Study Committee was divided on Zahn issues.
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3052.505,3053.164,--But--
2004.04-70,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3053.164,3056.342,They... they didn't make a recommendation one way or another on it.
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3056.342,3059.397,"--That's partially correct, but significantly incorrect, Your Honor."
2004.04-70,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3066.167,3069.883,"Yes, and the whole committee said we do not want to take a position on Zahn."
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3069.883,3071.946,"Respectfully, Your Honor, you have to follow it through."
2004.04-70,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3080.435,3080.741,I thought the--
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3080.741,3081.688,It goes to the full committee.
2004.04-70,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3081.688,3084.577,--I thought the committee report said we do not intend to overrule Zahn.
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3084.577,3084.949,No.
2004.04-70,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3088.376,3092.124,Did not the House committee report say we do not intend to overrule Zahn?
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3092.124,3093.084,What the House committee--
2004.04-70,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3093.084,3093.355,Did it?
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3094.608,3096.094,--The House report--
2004.04-70,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3096.094,3096.799,Am I correct or--
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3096.799,3099.361,"--yes, said we do not intend to overrule Zahn, Your Honor."
2004.04-70,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3099.361,3103.941,"--Right, and that was also the same report that was filed in the Senate proceedings as well."
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3103.941,3105.881,"Well, it is the report that was filed in the Senate."
2004.04-70,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3108.688,3109.059,Right.
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3109.059,3113.312,"--which I think everybody has concluded are mutually exclusive positions, but that's what it said."
2004.04-70,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3128.257,3130.486,I think... I think you're overstating what they say in the article.
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3130.486,3143.61,"Well, Your Honor, respectfully, what we do have is undisputed fact here because if you see Judge Weis' conclusion, for example, Judge Weis is one of the people who has adopted one of the opinions opposing our view of... of this position."
2004.04-70,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3143.61,3145.097,He was the chair of the--
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3145.097,3145.43,He was.
2004.04-70,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3155.211,3157.728,Are you sure he said that?
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3157.728,3159.109,"--He does, Your Honor, and what he says is--"
2004.04-70,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3159.109,3159.752,Where did he say that?
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3159.752,3162.436,"--He says it in a footnote, and he says he was unhappy--"
2004.04-70,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3162.436,3163.179,In a footnote to what?
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3163.179,3165.658,--To his opinion in this... in the decision.
2004.04-70,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3177.008,3179.693,That's in an opinion written after the statute was adopted.
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3179.943,3180.193,"--Yes, sir."
2004.04-70,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3181.884,3193.856,"When he did this thing... when he was trying to write this statute, he seemed fixated on one thing, Kroger, and... and (b) seems to reflect an effort to make... put in statutory form Kroger."
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3193.856,3200.997,"--To put it in context, the subcommittee of the Federal Courts Study Committee says Zahn is bad law and doesn't make any sense, which by the way, respectfully, I think it is."
2004.04-70,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3209.459,3215.775,"No, but they do say in no event should the enclosed materials be construed as having been adopted by the committee."
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3215.775,3216.314,Precisely.
2004.04-70,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3228.407,3235.754,"--Mr. Stearns, one of the things that we do know was that Congress intended to make a modest change."
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3246.983,3248.097,"Well, let's take those points."
2004.04-70,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3254.088,3261.246,"Well, if... if you have a statute with a clear meaning, I agree with you, but this statute seems to be a bit of a muddle."
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3274.809,3284.302,"--Your Honor, respectfully, if we look at the changes that were adopted in 1367, not a single one of the ones you're hearing argued today anybody can seriously argue are significant."
2004.04-70,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3296.645,3302.218,"It... it does... to the extent that Strawbridge is involved, it... it is a big--"
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3302.218,3314.356,"--Your Honor, respectfully, this Court has been looking the other way on Strawbridge for 200 years, and what Congress did was ratify some of your previous abrogations of Strawbridge and they made another minor adjustment."
2004.04-70,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3323.932,3324.182,Wait.
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3327.154,3327.73,--The whole--
2004.04-70,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3327.73,3330.619,Can you just... you said it doesn't make any difference.
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3333.691,3334.518,--Indeed.
2004.04-70,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3334.518,3337.844,But they can't remove the action unless it could have been there in the first place.
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3337.844,3338.15,Precisely.
2004.04-70,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3338.15,3355.511,"And therefore, this interpretation, if you're overruling Zahn, would have made a big difference because it would have meant the defendants could have brought a lot of cases into Federal court by the removal, and you would have seen the plaintiffs bar up in arms if, in fact, this provision would have allowed for easier removal."
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3355.511,3356.133,"Your Honor, respectfully--"
2004.04-70,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3356.133,3358.855,--As... as indeed they were in the Class Action Fairness--
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3358.855,3359.227,--Yes.
2004.04-70,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3445.79,3447.155,--They haven't overruled Snyder.
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3453.432,3457.352,--But Snyder was a class action case that says you cannot aggregate claims under 1332.
2004.04-70,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3543.107,3545.686,"That's not a direct quote of the House report, I might find out."
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3545.808,3546.822,--I'm sorry?
2004.04-70,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3546.822,3549.134,I say that's not a direct quote of the House report.
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3549.134,3551.53,"I paraphrased, Your Honor."
2004.04-70,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3577.452,3583.729,Do you think they were being intellectually honest in their Law Review or do you think... accuse them of something other than honesty in what they said?
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3583.729,3600.281,"Justice Stevens, I think whether it is or not, it demonstrates the mistake of relying upon something other than what's in the plain language of a statute because once you begin to encourage that kind of game to be played, then how would you have a trial over whether these professors were being honest or not?"
2004.04-70,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3681.067,3685.236,"But do you agree that if they're right on the interpretation of 1367, the judgment has to be reversed?"
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3685.236,3701.007,"There is no judgment, Your Honor, because the district court was well aware of the issue that existed here, notwithstanding his disagreement with some other courts, and he refused to enter judgment until the claims process went through where it was determined whether each claimant was above or below the jurisdictional amount."
2004.04-70,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3710.788,3711.986,Let me modify the question.
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3715.496,3719.377,"--There's no case that is... that would support that outcome, including the cases they cite."
2004.04-70,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3719.377,3719.583,"Your answer is no, I gather."
2004.04-70,2,23242,eugene_e_stearns,,3719.583,3720.204,The answer is no.
2004.04-70,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3748.894,3749.554,"Thank you, Mr. Stearns."
2004.04-70,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3751.412,3774.817,"Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court:"
2004.04-70,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3868.895,3872.61,I... I don't know what you mean when you say they... they don't destroy complete diversity.
2004.04-70,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3877.357,3877.811,"--No, no."
2004.04-70,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3888.502,3890.693,You're talking about geographical diversity--
2004.04-70,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3890.693,3891.014,--Yes.
2004.04-70,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3891.014,3891.657,--not jurisdictional.
2004.04-70,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3891.657,3892.3,Correct.
2004.04-70,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3913.272,3924.706,But I don't understand the distinction that you're making between diversity of citizenship and amount in controversy since 1332 includes both.
2004.04-70,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,3949.226,3949.886,"Correct, Your Honor."
2004.04-70,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4012.839,4014.531,"Well, they're saying what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander."
2004.04-70,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,4024.19,4025.016,"Correct, Your Honor."
2004.04-70,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4025.016,4026.835,And they say you can't do that under the statute.
2004.04-70,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,4054.532,4054.921,Well--
2004.04-70,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4054.921,4056.474,"Now, you respond to that what?"
2004.04-70,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,4056.474,4056.929,--I... I will.
2004.04-70,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4177.345,4185.723,"Well, you... you could say the same thing about... about a... a second claim that destroys diversity."
2004.04-70,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,4194.928,4196.043,"Well, it does, Your Honor."
2004.04-70,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4196.043,4196.786,"I mean, no, I doesn't."
2004.04-70,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,4200.584,4216.271,"Well, I'll... I'll give you an example of a situation that is often trotted out as a problem under our reading of the statute, and we think... the irony of it is, I think, none of the parties actually think it's a problem, and I certainly don't, and that is, the problem of a rule 20 plaintiff who is not listed in (b)."
2004.04-70,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4261.308,4276.168,"Exactly, but that's the reason for saying that... look, as I understand it... and this is... the... the thing that got me thinking they may have a point here is A, B, and C are dealing with three separate problems."
2004.04-70,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,4283.97,4285.706,"Well, we... we disagree with that."
2004.04-70,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4285.706,4287.525,The second problem B is simply Kroger.
2004.04-70,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,4341.062,4344.778,"Well, I... we agree entirely with the first part of what... what Your Honor has said."
2004.04-70,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4401.331,4407.73,"Mr. Ayer, let... maybe I'm going to oversimplify to the point of the absurd but let me try it."
2004.04-70,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,4455.673,4456.749,"That is correct, Your Honor."
2004.04-70,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4456.749,4456.871,--Okay.
2004.04-70,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,4456.871,4457.326,That is correct.
2004.04-70,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4616.336,4620.422,"See, that... that's what I thought was their view of... of (b)."
2004.04-70,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,4629.134,4629.627,--Right.
2004.04-70,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4629.627,4630.992,--getting a defendant.
2004.04-70,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,4648.925,4649.091,Right.
2004.04-70,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4649.091,4654.126,And so (b) was Judge Weis' effort to make sure that was codified.
2004.04-70,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,4657.348,4657.841,Right.
2004.04-70,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4657.841,4660.071,It was meant to have an independent basis there.
2004.04-70,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,4664.407,4665.522,Well--
2004.04-70,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4665.522,4667.379,--by giving it their reading.
2004.04-70,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,4667.379,4673.24,"--Well, I... I just think that the whole statute makes a very great deal of sense."
2004.04-70,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4689.958,4693.59,"Mr.... Mr. Ayer, may I ask you a question on your interpretation?"
2004.04-70,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,4721.826,4724.593,"Well, Clark, of course, is a Federal question case."
2004.04-70,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4728.802,4728.968,Yes.
2004.04-70,3,20486,donald_b_ayer,,4730.288,4730.66,Right.
2004.04-70,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5118.754,5120.462,"Thank you, Mr. Ayer."
2004.04-70,4,19760,carter_g_phillips,,5127.709,5131.896,"Thank... thank you, Justice Stevens, and I'd just like to make a few points."
2004.04-70,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5272.973,5274.459,This didn't make a whole lot of sense.
2004.04-70,4,19760,carter_g_phillips,,5274.459,5282.633,"--Well, except it does because the... the amount-in-controversy requirement keeps a lot of smaller cases out of Federal court that otherwise would be in there."
2004.04-70,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5326.472,5334.44,That... this point was not... would be you're asking us to decide it in the first instance.
2004.04-70,4,19760,carter_g_phillips,,5340.301,5342.798,"Well, except that this Court in Dataflux didn't send it back."
2004.04-70,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5353.183,5365.898,"Well, that's because the Court conceived of there... there being one entity, so you couldn't... you couldn't change... split that one entity into two fictitious persons."
2004.04-70,4,19760,carter_g_phillips,,5365.898,5372.296,"Well, that's... and that's what the district court held in Zahn, which is the reason the district court didn't allow this case to come... didn't allow this to go forward as a class action."
2004.04-70,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5385.095,5385.755,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
