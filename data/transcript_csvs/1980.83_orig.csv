1980.83_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,21.175,"The Court will hear arguments first this morning in case of the State of Maryland against the State of Louisiana, an original jurisdiction case."
1980.83_orig,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,25.846,30.155,"Thank you very much Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1980.83_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,139.793,140.988,General Sachs.
1980.83_orig,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,140.988,141.993,Yes sir.
1980.83_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,141.993,158.004,"Before you get to the so-called merits of the case, is it your opinion that Illinois -- Illinois versus Milwaukee completely overruled Ohio versus Wyandotte?"
1980.83_orig,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,158.004,171.154,"No, Your Honor, it is not our opinion that Illinois against City of Milwaukee overrules Ohio against Wyandotte nor as our opinion that this case is controlled by this Court's disposition of the application for reasons of jurisdiction in Arizona against New Mexico."
1980.83_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,268.221,283.958,Maryland is (Inaudible)
1980.83_orig,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,283.958,285.584,We are here in both capacities Your Honor.
1980.83_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,285.584,286.499,I realize that.
1980.83_orig,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,286.499,289.992,And we -- and I make the same assertion in both capacities.
1980.83_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,304.349,315.491,"Well, but do you disagree with the notion that there is some tension between Pennsylvania versus West Virginia and Ohio versus Wyandotte?"
1980.83_orig,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,315.491,325.894,"No, Your Honor, I do not and the reason -- that as I do disagree with the contention that there is tension between the two propositions for the reasons that I began to indicate perhaps a moment or two ago."
1980.83_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,388.325,412.055,"Yet ordinarily a litigant suing on the basis that the tax violated the Commerce Clause or for some other reason was deficient constitutionally would have this case reviewed in the District Court, the Court of Appeals."
1980.83_orig,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,459.447,461.636,I have two responses of that Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1980.83_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,482.684,492.104,"Well, I don't mean exhaustions in the sense of exhaustion of remedies, but I mean review by several different courts."
1980.83_orig,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,492.104,499.321,"Nor -- nor with all respect, Your Honor, do we believe that review by several different courts is essential to determine the claim here."
1980.83_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,578.079,587.077,"Philadelphia against New Jersey, of course, came up through the regular courts, did it not?"
1980.83_orig,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,587.077,592.099,"It did Your Honor but significantly, it was decided as I recall it, on pleadings."
1980.83_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,645.4,648.682,But -- but that -- that's the merits.
1980.83_orig,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,648.682,658.573,"Well, it is the merits but it's the merits of the narrow but fundamental question as to whether this statute facially discriminates and intends to discriminate against interstate commerce."
1980.83_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,740.891,753.671,Could Maryland itself have gone into United States District Court in Louisiana and made this same claim?
1980.83_orig,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,753.671,755.375,"No, Your Honor, for two reasons."
1980.83_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,792.803,794.202,Who supports you in this case?
1980.83_orig,0,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,794.202,795.569,They do indeed support this.
1980.83_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1089.255,1098.243,"Very well, General Sachs."
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1102.164,1106.053,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1980.83_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1225.236,1234.817,"Mr. Smith if we accepted either your argument or that of General Sachs, this Louisiana tax would be invalid, would it not?"
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1234.817,1235.505,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1980.83_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1235.505,1238.337,It wouldn't be necessary to accept both of them at all.
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1238.337,1238.743,No.
1980.83_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1260.647,1260.898,Mr. Smith.
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1260.898,1261.78,The Court accepts --
1980.83_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1261.78,1267.159,And -- and your argument is a constitutional argument insofar as it relies on the Supremacy Clause?
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1267.159,1267.387,Right.
1980.83_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1273.991,1285.362,"Mr. Smith, FERC would've had no difficulty in suing Louisiana in the Federal District Court in Louisiana, would it not?"
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1285.362,1302.869,"The -- FERC would've have had no difficulty suing Louisiana and in fact, there is a suit that has brought in the middle district of Louisiana, but that the states cannot be parties to that suit as General Sachs has pointed out."
1980.83_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1345.66,1352.611,"Well so that all revolves around our original jurisdiction in here, does it not?"
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1352.611,1353.507,It does.
1980.83_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1400.116,1405.374,But part of the reason theyre off track is because of this original action?
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1405.374,1407.132,"I don't think so, Mr. Justice."
1980.83_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1462.604,1467.766,"Mr. Smith, you say that these other courts are “Inappropriate.”"
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1470.069,1476.559,I really -- I suspect that they're really not capable of the kind of constitutional resolution of the sort.
1980.83_orig,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1476.559,1478.074,You say that it wouldn't be enough?
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1478.074,1479.032,No.
1980.83_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1551.458,1566.61,"Well, the solar power district in Arizona is in privity with the suit of Arizona only in the sense that it -- there's an enabling statute alive to be formed."
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1566.61,1568.013,"Yes, but that makes a big difference."
1980.83_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1624.401,1635.284,Would you -- would you say the same thing if the State of Maryland itself was not a direct purchaser of Louisiana gas?
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1639.017,1648.968,"Well, I think I would say the same thing but of course, I don't have to say that here because it's much -- we have a much -- the State of Maryland has a much stronger case because it is a consumer of --"
1980.83_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1648.968,1649.063,Granted -- granted --
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1649.063,1652.009,-- of natural gas in the same way that the Federal Government did.
1980.83_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1652.009,1654.545,Granted but I was asking you -- (Voice Overlap) --
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1654.545,1683.211,"I think that the parens patriae thing is compelling in the sense that you know, you've got a bunch of consumers, you know, who basically on the basis of this tax which is really -- you know, for want of a better expression, exported, you know fiscal greed or going to have to pay higher utility bills and the chances of people like that bringing a suit to complain in the proper forum are really remote."
1980.83_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1692.994,1695.475,"Well, where's the limitation then?"
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1703.129,1723.127,"I suppose -- I suppose that's so, but you know here, where the fiscal stakes are so large, where Maryland also is suing in its capacity of consumer, I don't think that you know the Court need to wrestle with those difficult questions of what would happen if the State was only here as parens patriae."
1980.83_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1744.091,1751.882,May I interrupt you just for a moment Mr. Smith to ask if each of the eight plaintiff States is itself a consumer of gas?
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1751.882,1755.881,I think that's -- I think that's correct and I think that's alleged in the complaint and I don't think there's any --
1980.83_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1755.881,1756.24,Right.
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1756.24,1757.82,-- dispute about that.
1980.83_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1822.978,1825.368,"Mr. Smith, do they treat all producers alike?"
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1831.443,1835.056,"I think that's right, but the rest of them, you know, get it back I think."
1980.83_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1862.198,1873.606,So the law prevents passing back to the producer this tax whether or not he still owns the gas at the time the tax is first applied?
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1873.606,1879.523,"Right, because the producer, in effect, -- in all cases, retains the liquid and liquefiable hydrocarbons."
1980.83_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1954.159,1956.509,Who made the motion for judgment on the pleadings?
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1956.509,1957.871,The plaintiff States.
1980.83_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1957.871,1961.604,And how about the FERC?
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1961.604,1963.044,We intervened.
1980.83_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1967.08,1967.716,Well was there any --
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1967.716,1968.564,-- which the Master will -- will support.
1980.83_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1968.564,1969.874,Was there any evidence?
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1974.37,1975.741,Strictly on the pleadings.
1980.83_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1977.476,1981.968,So would it -- would you treat this as a motion for summary judgment or what would you treat it?
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1981.968,1983.639,Essentially it's a motion for --
1980.83_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1983.639,1989.257,It's a -- it's only if there were evidence offered outside the pleading?
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1989.257,1989.709,That's right.
1980.83_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1992.937,1994.479,I don't think any -- has to be --
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,1994.479,1995.727,There doesn't have to any evidence.
1980.83_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2024.722,2034.913,"Well, you know, you wouldn't -- what if the Commission put out an order in a specific case allocating these costs?"
1980.83_orig,1,42099,stuart_a_smith,,2034.913,2063.46,"If the Commission put out an order allocating these costs, well, it's for the -- well, let me say and my time is -- I don't want to trench upon the time of the pipelines but let me simply say that the Commission -- it is not necessary to consider what would happen if the Commission put out an order because in our view, the mere fact that Louisiana has trenched upon the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commission, the Commission could agree with Louisiana, but that's not the point."
1980.83_orig,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2119.407,2121.846,Mr. Peragine.
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2121.846,2126.111,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1980.83_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2172.236,2176.501,"Mr. Peragine, you -- you've actually commenced a refund suit have you not?"
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2176.501,2177.612,"Yes we have, sir."
1980.83_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2200.715,2202.891,And if you lost in Louisiana court --
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2202.891,2203.345,If we have been --
1980.83_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2203.345,2205.906,-- this Court would be open on certiorari?
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2205.906,2207.023,"Presumably, yes."
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2246.946,2257.158,"So, why isn't -- why isnt that sort of an accommodation by the Commission to the Louisiana tax?"
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2257.158,2259.954,"Well you speak of it as an accommodation, sir."
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2259.954,2263.081,"Well, Mr. Smith said it is not to --"
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2263.081,2285.261,"Well, if I may address that point, Justice White for a moment, you have here -- let's say the Commission does issue an order saying, “We're not going to pay any attention to this non pass back provision,” which is the brunt of the Government's argument here as to 1303C."
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2330.284,2332.791,"So you say, it's just in Northern Natural Gas?"
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2332.791,2334.336,"That is correct sir, yes."
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2334.336,2336.784,"It's an infringement, an invasion of an exclusive jurisdiction?"
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2336.784,2340.328,"Yes, under the -- right sir."
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2428.917,2438.43,"Well, why shouldn't -- why shouldn't Louisiana be able to impose some kind of a tax with respect to the processing of natural gas within its borders?"
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2438.43,2438.659,"Yes, Your Honor that --"
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2438.659,2442.633,"Suppose it didn't attempt to control who ultimately paid it, suppose it didn't?"
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2442.633,2445.015,"Oh but it is -- it is just that, Your Honor."
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2445.015,2445.146,"Well, I know --"
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2445.146,2445.972,And for this reason --
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2445.972,2447.391,I know you -- I know that --
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2447.391,2450.043,Processing -- there's not a tax on processing.
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2456.305,2458.369,Well a use just happens to be a process?
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2458.369,2460.679,"Well, one of the uses happens to be processing."
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2461.868,2462.725,"Well, it's one of them, one of them."
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2462.725,2464.793,"But the -- but the effect -- yes it is, sir."
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2464.793,2472.826,"Well, why shouldn't Louisiana be able impose a tax with respect to that processing-use?"
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2472.826,2486.212,"Because, Your Honor, if you look at processing, first of all, it is an integral part of the interstate transmission of this gas which began offshore at the wellhead."
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2503.669,2506.442,"Well, you just barely started to answer my question."
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2508.873,2512.171,"All right sir, well what is your -- is --"
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2512.171,2521.362,My question is why shouldn't -- that's an activity going on within Louisiana and I suppose that Louisiana is giving it some protection.
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2521.362,2522.469,But in any activity --
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2522.469,2525.674,Why shouldn't it -- why shouldn't that part of the interstate movement have to pay either way?
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2525.674,2527.978,"Well, the process -- I may say this, Your Honor."
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2538.173,2538.184,Yes.
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2538.184,2539.499,So they attempt to do that.
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2539.499,2540.294,Why do they do that?
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2540.294,2541.57,But the tax is not imposed on it.
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2541.57,2542.415,Where do they do that?
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2542.415,2544.569,"They do it in Louisiana, no question about that."
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2544.569,2545.863,"And in plants, they have plants?"
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2545.863,2548.794,"In plants, yes, tremendous plants which do that."
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2557.717,2560.23,I thought -- you said it was imposed on the use?
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2560.23,2560.541,Yes.

1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2562.757,2565.794,"One of the uses is processing, sir, but --"
1980.83_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2565.794,2577.971,Is that semantics in the same sense that General Sachs referred to Justice Cardoza's opinion in Silas Mason against Henneford?
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2577.971,2584.306,"Well, it may be semantics, Your Honor, but I think we have a battle of semantics here."
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2589.438,2610.93,But what if -- what if the State put on a certain rate of tax for every -- every unit of processing of gas that was processed whether you speak in trillions or billions or millions or whatever it is?
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2613.97,2619.406,"I -- I don't know that a State could not do that, to put a tax on the processing of gas, Your Honor."
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2619.406,2621.354,Within the -- within Louisiana?
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2621.354,2628.144,"Within the confines of Louisiana and if that was a tax on processing itself, I don't know that that would --"
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2628.144,2630.896,"Oh, but you say processing is part of interstate commerce."
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2630.896,2631.704,"Yes, it is."
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2631.878,2632.602,But -- but you concede that it may --
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2632.602,2633.656,But you're talking about --
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2633.656,2634.651,-- that that kind of a tax might be --
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2634.651,2635.645,But this --
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2635.645,2635.685,-- nevertheless valid.
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2635.685,2642.229,"The effect of -- the effect of this tax is that it's transported beyond to Louisiana's borders, sir, because the only --"
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2642.229,2645.936,"Now, you're changing the case again."
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2658.524,2659.312,Well I think --
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2659.312,2662.095,That was in the course of being transmitted out-of-state?
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2662.095,2677.725,"I suppose the answer to that, Justice White, is that the Court would have to -- would have to hold that the interstate commerce does not begin until the processing has been completed."
1980.83_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2677.725,2678.107,Why?
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2680.995,2696.106,"Interstate commerce pays its way, Your Honor, but I don't believe that it has to -- that it must be -- well, let me get off that."
1980.83_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2714.309,2721.889,"Well, why do the States have any standing to object to it if in private or if that involves only a pipeline?"
1980.83_orig,2,24455,frank_j_peragine,,2721.889,2733.279,"Well, because it passes on the -- the pipelines pass it on and ultimately, it falls on the customers of the pipeline companies."

1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,2746.367,2750.999,Chief Justice Burger and it may please the Court.
1980.83_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2933.578,2939.355,Well you don't -- you don't suggest then -- I thought you were going to just these cases beyond our jurisdiction?
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,2939.355,2942.653,It is for various reasons but I don't think we --
1980.83_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2942.653,2944.002,You are arguing that right now.
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,2946.773,2969.459,"Discretionary declination which encompasses, in this case, additional considerations which I think put this case beyond the pale of this Court's original jurisdiction, even though it is nominally a suit between two or more states."
1980.83_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2972.756,2977.464,Well do you think is a case of controversy between Maryland and Louisiana or not?
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,2977.464,2989.279,"No, Your Honor, that is one of our basic propositions that there is no controversy, no -- between the sovereign interest of the State of Maryland and the sovereign interest of the State of Maryland --"
1980.83_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2989.279,2990.429,That isn't what I asked.
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,2991.895,2992.007,-- Louisiana.
1980.83_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2992.007,2997.719,It was whether -- whether there was a case of controversy between the two.
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3001.107,3005.921,"Well, if there does, in terms of invoking this Court's original jurisdiction."
1980.83_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3091.496,3095.201,They also wanted to declare that this statute declared unconstitutional.
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3095.201,3096.519,"That is true, Your Honor."
1980.83_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3096.519,3098.014,Prospectively even.
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3098.014,3099.787,Pardon?
1980.83_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3099.787,3101.847,At least that part of it would be prospective.
1980.83_orig,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3101.847,3102.088,And did they ask for --
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3102.088,3103.286,"Yes, indeed."
1980.83_orig,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3103.286,3105.736,Did they ask for an injunction on future collections?
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3105.736,3107.379,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.83_orig,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3107.379,3111.696,"And that this complaint was filed not just by the State of Maryland but by eight states, was it not?"
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3111.696,3112.254,That's true.
1980.83_orig,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3113.113,3116.378,And each -- each alleged that it -- itself was a consumer of gas.
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3116.378,3122.736,That is true but there is not one word in the (Inaudible) that would go to the benefit of consumers.
1980.83_orig,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3122.736,3123.596,"Well, except in joining the taxes (Voice Overlap) --"
1980.83_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3123.596,3129.912,"Well, you -- you don't suggest that the -- that this tax doesn't resolve it, increasing the cost of gas to the States."
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3129.912,3134.784,"No, there is no question that that is --"
1980.83_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3134.784,3139.408,Does the State of Maryland have a State in the controversy then substantially?
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3139.408,3141.137,"No, not in the --"
1980.83_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3141.137,3143.378,"Well, itself uses gas, doesn't it?"
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3143.565,3172.721,"That is true but that is a proprietary interest, Your Honor, and this Court has so declared and that brings us right back to the proposition that was stated as recently in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, that it has become subtle doctrine that a State has standing to sue only when it's sovereign or quasi-sovereign interest are implicated."
1980.83_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3178.71,3181.244,"Well, it's litigating its own claims."
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3188.57,3202.179,"Yes, but the interest that it is asserting there, that is the cost, the burden of the tax that has somehow been passed on by reason of some authority other than the State of Louisiana."
1980.83_orig,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3323.97,3331.015,I have an awful problem with saying that money is not an interest on the sovereign.
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3335.619,3337.095,"Of course not, Your Honor."
1980.83_orig,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3337.095,3345.718,"So, it is a -- it is a part and when they use that money for gas, they can't use that same money for police --"
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3345.718,3346.008,No.
1980.83_orig,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3346.008,3348.449,-- fire or any other.
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3348.449,3349.087,But the same could be --
1980.83_orig,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3349.087,3351.352,(Inaudible)
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3351.352,3358.29,It is obviously a burden but it's a burden that consumers have had to pay from the year one.
1980.83_orig,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3367.347,3370.155,Because the State is involved.
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3370.155,3370.823,"Well, the State --"
1980.83_orig,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3370.823,3375.302,"The State's money is involved, the State's life, blood is involved."
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3377.226,3381.215,"I understand exactly what you're saying, Justice Marshall."
1980.83_orig,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3416.499,3417.358,Which you've been passed on the --
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3417.358,3423.798,"Which then the manufacturer by economic forces or otherwise, passes on to the consumer."
1980.83_orig,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3605.467,3616.481,It is true is it not that there are more federal interest in this particular controversy than in most of the cases that you're describing because of the source of the gas and the special federal statute --
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3616.481,3617.975,"Of course, there are."
1980.83_orig,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3617.975,3619.541,It's sort of a unique case.
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3619.541,3640.501,There are but perhaps the answer that can be given to all those interests lies in the various causes of action that are pending and available in other courts.
1980.83_orig,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3676.754,3691.91,"Mr. Gressman, when would you predict that the issue would be finally resolved if the alternative route is taken rather than ruling on the motion for summary judgment, assuming that the judgment on the pleadings -- motion of the judgment on the pleadings has merit."
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3691.91,3693.768,Well --
1980.83_orig,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3693.768,3696.135,There's quite a difference in time and in interest (Voice Overlap) --
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3696.135,3711.198,"Yes, of course, but that involves a host of other considerations as to whether this case could ever be disposed of on the merits -- on the basis of the pleadings without any kind of an evidentiary hearing but the point is --"
1980.83_orig,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3711.198,3715.506,"We're just making that assumption for purposes preparing the relative value, the two different procedures?"
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3715.506,3729.025,"Right, well, in comparing the value of the two forum or sets of forums that are available, let me say there is no comparison."
1980.83_orig,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3754.026,3763.305,Didn't it take approximately 20 years for the State of Arizona -- for the case of Arizona versus California to be finally --
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3763.305,3763.871,Yes.
1980.83_orig,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3764.38,3764.996,-- decided by this Court?
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3764.996,3775.644,"-- on this original docket where you have to extend -- involve yourself in evidentiary hearings before a Special Master can well take many, many years."
1980.83_orig,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3779.669,3783.143,"Of course, the evidentiary hearing is probably rather brief if you grant the judgment (Voice Overlap) --"
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3783.143,3799.87,"Well, that is true but it says -- that suggests another proposition, and maybe so brief as to the untrustworthy, as a method of serious constitutional adjudication determining the -- the validity of a state tax on the basis of pleadings."
1980.83_orig,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3799.87,3804.558,"But Mr. Smith's argument is valid, what -- why do you need all the evidence for?"
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3807.022,3807.495,We --
1980.83_orig,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3807.495,3808.779,And suppose it is.
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3808.779,3821.847,"We hardly disagree that -- that you can even define, let alone resolve the constitutional issues by looking at this very complex and in many respects, ambiguous statute."
1980.83_orig,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3854.855,3857.378,"I had the impression, it's really fairly simple."
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3862.879,3873.165,"Well, on the contrary, Your Honor, there are various difficulties in determining which Section of the statute has been applied."
1980.83_orig,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3879.186,3882.767,"Most of the gas goes through a processing plant then shipped out-of-state, isn't it?"
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3882.767,3883.527,That is true but there --
1980.83_orig,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3883.527,3886.438,But the tax is applied on all that gas.
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3886.438,3887.441,But there are other kinds of uses.
1980.83_orig,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3887.441,3888.279,Isn't that right?
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3888.279,3895.42,It depends on your definition and then what method is selected by the State tax authorities to impose it.
1980.83_orig,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3900.947,3901.009,(Voice Overlap) --
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3901.009,3901.786,-- as to gas as it comes --

1980.83_orig,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3903.696,3907.65,-- is equal to the severance tax that's imposed on the gas that originates from Louisiana.
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3907.65,3921.281,"Well, and -- but much of the problems of consideration of the discriminatory nature of this tax whether there is indeed what --"
1980.83_orig,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3921.281,3928.293,And its clear isn't it that there is no tax on processing of gas that originates in Louisiana.

1980.83_orig,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3937.455,3940.226,That's the only processing tax a State seeks to impose.
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,3940.226,3947.703,That's right but the problem is it can be under this statute as to which of various processing uses are being attacked.
1980.83_orig,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3949.892,3955.661,And those are determined entirely by the source and the destination of the gas rather than the character of the processing or the use.

1980.83_orig,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4719.183,4720.75,If he has time.
1980.83_orig,3,22360,eugene_gressman,,4720.75,4722.542,That's right.
1980.83_orig,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4735.868,4736.724,Mr. Pugh.
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,4736.724,4740.842,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."

1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,4744.589,4749.031,"Absolutely, it refused him to this extent if I may, Your Honor."
1980.83_orig,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4808.99,4811.382,Where does that lead?
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,4811.382,4814.711,"Your Honor, we have an ongoing proceed."
1980.83_orig,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4818.258,4819.897,"Well then, may I ask this?"
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,4819.897,4820.369,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.83_orig,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4820.369,4828.665,"The fact that the Attorney General of Louisiana is willing to extend the invitation, does it or does not bind -- that bind your courts?"

1980.83_orig,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4830.695,4831.482,Does it bind the court?
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,4831.482,4840.368,-- whether or not this is a prestigious vehicle to accept an invitation issued by an Attorney General to another State.
1980.83_orig,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4843.651,4847.263,"Well, I know you won't oppose but what will your courts do?"
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,4847.263,4857.571,"Our courts will not oppose the intervention because the Court has already said it would welcome them upon their request, and that's in the record in Louisiana."
1980.83_orig,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4925.972,4927.483,And when was that?
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,4927.483,4930.555,"That was September the 29th, that litigation was filed."
1980.83_orig,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4930.555,4931.803,What year?
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,4931.803,4936.535,1978 and it was tied up for full 5 months based on the removal.
1980.83_orig,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4936.535,4938.674,And it's still tied up?
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,4938.674,4940.078,"To this extent, Your Honor, they appealed --"
1980.83_orig,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4940.078,4942.071,You mean they're still tied up?
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,4942.071,4943.034,"Yes, so, the federal court --"
1980.83_orig,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4943.034,4946.531,"Of course I'm going to ask you next, when is it set for argument?"
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,4946.531,4949.382,"It is -- it was set for argument in the Fifth Circuit, Your Honor."
1980.83_orig,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4949.382,4951.492,"Well, when is it set for trial now?"
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,4951.492,4953.707,"The federal case is not set for trial, Your Honor."
1980.83_orig,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4953.707,4955.111,But when is the state case set then?
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,4955.111,4957.928,We are prepared to set the state case immediately.
1980.83_orig,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4957.928,4958.723,It isn't set.
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,4959.776,4965.726,"Neither of those proceedings have been set for trial but if I may follow it through, Your Honor."
1980.83_orig,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4965.726,4967.725,That's over two years.
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,4967.725,4968.292,"Yes, sir."
1980.83_orig,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5026.916,5038.947,Don't you think that could've been the reason for the original jurisdiction provision in the Constitution that the State did not go down to a local state court of another state?
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,5040.864,5052.124,"I'm satisfied that was the reason, Your Honor, but -- but the problem here is, should there not be a state court interpretation of its own Acts."
1980.83_orig,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5081.342,5085.667,"Mr. Pugh, what about the interest of FERC in the state court?"
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,5087.431,5088.717,"But it may be, Your Honor."
1980.83_orig,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5088.717,5089.615,How?
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,5089.615,5093.862,It may -- Louisiana has a broad jurisdictional base.
1980.83_orig,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5093.862,5095.333,"Well, how does it get -- how does it get in?"
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,5095.333,5095.99,"They'd intervene, Your Honor."
1980.83_orig,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5095.99,5099.347,"You said it brought its own action, I gather in United States District Court."
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,5099.347,5100.411,"Yes, it did, Your Honor."
1980.83_orig,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5100.411,5103.053,And that still -- that's the one now before the Fifth Circuit.
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,5103.053,5104.234,Yes Sir.
1980.83_orig,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5105.002,5114.665,"But I mean, their -- their issue, as I understand the argument, that they make a statutory claim that under the Supremacy Clause, your statute has to fall anyway."
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,5114.665,5115.91,"Well, of course, it -- we suggest --"
1980.83_orig,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5115.91,5117.243,That's -- that's their argument?
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,5117.243,5117.753,"That's right, Your Honor."
1980.83_orig,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5117.753,5119.886,How are they going to be heard in a state court?
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,5119.886,5128.016,"They're going to go in and they're going to move to intervene and we're going to say, “We love to have you and at that time, we're going to have all the parties in Louisiana and Louisiana is the one --"
1980.83_orig,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5128.016,5130.995,"Well, why do you think they brought their own federal court action?"
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,5130.995,5137.098,"Because they couldn't bring the action in Louisiana in the first place, Your Honor, but it doesn't mean they could intervene on a pendent action."
1980.83_orig,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5141.521,5143.09,"Why -- why couldn't they, by the way?"
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,5143.09,5147.243,"Well, it's my appreciation that they could not, could be on their own, but it's my procedural --"
1980.83_orig,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5147.243,5148.47,Could they have been sued?
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,5151.819,5154.383,In our initial suit?
1980.83_orig,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5170.536,5172.92,"Well, I'm not talking about United States."
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,5175.344,5177.931,"Well, it is an agency of the United States."
1980.83_orig,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5177.931,5181.929,Wouldn't you have to start out before it?
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,5181.929,5184.8,"Well, as a matter of fact, Your Honor, if you're talking about the full -- FERC."
1980.83_orig,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5184.8,5185.555,Yes.
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,5185.555,5188.21,"Well, FERC actually has the same issue up right now."
1980.83_orig,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5205.065,5205.328,And of course --
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,5205.328,5205.694,That's right now (Voice Overlap) --
1980.83_orig,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5205.694,5212.501,"-- if they ordered -- if they ordered the producer to pay some of this tax, you might -- your tax might be in a little bit of trouble, wouldn't it?"

1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,5228.688,5233.933,-- relates to processing and also to --
1980.83_orig,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5233.933,5237.703,"Well, suppose FERC were to -- suppose FERC were to change its mind now and say --"
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,5237.703,5238.233,"All right, sir."
1980.83_orig,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5238.233,5244.383,"-- we'll -- we'll put the whole thing on the producer, would yours -- would your statute then self-destruct?"
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,5244.383,5258.227,"It would not be -- self-destruct until these contracts were presented to a court of competent jurisdiction to find out whether or not under the terms of the contract, either by courts or attacks that that would be passed back."
1980.83_orig,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5267.926,5270.918,"Well then, when does your self-destruct provision become operative?"
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,5270.918,5280.448,"It becomes operative if there is a judicial determination that either a cost or a tax, there are two paragraphs, are determined by a court, a final court."
1980.83_orig,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5280.448,5281.167,By a court.
1980.83_orig,4,40227,robert_g_pugh,,5281.167,5289.494,"All right, that processing and also distribution -- no sir, I'm sorry."

1980.83_orig,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6060.345,6064.082,"And in any event, they might like to know what we think about it."
1980.83_orig,5,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,6064.082,6066.588,"I -- I would certainly think so, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.83_orig,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,6066.588,6068.533,"Well, what about the state courts?"
1980.83_orig,5,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,6068.533,6073.193,"Mr. Chief -- Mr. Justice Brennan, we can't -- I must come back to what I said earlier."
1980.83_orig,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6102.39,6123.819,"Mr. Sachs, supposing that the Attorney General of Maryland became convinced that a number of Maryland residents who would move or retire to Louisiana were being unconstitutionally taxed by Louisiana in the -- in a state tax proceeding."
1980.83_orig,5,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,6134.0,6157.462,"Well, I think probably not, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, because for the very reason that this case, for example, in Pennsylvania against West Virginia are different from Pennsylvania against New Jersey, that that commuter tax situation that occupied this Court in Austin and New Hampshire and then the original jurisdictional declined where a state is really acting as the surrogate for some of its citizens."
1980.83_orig,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6170.358,6174.527,"Well, did you count heads to decide whether you're parens patriae or anything?"

1980.83_orig,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6276.877,6283.271,And as I -- as you -- does a State as a purchaser of each of those commodities acquire standing to attack the tax?
1980.83_orig,5,42054,stephen_h_sachs,,6283.271,6303.485,"No, sir, but the distinction here is that the -- the unconstitutional event in the first place, as your legislative history will show you, is that Louisiana imposed this tax, taking advantage of a mechanism, a conduits to the pipelines, a FERC mechanisms, all of which happened exactly as they forecast it precisely so that the tax would be born as we bear it."
