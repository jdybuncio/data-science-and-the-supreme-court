1961.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,9.17,"Keith Martin, Appellant, versus Herbert Walton, as Probate Judge of Johnson County, Kansas."
1961.30,0,27802,howard_e_payne,,12.147,17.228,"Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court."
1961.30,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,137.958,139.727,He is a citizen of Kansas?
1961.30,0,27802,howard_e_payne,,139.727,146.703,"He is a citizen, Your Honor, a resident of Kansas, and maintains an office in Kansas."
1961.30,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,146.703,148.112,He lives there.
1961.30,0,27802,howard_e_payne,,148.112,151.265,"And lives in Kansas, that is correct Your Honor."
1961.30,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,151.265,157.59,Your reference to the fact that this was a subsequently promulgated regulation or --
1961.30,0,27802,howard_e_payne,,157.59,157.667,Yes.
1961.30,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,157.667,163.011,"-- statute, leads me to ask, approximately what is the size of the Missouri Bar?"
1961.30,0,27802,howard_e_payne,,163.011,172.539,"The Missouri Bar as according to the judicial findings of our Supreme Court, is approximately 1800."
1961.30,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,172.539,173.532,The whole state?
1961.30,0,27802,howard_e_payne,,173.532,177.136,"No, in the Kansas City -- Kansas City Missouri Bar."
1961.30,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,179.213,181.346,"But this is applied to the whole state, does it not?"
1961.30,0,27802,howard_e_payne,,181.346,207.63,"Well, it applies to Mr. Martin practicing anywhere within any other state so long as he maintains an office in Kansas, our court has said that if he practices in a foreign state also, then he must associate with him when he practices in Kansas, a local lawyer --"
1961.30,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,207.63,214.817,I just want to get the incidence of this statute or regulation.
1961.30,0,27802,howard_e_payne,,219.405,220.88,In the whole state of Missouri?
1961.30,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,220.88,221.476,Yes.
1961.30,0,27802,howard_e_payne,,221.476,222.641,"Your Honor, I do not know."
1961.30,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,222.641,233.84,"Out of the 18 -- within the immediately affected area, out of the 18, how many have a practice both in Kansas and in Missouri?"
1961.30,0,27802,howard_e_payne,,233.84,263.201,"Well, I think that probably within the so-called classification that is affected by these rules, there are approximately 25 to 40 lawyers who reside in Kansas, who maintain an office in Kansas and who are admitted to the Bar in Kansas, but who also practiced over in Kansas City, Missouri or in the State of Missouri."
1961.30,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,263.201,274.407,"I'm not hitting or suggesting that numbers make the difference, I was just curious to know how many lawyers are affected by this -- by this restrictive provision?"
1961.30,0,27802,howard_e_payne,,276.682,278.056,"Well, it would be 25 to 40."
1961.30,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,278.056,280.065,"25, 30 to 40."
1961.30,0,27802,howard_e_payne,,280.065,289.251,"25 to 40, who are affected by these rules so far as the area that we are concerned about is concerned."
1961.30,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,289.251,291.78,"And that's where -- where the shoe pinches most, doesn’t it?"
1961.30,0,27802,howard_e_payne,,291.78,294.423,"Well, that is correct, Your Honor."
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2171.188,2174.942,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2202.681,2204.194,What was that number?
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2204.194,2205.481,"Some 300, Your Honor."
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2205.481,2206.956,300.
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2206.956,2207.825,"Now, this --"
1961.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2207.825,2209.012,Mr. Lysaught.
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2209.012,2209.325,"Yes, sir?"
1961.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2209.325,2228.013,May I ask you this (Inaudible)
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2228.013,2255.055,"If I may answer that in this way, Your Honor, the rule -- and I want to get to that next, the rule talks about those and the criterion is made, those attorneys who are licensed in Kansas but who regularly practice in another jurisdiction, that is the touchstone."
1961.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2255.055,2281.242,(Inaudible)
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2281.242,2285.898,"I cannot answer as to those who regularly practice in Kansas, Your Honor."
1961.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2285.898,2286.446,(Inaudible)
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2286.446,2299.02,"But I thought that Mr. Justice Frankfurter was attempting to get at the size of the group which is within the scope of Rules 41 and 54, with which we are here concerned."
1961.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2299.02,2345.719,(Inaudible)
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2345.719,2374.883,"I think not, Your Honor, because somewhere along the line would be a factual determination which in this case has been pleaded by Mr. Martin that he regularly practices in Missouri, and I don't think that Mr. Payne, his attorney, will stand before this Court, and tell this Court that Mr. Martin spent anywhere near one-half of his time in any office in Kansas."
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2406.439,2416.93,"Under the statute, what is the standard for regular practice in another state?"
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2416.93,2423.577,"It has not been taken down to the point, Your Honor, of so many hours, no."
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2423.577,2423.761,"Well, is there --"
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2423.761,2424.656,The only standard is the --
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2424.656,2426.068,Is there any standard at all?
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2426.068,2431.411,"-- is the rule itself, regularly practicing in Missouri."
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2436.486,2440.303,"Well, what are they?"
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2440.303,2458.254,"For instance, and this applies if it please you, Your Honor, to only -- to appearances before the courts, commissions, and boards in the State of Kansas, Mr. Martin can examine abstracts, he can draw bids all he wants in the State of Kansas --"
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2458.254,2460.077,"Well, that isn't the question I was asking."
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2460.077,2460.947,"Yes, sir, I'm coming to that."
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2460.947,2469.011,What is required -- this practice in the foreign state to constitute practice there (Voice Overlap) --
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2469.011,2474.089,"All of these -- all of these things would be embraced, every act within the practice of law."
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2497.834,2507.575,But how much of that work do they have to do in the foreign state to bring themselves -- to be brought under this rule?
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2516.505,2517.143,"Yes, sir."
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2517.143,2522.252,"He didn't say whether he had an office or not, but he said he occasionally tried a case over there."
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2531.559,2532.417,No Your Honor --
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2532.417,2532.545,"But now, what --"
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2532.545,2534.53,-- because he is not regularly engaged.
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2534.53,2544.832,"Well now, what is the standard under this law that defines regularly engaged?"
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2544.832,2547.377,There is no further definition that -- than --
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2547.377,2547.925,"Well, isn't that pretty vague?"
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2547.925,2560.796,"-- the word “regularly” but I submit to Your Honor, without putting into an equation of hours, that no more self-explanatory definition could be given."
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2560.796,2571.709,"It doesn't say that if he maintains his principal place of business or if he has a regular place of business or anything else, if he just practices over there, is that right?"
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2571.709,2572.314,Regularly.
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2572.314,2572.682,Yes.
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2572.682,2573.612,Yes sir.
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2573.612,2574.252,"Now, if he --"
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2574.252,2575.09,That is --
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2575.09,2603.87,"If he lives on half-a-mile on the Kansas side of the line, and his clients have some business over in Missouri, he maintains his office in Kansas but his clients have business over in Missouri quite regularly and he goes over there to take care of them, then he loses his right to practice freely in Kansas, is that right?"
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2603.87,2605.475,"I think not, Your Honor."
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2605.475,2605.716,I beg your pardon.
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2605.716,2607.197,I think not.
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2607.197,2607.863,Why?
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2607.863,2608.087,Because he is not --
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2608.087,2608.928,That is what I'm --
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2608.928,2611.478,-- regularly engaged in the practice in Missouri.
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2614.57,2623.029,"Well -- and, do you have to associate anyone in Kansas with you?"
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2623.029,2630.853,"No, sir, because I do not regularly engaged in the practice of law in Missouri."
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2630.853,2643.194,"Well -- well, I understand that, but really what I am trying to find out is if there is any standard at all to determine what is meant by regularly practicing over there?"
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2643.194,2646.709,"If that is not a standard, then there is none, Your Honor."
1961.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2646.709,2649.219,But you're saying is “regularly” is the standard.
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2649.219,2649.968,"Yes, sir."
1961.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2651.814,2657.633,(Inaudible)
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2657.633,2658.498,"Yes, sir."
1961.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2658.498,2663.398,(Inaudible)
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2663.398,2663.914,"Yes, sir."

1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2673.843,2675.779,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1961.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2675.779,2697.521,(Inaudible)
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2697.521,2711.119,"I would say maybe the law itself, maintains an office in a bank building in Kansas City, Missouri and I believe he has his name on and off his door out --"
1961.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2711.119,2720.774,(Inaudible)
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2720.774,2722.649,That is correct.
1961.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2722.649,2728.366,(Inaudible)
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2728.366,2729.926,That has been changed.
1961.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2729.926,2732.117,(Inaudible)
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2732.117,2733.421,"That was so, Your Honor."
1961.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2733.421,2739.519,(Inaudible)
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2739.519,2758.063,"I think he is not Your Honor, because he maintains that office in Kansas City Missouri, and during regular office hours, he is in the office in Kansas City Missouri, you can anymore find him in Mission, Kansas during what we consider regular office hours than anything."
1961.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2758.063,2766.145,(Inaudible)
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2766.145,2770.025,"I live in Johnson, practice in Wyandotte, yes, sir?"

1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2785.614,2786.708,"I think so, Your Honor."
1961.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2786.708,2798.167,(Inaudible)
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2798.167,2807.176,"I think not, I think when you reach that point, if it please the Court, that at that time, the factual termination would be made --"
1961.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2807.176,2807.6,"Well, what --"
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2807.6,2809.514,-- which we do not have here.
1961.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2809.514,2812.382,What factors --
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2812.382,2821.806,"That somewhere along the line, where you draw the line."
1961.30,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2826.908,2829.475,That's the charge in the complaint isn't it?
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2829.475,2834.974,"That -- that is the appellant's petition filed in the trial court, yes Your Honor."
1961.30,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2834.974,2839.753,If he alleges that he regularly practices in both states?
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2839.753,2840.257,Yes.
1961.30,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2840.257,2841.123,Yes.
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2841.123,2844.574,"But in one place, he says, he regularly practices in Missouri --"
1961.30,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2844.574,2844.945,And --
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2844.945,2850.663,"-- and if we ever get down to that point, then there would -- there have to be a factual determination."
1961.30,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2850.663,2853.019,Of whether -- I don't understand.
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2860.22,2862.342,"Yes, sir."
1961.30,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2862.342,2869.313,Do we not here and did not the Kansas Court here have to take this through the unchallenged affirmance of this complaint?
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2869.313,2870.321,That is correct.
1961.30,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2870.321,2871.645,"So, there isn't any factual issue on that --"
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2871.645,2872.317,No.
1961.30,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2872.317,2873.58,As far as we now stand.
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2873.58,2882.615,"But if he's -- if Missouri pass such a law, and then we came up on the question of which of these two statues controls --"
1961.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2882.615,2885.445,"Why would it have to be both, why couldn't both of them?"
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2885.445,2885.726,Sir?
1961.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2885.726,2891.077,"If one -- I don't understand why you have to choose between them, I don't want to interrupt --"
1961.30,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2891.077,2892.842,(Inaudible)
1961.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2892.842,2900.316,"What I meant was that -- I don't see why there's a which, if one could do it, I suppose the other could do it, I don't --"
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2900.316,2900.746,"Yes, sir."
1961.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2902.355,2911.406,"I understand that, but he's asking you on the basis of whether or not he could, and I frankly do not see why it couldn't, if one --"
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2911.406,2913.709,"I do not argue, Your Honor, that he could not."
1961.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2913.709,2914.246,Yes.
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2914.246,2916.367,I do not make that argument.
1961.30,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,2916.367,2923.431,I don't see why in factual determination except -- because no other man was regularly practicing in both states.
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2933.561,2935.748,I so assume also.
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2935.748,2949.719,What is the requirement for a foreign lawyer who has no connection with the State of Kansas when he comes into your state?
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2949.719,2952.012,He would take an entrance examination.
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2952.012,2956.995,"No, no, no, I mean for a specific piece of business."
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2958.762,2960.754,A foreign lawyer who comes in --
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2960.754,2960.867,Yes.
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2960.867,2964.319,"-- to appear before a court, Board or Commission --"
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2964.319,2964.515,Yes.
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2964.515,2965.291,-- in the State of Kansas?
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2965.291,2966.35,Yes.
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2973.429,2974.258,"Yes, sir."
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2974.258,2974.95,He can?
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2974.95,2975.296,"Yes, sir."
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2975.296,2989.905,So you make no distinction then between foreign lawyers and lawyers who are admitted to practice in Kansas and who operate as this practitioner does.
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2989.905,2990.518,That is correct.
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2990.518,2994.177,You put them all on the same basis.
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,2994.177,2995.736,That is correct.
1961.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2995.736,3002.636,"Could you give us the history of this rule or if it was a law, a statute passed, if you have it."
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3002.636,3002.988,There was a --
1961.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3002.988,3022.031,"I assume, it seems to me like it's being argued on reasons that probably not the main reasons, and I don't see why the main reason shouldn't be presented, lawyers and their fee -- and it might be that the state would be interested in their fees --"
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3022.031,3022.618,Well --
1961.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3022.618,3026.555,In preserving their right to get their part of representation.
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3033.412,3036.686,"Mr. Justice Black, I cannot answer that."
1961.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3064.509,3082.756,"Of course that -- if they have motive of lawyers to do something, it would necessary to invalidate your law, but I was asking because I think I've noticed recently that there are quite a number of places where the lawyers have been backing movements of this kind, I think right here, and in the city of Washington."
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3100.146,3101.024,"No, sir."
1961.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3122.896,3122.983,What is --
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3122.983,3123.908,We border on --
1961.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3123.908,3125.612,What is it they can have?
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3125.612,3144.214,"All right, here, Your Honor, is this situation -- there was a lawyer licensed to practice in Kansas, practice regularly in Oklahoma, he resided in Oklahoma, but to me, residence doesn't mean a lot."
1961.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3173.615,3177.358,That sometimes happened in the state with reference to the --
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3177.358,3177.825,I do not --
1961.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3177.825,3178.944,-- the knowledge of the rules (Voice Overlap) --
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3178.944,3183.267,"I do not say that this is a cure all and end all, Your Honor."
1961.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3184.772,3184.954,I thought you --
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3184.954,3207.126,"-- that the Supreme Court of Kansas has a right to expect that beneficial effects will flow from requiring that lawyers who regularly practice outside of the jurisdiction will have associated with them, counsel who regularly practice in the judicial district in which that case is pending."
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3216.366,3220.718,"With what I saw, do you -- you're admitted to practice in both states, aren't you?"
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3220.718,3221.299,"No, sir."
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3221.299,3221.691,Kansas and Missouri.
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3221.691,3225.08,I am not admitted to practice in Missouri.
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3232.165,3235.528,"Well, you are not associated -- you're not admitted to practice, you would have to --"
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3235.528,3236.269,That is right.
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3236.269,3237.068,-- (Voice Overlap) in any circumstances.
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3237.068,3238.086,That is right.
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3238.086,3238.986,Yes.
1961.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3238.986,3254.676,"Do you shy away from the argument that the state could classify, make a classification in order to protect its lawyers and their rights to fees, on the basis that that's not in the case because you think the others found them."
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3262.972,3264.4,"Yes, sir."
1961.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3264.731,3266.836,I am not saying that that wouldn't be --
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3266.836,3267.425,I don't shy --
1961.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3267.425,3269.776,"-- (Voice Overlap) wouldn't be a denial, but --"
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3269.776,3285.148,"Because what we have in this case, and two or three places in the appellant's brief, the client call was supposed ex post facto judicial notice of the Supreme Court of Kansas."
1961.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3358.63,3379.584,"Suppose they extend it to the county, I suppose, there's ample reason to believe that if the man being tried for defense in a county a hundred miles away from a good lawyer of his own county, said they'll get a better jury trial and a better trial as a whole, if they'd get a man located -- local man, wouldn't it?"
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3381.93,3384.137,"No, it has not, Your Honor."
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3394.821,3395.81,I couldn't --
1961.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3395.81,3398.071,"Yes, that's frequently (Voice Overlap), I agree with you."
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3398.071,3401.647,"But this is not mandatory at all, Your Honor."
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3401.647,3402.866,Mr. Lysaught.
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3402.866,3409.352,Yes.
1961.30,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3409.352,3429.087,"To say that Mr. Martin or one in his class may do office work counseling and the like, but he is stopped only at the courthouse door, is that too your understanding?"
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3429.087,3432.609,"Or the door of Boards and Commission, yes, sir."
1961.30,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3432.609,3449.058,"Now then, what does that do to the Kansas conclusion of competence, saying that he doesn't have competence to handle one class of law business when they admit he has competence to handle law -- other classes or law business."
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3449.058,3456.33,"I think the Supreme Court of Kansas made that distinction in our opinion, if the Court please, on this reason."
1961.30,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3481.401,3498.417,"Now on this, If Martin had competence to do the latter, is to try cases, the day before this rule was passed like Kansas, did he lose it by the rule?"
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3505.255,3530.778,"Your Honor, any law or most law, shall we say, are enacted to cure a situation which has come to the attention of the body, whether it be the Congress of the United States, they pass a law which forbids an Act, which may have been perfectly legal three months before."
1961.30,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3533.267,3535.395,"Well, I'm not talking about legality as opposed to illegality."
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3535.395,3535.819,No.
1961.30,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,3535.819,3539.387,I'm talking about competence.
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3559.809,3561.39,"I think not, Your Honor."
1961.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3576.131,3578.047,Was there legislation?
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3578.047,3578.49,Sir?
1961.30,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3578.49,3580.792,Had there been legislation previously?
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3580.792,3587.85,"In 1935, general statute 7104 was enacted by the Kansas legislature."
1961.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3632.743,3645.978,"But these rules derived from -- or justified as based on or authorized by the 47 statute, weren't they?"
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3645.978,3647.275,Not necessarily Your Honor.
1961.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3647.275,3656.499,I mean could they -- could your Supreme Court -- your Supreme Court -- is this the subject matter as to which legislation could control?
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3656.499,3664.945,I think that the Supreme Court of Kansas under the constitution of Kansas had the inherent part to pass these rules regardless --
1961.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3664.945,3665.068,But if you take --
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3665.068,3665.846,-- of what the legislature is.
1961.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3665.846,3669.529,"If rules were in conflict with the 47 statute, did it?"
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3669.529,3670.229,Sir?
1961.30,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3670.229,3675.37,It did not think that its rules went beyond or in conflict with the 47 statute.
1961.30,1,31627,j_donald_lysaught,,3675.37,3676.395,"No, sir."
1961.30,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3676.395,3680.214,What was the 47 statute?
