1986.86-80,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.826,"We will hear argument first this afternoon in Number 86-80, New York against Joseph Burger."
1986.86-80,0,22446,elizabeth_holtzman,,11.372,14.808,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1986.86-80,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,164.84,178.757,"What would the difficulty be, Ms. Holtzman, of getting an administrative warrant, which of course can be obtained more easily than a warrant in a criminal case on probable cause?"
1986.86-80,0,22446,elizabeth_holtzman,,178.757,185.503,"Well, the simple answer is there is no scheme allowing that in New York State, but beyond that--"
1986.86-80,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,185.503,188.783,There is no authority--
1986.86-80,0,22446,elizabeth_holtzman,,188.783,189.549,--Exactly.
1986.86-80,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,189.549,193.86,--under New York State law to permit obtaining an administrative warrant?
1986.86-80,0,22446,elizabeth_holtzman,,193.86,194.641,Exactly.
1986.86-80,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,280.294,295.052,"There is some suggestion in cases that one of the factors we would look at would be whether there are limits placed on the discretion of the inspectors, in this case the officers?"
1986.86-80,0,22446,elizabeth_holtzman,,295.052,295.708,--Yes.
1986.86-80,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,295.708,304.612,And I wonder if you would like to comment on the extent to which you think that these particular statutes have such limits.
1986.86-80,0,22446,elizabeth_holtzman,,308.626,309.484,Yes.
1986.86-80,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,309.484,318.044,"I don't think I saw any limits at all on the city's ordinance, and I am not sure there are very many in the state statute."
1986.86-80,0,22446,elizabeth_holtzman,,318.044,320.856,Let me address the state statute first.
1986.86-80,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,373.319,381.08,"Well, Ms. Holtzman, doesn't the statute limit to six in six months the number of warrantless searches that may be made?"
1986.86-80,0,22446,elizabeth_holtzman,,381.08,381.346,No.
1986.86-80,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,422.672,430.107,"Why don't they use administrative officers, if this is an administrative search?"
1986.86-80,0,22446,elizabeth_holtzman,,440.588,458.564,"Well, there is nothing in the record, Your Honor, with respect to why New York State used police officers, but they do use Department of Motor Vehicles officers to conduct administrative searches under the statute as well."
1986.86-80,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,515.135,519.384,Who administers this administrative scheme?
1986.86-80,0,22446,elizabeth_holtzman,,531.535,551.199,"There is really nothing in the record that completely explains the administrative scheme, to respond to your question, except to say that the scheme is enforced both by Department of Motor Vehicles personnel."
1986.86-80,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,743.2,746.089,"Do you think the length of time makes a difference, Ms. Holtzman?"
1986.86-80,0,22446,elizabeth_holtzman,,753.181,755.584,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
1986.86-80,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,789.243,803.909,"Ms. Holtzman, before you go on, I am not sure what was the relevance of the factors you mentioned a little bit earlier, that this was an open field in Brooklyn and the entrance was very wide and the public came on."
1986.86-80,0,22446,elizabeth_holtzman,,813.827,814.623,"--No, no."
1986.86-80,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,814.623,821.2,"Well, then how does that have any... how does that have bearing to your case?"
1986.86-80,0,22446,elizabeth_holtzman,,821.2,826.197,"The regulatory scheme itself, we argue, is reasonable."
1986.86-80,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,847.501,873.569,"Well, are you inviting us to hold that this is okay, at least where what you are doing is going into an open field that has a 20-foot entrance and where the public come on, but it might not be okay if it were walled in, if it were an inside premises, if the public was only admitted through a narrow door and after checking their credentials or whatever?"
1986.86-80,0,22446,elizabeth_holtzman,,879.925,882.346,"--They are not determinative, Your Honor."
1986.86-80,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,900.542,901.854,It's not the whole industry.
1986.86-80,0,22446,elizabeth_holtzman,,913.615,914.896,Perhaps I didn't make myself clear.
1986.86-80,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1018.791,1032.378,"May I just on that last argument, I'm not really sure I follow it because if, as your opponent contends, the statute is unconstitutional, then the dismantler who keeps the records could show them and say, but I'm not going to let you look at anything."
1986.86-80,0,22446,elizabeth_holtzman,,1032.378,1034.222,--That's true.
1986.86-80,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1034.222,1046.81,"So then, he's really no better off by not keeping records than if he kept records, so he has not created an additional expectation of privacy by refusing to obey the law?"
1986.86-80,0,22446,elizabeth_holtzman,,1046.81,1059.461,But the statutory scheme creates a low level of expectation of privacy because vehicle dismantlers are required to keep books and records.
1986.86-80,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1059.461,1059.789,Right.
1986.86-80,0,22446,elizabeth_holtzman,,1059.789,1068.459,"And can expect that there will be an inspection, not only of the books and records but of the inventory to match against the books and records."
1986.86-80,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1085.638,1095.213,"It doesn't give him any higher expectation of privacy than one who keeps records and says, I am going to violate the law by not letting you see the vehicle because I think the statute is unconstitutional?"
1986.86-80,0,22446,elizabeth_holtzman,,1095.213,1099.804,"Well, you could make the argument, the statute is unconstitutional."
1986.86-80,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1100.976,1102.397,It's certainly not a frivolous argument.
1986.86-80,0,22446,elizabeth_holtzman,,1102.397,1110.784,"--That's not a frivolous argument but it wouldn't depend, therefore, on the privacy interest in an inventory created by not keeping records."
1986.86-80,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1127.121,1129.917,I see.
1986.86-80,0,22446,elizabeth_holtzman,,1129.917,1130.792,I reserve the balance of my time.
1986.86-80,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1130.792,1133.51,"Thank you, Ms. Holtzman."
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,1135.587,1138.429,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-80,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1202.109,1210.387,"Well, don't you think in Colonnade and Biswell, one of the purposes of the law enforcement officers was to discover some evidence of crime?"
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,1210.387,1228.566,"Yes, and Mr. Chief Justice, the petitioner falls back to try to dilute that concession in this Court, falls back on the argument that there may be some secondary administrative value to these so-called inspections."
1986.86-80,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1263.052,1269.393,"Well, what does the word ""immediate"", modifying the word ""purpose"", add to the word ""purpose""?"
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,1269.393,1287.293,"--Well, it was their prime goal in this case, was to uncover evidence of crime, Mr. Chief Justice, and this Court has never held that when the prime goal was to uncover evidence of crime, that the search warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment was unnecessary."
1986.86-80,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1287.293,1290.027,Don't you think that's the prime goal of the administrative scheme?
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,1300.834,1306.113,"Justice Scalia, I don't think that that's their prime goal."
1986.86-80,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1314.688,1319.904,Why are they administering this scheme?
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,1325.839,1326.183,No.
1986.86-80,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1326.183,1332.477,"The whole purpose of it is to prevent people from chopping up stolen vehicles, isn't that the whole purpose of the entire--"
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,1332.477,1334.243,"That's correct, but that's administrative."
1986.86-80,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1350.048,1351.845,"--I must say, I don't see the distinction."
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,1373.991,1374.194,No.
1986.86-80,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1388.563,1397.748,"I think Justice Scalia's question was addressed to the purpose of the administrative scheme, not whether it required a warrant or not."
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,1397.748,1410.571,"Well, if we can go back to Biswell which is so heavily relied upon by the petitioner, petitioner ignores the evolution of the law in the most recent cases of the Court, by the way, but I'll get back to that."
1986.86-80,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1429.11,1430.61,"--Well, what difference does that make?"
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,1430.61,1433.702,Because it comes from an administrative agency.
1986.86-80,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1435.748,1438.528,"Well, what is an administrative statute?"
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,1444.433,1451.883,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we're trying to bring out that an administrative statute serves a strictly administrative purpose."
1986.86-80,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1457.068,1465.377,"Well, when these people walk in... when the inspectors walk into the yard here and they say, do you have your police book, the guy answers no."
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,1468.781,1469.187,--Yes.
1986.86-80,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1480.48,1494.646,"So, any time you have an administrative statute or, as you call it, an administrative scheme, the requirement requires the keeping of records and someone is going to come around to see if you have records and they ask you the question, do you have any records, you answer no."
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,1496.756,1517.606,"Yes, but the difference between that and the actual search for evidence of the crime is that the New York Court of Appeals saw fit to draw the line at that point and to say that it would be quite all right for the police to ask to inspect the records, but not to go further to try to seek out criminal evidence."
1986.86-80,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1517.606,1525.9,"In other words, if a man complies with the law and keeps records, they can be inspected but if he doesn't keep records the police are stopped stone cold?"
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,1525.9,1527.648,"Well, they are not."
1986.86-80,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1546.922,1549.093,"Well, they could perhaps get a search warrant."
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,1557.933,1559.105,"Treasury agent, yes."
1986.86-80,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1559.105,1563.15,And they are the ones with the authority to enforce that Act?
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,1563.15,1566.211,"Yes, but Mr. Justice White, again a Treasury agent--"
1986.86-80,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1566.211,1570.304,"And furthermore, the agent was accompanied by a policeman."
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,1570.304,1571.99,"--Well, that's true."
1986.86-80,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1581.767,1588.062,It doesn't turn on... or it didn't seem to me to turn on the fact that he was to be considered an administrative officer--
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,1588.062,1589.498,--He was connected--
1986.86-80,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1589.498,1590.294,--rather than a policeman.
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,1592.153,1599.01,"--The Treasury agent again, Mr. Justice White, is someone who is an administrative enforcement agent."
1986.86-80,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1601.65,1602.025,He's got power of arrest.
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,1602.025,1605.211,"He has power of arrest, but not general police duties."
1986.86-80,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1615.8,1624.547,You assert that this would be perfectly okay if they had used administrative officers instead of policemen?
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,1624.547,1625.671,"Well, that gets to part two."
1986.86-80,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1625.671,1630.763,"Even though, as I think the whole purpose of the statute is to uncover evidence of crime?"
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,1630.763,1631.653,Yes.
1986.86-80,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1812.721,1815.392,"Mr. Mahler, can I ask you a question?"
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,1848.16,1849.363,We don't believe so.
1986.86-80,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1858.969,1875.54,"What if they refined it by saying, there shall be created within the police department an auto inspection division... an auto inspection administration headed by a lieutenant who has been on the force in auto work for five years or more, and then he had the authority to give the warrant?"
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,1875.54,1879.538,"Well, we urge that that's to the entire point of this."
1986.86-80,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1897.22,1898.343,"Well, let me amend it once more."
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,1918.071,1924.083,As long as the prime focus is not to gather evidence of crime.
1986.86-80,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1924.083,1934.579,"Well, it's to conduct a lot of inspections which will discourage people from engaging in this sort of activity, in criminal activity, and catch them if they do engage in it?"
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,1934.579,1944.842,"It's just too fine a line to draw, we would urge, the difference between someone who is basically a cop and someone who is basically an administrator."
1986.86-80,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1944.842,1950.058,"So, it's not that the absence of an administrative warrant; it's the fact they used police officers?"
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,1950.058,1951.339,"Well, no."
1986.86-80,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1961.411,1967.3,"And if you asked the administrator, whoever it was, what's your job, what do you think he'd say his job was?"
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,2007.988,2008.861,I would agree.
1986.86-80,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2008.861,2015.062,So you are... I don't think you'd be contented if there was an administrator who did the same thing that the policeman did here.
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,2017.046,2021.638,His immediate purpose as--
1986.86-80,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2021.638,2025.09,--But doesn't it have to be his immediate purpose under this law?
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,2028.682,2036.32,--I think that the law is to regulate and not to take the further step of actually gathering the evidence of a crime.
1986.86-80,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2036.32,2057.123,"Well, Mr. Mahler, for many years, I don't know if they're still doing it but I think it was the Harrison Act, required all pharmacies to keep a poison register where you had to sign if you took out any of a number of scheduled substances, and I daresay there were inspections provided to see if the poison registers were kept."
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,2066.87,2070.494,"Well, the New York State Court of Appeals actually drew that line."
1986.86-80,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2120.52,2122.721,"Well, here there were no books to compare."
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,2122.721,2123.127,Here there was nothing.
1986.86-80,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2127.578,2129.719,"Well, you know, I don't know who conceded what."
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,2133.482,2140.121,"But the whole idea of it was, there was no purpose at all."
1986.86-80,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2165.174,2171.873,Did you argue the case in the Court of Appeals?
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,2171.873,2172.092,"Yes, I did."
1986.86-80,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2172.092,2177.544,And did you argue it on a state constitutional basis?
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,2177.544,2178.59,"I did, yes."
1986.86-80,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2181.01,2184.541,"And did the state court deal with that at all, or just passed it?"
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,2184.541,2186.337,"Yes, they did."
1986.86-80,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2186.337,2193.381,And preferred to put it on the Fourth Amendment?
1986.86-80,1,41766,stephen_r_mahler,,2193.381,2194.287,Yes.
1986.86-80,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2198.801,2201.815,"Thank you, Mr. Mahler."
1986.86-80,2,22446,elizabeth_holtzman,,2205.079,2221.183,"Mr. Chief Justice, I'll just take one or two minutes simply to point out that the purpose of the statute and the purpose of the administrative scheme is not to uncover evidence of crime in a particular case."
1986.86-80,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2295.293,2304.759,"Ms. Holtzman, are you familiar with the laws in other state that deal with this same problem, generally speaking?"
1986.86-80,2,22446,elizabeth_holtzman,,2304.759,2306.586,"--Yes, Justice O'Connor."
1986.86-80,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2307.18,2310.287,Some 33 states?
1986.86-80,2,22446,elizabeth_holtzman,,2310.287,2311.442,"--Yes, 33 states."
