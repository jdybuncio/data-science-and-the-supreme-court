1977.76-864,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,51.978,"We will hear arguments next in 76-864, City of Lafayette against Louisiana Power & Light."
1977.76-864,0,30982,jerome_a_hochberg,,56.063,59.807,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-864,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,336.852,366.569,"Well, suppose a city or make it more comprehensive a state, the state of Louisiana organized an airline with 50 or 75 airplanes, the usual pattern of airline operations and then engaged in monopolistic or price fixing or other statutory violations, what would be your view of that?"
1977.76-864,0,30982,jerome_a_hochberg,,366.569,369.902,I would say that that would not be subject to antitrust attack.
1977.76-864,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,379.978,383.773,"If it was entirely intrastate, do you think they could do?"
1977.76-864,0,30982,jerome_a_hochberg,,383.773,387.129,"If it effected intrastate commerce, I believe they could yes."
1977.76-864,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,387.129,401.453,"Let me change the question a little bit. Suppose a city conspired with a private entity, is not there a language Parker itself that suggests that a city is then liable under antitrust Laws?"
1977.76-864,0,30982,jerome_a_hochberg,,401.453,405.383,I know the language you refer to Mr. Justice Blackmun and I think just the opposite.
1977.76-864,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,485.048,497.877,"Are you going; is your submission that there may be, there is absolute antitrust immunity for all municipal governments in respect of municipal conduct by the officials in the municipality?"
1977.76-864,0,30982,jerome_a_hochberg,,497.877,502.908,"Well, my position is that there is – that the law absolutely does not apply to cities."
1977.76-864,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,506.181,513.619,"Alright, in any event that the Parker v. Brown principle applies to municipalities as it would to state governments, is that it?"
1977.76-864,0,30982,jerome_a_hochberg,,513.619,514.278,That is correct Your Honor.
1977.76-864,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,514.278,515.926,And no exceptions of any kind?
1977.76-864,0,30982,jerome_a_hochberg,,515.926,521.317,No exceptions unless Congress sees fit to change that.
1977.76-864,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,523.049,524.756,"Well, may I just ask?"
1977.76-864,0,30982,jerome_a_hochberg,,553.93,555.829,There is a remedy for those private parkings.
1977.76-864,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,555.829,560.634,"Well, though – you still think Parker v. Brown applies to --"
1977.76-864,0,30982,jerome_a_hochberg,,560.634,576.341,"I believe it does, that is correct Your Honor and rather then use the antitrust laws, there are political remedies and state law remedies, if the public feels that what the city is doing, what government is doing at their behest is not appropriate, not consistent with public --"
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,1778.002,1781.107,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-864,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1974.566,1976.471,I think he did not talk about this case?
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,1976.471,1979.481,"Well, he mentioned [Laughter] Your Honor."
1977.76-864,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1987.92,1990.758,He analyzed them his way and now you will analyze it your way?
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,1990.758,1994.831,"[Laughter] Well, you could look at it that way."
1977.76-864,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2143.726,2156.243,"You get an implication out of the Goldfarb case that if the Supreme Court of Virginia had ordered that action, it would have been exempt?"
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2156.243,2162.695,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think we would have a Bates case in that situation, probably."
1977.76-864,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2226.246,2235.931,"Well, in Parker against Brown, the legislature did not mandate the imposition of these Raisin Quarters, the Quota Board did, did it not, and the legislature simply authorized it?"
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2235.931,2251.015,"Your Honor, I think that the legislature mandated the whole program and it in fact I believe went into a pretty good detail with it, naturally they could not go under detail as to the particular price on a given day or anything like that, but they --"
1977.76-864,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2251.015,2254.797,"But they had to be approved by the growers, did they not?"
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2254.797,2259.954,"Had to be approved by the growers, I do not think that program had to be Your Honor."
1977.76-864,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2266.091,2272.98,"Well, I thought the very existence of, in other words, if a majority Raisin growers voted against that sort of a thing, there would not be any prorating?"
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2272.98,2276.425,"Oh! No, I do not believe."
1977.76-864,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2381.731,2404.733,"Of course all of your analysis so far is based up on the premise that the city here, the municipality here is the equivalent of the bar association in the Goldfarb case of the utility in the Michigan case and of the marketing association of the California (Voice Overlap)."
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2413.761,2422.012,"Well, it surely would Your Honor, but so would a whole bunch of law cases, all standing for the proposition that the city is not be equated with the States."
1977.76-864,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2422.012,2428.136,"Well, there are a whole bunch of law cases if I may induce your phrase the other way to all the cases under the Fourteenth Amendment Rights?"
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2428.136,2440.814,"Well, that is right Your Honor, but I have in mind the commerce clause and antitrust cases and I think that the State and the city are not to be equated, at least that is our position."
1977.76-864,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2440.814,2445.747,"Well, that is the important part of your argument, you have to begin with that hypothesis?"
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2445.747,2448.966,"Indeed, you are entirely correct."
1977.76-864,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2462.346,2480.747,"In other words, in other words Mr. Carter, if the defendant in this case had been the state of Louisiana which was in the electric power business, you would concede that they would not be within the coverage and that if the State would not be within the coverage at all of the antitrust law?"
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2480.747,2486.634,If it was in that business as a result of exercise of its sovereign power and yes --
1977.76-864,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2486.634,2498.94,"Well, if it was in that business, that is a sovereign State to the extent the States are sovereign and if it was in the electric business then you would concede that you could not make any defendant in your antitrust law suit?"
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2498.94,2505.707,"I would as an antitrust matter, yes, I would say they would get grabbed on the U.S. v. California under the commerce clause."
1977.76-864,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2505.707,2524.32,"Well, Mr. Carter, do I get your submission is that unless the particular municipal activity has been what compelled by State legislation, the Parker and Brown does not apply to that activity when performed by the municipality?"
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2524.32,2529.415,"Mr. Justice Brennan, I would not restrict it to just legislative mandate."
1977.76-864,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2530.969,2535.036,"But in any event there has to be some state mandate, you used the word mandate --"
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2535.036,2535.456,Correct.
1977.76-864,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2535.456,2538.1,A particular activity has to be mandated --
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2538.1,2538.705,Correct.
1977.76-864,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2538.705,2542.159,"Carried on by the municipality, it has to be mandate by the state --"
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2542.159,2542.371,That is right.
1977.76-864,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2542.371,2547.342,"Tell me about this, my home state is a home rule state."
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2557.555,2559.327,Yes sir.
1977.76-864,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2559.327,2569.637,That is not mandated by any state legislation or by -- except that it has home rule powers which gives it the broadest possible governmental power.
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2571.26,2575.048,Your Honor I think that --
1977.76-864,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2575.048,2591.029,Suppose for example that city entered into an agreement with the private parking lot operators to fix the price uniformly at both municipally operated and privately operated parking lots?
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2591.029,2603.548,"Your Honor as I read Parker, Goldfarb, Cantor and Bates, the answer is that if that parking lot were not the result of some mandate of the sovereign --"
1977.76-864,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2603.548,2605.275,"Well, it is not more than what I told you."
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2609.914,2613.505,Then Your Honor they would have to abide by the Anti Trust Law in my opinion.
1977.76-864,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2613.505,2640.543,"Mr. Carter, let me read you this sentence out of Parker against Brown, at Page 347 of 317 U.S. and it says if the proposed program is approved by the commission is consented to by 65% in number of producers in the zone owning 51% of the acreage devoted to production of the regulated crops, the director is required to declare the program instituted."
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2646.187,2653.649,"Yes sir because I think that the state directed him on that 65%, legislative act."
1977.76-864,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2661.334,2673.022,"Well, so if -- in other words, authorizing legislation really can be mandatory in your view, so long as the terms of the authorization are complied?"
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2673.022,2690.87,"Oh! I think authorizing legislation Your Honor, could contain a mandate, but I think on the other hand you can have authorizing legislation that does not contain a mandate and I think that you have to look at what the legislative act did."
1977.76-864,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2728.012,2745.845,"Then if the State statute said in any city in Louisiana where by referendum 60% of the voters of the city vote in favor of a municipal electric company, the city shall establish one, that would meet your definition of mandate?"
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2745.845,2746.77,Yes it would.
1977.76-864,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2749.311,2762.358,"But you would demand that the legislature go further than that, would you not, under my brother Rehnquist's example, then that authorizes the city to, when 65% electric solo to go under the electric power business."
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2777.772,2778.485,"Your Honor, that --"
1977.76-864,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2778.485,2779.814,Would you not?
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2779.814,2780.078,Those two things --
1977.76-864,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2780.078,2783.861,"They are not clearly authorized to be in the electric business, are not they, by the State legislature?"
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2783.861,2785.251,"Exactly, so --"
1977.76-864,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2785.251,2787.629,So you would demand something more than that?
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2787.629,2790.167,"Oh! Indeed, to violate the Antitrust laws that means they are exempt --"
1977.76-864,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2790.167,2796.029,"Specific authorization to violate the Antitrust laws, to engage in conduct which otherwise would violate the Antitrust laws?"
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2796.029,2803.458,"Absolutely, I do not think they should just go around making tie in arrangements."
1977.76-864,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2803.458,2805.547,"But that is your test, is it not?"
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2805.547,2807.69,My test is the Goldfarb test Your Honor.
1977.76-864,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2838.405,2852.38,"Mr. Carter, in Cantor a public utility commission in Michigan was an agency of estate, was it not?"
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2852.38,2856.209,"The public service commission was an agent of the State, yes sir."
1977.76-864,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2856.209,2864.109,And it was argued in that case that by virtue of that fact that was State action that argument was rejected by the court?
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2864.109,2883.054,Detroit Edison argued that Your Honor and I think it was obvious from the decision of the Court that the Court considered that the mere filing of a great tariff of that time was not State compelled action by the Public Service Commission.
1977.76-864,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2883.054,2898.657,"The city in this case has authority to make rates to enter contract or in general operated utility or independently, the Public Service Commission of the State, does it not?"
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2898.657,2904.748,"Your Honor, if I caught your question correctly you are asking about the city’s authority?"
1977.76-864,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2904.748,2910.717,I am asking about the city’s authority to operate an electric under the State law?
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2910.717,2912.281,They can set their own rates.
1977.76-864,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2915.395,2938.861,"That they are independent of the State utility commission, because the city has authority to operate the utility that is substantially consistent with the authority conveyed to the Public Service Commission to operate or to supervise the operation of private utilities."
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2947.168,2970.859,"Mr. Justice Powell, in the Louisiana the power of the Public Service Commission to regulate, invest on utility companies and co-opt is what is known as plainary. Our power about commission is plainary, so without trying to be semantical I would say would say that the cities would have certainly no more power than that and possibly less."
1977.76-864,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2970.859,2975.075,(Inaudible)
1977.76-864,1,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2975.075,2978.691,Yes that is right.
1977.76-864,2,44311,william_t_crisp,,3155.049,3158.601,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1977.76-864,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3222.792,3231.163,In terms of the volume to the 485 it is – you have about half of the total or three quarters or one quarter?
1977.76-864,2,44311,william_t_crisp,,3231.163,3243.966,"There are about 200, I have used Chief Justice Burger, who distributed about 90% of the power that is attributable to the investor owned part of that segment."
1977.76-864,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3544.781,3547.767,"Thank you gentlemen, the case is submitted."
1977.76-864,3,15711,andrew_p_carter,,3550.671,3552.594,"I have nothing further, unless the Court has a question."
1977.76-864,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3552.594,3555.083,No.
