1999.98-1464,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.196,"We'll hear argument now in Number 98-1464, Janet Reno v. Charlie Condon, Attorney General of South Carolina."
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,10.318,13.15,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1464,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,116.347,123.823,"As I understand it, General Waxman, the Government says it's the Commerce Clause authority here, not anything to do with the Fourteenth Amendment."
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,123.823,124.363,That is correct.
1999.98-1464,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,127.757,139.594,"And what are the other examples of Congress' choice to regulate States alone, exclusively under the Commerce Clause power, rather than general legislation?"
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,139.594,184.505,"I think Justice O'Connor, that there are few examples of Congress' attempt to regulate States alone directly, as actors as opposed to the traditional preemption doctrine, because ordinarily what States do in interstate commerce is similar to what other people do, and in this case I think it's very important to recognize that this act, the Driver's Privacy Protection Act, is one of a series of laws that stretches from the 1970's until last week, in which of necessity Congress has been dealing with this kind of evolving information age on a sector-by-sector basis."
1999.98-1464,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,184.505,189.686,"Well, that could be the case, but I still have my question, if there are other examples..."
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,189.686,190.227,Well...
1999.98-1464,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,190.227,196.762,of Congress' choice under the Commerce Clause power to regulate exclusively the States.
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,196.762,206.767,"Well, I think the best example that I've come up with, and it's in our brief, is, for example, the regulation of the operation of commercial airports."
1999.98-1464,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,217.957,220.398,"Are you sure of that, as factual predicate for that statement?"
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,224.519,232.295,"No, I think commercial air...  this was actually a subject of debate in the oral argument in Travis, in the Seventh Circuit, and I believe we went back and checked."
1999.98-1464,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,250.766,255.51,But Justice O'Connor's question points up a reaction I had in reading your brief.
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,280.675,282.177,I...
1999.98-1464,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,282.177,285.039,"Under its preemption power, sometimes."
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,285.039,290.523,"Well, I think with respect...  preemption, of course, we're not arguing that this is a preemption case."
1999.98-1464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,339.096,363.53,"Mr. Waxman, this case differs, it seems to me from the airport cases you're talking about and from the pollution emission example you alluded to earlier, in that the collection and retention of data regarding automobile licensing is distinctively a governmental function."
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,386.657,386.806,Well...
1999.98-1464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,386.806,393.459,"It's a purely governmental...  now, maybe this is a Garcia-type concern I'm raising, but I think that is really what is..."
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,393.459,393.68,I...
1999.98-1464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,393.68,395.052,troubling me about the case.
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,395.052,398.683,"I think it is, but let me address your concern, Justice Scalia, as best I can."
1999.98-1464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,442.262,443.813,But we answered that argument in the Printz case.
1999.98-1464,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,443.813,447.776,"In the Printz case, you made the same argument."
1999.98-1464,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,447.776,449.706,"You said, really, this is good to the States."
1999.98-1464,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,449.706,452.519,This is allowing the States to regulate.
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,473.572,492.326,"With all respect, Justice Kennedy, I don't...  I think this is Baker and Fry and not Printz, because the Federal legislation is not using State employees or State governments to regulate third parties, or to act on its behalf."
1999.98-1464,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,515.63,527.438,"But here...  here, the act certainly does in effect impose duties on people in the Motor Vehicle Division, where you get a request for information."
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,537.504,540.586,"Well, Chief Justice Rehnquist, that is certainly true."
1999.98-1464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,584.835,612.394,"General Waxman, your...  the connection with commerce that you rely on here is, as you stated at the outset, simply the fact that information, these lists, once they are released, are an article of commerce, and I suppose that would apply to any information possessed by a State, so the Government could also...  the Federal Government could also regulate the State's use of its tax information and any other State records, I assume."
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,612.394,632.078,"Well, Justice Scalia, I think first of all there would have to be a showing with respect to the particular type of information that was being regulated, that it did...  that its dissemination did, in fact, have what this Court has reiterated to be a substantial effect in interstate commerce, a point that's not contested here."
1999.98-1464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,659.955,664.289,"Well, suppose the Federal Government has a change of heart, and it...  which it does."
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,677.887,680.289,"Well, again..."
1999.98-1464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,680.289,685.441,"Could it pass such a law, that any information in the States' records have to be released?"
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,685.441,694.426,"I don't...  I think that would be very...  I mean, if it were truly anything, it would be very problematic, and it might not be defensible under Coyle."
1999.98-1464,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,694.426,696.279,Wouldn't a closer case...
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,696.279,717.872,"It would also require, I think, either express findings, or it to be obvious to this Court's, quote, naked eye that that law had, or the release of that information had a substantial effect on interstate commerce, but here, it's conceded, there's no question that it does, and not only are these data bases..."
1999.98-1464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,717.872,719.395,"That's the only obstacle, effect on commerce."
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,720.496,720.915,No.
1999.98-1464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,720.915,729.161,"substantial effect on commerce, to the extent there is, the Federal Government could require all of the States to make available whatever is in their files to the public?"
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,729.161,739.076,"Justice Scalia, as we understand this Court's jurisprudence, the Tenth Amendment has three, if you will, independent heads of authority."
1999.98-1464,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,812.203,823.502,"There was no doubt there that commerce was affected, I take it, so that it was not a question of Congress' commerce power, but a question of other limitations on that power."
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,823.502,837.121,"That's right, Chief Justice, and I think with respect to those three heads of authority they all...  they wouldn't even come into play unless the Court were to find, or Congress were to find that it were acting under one of its enumerated powers."
1999.98-1464,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,903.703,918.983,"Well, isn't it one of the fundamental mechanisms of State government that State employees and State officers are accountable to their voters, to their citizens for what they do, and this completely blurs that line?"
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,918.983,920.856,"Well, I think I would..."
1999.98-1464,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,920.856,935.756,"In fact, suppose you have a State which is so insensitive that it's selling this information right and left, by the Federal statute you make it unnecessary to the State voters to control that conduct."
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,935.756,938.367,"Well, Justice Kennedy..."
1999.98-1464,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,938.367,952.637,"It seems to me...  and just to finish the thought...  here the class affected, i.e., the people that have driver's licenses, is congruent almost precisely with those who vote and control their State officials."
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,958.22,961.052,"Well, I'd like to make two points."
1999.98-1464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1103.826,1114.482,"I'm not sure that the...  what the State administrators desire is not always what the State government desires, or what the State voters, much less what the State voters desire."
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1124.259,1127.392,"Well, I don't know that I would make that assumption at all."
1999.98-1464,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1155.789,1174.702,"This discussion is a...  has a little bit of an academic quality in light of recent congressional action, I take it, which now is out there telling the States that if they don't have these privacy protections they will lose Federal transportation funding."
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1174.702,1187.618,"Well, actually, one of the...  Justice O'Connor, we did the best we could in our supplemental brief to explain the operation of this provision of the Department of Transportation Appropriations Act."
1999.98-1464,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1203.009,1205.892,"What is the sanction, then, in the appropriations..."
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1205.892,1221.302,"Well, there is...  I mean, there is no...  the appropriations law, which of course is 1-year legislation in any event, doesn't include a sanction, but it incorporates all of the provisions of the Driver's Privacy Protection Act, which itself has sanctions."
1999.98-1464,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1293.709,1305.606,"What also raises a question in my mind is, if there is this unwritten constitutional principle, the Federal Government may never pass a law that imposes burdens on States that don't also impose burdens on private parties."
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1311.239,1319.257,"Well, if the...  if...  it may very well apply."
1999.98-1464,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1319.257,1328.273,"Surely you couldn't...  surely the Congress couldn't give the States money on condition that they close up all their newspapers, for example, or something like that."
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1334.277,1362.784,"I have been unable to discern anything in the constitutional structure that would require a result as bizarre as saying to Congress, if you want to regulate the dissemination in interstate commerce of the motor vehicle data base, you have to do so in the same law and in the same way as all of the other data bases that are in interstate commerce that you've heard have different promise and pose different problems."
1999.98-1464,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1410.175,1412.957,"General Waxman, may I just clarify one point?"
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1430.047,1465.931,"Well, it's even more solicitous of the State motor vehicle operators, because it allows them to disseminate it for any purpose, provided that they have in place a system...  and this is reflected in section (b)(11) of 2721, provided that they have a system that permits people to, quote, opt out of the legislation, so it is certainly true that the State, any State that puts in place a system that allows people to just check off if they want to opt out can otherwise sell this data base as they have before."
1999.98-1464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1465.931,1474.447,"General Waxman, you know, you mentioned the three separate heads that could overcome the Federal Government's authority to control activities, Printz and so forth."
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1505.297,1506.116,Justice...
1999.98-1464,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1506.116,1510.08,Anybody can look to see who's getting licensed and who isn't getting licensed.
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1510.08,1515.142,"Well, Justice Scalia, I...  this may be repeating myself, but maybe I didn't make my point clear."
1999.98-1464,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1588.78,1589.912,"Very well, General Waxman."
1999.98-1464,0,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1589.912,1590.312,Thank you.
1999.98-1464,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1590.312,1591.763,"General Condon, we'll hear from you."
1999.98-1464,1,18546,charles_condon,,1591.763,1602.381,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-1464,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1660.341,1672.608,"Well, in one sense, though, the act does regulate use of the information by both the States and private parties into whose hands the information comes."
1999.98-1464,1,18546,charles_condon,,1672.608,1674.689,The overall...
1999.98-1464,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1674.689,1676.49,"It is, to a degree, broader."
1999.98-1464,1,18546,charles_condon,,1676.49,1677.551,That's correct.
1999.98-1464,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1679.762,1695.834,"And it is also, in part, about privacy, because your State chooses to sell the information and make it public, and the Federal legislation would say to the State, you can't."
1999.98-1464,1,18546,charles_condon,,1695.834,1705.772,"Well, if I can answer both of those questions, it is possible this act may be severable, because it does...  and we're saying that the Congress should directly regulate individuals."
1999.98-1464,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1749.749,1750.298,It sure is.
1999.98-1464,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1750.298,1750.818,I mean...
1999.98-1464,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3281.813,3283.413,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.98-1464,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3397.617,3404.772,I don't know that the Tenth Amendment applies with all its force to local governments as opposed to State governments.
1999.98-1464,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3409.307,3417.191,"Well, if it doesn't, Mr. Chief Justice, I'd sure like to take another shot at United States v. Printz, which involved sheriffs and..."
1999.98-1464,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3490.114,3490.524,"Thank you, General Waxman."
1999.98-1464,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3490.524,3491.386,Thank you very much.
1999.98-1464,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3491.386,3492.527,The case is submitted.
