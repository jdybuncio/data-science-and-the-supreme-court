1978.77-742,0,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,49.255,54.279,Thank you.
1978.77-742,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,226.012,231.695,"Mr. Attorney General, are there many other States had follow Illinois' lead here?"
1978.77-742,0,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,231.695,236.03,There are other states which follow Illinois' lead.
1978.77-742,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,525.697,540.362,"Now, that you're -- you are saying that the language except for his removal from a home by judicial decree suggests that 606(a) would exclude those people and in such a way (Voice Overlap)."
1978.77-742,0,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,540.362,543.44,"That's -- that is correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-742,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,749.981,758.238,But this also in A7 includes child care institutions too which is not involved in this at all.
1978.77-742,0,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,758.238,760.304,"That -- that is correct, Your Honor."
1978.77-742,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,760.304,764.256,It also includes 603(a)(1).
1978.77-742,0,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,767.759,770.364,"I'm sorry, Your Honor I don't --"
1978.77-742,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,770.364,773.867,"That's my problem I don't understand it, you understood it."
1978.77-742,0,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,773.867,788.363,"Well, our position -- our position is that eligibility is defined in Section 608 in terms of a dependent child or family with whom that child is living."
1978.77-742,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,826.25,838.795,"Well, why is it that in this case, this is not included in all of this language on page 86 and 87, which I don't understand?"
1978.77-742,0,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,838.795,842.328,"Why -- why is what not included, Your Honor?"
1978.77-742,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,842.328,853.369,The respondents in this case.
1978.77-742,0,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,853.369,856.028,"I'm -- I'm sorry, I do not --"
1978.77-742,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,856.028,860.274,You say will not pay this people that are in this case right?
1978.77-742,0,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,860.274,861.436,That is our -- our positions that are not (Voice Overlap)
1978.77-742,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,861.436,863.376,And my question is why!
1978.77-742,0,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,865.352,873.466,Our position is we will not pay them because Congress did not define them as a class which was eligible for assistance under Section 608 of this program.
1978.77-742,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,902.484,906.789,What about -- what about 607?
1978.77-742,0,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,906.789,913.885,"Well, 607 requires that a child lives with a specified relative again, and be deprived of parental support because of his father's unemployment."
1978.77-742,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1086.627,1090.1,Do you think that it means that in the ordinary vernacular clause?
1978.77-742,0,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1090.1,1093.447,Do I think it means unrelated care in the ordinary vernacular?
1978.77-742,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1093.447,1095.447,Yes.
1978.77-742,0,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1095.447,1097.297,I did until --
1978.77-742,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1097.297,1098.644,You read the statutes.
1978.77-742,0,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1098.644,1099.177,Pardon?
1978.77-742,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1099.177,1100.848,Until you read the statues.
1978.77-742,0,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,1100.848,1104.644,"No, no, until I read the dictionary definitions, not until I read the statues."
1978.77-742,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1184.179,1189.233,Very well.
1978.77-742,1,39754,robert_e_lehrer,,1193.119,1196.502,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1293.506,1303.65,"Doesn't -- well, doesn't 608 have in the very language you just quote suggests that Congress was thinking about 2 different classes of children in 608 and 606?"
1978.77-742,1,39754,robert_e_lehrer,,1303.65,1307.237,"No, Your Honor with all due respect, I don't believe that is the case."
1978.77-742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1390.936,1396.679,"But your definition of eligible children comes from 606(a), doesn't it?"
1978.77-742,1,39754,robert_e_lehrer,,1396.679,1410.356,"Well, the definitions of eligible children come from 606(a) but it turns at least in part or eventually on the last paragraph of 608(a) because the state's contention here is as the Court of Appeals noted."
1978.77-742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1416.368,1421.033,"Well, doesn't it also turn on the definition of the dependent child in 608(a)?"
1978.77-742,1,39754,robert_e_lehrer,,1421.033,1436.207,"Most certainly, Your Honor, and what Section 608(a) is doing is to -- is defining a -- is establishing a new program and setting forth new eligibility standards which a child may meet and be a dependent child."
1978.77-742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1440.003,1461.547,"What -- what do you make of the language that your opponent relies on in the first part of Section 608(a) there, that a dependent child shall also include a child who would meet the requirements of Section 606(a) or Section 607 except for his removal from a home of a relative?"
1978.77-742,1,39754,robert_e_lehrer,,1473.547,1481.128,"No, if I understand your question properly, the language that defendant makes so much of his language that supports the conclusion of the children here are eligible."
1978.77-742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1500.793,1504.949,"Well then, you get all your rights from Section 608."
1978.77-742,1,39754,robert_e_lehrer,,1504.949,1535.001,"From Section 608, oh, yes, except that I think as the defendants takes time to point out that the statutory definition does have to be interpreted in the context of its statutory environment particularly Section 601, Section 42 U.S.C., Section 601 which provides that the primary purpose of the program, one of the primary purposes of all the AFDC programs is to encourage the care of dependent children in their own homes or in the homes of relatives."
1978.77-742,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2243.343,2251.76,Probably not relevant but suppose a child was placed in one of the institutions.
1978.77-742,1,39754,robert_e_lehrer,,2272.263,2282.646,"Well, the state is given authority under its licensing standards to approve certain classifications of individuals as suitable caretakers or not."
1978.77-742,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2412.847,2418.29,How many years are left between the enactment of the statute and a promulgation of the regulation?
1978.77-742,1,39754,robert_e_lehrer,,2418.29,2430.775,"Fourteen years and I think the reason why there was a lapse, why there was not an articulated policy prior to â€˜74 though the Solicitor notes the operative policy."
1978.77-742,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2587.405,2590.369,Do you have anything further counsel?
1978.77-742,2,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,2590.369,2591.95,I would like to make one brief comment for rebuttal.
1978.77-742,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2591.95,2592.992,All right.
1978.77-742,2,37739,paul_j_bargiel,,2596.399,2603.914,I would simply like to reaffirm that our position that unrelated persons are not eligible for foster care.
1978.77-742,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2687.23,2687.979,Thank you gentlemen.
