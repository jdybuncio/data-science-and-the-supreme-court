1972.71-1698,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,39.418,"We’ll hear arguments next in 71-1698, United States against Bishop."
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,40.638,44.267,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1698,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,242.606,266.43,"Mr. Stone, just as a matter of curiosity, how do you explain the heavier penalty under 7206 (1), a felony charge, for mere absence of belief in the truth with by then as compared to the penalty for actual knowledge of falsity under 7207 made a misdemeanor?"
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,266.43,271.619,I think that is a very important question in this case Mr. Justice Blackmun to which I think the answer is quite simple.
1972.71-1698,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,295.63,300.559,Or state income tax return that he said here it is and --
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,300.559,305.419,"Well, an income tax return, if properly filed, and signed under penalty of perjury."
1972.71-1698,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,341.394,342.659,Although it’s been that way a long time?
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,342.659,343.477,Yes.
1972.71-1698,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,343.477,348.79,Although I gather the prosecution could be only for a misdemeanor in the case of the signed document as well?
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,348.79,350.729,"That is right, that is right, it could be."
1972.71-1698,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,357.366,360.501,We have any information about what the practice is?
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,360.501,376.158,"Yeah, the practice is ordinarily I am told with respect to income tax returns to prosecute for the felony, but that is -- there is the discretion exercised and what you would expect to be the factors playing into such a discretion or use."
1972.71-1698,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,376.158,382.009,And I take it that with the discretion as exercised by the individual U.S. Attorney?
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,382.009,391.119,By the individual US Attorney presumably in consultation with the fraud Section of the tax division and the Internal Revenue Service.
1972.71-1698,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,425.282,430.079,But I gather other consequences there are other choices --
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,430.079,430.223,Certainly.
1972.71-1698,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,430.223,430.247,-- between felony and misdemeanor besides the prison sentence?
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,430.247,434.463,"Certainly, yes, that is right."
1972.71-1698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,525.655,526.737,Which is what?
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,526.737,532.228,"It’s not really entirely, analytically, but what the function of the jury is supposed to be --"
1972.71-1698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,532.228,541.117,"Not analytically but there has been a good deal of comment over the years but that is precisely the function of a jury, isn’t it?"
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,541.117,541.488,"Well, I don’t—"
1972.71-1698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,541.488,545.532,Or at least that this is a precise aspect of the basic function of a jury?
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,545.532,569.409,"Well, there maybe opinion to that effect Mr. Justice Stewart, but I think all the law on lesser included offense and with this, I think that the respondent does not anywhere disagree nor did the court below disagree, the lesser included offense doctrine is very precisely designed to avoid presenting the jury with a situation in which it has to and makes a choice on a non factual determination."
1972.71-1698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,931.656,933.717,"Well, he does have the Court of Appeals going for him?"
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,933.717,944.281,He has the Court of Appeals going for him Mr. Justice Stewart in what I think is a just an explicable ground which is essentially that misdemeanor us per se --
1972.71-1698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,944.281,945.561,Willfully and misdemeanor makes something that --
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,945.561,958.975,"Willfully and misdemeanor means something different from willfully in the context of felonies, and I think that the decisions of this Court make it perfectly clear that though willfully, the word willfully may mean different things in different, the context of different factual --"
1972.71-1698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,958.975,960.31,That it’s not a misdemeanor felony to that account?
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,960.31,974.084,"Its certainly not, that difference is certainly not based on some arbitrary distinction between felonies and misdemeanors and as I read the opinion of the Ninth Circuit that is virtually all that it says and quite conclusively in support of its holding."
1972.71-1698,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1045.794,1058.885,"Mr. Stone, I understand the respondent contends that another paradox is that the government on other occasions has urged much the same construction of the misdemeanor statute as the respondent now urges?"
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1058.885,1111.484,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the government has -- it is not clear that the government has ever urged in any tax misdemeanor statute a standard of mere carelessness or capriciousness and we deal with that in the reply brief in some detail when we replied ti his brief -- to his opposition to our petition, but in any event, the only statute which he even claims that we have ever applied a standard of carelessness or capriciousness to and the only misdemeanor tax statute is Section 7203, which deals with willful failure to file required documents, a return of filed documents, and an omission, a willful omission of a required act may involve a different and lower standard of evil intent or willfulness than does submission of a known fraudulent document."
1972.71-1698,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1170.085,1173.128,But sadly with two felony statutes?
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1173.128,1175.472,One felony and two misdemeanors I think Mr. Justice Marshall.
1972.71-1698,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1175.472,1178.084,But it was two felony that I know wasn’t it?
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1178.084,1180.545,I think the only felony involved was 7201.
1972.71-1698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1442.747,1447.955,"How about the, did you rely on the Berra Case?"
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1447.955,1448.818,The Berra case.
1972.71-1698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1448.818,1461.496,"B E R R A, I guess it’s pronounced Berra, in which apparently the same elements were eventually needed."
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1478.312,1480.815,"Well, Mr. Justice Stewart, that’s the point --"
1972.71-1698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1480.815,1480.933,Whether the same appear in much longer that --
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1480.933,1485.149,"That is the point here, but there is a rather strong dissenting opinion in that case."
1972.71-1698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1485.149,1486.643,"Yes, I know but all two justices is trying to --"
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1486.643,1504.396,Justice Black and Douglas I think dissented in that case on the ground that they feel that a statute is ought not to be interpreted if possible to render the prosecution with any degree of discretion to choose between which offense when the underlying commissions are identical.
1972.71-1698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1504.396,1510.394,"I suppose boiled down and analyzed, this simply upheld prosecutorial discretion didn’t it, the Barre case?"
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1510.394,1512.579,"Yes it did, it did."
1972.71-1698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1512.579,1514.531,Although it’s not put in quite for those terms?
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1514.531,1525.872,"That is right and that was the ground, but that was the ground that the dissent put it on, but I don’t think that the holding in that case and the majority opinion in an any way contradicts our --"
1972.71-1698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1525.872,1526.539,"If anything, it helps you."
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1526.539,1527.522,"It helps you, yes."
1972.71-1698,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1537.369,1537.758,Attacking that.
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1537.758,1540.485,-- general attack of the lesser included offense doctrine.
1972.71-1698,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1570.326,1587.262,"In the Sansone, didn’t the opinion of Justice Goldberg indicate that there was an important judicial policy not to give the jury too much choice on the selection of the crime and therefore the penalty?"
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1587.262,1587.785,That is right.
1972.71-1698,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1607.519,1610.475,And that would permit the jury to be picking the sentence in that matter?
1972.71-1698,0,40553,richard_b_stone,,1610.475,1610.946,That’s right.
1972.71-1698,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1624.447,1636.549,"Very well, Mr. Johnston?"
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,1636.549,1641.543,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1698,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1930.302,1959.074,"But now, that argument, the argument that the same word might have different meanings, it has a lot of force in statutes that are either unrelated or separated, either in subject matter or either the number of pages and the time of the enactment, but when they’re in two successive paragraphs, isn’t that a little bit more difficult burden?"
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,1959.074,1961.509,Perhaps to all Mr. Chief Justice but this --
1972.71-1698,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1961.509,1969.916,This Court -- most subjects at the same time are they not when the draftsmen are working on it?
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,1969.916,2002.276,"They’re not necessarily thinking I believe that the word has identical meaning in the two sections and I would suggest that this Court in the Spies case, however it is pronounced, in 1943 focused on length, referring back to the older case of Murdock in which the Court in its opinion had a long paragraph to the effect that the word “willfully” is a word of many meanings and as listed a variety of meanings that maybe given to that word."
1972.71-1698,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2067.574,2082.096,"What’s inconsistent with Congress having said the way you willfully file a paper which you don’t swear to, it’s a misdemeanor and when you willfully file a paper which you swear to, that’s a felony."
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,2082.096,2085.719,"Well, I don’t say that is necessarily inconsistent Mr. Justice."
1972.71-1698,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2088.286,2093.062,What do you think “willfully” means in the misdemeanor Section?
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,2093.062,2094.036,My own position --
1972.71-1698,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2094.036,2099.081,"You said it did, you’re not using the negligence now, are you?"
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,2099.081,2100.645,"No, I agree with --"
1972.71-1698,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2100.645,2103.386,Once you have the negligence then what do you have?
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,2103.386,2112.97,I agree with the government that the word “willfully” when used in any criminal Section should mean at least intentionally and deliberately.
1972.71-1698,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2202.365,2203.198,Right.
1972.71-1698,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2203.198,2207.436,Like taking an oath?
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,2207.436,2209.452,"Well, perhaps Mr. Justice."
1972.71-1698,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2209.452,2211.829,"Well, isn’t that the difference between the two Section?"
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,2211.829,2226.473,"The fact is that in our factual situation where we’re talking about income tax returns and in any case where we’re talking about tax returns, the other portions of the law and regulations require that the returns be made under penalty of perjury."
1972.71-1698,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2226.473,2227.144,"Well, that’s what I said."
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,2227.144,2230.062,And the declaration stated right on the return --
1972.71-1698,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2230.062,2234.276,But there is – here isn't the difference between the two Sections?
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,2234.276,2236.669,But in the case where we’re talking about income tax --
1972.71-1698,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2236.669,2250.291,"Willfully file is, my first question was the difference between willfully file in a piece of paper that does purport to be an oath and willfully filing on a piece of paper which isn’t oath."
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,2258.635,2264.449,"Mr. Justice, I think it could mean the same, but my argument to the Court is that it should not be construed by this Court to mean exactly --"
1972.71-1698,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2264.449,2268.287,Then you don’t think Congress did make that distinction?
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,2268.287,2296.158,"I think the Court now has the job of deciding what Congress’ intent was and if I may quote from the Court’s statement in the Achilli case which I think is most appropriate here, this Court said in the Achilli case in 1957, “Our duty is give coherence to what Congress has done within the bounds imposed by a fair reading of legislation.”"
1972.71-1698,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2346.512,2354.703,"Well I understood that the second to misdemeanor was limited to tax returns, it was any tax information you might give?"
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,2354.703,2356.329,"That is correct, that is correct Mr. Justice."
1972.71-1698,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2356.329,2358.381,"Well, that doesn’t require an oath."
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,2358.381,2382.722,"No sir, but the case that we’re concerned with involve tax returns and tax returns are required to be made under penalty of perjury and this Court has held that 7207 applies to the filing of income tax returns so that my argument to the Court is that we do not achieve the kind of coherence that the Court seeks to give to acts of Congress."
1972.71-1698,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2458.937,2481.279,"Mr. Johnston, just as matter of English usage, I take it willfully is an adverb and what does it modify under your construction of the two statutes other than the verbs deliver or disclose in 7207 or make and subscribe in 7206?"
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,2481.279,2487.797,"Well Mr. Justice, I think those are the verbs that it modifies or describes."
1972.71-1698,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2500.693,2513.372,So the variations in the definition of willfully that you adverted to go to the state of mind with which one performs this act?
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,2513.372,2514.869,Precisely.
1972.71-1698,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2540.386,2556.483,"But then under the Ninth Circuits construction, a person who carelessly or inadvertently delivered a return would be guilty which really doesn’t make much sense at all if he didn’t actually intend to deliver the thing."
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,2556.483,2581.627,"I hope I have made it clear, I have some difficulty with that position also Mr. Justice, but I would point out that 7207, the misdemeanor Section by its language applies only to returns, documents and so on known by him to be fraudulent or false so that there is a requirement of knowledge that the document is false which is part of that Section."
1972.71-1698,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2600.531,2610.612,"Well then, doesn’t willfully almost boil down to whether or not the act of delivery is required to be intentional or not?"
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,2610.612,2625.105,"Well, I think that is the question and my suggestion is that perhaps any definition in terms of intentional action is a proper definition of the term in this misdemeanor Section."
1972.71-1698,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2637.824,2647.089,"But reckless means not actually intending, but grossly heedless of the consequences or something like that, doesn’t it?"
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,2647.089,2651.257,Perhaps it’s only a kind of gross negligence.
1972.71-1698,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2653.026,2667.1,"I can see how you can describe someone driving recklessly, but I have great difficulty in seeing how you can describe somebody as recklessly delivering or disclosing something to the secretary knowing it to be false?"
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,2667.1,2676.845,"Well, let me suggest a possible factual situation which might indeed have been the situation here."
1972.71-1698,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2728.429,2736.503,"But that would go to his knowledge of falsity, not to the intentional character of his actual filing of the document, wouldn’t it?"
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,2736.503,2750.359,"Well, Mr. Justice, when I use the term recklessly, I mean perhaps that he proceeded without taking some further steps to satisfy himself of the accuracy or inaccuracy of the return which perhaps he should have taken."
1972.71-1698,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3031.411,3041.209,"Do you think it can be clarified much beyond what was said in that case several years ago at Spies or Spies, like you, I don’t know how this people really pronounce the names?"
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,3041.209,3043.76,I think it badly needs to be clarified Mr. Justice.
1972.71-1698,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3043.76,3049.515,"Well, the point is, willfulness, that means variety of different things depending on its content, isn’t it?"
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,3051.477,3060.29,"But here Mr. Justice, we have the precise question as to what it means in these two particular Sections and I think at least, it has to be clarified to what extent."
1972.71-1698,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3124.38,3137.579,"Sometimes willful can just mean purposeful or not accidental and other times it imports, it’s been mens rea and it really, it always depends on the context?"
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,3137.579,3153.752,"I think that is correct Mr. Justice and of course our argument to the Court is that it means different things and the misdemeanor as it means in the felony Section and that only by giving it a different meaning, the Court really rationalized these Sections."
1972.71-1698,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3153.752,3157.379,"Well, how about Barre?"
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,3162.446,3163.949,That was the Court’s holding.
1972.71-1698,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3163.949,3164.474,That is right.
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,3164.474,3237.12,"And for that reason, the Court said in that case the taxpayer was not entitled, to a lesser included offense instruction, but then the next year in Achilli, this Court held that the misdemeanor Section that was involved there, 616 (a) under the 1939 code, actually did not apply to income tax violations and that ruling was explained in Sansone on the ground in part that this Court would not presume that Congress would enact two Sections covering the same area, one of which is a felony and one of which is a misdemeanor and it was subsequent to Achilli then that, that section was re-enacted in 7207 in the 1954 code and although one might have suspected at that point that it started or forgotten Section that somehow Congress really wasn’t focusing on it, it’s important to know I think that the section was subsequently amended by Congress in 1963, 7207 was amended by adding the entire second half of what now appears in that Section, it was subsequently amended still further by a further amendment to that portion of the Section."
1972.71-1698,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3243.758,3246.033,That was the section involved in Achilli?
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,3246.033,3247.63,It is the successor to the Section involved in Achilli.
1972.71-1698,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3247.63,3249.835,Yes.
1972.71-1698,1,31124,j_richard_johnston,,3249.835,3269.371,"It was changed by removing the language about attempt to evade or defeat which had originally appeared in 3616 (a), so that was taken out and then the Section was moved in to the income tax sections were it now is in the code and in Sansone, this Court held that it applied to income tax cases."
