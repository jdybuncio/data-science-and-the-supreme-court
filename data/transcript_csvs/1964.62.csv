1964.62,0,38003,philip_b_heymann,,54.506,58.116,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,1798.349,1801.42,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1964.62,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1854.298,1859.958,It could be done but it would take 80 minutes to do it.
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,1869.531,1878.479,"Mr. Chief Justice, that would not only destroy the value of the commercial, but I think it would drive Madison Avenue and the broadcasting business and the viewers wild."
1964.62,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1882.404,1882.956,I beg your pardon?
1964.62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1882.956,1884.542,It wouldn't take 80 minutes?
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,1884.542,1890.161,"I don't think it takes 80 minutes either, but I'm suggesting Mr. Chief Justice that --"
1964.62,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1890.161,1893.673,I was just restating what I thought Mr. Heymann said.
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,1893.673,1896.141,"You correctly restated it, Your Honor."
1964.62,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1998.155,2006.202,"Well, isn't it still a part of the question as to whether there was a misrepresentation at all."
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2006.202,2015.566,"We do not here contend before Your Honors today, that there was no misrepresentation in that respect."
1964.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2090.835,2097.726,"Well if you -- I take it then, or do you deny that there are two misrepresentations involved?"
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2110.917,2118.189,"I say there is no representation, Mr. Justice White based on what this commercial was."
1964.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2133.407,2133.679,Yes but –
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2133.679,2142.3,"That it was necessarily real sandpaper or that if it was, the representation was material."
1964.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2146.959,2161.607,"Well, I understand that, but the viewer is expected to think he is seeing an actual proof of the claim. He thinks that here is a razor shaving sandpaper and you intend him to think that."
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2161.607,2162.209,"Yes, Mr. Justice White."
1964.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2162.209,2165.575,"And as a matter of fact, it is false."
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2168.512,2186.594,"I say that the representation that is material is whether, if the viewer were in the studio and if the test were performed before his eyes, and if real sandpaper were used and if it could be shaved exactly as the commercial depicted it --"
1964.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2186.594,2187.679,Yes.
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2187.679,2199.333,"– that, that would all be true, but when they want to put a television camera on the same thing in order to convey that truth to the viewer, they must use a substitute."
1964.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2205.065,2207.571,It's misrepresentation but not material --
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2207.571,2209.567,"Well, either way or both."
1964.62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2219.285,2240.011,"Mr. Sonnett if you please, may I just add, I'm looking at pages 93 to 95 which I understand -- of the record, which I understand is the final order, third and final order and all that we have involved, am I correct about this, is the provision of paragraph 1, neither 2, 3, 4, or 5 of that order."
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2246.289,2257.889,"Well, with respect Your Honor to -- there is a problem with respect to paragraph 3 relating to Bates which is covered by the briefs."
1964.62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2257.889,2258.505,"Oh, I see."
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2258.505,2262.685,And I don't propose to get into that question.
1964.62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2290.271,2296.216,"I don't want to take your time, but I'm just trying to find out which provisions of this order are before us."
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2296.216,2299.005,"Before you, at this time, it is only paragraph 1."
1964.62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2299.005,2299.591,That's what I want.
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2299.591,2301.033,"Of the order, Section 1, Your Honor."
1964.62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2301.033,2301.231,Thank you.
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2304.111,2311.524,"Well, all of one, Your Honor is before you on the main point of the appeal."
1964.62,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2321.153,2335.871,[Inaudible]
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2335.871,2337.584,You do Mr. Justice Goldberg.
1964.62,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2338.29,2339.734,[Inaudible]
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2339.734,2345.837,I think that we must recognize that this proceeding has had a rather peculiar history.
1964.62,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2383.816,2396.947,[Inaudible]
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2396.947,2402.914,"Mr. Justice Goldberg, that question is not before you and I would not so maintain in any event."
1964.62,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2449.434,2455.489,[Inaudible] the way the question is presented to us in the petition for certiorari or in the brief.
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2455.489,2479.468,"Mr. Chief Justice, you've given me the opportunity to comment on something in that regard, which without meaning to twit the government but I think there maybe at least a violation of the spirit if not the letter of Rule 40 (d) -- 41 (d) (1) of the Rules of Practice of this Court."
1964.62,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2701.983,2714.169,I didn't see the broadcast but did it show the application of this cream in the telecast and then show an immediate shaving of the --
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2714.169,2722.531,"There was, Mr. Chief Justice, a pause and this was a matter of some controversy below -- before the examiner."
1964.62,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2758.178,2762.761,The government might want to force us to go farther than we have to go in the case.
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2762.761,2763.673,Yes Your Honor if I --
1964.62,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2763.673,2765.621,And do we have to go that far?
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2765.621,2766.365,I don't think you do.
1964.62,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2766.365,2769.501,You did say they would press us to do it.
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2792.991,2793.455,That is --
1964.62,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2793.455,2798.189,– that we should have to take into effect where the government says we want you to go all the way or not?
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2798.189,2801.633,"Mr. Chief Justice, we do not here dispute that."
1964.62,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2803.217,2804.131,It would be a violation.
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2804.131,2806.21,"It would be sir, yes, yes Mr. Justice."
1964.62,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2806.21,2810.156,This was a violation in this case and it's been held so and you concede that that is correct.
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2810.156,2811.212,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2954.34,2972.077,"[Inaudible] can it ever be, can it ever be as long as the representation is true about the charges to the product and even I suppose, even if you say that you're actually proving it by an actual test."
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2972.077,2977.025,"Mr. Justice White, I would so maintain, but I don't think the Court has to go that far."
1964.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2977.025,2978.783,Well I know but you say that's the question for it.
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2978.783,2979.083,Yes.
1964.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2979.083,2979.662,Ever.
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,2979.662,2982.567,"Well, yes, yes."
1964.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2999.016,3001.088,Even if you say that we're not using a substitution?
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3001.088,3004.736,"Ah, now that's a different question and one not before us."
1964.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3010.183,3013.104,If this is an ever question --
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3013.104,3016.52,"Well, never on the state of facts Mr. Justice White."
1964.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3030.146,3031.428,Why for heaven sake?
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3031.428,3032.481,"Well, I'm not --"
1964.62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3032.481,3034.287,What you're referring to would make a big difference.
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3034.287,3039.467,"Logically, I don't think I need say that it would, but I don't think we need immediate here."
1964.62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3039.467,3041.977,"No, but this is almost implicit."
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3041.977,3042.626,I don't think so --
1964.62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3042.626,3044.051,You don't think so?
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3044.051,3051.194,"I don't think that the representation, in any event I'm sure in my own mind that if there is a representation, it's not material."
1964.62,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3051.194,3059.547,"But don't you have to say that if you made the affirmative representation that this is not a substitute, that you're nevertheless home free?"
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3059.547,3061.581,I don't have to but I will sir.
1964.62,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3071.806,3081.107,"Well it appears it's not saying anything, it means to most people that you're saying affirmatively that, I suppose we must reach it."
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3081.107,3100.01,"Well, Mr. Justice White, one of the great deficiencies of this record is that there is nothing in the record to establish anything with respect to the public's awareness these days of the use of mock-ups and other artifices or substitutes on television."
1964.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3129.711,3132.814,[Inaudible]
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3132.814,3142.118,"Well Mr. Justice Black, it would render the commercials as the court below found, impractical and unworkable because --"
1964.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3142.118,3142.977,"Well, why would it?"
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3142.977,3145.239,The amount of disclosure you would have to make --
1964.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3145.239,3147.237,I'm talking about this case.
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3147.237,3148.224,In this case --
1964.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3148.224,3153.455,All you'd have to say would be this is not real sandpaper.
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3153.455,3159.78,"Well, wouldn't we have to go further Mr. Justice Black and say, this is not real sandpaper because, although --"
1964.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3159.78,3173.197,"I didn't say because, if you just want to tell the truth, why should they want to leave the impression, now I certainly would be left with the impression if I saw this advertisement that they are actually shaving real sandpaper."
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3175.494,3175.952,Because --
1964.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3175.952,3177.032,Impression on the public.
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3177.032,3184.51,"Because by hypothesis as the question comes to you, we can actually shave real sandpaper just as the commercial describes it."
1964.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3184.51,3191.013,"Well, suppose you can, you're trying to impress them that you can shave it."
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3213.871,3223.653,"Because the truth by hypothesis Mr. Justice Black as the question comes to you is that this product can do exactly that, that's the hypothesis."
1964.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3223.653,3250.03,"Assume it can, assume it can, why on this -- why in this note that you just referred us to absolutely sound and that the reader, the man who is going to be impressed is being led to believe that it does just in this fashion when you put it on just like he's put it on there before his eyes and why would an honest businessman want to deceive the public in that fashion?"
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3250.03,3252.582,Because there is no deceit involved.
1964.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3253.47,3254.797,It would be if I saw it.
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3254.797,3258.527,"Well, Mr. Justice Black, may I put it you this way."
1964.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3270.093,3270.799,But I wouldn't go --
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3270.799,3271.278,Were true --
1964.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3271.278,3272.21,I'd seen it on the television.
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3272.21,3272.85,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3272.85,3274.315,I'm not there.
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3274.315,3274.744,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3274.744,3284.307,And what the advertiser is supposed to be doing is doing somewhere within the reasonable range of a truthful representation so that the public will not be deceived.
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3284.307,3298.647,"There is no way that we could communicate to the public the fact that this test had been or could been -- could be performed which is, I think a fair reading also of the commercial."
1964.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3302.049,3304.126,"Can it actually performed, can it?"
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3304.126,3304.862,I beg your pardon sir?
1964.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3304.862,3306.699,Can it actually be performed?
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3306.699,3310.054,"Well not within the time stated, but--"
1964.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3310.054,3322.036,"But what you have is you're saying because it can actually be performed in the longer time, you can let the public look at the television which is all it can look at and leave the impression that it can do it in the time you were looking at it."
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3322.036,3326.08,"No Mr. Justice Black, with great respect that is not the question."
1964.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3335.308,3349.724,"No, no, I'm not say that you're defending them, but I'm trying to get back to the principle that the Court long ago said that you must take the most incredulous person that's looking at that advertisement and not try to deceive him."
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3349.724,3356.696,"Well, to tell the truth by use of a substitute cannot possibly be deception, I submit."
1964.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3364.08,3379.985,"Well where we differ -- where we differ here is that I don't think its telling the truth because to me what the television is saying is that we assure you right here, we take this sandpaper before your eyes, we put this thing on it, it moistened it and then it shaves beautifully --"
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3379.985,3380.211,But --
1964.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3380.211,3381.508,– and that's not the truth.
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3381.508,3387.783,"No, no, but we're assuming in the hypothetical question you are called on to decide that it can be done Your Honor, that is whole point."
1964.62,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3387.783,3391.354,"Suppose it could, suppose it could."
1964.62,1,33118,john_f_sonnett,,3391.354,3393.744,"If it could, and that's the question before you."
1964.62,2,38003,philip_b_heymann,,3924.672,3936.093,"Mr. Chief Justice, I -- my bewilderment is that I sit in that chair and I can agree practically with everything the respondents say."
1964.62,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3973.446,3982.231,[Inaudible] short of why the use of this possible remedy for what you're talking about?
1964.62,2,38003,philip_b_heymann,,3982.231,3989.803,"Your Honor, I'm trying to get across that the order, if you look at it bars misrepresentations that you're furnishing proof."
1964.62,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3989.803,3994.513,I know but suppose --
1964.62,2,38003,philip_b_heymann,,3994.513,3998.411,Justice Goldberg's suggestion by the way I take it takes you right out of the order.
1964.62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4002.991,4005.808,What Justice Goldberg read wouldn't be truth?
1964.62,2,38003,philip_b_heymann,,4005.808,4006.369,That it was a reproduction?
1964.62,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4006.369,4008.484,It's a reproduction of an actual test.
