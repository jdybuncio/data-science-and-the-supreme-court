1984.83-1750,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.733,We will hear argument first this morning in United States against Miller.
1984.83-1750,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,13.433,34.674,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case concerns the degree of correspondence that is required between the proof at trial and the allegations in an indictment."
1984.83-1750,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,758.302,768.86,"What you're saying is that the inflation of a claim could have happened without the phony burglary, but the phony burglary by itself wouldn't have stated any sort of a crime?"
1984.83-1750,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,768.86,805.518,"Well, the phony burglary by itself would not have stated mail fraud without a claim, but I think what I am saying is that from the standpoint of the decision whether or not to indict, if we are going to speculate... and I don't believe we should... but if we were going to speculate about what the grand jury might have done, it seems to me that from the standpoint of the seriousness of respondent's conduct there is very little difference between the offense proved at trial and the offense with the additional element alleged in the indictment and, therefore, such speculation in quite implausible, that the grand jury might not have indicted."
1984.83-1750,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,805.518,821.058,"But, of course, once you get into the business of speculation, I suppose you could speculate that if the indictment was off three or four days as to the time, even though there was not a material variance, you know, one particular juror might have felt well, geez, it was a little longer ago."
1984.83-1750,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,821.058,835.583,"Well, that is, of course... that is, of course, a problem, and as I said at the beginning of the argument, it is frequently the case that there is some lack of correspondence between the proof at trial and the description of the offense contained in the indictment."
1984.83-1750,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,855.7,862.589,"Well, do you agree that we should retain the concept of examining prejudice to the defendant?"
1984.83-1750,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,862.589,863.136,"Oh, absolutely."
1984.83-1750,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,875.161,882.189,Would the result be different if the indictment had not included paragraph 7?
1984.83-1750,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,882.189,891.139,"Well, our contention would be that the conviction could still be affirmed even if the indictment had not included paragraph 7."
1984.83-1750,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,891.139,900.229,"But how, then, would the defendant have known that he ought to prepare by having witnesses as to value and so forth?"
1984.83-1750,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,900.229,903.041,"Well, he could have known by receiving a bill of particulars."
1984.83-1750,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,908.069,915.332,"Oh, but there would be nothing to tip the defendant off under those circumstances that he ought to even be making an inquiry, would there?"
1984.83-1750,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,915.332,918.44,"--Well, there might or might not be."
1984.83-1750,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,936.027,945.071,So you think the underlying purpose of the Fifth Amendment's grand jury indictment requirement is to put the defendant on notice?
1984.83-1750,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,945.071,947.148,"No, I don't think that is--"
1984.83-1750,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,947.148,947.336,No?
1984.83-1750,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,947.336,973.246,"--I think that is a purpose of the requirement, but I think that is a purpose that can be served by other means, and if served by other means... that is, if there were, for instance, a bill of particulars that fully spelled out the theory of the offense as it was to be proved at trial... I think there would be no reason to reverse the conviction simply because the defendant got one form of notice rather than another."
1984.83-1750,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1011.449,1018.119,"Mr. Frey, could I go back for just a second to your suggestion that the indictment would have been sufficient even without paragraph 7?"
1984.83-1750,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1041.515,1045.514,"Well, I think it's clear that if paragraphs 2 through 7 were all out there would be no problem of misleading."
1984.83-1750,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1047.888,1056.181,"--But would you say the indictment, this conviction could stand if the indictment included paragraphs 1 through 6 and not paragraph 7?"
1984.83-1750,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1056.181,1067.225,"I wouldn't say that the conviction should be permitted to stand, but I will admit that in that kind of case I would have a problem with Stirone and the Court would need to reexamine the Stirone case."
1984.83-1750,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1067.225,1073.441,"Because then there would presumably be no reason to ask for a bill of particulars, because he would have thought well, the issue is whether there was really a burglary."
1984.83-1750,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1073.441,1073.801,I understand.
1984.83-1750,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1085.062,1087.343,Let me ask you this also.
1984.83-1750,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1097.103,1097.994,That's correct.
1984.83-1750,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1097.994,1100.665,But did the indictment itself go to the jury?
1984.83-1750,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1103.007,1113.785,"They did because respondent asked that they be charged on the... that is, there was a request by the prosecutor to strike or not submit to the jury specification 6."
1984.83-1750,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1131.09,1136.947,"Well, that's really what I was going to ask you... what your views are, would be with regard to the correct procedure when this problem develops."
1984.83-1750,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1145.678,1153.519,"That is our view, and we do not ask the Court to distinguish Bain on the ground that there was not an actual physical change in the indictment."
1984.83-1750,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1443.495,1455.349,"Well, on that point, apparently there was some testimony before the grand jury, I gather, that there was an inflated burglary."
1984.83-1750,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1455.349,1455.708,--Yes.
1984.83-1750,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1455.708,1458.41,An inflated loss.
1984.83-1750,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1458.41,1467.798,"Yes, there was, and we have lodged the transcripts of the grand jury proceeding, but I would say that under Costello and so on I don't think it would matter."
1984.83-1750,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1499.347,1506.188,And the prosecutor's opening statement at trial referred to the inflated insurance claim?
1984.83-1750,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1506.188,1509.437,"Only, only to that, in our view, but surely at least to that."
1984.83-1750,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1509.437,1517.325,"Mr. Frey, since you've mentioned the reply brief, I just want to mention one thing in that brief that troubles me a little bit."
1984.83-1750,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1541.362,1556.512,"Well, in this particular case what had happened was we had not raised the matter in our opening brief and in the answering brief the suggestion was made, which was really made for the first time in this Court--"
1984.83-1750,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1556.512,1559.401,"Was it supported by the record, the suggestion that was made?"
1984.83-1750,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1559.401,1560.572,--The suggestion?
1984.83-1750,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1592.137,1607.428,"Well, it seems to me the correct answer to a contention that's not supported by the record is simply that the record doesn't support that contention, not... well, anyway I just want you to know I see this in a number of your briefs lately, this sort of thing."
1984.83-1750,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1607.428,1607.616,Okay.
1984.83-1750,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1687.583,1690.926,Very well.
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,1691.332,1712.713,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, the problem presented before reaching the merits of the question of overruling Bain, as the government seeks to do, is more fundamental for a reviewing court than perhaps any case that I have been able to review and see in this court."
1984.83-1750,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1884.692,1899.966,"Well, I think you can assume we granted certiorari on the basis of the government's petition, your response, and the opinion of the Court of Appeals, which, of course, is written out and not necessarily on nuances that may not be apparent in those papers."
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,1899.966,1914.974,"Well, I do assume that, but what I could not assume and I'm sure was not apparent to the Court is that the government seeks to rely now upon materials which were never mentioned in the petition for cert, let alone the--"
1984.83-1750,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1914.974,1922.52,"Well, I thought the government said it was not relying on it, and it did not ask us to consider that in rendering a decision."
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,1925.487,1945.806,"--He did say that to you because I think that he wishes to be in a position in which he can counter the statement of trial counsel that we were prejudiced without having you look into the matters which indicate that in fact... pardon me, that we were not prejudiced, by having you not look into the facts as they existed below."
1984.83-1750,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2001.862,2019.121,"In this Court I think the practice is if in writing an opinion one is... the author is going to rely for part of the conclusions of the opinion on something that isn't apparent in the record but, rather, is dependent on the statement of counsel, then that is footnoted in the opinion."
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2021.744,2024.602,They do on occasion and they don't on other occasions.
1984.83-1750,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2035.769,2040.597,"Well, all we have before us is the written opinion of the Ninth Circuit."
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2040.597,2046.313,"--That's correct, and it's in that respect that that opinion breaks no unusual new ground."
1984.83-1750,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2069.99,2073.005,What's the difference between one and three?
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2078.972,2082.439,"--Well, ""grossly inflated"" is the language used in the indictment."
1984.83-1750,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2082.439,2093.31,"Well, but you are saying there are three elements that the government charged and one of them, you say, is the burglary, the alleged burglary."
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2095.856,2098.245,"No, I think I'm not being clear."
1984.83-1750,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2098.245,2099.589,I don't think you are either.
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2100.556,2168.731,"Without the mailing, there is no mail fraud."
1984.83-1750,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2170.372,2174.558,--And without the effort to defraud the insurance company there's no mail fraud?
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2174.558,2174.948,That's right.
1984.83-1750,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2199.235,2202.577,And that's what's before us now... the correctness of their decision?
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2202.577,2202.796,That's right.
1984.83-1750,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2255.277,2260.929,And you never... did you make a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence in the Ninth Circuit?
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2260.929,2261.773,No.
1984.83-1750,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2289.232,2292.948,And there was evidence of the increase in the insurance coverage?
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2292.948,2294.87,"Oh, yes, indeed."
1984.83-1750,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2296.508,2297.008,And the mailing?
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2297.008,2300.054,--The witness came and said I am the insurance broker.
1984.83-1750,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2382.177,2393.594,"Well, did the opening statement not focus on the exaggerated insurance claim to the exclusion of the reference to the phoney burglary?"
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2393.594,2396.031,"I have trouble with the word ""focus""."
1984.83-1750,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2408.106,2418.181,"Well, wasn't that clear at that stage, that the government was talking just about the inflated insurance claim in the opening statement?"
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2418.181,2420.166,"No, act to me in the defense of that case."
1984.83-1750,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2512.457,2516.003,"Well, did you move... you say you were misled on that."
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2517.815,2547.193,"--No, on the basis that once that case had stopped, Fisher didn't show, the government rested, we put on the short amount of evidence that we had, which had to do, again, with whether or not Mr. Miller was a man running a substantial copper business and had no motive to fake a burglary, because the jury had kept hearing time after time about inferences, something is faked about the burglary, but he never got quite to the point during the case."
1984.83-1750,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2547.193,2549.833,What was faked was the insurance claim.
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2549.833,2560.094,"Yes, but the government's position in proceeding with that is that the burglary was faked and, therefore, the claim of the burglary, of any burglary at all, was wrong."
1984.83-1750,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2588.942,2589.957,"Let me just interrupt you, if I may, there."
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2606.108,2608.935,I think that--
1984.83-1750,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2608.935,2614.387,"And, therefore, it would seem to me you would have been on notice of the fact that the government was going to prove the copper was not worth $123,000."
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2614.387,2624.15,"--We certainly were on notice that the government claimed that there was no copper on the premises, except for a bale or two, from the material we received."
1984.83-1750,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2650.247,2650.56,"Well, why not?"
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2659.979,2664.727,"--Well, I think this is the problem with the defense of a criminal case in this spot."
1984.83-1750,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2743.71,2747.725,"--Well, I don't see paragraph 7 as an addition or a description."
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2772.494,2773.463,No.
1984.83-1750,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2774.01,2775.337,Why do you say no?
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2775.337,2782.508,--One dollar is grossly inflated when you understand the government's position was this burglary never happened.
1984.83-1750,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2782.508,2783.959,"Well, but--"
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2783.959,2785.084,If... I'm sorry.
1984.83-1750,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2785.084,2796.268,"--Do you disagree with me that the term ""inflated"" suggests an upward shifting of value over an amount which would have been the true value?"
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2796.268,2797.236,Yes.
1984.83-1750,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2800.047,2801.297,You disagree with me on that.
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2801.297,2801.905,"No, I don't."
1984.83-1750,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2801.905,2802.655,Your answer is yes--
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2802.655,2808.84,"I do agree with you that the word ""inflated"" means an upward shifting; ""grossly inflated"" means even more of an upward shifting."
1984.83-1750,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2831.019,2833.378,"--Well, you didn't read the indictment very carefully, then."
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2833.378,2838.141,"Well, neither did the government ask for any instruction to the jury as to what ""inflated"" meant."
1984.83-1750,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2871.471,2876.063,But it isn't the instructions that you rely on to put you on notice; it's the indictment.
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2876.063,2885.84,"No, it is... the indictment starts the notice, but what theory the government will use is evidenced by the ongoing process of the trial."
1984.83-1750,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2904.381,2913.345,"Even before the instructions, you could have cleared that up by more specific allegations in the indictment, couldn't you?"
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2916.609,2921.685,--Discussions were had on a regular basis in attempting to settle this case.
1984.83-1750,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2921.685,2922.95,I'm not talking about off-the-record discussions.
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2926.511,2933.79,We are discouraged in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California from making those kind of motions because they are pursued in discovery.
1984.83-1750,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2933.79,2935.649,Discouraged?
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2935.649,2936.288,I beg your pardon?
1984.83-1750,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2936.288,2938.366,My question is are you prohibited?
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2938.366,2938.632,No.
1984.83-1750,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2952.251,2954.234,"Well, is all of that in the record?"
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2954.234,2954.452,Certainly not.
1984.83-1750,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2954.452,2955.077,"Well, I know it's not."
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,2959.655,2966.073,Because I didn't take the position that the Ninth Circuit misunderstands the case.
1984.83-1750,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3002.34,3006.323,Is a part of this difficulty that the Court of Appeals didn't send for this material on its own?
1984.83-1750,1,31451,jerrold_m_ladar,,3006.323,3007.573,No.
