1989.89-5383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.856,"We'll hear argument first this morning in No. 88... pardon me, 89-5383, Mark Howlett v. Scott Rose."
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,16.093,20.145,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1989.89-5383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,206.097,217.738,"Well, Mr. Beckett, would it be fair to say that another way of presenting... of phrasing the question is whether a state court has to entertain an action brought under Section 1983?"
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,217.738,237.885,"No, Your Honor, we don't think that because we think there's an intermediate ground in which this Court has taken the position that where the suit brought on a Federal claim is a claim which is within a class of claims that the state customarily exercises jurisdiction over."
1989.89-5383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,253.43,266.904,"So your... your position is that the state entertains claims just like this against the State of Florida, but it doesn't entertain a claim against... under Section 1983?"
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,266.904,281.164,"Not against the State of Florida, Your Honor, because one of the distinctions to be made is that although the school board is immune from suit under Florida law, it is not immune from suit under the rulings of this Court under 1983."
1989.89-5383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,281.164,289.686,And so what are the other claims just like this that are so similar that Florida entertains that... that this should be entertained too?
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,289.686,308.565,"If Your Honor please, going back to Claflin against Houseman, an 1876 case in which Justice Bradley rendered the opinion of the Court, the claim there was based on a... an assignment in bankruptcy."
1989.89-5383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,345.606,353.194,"Well, then what are the kinds of claims that Florida courts routinely handle that would cover this sort of claim?"
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,353.194,374.459,"Florida, Your Honor, has a general statute which abolishes or waives the statutory immunity of the state and its agencies in all tort claims except tort claims involving so-called discretion or discretionary acts."
1989.89-5383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,404.495,411.715,Is there a waiver as to torts which were claimed to be violations of the state constitution?
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,414.25,416.286,Not by... not in the legislature.
1989.89-5383,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,596.604,598.806,"Mr. Beckett, could I ask--"
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,628.741,631.527,"Well, that's not the sense in which it's used in Florida, Your Honor."
1989.89-5383,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,662.379,684.412,"Well, why... why isn't there some discretion involved here on the part of the principal as to whether he had authority to make the examination of the car that he did and as to whether the procedures that were provided in the hearings were adequate?"
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,685.862,686.595,There is a--
1989.89-5383,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,686.595,687.212,--judgment implied in that?
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,687.212,693.081,"--There is a distinction, Your Honor, between making a mistake and violating the Constitution."
1989.89-5383,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,729.774,738.212,Didn't he have some discretion to decide whether there was danger that it was going... going to be taken before... before he could get a warrant and before proper investigation could be made?
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,738.212,738.862,"--No, Your Honor."
1989.89-5383,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,738.862,740.029,Didn't somebody have to make that decision?
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,740.029,740.748,No.
1989.89-5383,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,773.635,776.254,"Well, you're making a quite different argument though now."
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,782.208,782.875,--Because he--
1989.89-5383,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,782.875,793.181,--But your initial argument was that no violation of Section 1983 could come within Florida's discretionary exception because there is simply never any discretion to violate the Constitution.
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,794.883,797.501,"--I don't think I've changed that, Your Honor."
1989.89-5383,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,799.085,801.037,"Well, you haven't changed it but your not defending it either."
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,803.155,813.928,"--If, as a matter of fact, there was some reasonable action that could be taken, that was the action which the statute... or which the Fourth Amendment required."
1989.89-5383,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,834.858,849.434,"Mr. Beckett, did you raise in... in the courts below the question whether the complaint against the officials in their individual capacity had been dismissed?"
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,849.434,849.97,"No, Your Honor."
1989.89-5383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,866.562,877.62,Do you... do you know whether Florida courts will entertain 1983 actions against individual officers in their individual capacity?
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,877.62,879.405,We do know and they will.
1989.89-5383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,885.726,906.389,"So in this... in this case you say that even if... even if under Florida law the case against the officials in their official capacity should have been dismissed, in other cases they entertain the suits in the individual capacity."
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,906.389,912.543,"--That's correct, Your Honor, and it's our opinion that such a distinction could have been made with the court in this case."
1989.89-5383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,924.434,932.188,There's... that they refuse to entertain 1983 actions entirely--
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,932.188,932.624,No.
1989.89-5383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,932.624,933.64,--or you can't really say that--
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,933.64,934.174,"No, and I--"
1989.89-5383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,934.174,934.857,--they... they are--
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,934.857,938.175,"--and if I... if I gave that impression, that is not our position."
1989.89-5383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,938.175,938.76,--No.
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,938.76,954.953,"Our position is that where there is a distinction, as there is in this case, between liability under 1983 and immunity under the state law, 1983 controls."
1989.89-5383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,974.451,989.626,"Well, you wouldn't... you wouldn't say that if... if Florida had never waived any of its sovereign immunity for ordinary torts or any other set of torts, you wouldn't say that Florida had to entertain 1983 suits would you?"
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,989.626,991.928,"We wouldn't say it on this basis, Your Honor."
1989.89-5383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1012.826,1014.059,Tort claims... tort claims.
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1014.059,1026.233,"--In this case, tort claims, of which the Federal claim is itself a member, then it may not refuse to entertain that claim merely because it's a Federal claim."
1989.89-5383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1026.233,1041.761,"Well, would a... would a Florida state court have entertained a tort suit by your client against Scott Rose as superintendent of schools for Pinellas County simply based on a violation of state tort duty?"
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1041.761,1044.244,"No, it would not if you mean in his official capacity."
1989.89-5383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1044.244,1044.713,Yes.
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1044.713,1045.213,It would not.
1989.89-5383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1045.213,1052.617,"Well, so why... isn't fair to say that Florida is treating both claims based on the Federal Constitution on state tort law the same here?"
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1057.937,1081.886,"We don't think so, Your Honor, and the reason is... the reason that I enunciated a little earlier, the fact that there is no discretion to violate the Constitution and the only exception to the waiver is the discretionary exception, though we think that as a matter of fact it cannot be brought within the discretionary--"
1989.89-5383,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1081.886,1082.436,Excuse me.
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1097.412,1097.862,--No.
1989.89-5383,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1116.559,1117.059,Well--
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1117.059,1118.709,We say that it couldn't be discretionary--
1989.89-5383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1118.709,1122.546,"--They're immune, but you mean that... you mean they were protected by sovereign immunity."
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1122.546,1123.329,--That is correct.
1989.89-5383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1123.329,1123.779,Yes.
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1123.779,1125.248,That is correct.
1989.89-5383,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1142.008,1166.408,"Well, Mr. Beckett, if a state decided to waive its sovereign immunity, let's say only for intentional torts of any kind, do you think that you would be entitled to bring an action in state court based on Section 1983 for that kind of a tort?"
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1166.408,1173.062,The question would be whether or not the tort we were seeking to redress was intentional.
1989.89-5383,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1173.062,1174.012,"Yes, let's assume that."
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1174.012,1176.098,"If it were, it would clearly fall."
1989.89-5383,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1176.714,1196.511,"Well, you don't think then that there could be any room for saying that a neutral state waiver of sovereign immunity to a limited extent can be upheld even though it's based on Section 1983 in state court?"
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1196.511,1208.069,"--That's really correct, Your Honor, and the reason is the reason I stated, that there is no... there is no authority to violate the Constitution."
1989.89-5383,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1208.069,1215.223,"Well, but that certainly isn't a discriminatory kind of statute, is it... that kind of waiver?"
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1226.031,1234.736,We don't think it's neutral if the only effect of it is to preclude the assertion of a Federal claim which is--
1989.89-5383,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1234.736,1235.819,"Well, that isn't the only effect."
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1244.742,1246.527,--That's true.
1989.89-5383,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1247.877,1250.229,And why isn't that neutral?
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1250.229,1260.185,"Simply because under... under this Court's decision as in Owen, it is not permissible to violate the Constitution."
1989.89-5383,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1263.12,1267.44,"Well, of course, you could file your suit in Federal court, could you not?"
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1267.44,1268.474,We could.
1989.89-5383,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1268.474,1268.974,Yes.
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1268.974,1271.392,That's correct.
1989.89-5383,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1271.392,1274.761,Was there... was there a reason for not filing it in Federal court?
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1274.761,1275.879,"Yes, there was, Your Honor."
1989.89-5383,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1288.604,1292.973,But that puts your client in... this particular client in a bind doesn't it?
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1299.845,1307.333,"That's true, and that was discussed with the client, and we explained to him what we thought we could do with this case."
1989.89-5383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1310.435,1336.518,I read your... I read your brief as suggesting a state may not... may not make itself or its... may not make its agencies or this local... the counties and cities immune... give them sovereign immunity because the Eleventh Amendment doesn't give them sovereign immunity.
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1336.518,1339.72,"Well, as Your Honor knows the Eleventh Amendment has two--"
1989.89-5383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1339.72,1340.406,"Well, I know but--"
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1340.406,1341.039,--has two... two steps removed--
1989.89-5383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1341.039,1344.108,"--you do argue that in your brief, don't you?"
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1344.108,1346.158,--I don't believe we argue it that way.
1989.89-5383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1351.111,1351.494,Yes.
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1351.494,1359.883,"And the second is as result of this Court's recent decision in Will, the state in its agencies are immune in any event."
1989.89-5383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1383.649,1393.79,"Well, what law do you think... you say that... one of your arguments is that the scope of immunity defense under 1983 is governed by Federal law."
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1393.79,1394.873,That's true.
1989.89-5383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1394.873,1397.175,What Federal law determines the--
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1397.175,1397.842,1983.
1989.89-5383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1397.842,1398.392,--immunity in this case?
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1398.392,1399.125,1983.
1989.89-5383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1400.944,1404.146,"Well, tell me how it solves this problem."
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1404.146,1421.024,"--Over a period of time this Court has recognized many immunities under 1983: executive immunity in Tenney against Brandhove, judicial immunity in Ray against Pierson."
1989.89-5383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1425.56,1427.128,"Well, go ahead, go ahead."
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1427.128,1429.714,--a list of them here.
1989.89-5383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1432.431,1440.771,"Well, how does 1983 help you in this case in... in establishing the limits of immunity?"
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1440.771,1446.306,"Well, we start with the proposition that 1983 on its face shows no immunities."
1989.89-5383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1465.72,1479.979,On that basis... on that basis Florida just hasn't any business extending sovereign immunity to cities or its school boards.
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1485.216,1487.383,Extending sovereign immunity.
1989.89-5383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1487.383,1499.708,"Yes, or giving sovereign immunity to... or providing that cities may not be sued for constitutional torts in their... in the state courts."
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1499.708,1500.693,"Now, I'm not sure I--"
1989.89-5383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1500.693,1504.928,You say 1983 forbids that.
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1504.928,1507.797,"--No, I don't think we say 1983 forbids it."
1989.89-5383,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1531.929,1533.297,I see.
1989.89-5383,0,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,1533.297,1546.089,"Therefore, the school boards are not immune under Federal law even though they are immune under state law."
1989.89-5383,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1546.089,1547.041,"Thank you, Mr. Beckett."
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1550.909,1553.61,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1989.89-5383,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1599.723,1612.483,"Well, its language, Mr. Rothfeld, did say an action pursuant to Section 1983 will not lie in state courts."
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1617.685,1620.839,I think it is clearly a lack of jurisdiction in the state courts.
1989.89-5383,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1632.73,1637.931,But the court below didn't really say we lack subject matter jurisdiction.
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1644.268,1647.22,"Well, it said this action will not lie, and it went on to say--"
1989.89-5383,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1647.22,1647.689,Yes.
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1647.689,1654.476,--that Petitioner was asking the Florida courts to recognize an action under Federal law that are not... it does not otherwise recognized.
1989.89-5383,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1654.476,1660.464,"Well, do state courts in Florida have jurisdiction over any Section 1983 claims?"
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1660.464,1661.53,"Yes, they do."
1989.89-5383,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1682.995,1687.031,"Well, what is the extent of the waiver in Florida?"
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1691.685,1703.659,"Well, let me say as a preliminary matter, I think Petitioner is not well placed to make his argument about discrimination here because he did not make it to the state courts, which could have authoritatively settled it."
1989.89-5383,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1778.874,1782.243,"Well, we're not very well equipped to do that here."
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1787.247,1798.97,"Well, I think the opinion on this point is... is clear that... and, again, quoting that petitioner is asking Florida to recognize Federal actions that the state does not otherwise recognize."
1989.89-5383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1844.983,1855.707,"Tell me how you define the extent of the sovereign immunity that is waived, because the statute... it's the statute that waives, isn't it?"
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1855.707,1856.641,That's right.
1989.89-5383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1856.641,1872.003,"And it says that there's a waiver in all actions in tort for money damages against the state or its agents or subdivisions for injury or loss of property, personal injury or death caused by the negligent or the wrongful act or emission."
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1872.003,1889.278,"I... I think that the language that Florida courts have focused on is a portion that makes the state liable in circumstances in which a priva party would be liable and the Florida courts have interpreted that, as we read their decisions, to exclude an area of governmental activity from liability."
1989.89-5383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1894.849,1903.938,You mean... you mean... you just... you just can't sue a city for damage to your property?
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1903.938,1908.842,"--I think you can't sue a city for law enforcement, public safety--"
1989.89-5383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1908.842,1913.263,I didn't... well... for damage to your property?
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1913.263,1917.365,"--One can sue a city for certain types of property damage, negligent property damage--"
1989.89-5383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1917.365,1918.983,Or intentional property damage.
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1918.983,1941.413,"--Well, I think that the line draw by the Florida courts is very similar to the traditional distinction between governmental and proprietary actions and an action taken by a city employee which is said to make the city liable, which is of a sort that the Florida courts would characterize as governmental, as I think the action in this case is, simply will not give rise to liability."
1989.89-5383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1941.413,1949.253,Can they... can you... under... can you bring a suit under Florida law against a police officer for beating up... beating up a prisoner?
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1949.253,1953.055,"Against an individual police officer, yes, who is not protected by--"
1989.89-5383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1953.055,1956.49,"Well, how about suing the city for that?"
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1961.91,1962.31,--No.
1989.89-5383,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2121.298,2124.016,"What's the name of that case, Mr. Rothfeld?"
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2124.016,2127.468,Douglas v. New Hampshire and New York Railway.
1989.89-5383,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2127.468,2128.57,Is it... is it cited in your brief?
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2128.57,2134.89,It is cited in amicus brief for the National Association of Counties.
1989.89-5383,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2134.89,2135.89,Which amicus brief?
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2135.89,2136.357,National--
1989.89-5383,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2136.357,2137.224,Is there only one?
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2137.224,2141.128,--For the National Association of Counties.
1989.89-5383,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2177.317,2184.205,Should... should it really be based on the question of whether the state courts have jurisdiction of... of these other actions?
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2211.474,2218.128,"Well, I... the Court has discussed these cases in jurisdictional terms, and that's why we are emphasizing jurisdiction here."
1989.89-5383,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2263.923,2279.619,"Well, suppose instead a Florida statute says that no Florida court shall have jurisdiction to render judgment against... against a state agency or officer in his official capacity for more than $10,000?"
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2279.619,2280.152,Well--
1989.89-5383,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2280.152,2281.469,That's the way it phrased... it's phrased.
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2289.224,2292.859,"--Well, I think that that would be a more... much more difficult case than this one, Justice Scalia."
1989.89-5383,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2292.859,2294.044,Why?
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2294.044,2300.132,I think that the analysis that the Court has used in cases like this... and let me set out a range of cases which are I think are... are instructive.
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2426.779,2428.395,May I ask about the jurisdictional character?
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2434.015,2434.634,--Apparently not.
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2435.567,2444.49,Do you think the school board... the school board answered and the judgment was entered against it and then three years later they could come in and vacate the judgment on the ground that they really didn't have authority to waive jurisdiction?
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2444.49,2448.192,--My... my understanding of the most recent Florida law is that the waiver is not possible.
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2454.512,2460.833,It's even more jurisdictional than the Eleventh Amendment would be in a case involve... brought in the Federal case?
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2462.785,2466.154,--I think that... that is reflective of the most recent law in Florida.
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2466.77,2472.391,Which case do think most strongly supports that proposition that... by the Florida Supreme Court?
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2472.391,2477.227,There was a recent case of the Florida District Court of Appeal and I am afraid I can't give you the name.
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2478.727,2481.263,But is there Supreme Court of Florida authority for the proposition that--
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2481.263,2485.817,--The Supreme Court of Florida has recently denied to answer a certified question on that point by a state court--
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2485.817,2490.269,--But has the Supreme Court of Florida spoken on the point that you're relying so heavily on?
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2490.269,2491.221,--Not to my knowledge.
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2492.504,2493.756,So you're relying on intermediate court opinions?
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2493.756,2498.708,"--Well, I'm not relying on the... absence of the an ability to waive."
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2501.51,2514.669,What is the strongest Supreme Court of Florida authority that you have for the basic proposition that this is a jurisdictional matter and not something that can be waived?
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2514.669,2516.986,"--Offhand, Your Honor, I can't cite you a case."
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2518.888,2519.354,"No, you don't."
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2520.573,2525.792,"--Well, no, we cite a number of cases in our... in the briefs in this case."
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2525.792,2531.512,"--I... the opinion before us in this case is not quite as clear as you suggest it is, I don't think."
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2531.512,2542.987,"Well, I think it is... it is quite clear that the Florida courts do regard sovereign immunity as a defect in subject matter jurisdiction."
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2546.974,2557.913,"Again, what is the strongest Supreme Court of Florida opinion supporting that proposition?"
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2557.913,2560.548,"Well, the question is that can be raised at any time?"
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2561.065,2564.417,"Well, the one you said it's definitely a jurisdictional defect."
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2564.417,2572.589,"--Well, that one case that is cited in the briefs in this case is Schmauss v. Snoll, which is an actually an intermediate court opinion of Florida--"
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2572.589,2575.208,I have been inquiring about supreme court opinions--
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2575.208,2575.641,"--No, I--"
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2575.641,2578.243,"--and I guess there really aren't any right on point, are there?"
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2578.243,2590.968,"--Well, I... it seems to me, Your Honor, that the intermediate court opinions establish Florida law for purposes of this Court, for the purposes of the Federal court determining what Florida law means."
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2594.871,2601.692,"Let me just get one other thing clear in my mind that, had this case been brought in the Federal court, your defense would not be valid in Federal court."
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2602.742,2603.16,--Yes.
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2605.476,2612.949,Your reason for saying this is not discrimination against the Federal cause of action is because you say comparable claims in the state court would also be dismissed?
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2612.949,2614.582,--That's right.
1989.89-5383,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2614.582,2622.038,"Is... is the case you refer to in your colloquy with Justice Stevens, Schmauss against Snoll, is that cited in your brief?"
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2622.038,2624.156,"This, again, is cited in the amicus briefs in the case."
1989.89-5383,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2624.156,2630.727,And that you regard as the strongest case from the district court of appeal on this question of jurisdictional?
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2630.727,2635.529,It's the strongest case that... that is cited in the briefs in this case.
1989.89-5383,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2661.68,2667.566,"Mr. Rothfeld, when you refer to the amicus brief, you mean the one that bears your name."
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2667.566,2668.602,"That is right, Your Honor."
1989.89-5383,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2668.602,2670.335,Because there is more than one here.
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2670.335,2676.839,"Well, the amicus brief for the National Association of Counties, as well as other... other clients."
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2697.853,2711.393,"And you... you mean it's subject matter jurisdiction in the sense that even if they didn't... if they answered and they went to trial and they got a judgment entered against them and then five years later they could come in and set aside the judgment, it that... that strict sense?"
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2711.393,2713.595,That is my understanding of the--
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2713.595,2715.297,You think that's clear from the Florida cases.
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2715.297,2719.666,"--Well, I think that... as I say, the latest authority in Florida establishes that proposition."
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2719.666,2722.451,But your... your position is that it wouldn't matter.
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2729.855,2731.19,That is absolutely... is absolutely right.
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2748.935,2757.874,"I'm still not quite clear on why the jurisdictional argument makes a difference from Justice Scalia's example of, say, a $10,000 ceiling on recovery."
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2763.445,2775.103,"Well, I... I think that the question is whether Congress has wanted to set aside a limitation on the jurisdiction of the... of the court simply by enacting a cause of action and--"
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2775.103,2782.573,"But, I mean, in his example was the state statute purportedly says no state court shall have jurisdiction to enter a judgment in excess of $10,000."
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2782.573,2783.109,--No.
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2791.845,2795.166,I guess the thing I don't understand is why it's a closer question from your point of view.
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2795.166,2803.253,"--Well, a closer question I think only because since the state court is entertaining the action, the question of whether Congress would have wanted to sweep away limitations on that action--"
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2803.253,2813.378,"Well, would this be a different case if in addition to the school board they also had the police department so there were two defendants, so they entertained the action but the question whether they can bring it against a particular defendant."
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2820.948,2834.957,"--Well, I think that the Court would be open to adjudicate the claim as it is against the individual, but not against a party as to whom it lacks jurisdiction... as to whom a judgment cannot run because of it lacks jurisdiction to enter a judgment against that party."
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2835.307,2835.89,I don't see--
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2835.89,2836.807,--lacks jurisdiction to entertain--
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2836.807,2840.009,"--why that's different from lacking jurisdiction to enter an $11,000 judgment."
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,2843.211,2860.155,"--Well, let me... let me move away from that hypothetical because I think the case here is a clear one because, as I said, there is no doubt that sovereign immunity not only is viewed in Florida as being jurisdictional but that it is... historically, traditionally been viewed in all jurisdictions as going to the jurisdiction of the court."
1989.89-5383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2983.386,2993.075,"Mr. Rothfeld, suppose... suppose Florida said our courts are closed to any kind of tort suits against prison officials or guards."
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3007.002,3022.511,"If... if... if the courts where closed in actions against prison officials, based on state law as well as on Federal law so that clearly analogous claims were being excluded and there were no... there was no sign that the state meant to discriminate against Federal claims, I would think that would be a valid limitation on the jurisdiction."
1989.89-5383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3022.511,3028.332,Even though they entertain similar suits against all other officials.
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3028.332,3029.148,I think that's right.
1989.89-5383,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3041.758,3045.31,Do you think there might be an equal protection issue?
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3045.31,3053.298,"--I would think not, Your Honor, if the... in the Martinez v. California case, there was a similar limitation on state claims--"
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3053.298,3060.136,"I think your view would say that they could... they could also immunize parole board officials, too, from parole release decisions."
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3060.136,3063.255,--I would think they could vest their courts of jurisdiction.
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3063.255,3066.873,Divest them of jurisdiction over the kind of claim that was asserted in Martinez.
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3066.873,3071.277,"If it is done evenhandedly, if it applies to state law claims as well, I would think that it... they could."
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3071.277,3072.561,"Well, that case, of course, it did."
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3077.765,3078.148,No.
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3115.39,3115.99,Altogether.
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3115.99,3124.412,"--And suggested in... in its discussion that the test there was whether analogous claims based on state law were excluded, citing to Testa v. Katt."
1989.89-5383,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3124.929,3129.531,"Yes, but it also quoted from a Seventh Circuit opinion which is somewhat inconsistent with your argument."

1989.89-5383,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3209.666,3218.172,"Mr. Rothfeld, just out of curiosity, why would a plaintiff want to get into state courts rather than Federal courts, outside of docket problems, you know, backlog problems?"
1989.89-5383,1,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3218.172,3228.396,"I would think outside of those problems, it is not clear to me, Your Honor, since as I have been stating the elements of the claim are entirely identical whether in state or Federal court."

1989.89-5383,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3426.09,3435.196,xxx example of Florida attempting to immunize from suit only prison officials just wouldn't work.
1989.89-5383,2,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,3435.196,3451.971,"--It wouldn't work because once Florida creates a class as the... Justice Brandeis said, the Alabama courts, the courts of general jurisdiction, they can entertain these claims, it must entertain this claim and not discriminate merely because it's Federal."
1989.89-5383,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3451.971,3456.442,That just all depends upon how you want to define the class.
1989.89-5383,2,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,3456.442,3459.227,"That's precisely correct, Your Honor, and that's where--"
1989.89-5383,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3459.227,3460.311,Don't say it's precisely correct.
1989.89-5383,2,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,3462.346,3462.996,--It's... if we--
1989.89-5383,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3462.996,3468.25,I mean... you... you... you can define the class as prison officials or you can define the class as tort claims.
1989.89-5383,2,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,3468.25,3472.285,--You cannot define it simply as the class which is excluded.
1989.89-5383,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3478.439,3482.843,What about membership in a class of lawsuit defendants?
1989.89-5383,2,25012,gardner_w_beckett_jr,,3486.479,3491.548,That's correct and we think that there is guidance from this Court on that point.
