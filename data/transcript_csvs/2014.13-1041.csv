2014.13-1041,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.039,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 13-1041, Perez v. the Mortgage Bankers Association and Nichols v. the Mortgage Bankers Association."
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,12.058,15.426,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-1041,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,56.753,70.846,"Is there some background principle that should guide our decision here that in -- that in a close case, an interpretive rule is preferable to a regulation or vice versa?"
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,88.824,89.241,Right.
2014.13-1041,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,97.078,97.497,Correct.
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,97.497,98.147,That was conceded below.
2014.13-1041,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,121.51,131.701,"And -- and if I'm an agency head and you're an attorney, do you advise me that interpretative rules are often preferred to regulations?"
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,131.701,134.086,"--Well, I -- I -- I think it depends."
2014.13-1041,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,161.237,166.79,"Well, things have changed so much mainly because of this Court's interpretations."
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,216.205,216.857,Yes.
2014.13-1041,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,228.798,230.131,"Yes, yes, yes, yes."
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,234.2,242.289,"--Well, as we point out in a reply brief, it was -- it was understood that there would be principles of deference to the to -- agency interpretations."
2014.13-1041,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,257.048,264.218,"What about, Mr. Kneedler, this particular kind of interpretation?"
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,303.527,308.314,"--Well, there -- there haven't been that many instances of -- of changes."
2014.13-1041,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,342.768,345.451,What was the was there a particular basis for the change in this case?
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,345.451,345.803,--Yes.
2014.13-1041,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,375.071,378.956,Was there a change in the leadership at the agency between those two interpretations?
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,378.956,379.273,"--Yes, there was."
2014.13-1041,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,383.04,383.758,Change in administration?
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,383.758,385.092,"--Yes, change in administrations."
2014.13-1041,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,385.676,387.394,Isn't that a more likely explanation?
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,387.394,394.048,"--Well, the -- the agency gave a very thorough explanation of the of the reasons for the change."
2014.13-1041,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,394.981,400.202,And they hadn't -- they hadn't done -- they hadn't addressed the same issues the first time in 2006?
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,400.202,417.311,"They had addressed the same issues, but -- but the Court -- or excuse me, the 2006 administrative or excuse me, opinion letter gave what in 2010 the agency thought was an unduly narrow view of what sales activities would consist of."
2014.13-1041,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,417.311,421.215,And it's instructive to look at this Court's decision in Christopher.
2014.13-1041,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,455.02,459.071,Was the 2006 advice contrary to prior advice?
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,459.071,460.69,--Yes.
2014.13-1041,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,477.702,479.568,So is it a second second flip-flop?
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,489.693,494.078,"Well, the question of -- the question of deference, again, is another thing that is not before the Court."
2014.13-1041,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,496.097,508.504,"I understand it's not before the Court, but my perception of what is before the Court would be altered if I didn't think that courts had to give deference to these flip-flops."
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,508.504,520.812,"--Well, the question of how -- this Court's decisions have different formulations about how a change in position may be factored into the question of deference."
2014.13-1041,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,546.545,555.751,"In this case, didn't -- didn't the government say explicitly that its interpretation would be entitled to controlling deference?"
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,555.751,560.536,"Well, that was that was an invocation of the Seminole Rock standard, yes."
2014.13-1041,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,565.44,568.142,"If it has controlling deference, does it have the force of law?"
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,568.142,569.825,"--No, it doesn't."
2014.13-1041,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,592.773,596.392,"It's a formal deference, but as a practical matter, do you think there's much of a difference?"
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,596.392,606.683,--I -- I think there's an important difference because a legislative rule which has the force and effect of law itself prescribes duties for the regulated party.
2014.13-1041,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,620.691,625.662,"Mr. Kneedler, that was -- that's what's been troubling me."
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,652.478,653.212,--No.
2014.13-1041,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,655.18,668.338,You were saying a if you were advising on this issue that some you suggest go by rule and some you -- by legislative rule and some you suggest go by interpretative rule.
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,668.622,671.539,--I certainly didn't mean to suggest that there's no difference between the two.
2014.13-1041,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,672.975,673.741,--There is a fundamental difference.
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,674.225,686.049,"And the way I described it, it's just that there -- there could be situations in which an agency might decide to be very detailed in a regulation and there are situations in which the agency might not want to."
2014.13-1041,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,686.433,712.7,"Could I ask about that, Mr. Kneedler, because it seems to me that part of what's motivating that Respondent's position and their amici's position, and I'm not sure that this maps on very well to the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine, but part of what's motivating it is a sense that agencies more and more are using interpretative rules and are using guidance documents to make law and that there is -- it's essentially an end run around the notice and comment provisions."
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,745.838,746.374,--Okay.
2014.13-1041,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,779.928,796.206,"But I notice you make a point of that on page 4 of your brief, but -- I don't wish to interrupt Justice Kagan's line of questioning -- but it seems to me that we have to assume that there will be many other cases in which there's no safe harbor provision, and you have the retroactivity."
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,796.206,796.539,--Right.
2014.13-1041,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,800.608,805.66,But you -- you don't ask us to confine our reasoning to that kind of case.
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,805.66,805.995,--Right.
2014.13-1041,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,869.449,879.674,"Suppose -- suppose a court had given, quote, “ controlling deference ” to the 2006 rule."
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,882.107,883.442,--No.
2014.13-1041,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,894.314,897.783,--Could you go back to Justice -- answering Justice Kagan?
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,913.377,917.246,"Well, first of all, I mean, I think some may have that impression."
2014.13-1041,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,920.465,921.448,Assume the impression is true.
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,928.618,940.093,"--Well, the -- the D.C. Circuit's decision in American Mining Congress has been given a lot of attention as dividing between what's an interpretative rule and what's a -- what's a regulation."
2014.13-1041,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1059.001,1060.785,Why -- why should there be a difference.
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1060.785,1062.985,--Pardon me?
2014.13-1041,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1062.985,1071.406,"Why should there be a difference between the two, between the treatment of substantive rules and interpretative rules?"
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1071.406,1078.077,"Well, as I said, substantive rules or legislative rules themselves define -- have the force and effect of law."
2014.13-1041,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1094.439,1094.772,"Well, nonsense."
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1103.044,1103.644,--Yes.
2014.13-1041,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1103.644,1107.396,And you want us to give the same deference to both.
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1107.396,1107.679,Yes.
2014.13-1041,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1107.679,1118.304,"So what the court says about, in its substantive rule, is just as much or no less law than what a court says in its interpretative rule."
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1130.695,1143.169,"With respect, Justice Scalia, I think that I think there's a critical difference, and that is, that when the case goes to court, the court is deciding whether the whether the agency's interpretation whether to defer to the agency's interpretation or not."
2014.13-1041,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1160.88,1163.696,I'm rather surprised sorry to wake up so late.
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1243.784,1246.034,"--Well, yes."
2014.13-1041,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1256.008,1258.977,It's called Skidmore very often.
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1258.977,1259.41,"--Well, no."
2014.13-1041,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1271.201,1297.769,"But, Mr. Kneedler, one of the very strange things about this case is that I thought that in SmithKline and I recognize that the government probably doesn't like this aspect of SmithKline but that SmithKline basically says when it comes to Auer deference, if the interpretation has been unstable over time and if the interpretation has created a kind of unfair surprise for private parties, that those interpretations do not get Auer deference."
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1313.361,1318.246,"--Well, I don't think Christopher is -- is dispositive on that -- on that point."
2014.13-1041,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1385.125,1387.493,Or the administrations might have changed.
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1387.493,1390.962,--Or the -- but that may also be an occasion to identify an error.
2014.13-1041,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1391.845,1400.067,"We have to really get into this, because I think it's fascinating and probably we could each write, you know, like a new treatise on administrative law in this subject."
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1404.554,1404.854,--Yes.
2014.13-1041,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1404.854,1406.138,How?
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1406.138,1416.262,"As -- As I said before, this -- this interpretation was challenged not only under the Paralyzed Veterans Doctrine, but also as being substantively invalid."
2014.13-1041,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1437.392,1440.127,But that's often the case when you have a procedural challenge.
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1452.785,1456.321,"--Well, the APA itself has a mechanism to take into account that as well."
2014.13-1041,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1466.029,1466.629,How often--
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1466.629,1480.788,"--noted in Auer -- in Auer itself, that the that the regulated industry States could have petitioned the agency for a rulemaking and agencies that is subject to judicial review."
2014.13-1041,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1525.4,1526.15,"--Thank you, Mr. Kneedler."
2014.13-1041,0,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,1526.15,1526.783,Thank you.
2014.13-1041,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1526.783,1531.554,Ms. Ho.
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1531.554,1535.173,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-1041,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1584.587,1591.091,"Ms. Ho, I think that this entire case has been litigated with everybody accepting that this was an interpretative rule."
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1611.254,1616.225,"--Respectfully, Justice Kagan, I disagree with that with that description."
2014.13-1041,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1655.783,1656.618,Yes.
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1680.583,1683.519,"Again, Your Honor, I would respectfully disagree with that."
2014.13-1041,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1689.806,1690.839,It's not just loose language.
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1706.801,1720.875,"--Your Honor, I think the way that I would understand both Paralyzed Veterans and the cases since it, is Paralyzed Veterans looked at one argument for why what it had before it was interpretative in name only."
2014.13-1041,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1728.814,1752.764,"Why wouldn't the 2006 interpretation, which you say should have stuck, why if this -- if it's -- if it's legislative, if it's substantive, then the 2006 interpretation was equally defective because there was no notice and comment for the 2006."
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1793.257,1804.631,"--Your Honor, I think I think what the status of 2006 opinion, which is not before this Court, I agree with you, it's a difficult question."
2014.13-1041,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1839.053,1852.712,"But I don't understand why we should say go back to an interpretation that didn't get -- I mean, I can see you say the 2010 should have had notice and comment."
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1875.911,1881.463,"--Well, again, Your Honor, we could -- I think 2006 -- again, it's a harder question."
2014.13-1041,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1930.729,1948.773,"I don't follow that because it seems as far as the change, the -- an employer who had relied in good faith on the 2006 interpretation is home free."
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1952.392,1954.861,--Your Honor is correct.
2014.13-1041,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1964.4,1966.019,"But why wouldn't -- well, how could there not be good faith?"
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,1972.139,1975.858,"--In any particular case, the question would be good faith."
2014.13-1041,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1986.815,1992.552,But the employer would say here's interpretative rule 2006.
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2013.466,2015.068,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2014.13-1041,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2021.738,2024.09,"Well, even for that period."
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2026.959,2027.309,--Yes.
2014.13-1041,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2027.859,2034.379,"If he went ahead and did this without any knowledge of the regulation, he would not be in good faith reliance on a regulation, would he?"
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2034.379,2035.748,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-1041,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2035.748,2038.933,But I -- I didn't imagine and maybe I misunderstood Mr. Kneedler.
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2049.739,2050.506,No.
2014.13-1041,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2098.239,2101.524,What changes what is an interpretative rule?
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2136.528,2143.284,"--I think -- the key point and, Justice Sotomayor, you are exactly right."
2014.13-1041,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2161.495,2167.983,But there is a safe harbor in this particular statute and they're trying to comply with the meaning of the safe harbor.
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2167.983,2171.685,I understand that that's the position that the government has taken in this case.
2014.13-1041,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2196.918,2198.502,"No, you keep calling it a law."
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2202.222,2206.108,--I'm actually quoting from the government's brief.
2014.13-1041,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2209.393,2209.793,Well--
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2209.793,2210.495,"The government says,"
2014.13-1041,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2230.806,2232.675,"--Ms. Ho, can I take you back to what--"
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2232.675,2232.958,"--Yes, ma'am."
2014.13-1041,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2232.958,2236.643,"--I thought was the question in this case, which has to do with the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine."
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2236.643,2236.979,Yes.
2014.13-1041,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2236.979,2264.047,"And I guess what I would like for you to do is simply to try to explain that doctrine to me, and on the view that is a doctrine about interpretative rules and what it says is that there are occasions when interpretative rules must be done through notice and comment and that those occasions are when the interpretative rules make a significant revision to a stable -- a prior stable interpretation."
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2267.082,2303.105,"Yes, Your Honor, and operating under the premise that you've asked me to operate under, I think it rests on the premise that where an administrative agency's -- the lawmaking power and the power to interpret that law rest in the same hands, where the agency gives an authoritative, definitive interpretation of what its own regulation means, that meaning--"
2014.13-1041,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2303.105,2303.555,"Well, why--"
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2303.555,2311.943,--is for all practical purposes what the regulation is such that to change that meaning is to change the regulation itself.
2014.13-1041,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2311.943,2318.697,--I think I understand that but it seems to me that that would apply as well to the initial interpretation as to the revised interpretation.
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2328.989,2330.689,"No, Your Honor, I don't think it does."
2014.13-1041,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2379.422,2379.888,"Yes, but again--"
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2379.888,2380.822,--versus the regulation.
2014.13-1041,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2380.822,2389.978,--Auer deference actually is more strong with respect to the initial determination than -- initial interpretation than with respect to a revised interpretation.
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2408.103,2417.043,Because the second -- the second -- the first interpretation under Paralyzed Veterans has to be authoritative.
2014.13-1041,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2455.9,2478.08,"But it seems to me that what you are doing is that in order to make your case, you are saying that the second interpretation deserves the same deference, the same Auer deference as the first, and Justice Kagan's questions seem to me highlight you're -- you are basically running away from the Paralyzed Veterans."
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2478.08,2479.265,"No, no, Your Honor."
2014.13-1041,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2481.249,2490.74,"And it -- it seems to me odd that you would represent your client and say, well, this second interpretation of its stance gets full Auer deference."
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2494.442,2495.742,--And I apologize.
2014.13-1041,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2534.417,2538.553,How -- it may not be a bad idea to run away from Paralyzed Veterans.
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2542.005,2557.865,--I think it's -- it's entirely consistent with -- with Vermont Yankee in that the question in a Paralyzed Veterans is -- is whether a rule -- is -- is -- is legislative or interpretative.
2014.13-1041,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2570.356,2578.443,"Again, unless it is adding procedures if you acknowledge that this is an interpretative rule."
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2578.443,2584.78,And we do not -- we don't acknowledge that and we don't think that is the fairest reading of what the D.C. Circuit cases have done.
2014.13-1041,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2584.78,2595.386,"So it is absolutely essential to your position and to Paralyzed Veterans that this change has to be regarded as a substantive rule, right?"
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2595.386,2596.505,Correct.
2014.13-1041,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2597.638,2601.889,"And if we disagree with that, you acknowledge that Paralyzed Veterans is wrong--"
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2601.889,2606.26,"Yes, I -- I -- I acknowledge that."
2014.13-1041,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2611.68,2618.001,"--Well, Ms. Ho, I think that you've just said that Paralyzed Veterans is wrong then, because, I mean, the D.C. Circuit has two lines of precedent."
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2646.67,2651.905,"Your Honor, what I would say is that American Mining -- the American Mining case--"
2014.13-1041,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2651.905,2652.172,That's it.
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2652.172,2660.828,"--that you are referring to, the fourth the fourth prong of that is is whether the rule is an amendment right--"
2014.13-1041,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2660.828,2663.03,"No, but it's an amendment of the legislative rule--"
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2663.03,2664.23,--Of -- of the regulation.
2014.13-1041,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2664.465,2664.965,--Of the regulation.
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2664.965,2679.807,"And I -- I think the best way to understand Paralyzed Veterans is it is, if you will, a variation on that and saying that you can have an amendment to a regulation."
2014.13-1041,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2684.776,2693.649,I understand the fourth prong of American Mining to be essentially the question of whether the interpretation is in conflict with the previous regulation.
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2693.649,2701.405,"--Yes, Your Honor, and I -- I think Paralyzed Veterans is best understood as recognizing a variation on that."
2014.13-1041,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2713.046,2730.588,"But then, I mean, go back to what Justice Scalia asked you, which is that if you drop this kind of reinterpretation of Paralyzed Veterans and you assume that what we are dealing with here is an interpretative rule, then you don't think notice and comment is required."
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2730.588,2733.607,I think the APA is clear.
2014.13-1041,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2745.683,2746.9,What should we do?
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2810.657,2816.477,"No, Your Honor, I don't think you need to -- to get into all of that."
2014.13-1041,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2838.576,2854.435,--You're -- you're saying that what the question presented boils down to is whether an interpretative rule that radically modifies a prior interpretative rule is a substantive rule.
2014.13-1041,1,56044,allyson_n_ho,,2858.637,2864.976,"--That is our submission and we believe that is an accurate statement of what the D.C. circuit has, in fact, been doing in its Paralyzed Veterans Doctrine."
2014.13-1041,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2871.814,2872.58,"Thank you, Counsel."
2014.13-1041,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2878.901,2879.567,Yes.
2014.13-1041,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2901.58,2904.632,What do you do with the quote from your brief that she revised?
2014.13-1041,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2904.632,2907.818,The brief in the Henry case?
2014.13-1041,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2960.553,2972.611,"Mr. Kneedler, you are not going to go after employers who acted consistent with the prior interpretation between 2006 and 2010 on the ground that they didn't know about the prior interpretative regulation, are you?"
2014.13-1041,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2972.611,2972.911,No.
2014.13-1041,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2989.455,2991.157,Whether they knew about the regulation or not.
2014.13-1041,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2991.157,2991.507,--Right.
2014.13-1041,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2992.357,2995.126,"So you're not -- you're not relying on the good faith exception, right?"
2014.13-1041,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,2999.678,3001.88,"--Well, no, it's not -- it's not -- it's not just generosity."
2014.13-1041,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3012.421,3023.377,So are you -- so are you saying that you would be required to avoid retroactive application even if the safe harbor provision were not in the statute?
2014.13-1041,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3023.377,3029.614,--That's the position we've taken because -- in this case because there is a significant change.
2014.13-1041,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3039.77,3041.089,--We're going to write this down.
2014.13-1041,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3041.089,3041.905,--Pardon me?
2014.13-1041,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3041.905,3045.306,We're going to write this down and quote you in future cases.
2014.13-1041,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3045.306,3052.544,I just -- I just wanted to add a caveat to that is I don't think it would be prudent for the Court to adopt a rule that runs across different agencies.
2014.13-1041,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3057.864,3066.037,"No, the point is that's not right because the provision you're citing requires good faith and you told me it doesn't matter whether they know about it or not."
2014.13-1041,2,22617,edwin_s_kneedler,,3066.037,3072.624,"Yes, because there was a change, but that may not be the case under all programs is the point that I was going to make."
