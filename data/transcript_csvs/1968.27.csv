1968.27,0,23467,edwin_m_zimmerman,,40.816,47.047,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.27,1,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,1890.88,1892.476,May it please the Court.
1968.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2188.209,2197.79,"That would apply to everything, that apply to all over our economy wouldn't it Mr. Seymour, that they need that price information about the competitors --"
1968.27,1,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,2197.79,2204.214,"Of course, otherwise you're asked to fire a cannon without knowing where the target is."
1968.27,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2394.458,2395.09,Mr. Seymour.
1968.27,1,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,2395.09,2396.156,Yes sir.
1968.27,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2396.156,2400.036,You're making --
1968.27,1,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,2400.036,2402.252,Yes.
1968.27,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2402.252,2404.935,Those that are in the lawsuit -- understand?
1968.27,1,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,2404.935,2405.402,Yes.
1968.27,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2405.402,2405.941,(Inaudible)
1968.27,1,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,2405.941,2406.887,Yes.
1968.27,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2406.887,2412.77,"Now, is the same arrangement open to the (Inaudible)"
1968.27,1,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,2412.77,2414.028,I can't answer that.
1968.27,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2414.028,2417.669,But you participate in the --
1968.27,1,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,2417.669,2421.31,I can't answer that but I have no reason to doubt that it is.
1968.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2550.345,2571.41,"Mr. Seymour, I suppose that if there were price uniformity or price stability in this industry, that the effect of the exchange of price information would be some evidence of a combination, conventional antitrust --"
1968.27,1,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,2571.41,2575.949,"Well, I have no doubt it would be pointed to as some evidence of that but you barely need to --"
1968.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2575.949,2579.415,And it could be -- and could be relied on to some evidence of that.
1968.27,1,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,2604.608,2612.533,"Mr. Zimmerman if I understood him said, if you assume the effects, you can establish the restraint and that's the Government's case."
1968.27,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2671.944,2680.733,"Mr. Seymour, did I understand Mr. Zimmerman to say that in addition to the stipulation, in other words, an agreement upon many other findings of fact?"
1968.27,1,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,2680.733,2685.635,"Yes, and if Your Honor will look in volume one --"
1968.27,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2685.635,2690.473,"Well, I notice here at page 183, there are some 326 findings of fact."
1968.27,1,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,2690.473,2701.91,"Well, that the agreed findings begin at page 55 and run on for 150 pages and those --"
1968.27,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2701.91,2703.228,"Agreed finding, was that it?"
1968.27,1,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,2703.228,2704.114,Those are the findings --
1968.27,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2704.114,2704.653,I see.
1968.27,1,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,2704.653,2720.761,"Where the indication in the margin as to whether they were agreed or not agreed and those, the agreed findings are the basis for the trial court's findings and those agreed findings in turn were based upon the underlying stipulation which is also in this record, the several stipulations."
1968.27,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2720.761,2724.881,"But the District Court, did the District Court makes some independent findings?"
1968.27,1,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,2724.881,2725.904,Yes.
1968.27,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3081.873,3082.694,Mr. Seymour --
1968.27,1,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,3082.694,3082.862,Yes.
1968.27,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3082.862,3090.096,Is there anything pro con in the record as to the small suppliers that are not in this group?
1968.27,1,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,3090.096,3092.659,"I think not, but there are small suppliers in the group."
1968.27,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3092.659,3096.24,"No, I mean is there any -- that they were denied this information or anything?"
1968.27,1,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,3096.24,3097.606,"No, nothing of a kind."
1968.27,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3097.606,3098.503,One way or the other?
1968.27,1,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,3098.503,3100.539,It's absolutely neutral on that subject.
1968.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3100.539,3108.384,"Mr. Seymour, is there anything in the record on the price history in the industry?"
1968.27,1,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,3111.546,3124.827,"Well, may I at this time ask those of Your Honors who want to look at Charter two, look at volume three which contains significant information."
1968.27,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3326.664,3343.79,I'm beginning to think that perhaps what the Government is seeking is a perceived rule with respect not to price fixing but with respect to a “combination” to exchange current prices information.
1968.27,1,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,3343.79,3346.365,I think that's -- I think that's perfectly evident.
1968.27,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3376.94,3395.264,"Mr. Seymour, on page 567 on the opinion of the District Court it says, the plaintiff conceives, I think that that's the United States conceives that if it had only part on the complaint that the defendants had agreed to obtain price information it would have no case?"
1968.27,1,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,3395.264,3396.51,Yes sir.
1968.27,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3397.516,3402.424,I take it that what you're saying is the Government is just taking an entirely different position here?
1968.27,1,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,3402.424,3413.083,"Well, the -- I think the Governments position in the lower court was if they just charge exchange “a price information” they would have no case."
1968.27,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3425.912,3445.9,"Well, the Court says, goes on and says that the District Court says that the plaintiff therefore has the additional burden of showing that from such inferred agreement, namely, the exchange price information, the Court should further infer that there was an agreement to use such exchange price information."
1968.27,1,46320,whitney_north_seymour,,3445.9,3457.337,"I think what the Court is saying really is that you have to have a combination which restraints trade and if there was a combination, it didn't show any restraint of trade."
1968.27,2,23467,edwin_m_zimmerman,,3691.354,3697.869,"I'm -- again, I have to give the same answer that Mr. Seymour gave Mr. Chief Justice, I do not know."
1968.27,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3719.534,3725.989,"I understood Mr. Seymour exactly rely on and have to do some exploring, don't they?"
1968.27,2,23467,edwin_m_zimmerman,,3733.893,3753.175,"Well, we picked out all the substantial companies, there were a number of new entrance, I don't know how many of the other companies would have been relatively new entrants and I assume that we chose those on as to whom we had evidence."
1968.27,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3764.66,3775.858,"Well, Mr. Zimmerman, may I take advantage of this to ask you whether you agree that the Government is seeking a per se rule here?"
1968.27,2,23467,edwin_m_zimmerman,,3790.559,3824.499,"No, I think the rule we are advancing here Mr. Justice Fortas is that when you have an industry which is dominated by a relatively, relatively small number of sellers, then the precise exchange of current price information with respect to particular costumers necessarily as an inhibiting effect on pricing because --"
1968.27,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3824.499,3824.667,"Well, is that so."
1968.27,2,23467,edwin_m_zimmerman,,3824.667,3829.865,Of the ability of that small group to visualize the necessary consequence.
1968.27,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3829.865,3831.769,Without any proof as to --
1968.27,2,23467,edwin_m_zimmerman,,3831.769,3832.116,As to effect.
1968.27,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3832.116,3833.287,The effect.
1968.27,2,23467,edwin_m_zimmerman,,3833.287,3833.994,As to effect.
1968.27,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3846.078,3853.731,"Alright, but no proof -- you don't claim that you got any proof in this record as to specific effect on price in the market?"
1968.27,2,23467,edwin_m_zimmerman,,3853.731,3876.833,"Well, yes we have specific findings which indicate that when the information was supplied, the recipient quoted the same price, we have that but we did not even attempt to go into the question of what was happening to prices that it seem to us is not necessary after the Socony-Vacuum case."
1968.27,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3876.833,3882.0,This is (Inaudible) --
1968.27,2,23467,edwin_m_zimmerman,,3882.0,3891.326,"The 18, Mr. Justice Black control 90%, six of the 18 controls 60%."
1968.27,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3897.827,3912.366,Do you submit that (Inaudible) --
1968.27,2,23467,edwin_m_zimmerman,,3912.366,3924.091,"Well, I would assume that one can infer that if they didn't -- perhaps they weren't interested in helping competition and indeed we don't think they were."
1968.27,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3924.091,3936.255,except that the rule (Inaudible).
1968.27,2,23467,edwin_m_zimmerman,,3936.255,3940.609,Maple Flooring Mr. Justice Black is a very interesting case.
1968.27,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3972.751,3973.757,(Inaudible)
1968.27,2,23467,edwin_m_zimmerman,,3973.757,3975.362,I think there were about 22.
1968.27,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3975.362,3976.548,(Inaudile)
1968.27,2,23467,edwin_m_zimmerman,,3976.548,3977.674,I believe so.
1968.27,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3977.674,3980.117,(Inaudible)
1968.27,2,23467,edwin_m_zimmerman,,3980.117,3993.949,"I think they had most of the business but there was no exchange of current or specific price information and the Maple Flooring exchange indeed went on here and we didn't challenge it, that's what the trade association was doing."
1968.27,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3993.949,3995.746,"Yeah, alright."
1968.27,2,23467,edwin_m_zimmerman,,4005.435,4006.691,Yes.
1968.27,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4006.691,4016.632,(Inaudible)
1968.27,2,23467,edwin_m_zimmerman,,4016.632,4020.284,"Oh, we do not claim any evidence that the price went up."
1968.27,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4021.781,4023.757,You said something -- (Inaudible)
1968.27,2,23467,edwin_m_zimmerman,,4023.757,4037.29,I stated that the purpose of the exchange as to explicit information was to avoid unnecessary in terms price cutting.
