1974.73-717,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.958,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in 73-717, Antoine against the State of Washington."
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,15.937,20.037,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.73-717,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,267.624,274.257,"Are those lands, Mr. Morisset, are they subject to taxation?"
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,274.257,276.683,"The alloted lands are not, Your Honor."
1974.73-717,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,278.765,282.18,State of Washington makes no point about -â€“ they are just tax free?
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,282.18,282.301,That's correct.
1974.73-717,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,282.301,283.384,No property taxes?
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,283.384,284.37,That's correct.
1974.73-717,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,292.31,294.439,It occurred on what kind of land?
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,294.439,299.101,"As far as we know this is fee simple land, held probably by an individual."
1974.73-717,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,312.706,316.676,"And is it, it's the land on which the incident occurred subject to state taxation?"
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,316.676,323.439,"It probably is, if it's held by an individual in fee and I think we can assume that it is."
1974.73-717,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,323.439,336.272,"I take it your answer to my question about taxability is based on the trust land aspect rather than only agreement, which provided for tax exemption?"
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,336.272,344.886,"That's partially correct, Your Honor, but the agreement by setting up the allotments would be the document from which that non-taxability flows."
1974.73-717,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,357.881,368.144,"I am focusing on the land, where this hunting occurred, others people, others land members of this tribe permitted to hunt there?"
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,368.144,372.569,"Non-Indians who are citizens to this state would certainly be allowed to hunt there, yes."
1974.73-717,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,377.711,388.198,And there is no question about the States right to acquire licenses or any other restrictions with respect to others than members of --
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,388.198,391.542,"To non-Indians -- that's correct, Your Honor, no question about that."
1974.73-717,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,391.542,408.035,"Mr. Morisset, during my brief tenure on the court I have heard the term alloted lands used in a number of arguments involving Indian cases, and I have tried to read and find out what they meant, I really don't know what that term means, can you define it?"
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,408.035,409.21,"Certainly, Your Honor."
1974.73-717,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,458.119,460.323,And the record title then is in the United States --
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,460.323,473.95,"United States Government, a regular title report which show fee in the United States of America in trust for in either the tribe as a whole or an individual Indian, that's the way the record agrees."
1974.73-717,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,473.95,477.885,And if it is an individual Indian then that means it's an alloted land.
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,477.885,478.934,That's correct.
1974.73-717,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,478.934,480.777,Otherwise it's an ordinary --
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,480.777,481.739,Would be non alloted trust.
1974.73-717,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,481.739,482.997,-- like another reservation.
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,482.997,484.134,"Right, non alloted trust."
1974.73-717,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,484.134,489.414,Isn't there is some cut-off date in the statue that wasn't there or has it been indefinitely extended?
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,489.414,496.826,"There is a variety of allotments statute, the General Allotment Act had a cut-off date which has been constantly and consistently continued by Congress."
1974.73-717,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,496.826,499.001,That (Inaudible) trust would end at sometime?
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,499.001,505.488,"And right, it was originally 25 years, it has been continued, I believe, in 25-year increments possibly more."
1974.73-717,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,507.6,511.162,Would this land under the General Allotment Act or special?
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,511.162,519.741,"This was under a Special Allotment Act, which flowed from the 1892 at the Congress, and the 1891 agreement."
1974.73-717,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,519.741,521.299,"Mr. Morisset, well we've to interrupt you."
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,527.338,528.175,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-717,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,528.175,530.822,And She has a full blooded Indian?
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,530.822,532.571,"She is an Okanogan, yes."
1974.73-717,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,532.571,535.037,"But not a member, not an enrolled member of the tribe?"
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,535.037,538.472,"Not enrolled in this country, no."
1974.73-717,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,538.472,543.126,Do you raise any question about her conviction as such at all?
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,543.126,564.842,"I do not raise any question because the facts which don't appear on the record, because they were not deemed to be material I believe are that she could be no more than an aider or an abettor and my position would be as a matter of criminal law, Mr. Antoine committed no crime, she couldn't very well have aided and abetted him in such a known act and she was along for the ride, in other words."
1974.73-717,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,564.842,582.666,"There maybe something in the record as distinguished from the printed appendix, but I look at the findings on page 12 of the Appendix, the findings entered by Judge Tennis, the only place in those claims."
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,603.089,603.789,Well that is the situation --
1974.73-717,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,603.789,606.752,(Voice Overlap) this --
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,606.752,610.094,I don't want to answer the question but I suppose you could Your Honor.
1974.73-717,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,615.476,622.242,Well I find no findings or conclusions that in effect --
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,622.242,623.827,"That's correct, Your Honor, there is no more --"
1974.73-717,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,623.827,624.543,-- find her guilty --
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,624.543,630.73,"There are no more findings on the record that have been other than printed in the Appendix as to her, to Mrs. Antoine."
1974.73-717,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,630.73,631.417,Well --
1974.73-717,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,631.417,632.93,You are making no point to this?
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,632.93,634.365,No.
1974.73-717,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,634.365,634.436,Why?
1974.73-717,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,634.436,649.861,"More specifically, finding four refers to defendant Alexander Antoine in conclusion of Law 2 and 3 speak of defendant in the singular."
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,653.689,655.048,Ah --
1974.73-717,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,655.048,658.197,"This, of course, is my point throughout."
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,670.81,684.104,"Well as, I think in here is deficiency but I think that more central, more important point is that Alex Antoine committed no crime and when his conviction falls, Mrs. Antoine will of necessity falls."
1974.73-717,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,687.574,692.893,"But if you do that, she is stuck if you don't raise the secondary point --"
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,692.893,693.458,That's correct.
1974.73-717,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,693.458,704.727,"Well then your questions presented on page four of the jurisdictional statement, you certainly didn't raise any question like that, did you and that's all that's before the court."
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,704.727,705.922,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1974.73-717,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,705.922,715.444,"In any event, my question shall be regarded as to state counsel and perhaps he can explain it?"
1974.73-717,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,715.444,735.905,"Before you leave the question of these alloted lands that Mr. Justice Rehnquist was puzzled about, when the land is alloted, will you clarify for me, is that alloted the way a conveyance of the farm land, piece of farm land is alloted by meats and bounds description or other specific description?"
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,735.905,740.777,Now that's -- that's a difficult fact question because it differs from reservation to reservation.
1974.73-717,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1058.519,1061.46,"I gather you have to be a member of the tribe, an enrolled member?"
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,1061.46,1062.557,That's correct.
1974.73-717,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1062.557,1073.253,"I notice, as the wife in discussing with Mr. Justice Blackmun, you have a footnote in the jurisdictional statement that she is an Indian but not an enrolled member of the Tribe."
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,1073.253,1074.096,That's correct.
1974.73-717,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1074.096,1078.292,"Well, how does that place your position as to --"
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,1078.292,1084.051,Our position on that would be the same as it is been in fishing litigation in the State of Washington.
1974.73-717,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1090.071,1094.966,"Do you mean they have the benefit of the reservation, will they?"
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,1094.966,1097.218,Yeah the reservation of hunting rights.
1974.73-717,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1109.763,1112.018,Suppose she were hunting on her own?
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,1112.018,1117.102,I still think that the spouse should be allowed to exercise the right.
1974.73-717,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1124.777,1128.192,Well what's the law it had been where the reservation apply?
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,1128.192,1131.018,There is been no holding by this Court.
1974.73-717,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1131.018,1133.138,How about the Washington courts?
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,1133.138,1148.882,"The only holding that I know of is the holding of Judge Bolt in US v. Washington in which he held that, I don't know if he held in the original decision or subsequently that the spouses should be allowed to participate in the treaty right in that case."
1974.73-717,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1224.754,1228.341,"But it's not on tribal land, is it?"
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,1228.341,1239.022,"No, but it's a tribal right, it's a tribal right as is all of reservation, usual and accustomed hunting or fishing rights."
1974.73-717,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1281.05,1286.718,"But I think, that non-Indians could hunt in the same area consistently with the treaty, couldn't they?"
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,1286.718,1289.485,"Subject to State Law, yes."
1974.73-717,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1289.485,1290.362,So the non-Indians.
1974.73-717,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1290.362,1291.033,(Inaudible) was it?
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,1291.033,1291.355,No.
1974.73-717,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1291.355,1292.274,This isn't a treaty.
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,1292.274,1292.686,"No, no."
1974.73-717,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1292.686,1296.823,"There were no treaties after 1871, that was sale."
1974.73-717,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1296.823,1297.948,A sale.
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,1297.948,1299.707,Act of Congress.
1974.73-717,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1299.707,1302.813,"Well, the Act of Congress simply appropriated money, didn't it?"
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,1302.813,1305.514,Yeah and ratified the agreement of 1891.
1974.73-717,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1305.514,1307.741,In hike variable?
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,1307.741,1308.72,Yes.
1974.73-717,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1308.72,1311.452,In intern?
1974.73-717,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1311.452,1316.35,"Now, this is the first time you have made reference to ratification and you are relying on that?"
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,1316.35,1317.496,"Yes, well --"
1974.73-717,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1317.496,1320.874,But before you made the reference only to the appropriations?
1974.73-717,0,36341,mason_d_morisset,,1320.874,1329.272,"I thought, I said, my only remarks that it was ratified in 1906 by any Appropriation Act, I believe I made that statement."
1974.73-717,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1461.831,1468.85,Very well Mr. Morisset.
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,1470.169,1473.232,Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1974.73-717,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1525.101,1531.864,"Well, perhaps because if she was referred to in the judgment that followed the findings of the facts and conclusions involved?"
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,1531.864,1533.695,"Yes, I presume so."
1974.73-717,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1541.765,1549.868,"Well, Mr. Coniff, if he could not be prosecuted, could she not a member of the -- not enrolled member of the tribe?"
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,1549.868,1564.065,"In my opinion a non-enrolled member of an Indian tribe, in this particular case, a Canadian Indian is fully amenable to state law in exactly the same way as any other non-member or non-Indian might be."
1974.73-717,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1564.065,1578.895,"So, that the reversal here, is a little one, would not mean that she would be -- the affirmance here would not mean necessary that she couldn't be prosecuted?"
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,1578.895,1590.205,"I believe that it would logically follow assuming her status is as is stated in the United States' Memorandum as amicus curiae, that is a non-enrolled member or a native Indian --"
1974.73-717,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1590.205,1594.543,"Well, that's stated too in her jurisdictional statement?"
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,1594.543,1595.076,Yes.
1974.73-717,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1595.076,1596.488,She is not non-enrolled --
1974.73-717,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1596.488,1598.634,But were the charges filed against her?
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,1598.634,1602.276,The original charges were filed against both Mr. and Mrs. Antoine.
1974.73-717,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1602.276,1604.366,What did they allege about her?
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,1604.366,1611.221,"That she was aiding and abetting in the -- there were originally two charges filed, one was dismissed by stipulation."
1974.73-717,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1611.221,1622.231,"Well, so really, they would have to prosecute her, file another charge if they wanted to prosecute her because she was charged as an aider and abettor?"
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,1622.231,1630.416,"Yes and in as much as these matters are misdemeanors under the laws of the State of Washington, the statute limitations would have run. So, as a matter of reality there would be --"
1974.73-717,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1630.416,1638.444,"So if she is found -- if he is found -- if he wins here, she is out of trouble?"
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,1638.444,1645.188,"She is out of trouble as far as I can say, because of the statute of limitations in any event."
1974.73-717,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1645.188,1648.564,"But, if he doesn't win here, what happens to her?"
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,1648.564,1650.129,If he does not win here?
1974.73-717,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1668.649,1676.953,"Well, I take it from your remarks that you are doubtful on the part of the state as to the integrity of this judgment against her?"
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,1676.953,1679.373,"As to Mrs. Antoine, yes."
1974.73-717,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1679.373,1680.609,This judgment anyway.
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,1680.609,1686.734,"Yes, because the statement of facts does reflect that she was not present at the trial."
1974.73-717,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1686.734,1701.392,"That would be -- this record would suggest at least the possibility that that's a jurisdictional matter and that whether it was raised or not the court could take notice of the absence of jurisdiction over her, could they not?"
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,1701.392,1707.371,"Yes, I would submit that may would be the case Mr. Chief Justice."
1974.73-717,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1707.582,1714.484,Do you think it is a matter of state law?
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,1714.484,1716.277,With regard to the -- my respondent.
1974.73-717,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1716.277,1719.726,With regard to Mrs. Antoine?
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,1719.726,1721.542,With regard to the statute of limitations?
1974.73-717,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1721.542,1729.776,"Yes, well also with regard to the effect of the judgment honor and with respect to whether she have to be re-prosecuted as an aider and abettor?"
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,1729.776,1741.183,"Yes, first I of all, I would question the jurisdiction of the trial court in the first instance to enter any sort of a judgment and sentence upon an individual who was not present."
1974.73-717,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1768.932,1784.385,In any event I take that you are -- you share my concern anyway about the integrity of the judgment against her and almost concede that so far as she is concerned the reversal is indicated.
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,1784.385,1792.761,In as much as the court in the first instance might well lack jurisdiction because of her failure to have appeared in the case.
1974.73-717,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1792.761,1802.099,"Well you are also here, are you not, to defend the judgments that have been entered by the Supreme Court of Washington which affirmed the judgment of conviction against her?"
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,1802.099,1802.585,Yes.
1974.73-717,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1802.585,1808.168,"I mean, you can leave it to the other side presumably to attack the judgment."
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,1808.168,1809.824,"Yes, I would presume that would be true."
1974.73-717,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1826.42,1829.054,Was this one argued to the Supreme Court of Washington?
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,1829.054,1830.859,The status of Mrs. Antoine?
1974.73-717,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1832.382,1833.807,"So, it didn't pass on it, did they?"
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,1833.807,1838.068,"No, they did not Your Honor."
1974.73-717,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1838.068,1840.143,This is unbelievable.
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,1853.821,1862.931,"The appellants did not raise the question, and did not, it was not argued by appellants and I believe that counsel for appellants has so indicated."
1974.73-717,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1937.859,1942.887,"This isn't an unlicensed hunting, it's a hunting out of season?"
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,1942.887,1959.559,"Yes that is correct, and the owner of the land would likewise have to comply with that hunting season regulation which was promulgated by the Game Commission of the State of Washington pursuant to statutory delegation by the legislature."
1974.73-717,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2191.233,2194.709,Where in the brief or records is that passage that you are reading from?
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,2194.709,2202.643,"I am reading from page 12 of the brief of Appellee, the blue brief."
1974.73-717,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2202.643,2223.91,"The chronology as I understand it was this agreement in the 1891 and then legislation in 1892 which almost rejected the agreement implicitly so, at least, one House of Congress thought that the land hasn't been the Indians to sell."
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,2231.498,2232.774,That is my understanding of --
1974.73-717,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2232.774,2245.384,"1891 agreement, 1892 legislation which was inconsistent with the agreement and then 1906 law that was consistent with the agreement and purported to be ratified."
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,2245.384,2253.217,"A caveat on purported to ratify, which leads to the next leg of my argument."
1974.73-717,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2262.662,2264.035,That is the 1871 statute -- ?
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,2264.035,2294.023,"-- prohibiting, saying further, saying no more Treaties and if we assume for purposes of argument that the Commissioners who executed the Treaties purported to execute a treaty, the question is, whether or not, under the Constitution of the United States Article 2, Section 2, Clause 2 which requires rectification by two-thirds of the Senators present, whether or not in fact there was a ratification legally and constitutionally of the 1891 agreement"
1974.73-717,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2294.023,2296.179,"Well, an agreement needs to be a treaty."
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,2301.749,2302.047,That is correct.
1974.73-717,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2302.047,2311.658,"And in that agreement for the purchase of your land it can give you certain remaining rights in it, like the right to hunt or fish, even though it may well belong to the government."
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,2316.388,2358.533,"It could be a reason -- I think we must be careful to distinguish between the question of dealing with the police powers of the state, the State of Washington being admitted into the Union in 1889, and presumably coming in to the union on any equal footing with the sister states and to distinguish between the Rights of Government or reserved police power, if you will, the right to regulate the hunting activities over the land in question and the right in this nature of an easement, the right to go upon others land and hunt, does not deal with the subject matter of the right of the state to govern or the right of the state to apply the laws in question to the Indians in the extinguished Northern half."
1974.73-717,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2358.533,2383.336,I suppose your position would be that if the government after Washington had attained statehood had allowed homesteading of certain land that in owned and/or would ultimately passage into private hands through a patent that the Federal Government couldn't have accompanied that pattern by a guaranteed to the homesteader that they would never be the subject to police power at the state of Washington?
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,2383.336,2389.539,"That is correct Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that is my position."
1974.73-717,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2511.967,2516.223,"That's what divided the two, it had divided the two house of Congress by 1992."
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,2516.223,2527.525,"Yes, the reading of the legislative history in that regard would seem to me it lead to that conclusion."
1974.73-717,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2629.437,2630.146,What comes into?
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,2630.146,2645.441,"Public Law 280, which is the state's assumption of jurisdiction over Indian reservations, it was enacted by Congress in 1953, became effective in August, 1953."
1974.73-717,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2808.847,2825.685,"What was the provision of the federal constitution, you referred to, which you said that limited right of Congress to impair any right of the State after 1889?"
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,2825.685,2856.535,"With regard to the jurisdictional argument was Article 1, Section 8, Clause 16, and I submit to the Court that the decisions of this Court and construing this constitutional provision, make it clear that once a jurisdiction of a state vests or is acquired, that it can may only be retroceded to the United States with the express concern of the State Legislature."
1974.73-717,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2922.091,2925.091,"Privately owned by a non-Indian presumably, is that right?"
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,2925.091,2926.318,"Yes, it is."
1974.73-717,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3119.505,3123.515,"You referred us to Article 1, Section 8, you say Clause 16?"
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,3123.515,3124.81,Yes.
1974.73-717,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3124.81,3128.35,Is that the one on organizing arming and disbanding the militia?
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,3128.35,3131.537,"No I am sorry, I have the wrong."
1974.73-717,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3134.52,3142.964,"Authority of training the militia, according to (Inaudible) described by the Congress."
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,3142.964,3144.502,"The Clause 17, Your Honor."
1974.73-717,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3145.146,3153.914,"You mean, the last purchase by the concerned or legislature, the State was the same shall be relating to the Fords Magazines, arsenals etc?"
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,3153.914,3155.458,"Yes, that is the clause."
1974.73-717,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3166.095,3169.187,They aren't numbered so it makes it a little difficult sometimes.
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,3169.187,3170.981,"Yes, I am very sorry for that."
1974.73-717,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3203.437,3209.989,"Had that subjected on the just in a little Footnote 7 of their brief, it's unencrypted form (Inaudible)"
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,3209.989,3211.057,Yes it is Your Honor.
1974.73-717,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3211.057,3214.823,I really don't understand that you are making the argument.
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,3214.823,3217.296,Yes.
1974.73-717,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3365.442,3367.483,Your time has expired now Mr. Coniff.
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,3367.483,3381.904,Thank you.
1974.73-717,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3381.904,3390.209,"(Inaudible) and if you look at the index, don't do it now, but in the index page references, I think without exception are all wrong."
1974.73-717,1,29636,joseph_lawrence_coniff_jr,,3401.112,3410.085,I apologize on behalf for the inconvenience caused to Court by that error.
1974.73-717,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3410.085,3412.428,"Mr. Morisset, do you have anything further?"
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3412.428,3412.674,Just briefly --
1974.73-717,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3412.674,3418.298,Mr. Morisset before you get started I wish you would clear up one point to me?
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3423.358,3435.672,"We are not sure if it's privately owned, but it certainly is not state land, nor a Federal land nor an Indian allotment of any kind, which probably leaves on privately owned land."
1974.73-717,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3435.672,3439.052,Now if it were privately owned your position would be the same?
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3439.052,3440.307,That's correct.
1974.73-717,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3440.307,3458.479,Now there is a statement in the Supreme Court of Washington's opinion to the affect that if privately owned land had been fenced then there would have been no question of the right of that private owner to forbid Indians from hunting on it.
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3463.719,3468.038,I think that's dicta in the States Court's opinion and I disagree completely.
1974.73-717,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3487.315,3496.449,"That was to get to the stream, and the stream didn't belong to the private owner, but here the land on which the deer was shot and killed that did belong to the private owner."
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3507.029,3508.673,"Well, that's a different case of course, but I think --"
1974.73-717,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3508.673,3510.272,"Well, that is the case, isn't it?"
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3510.272,3513.222,"Well, it could this case, that will be the next case I am sure."
1974.73-717,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3531.474,3543.662,"They was not crossing the land to get somewhere else, he is hunting the deer on this land, and then killing it on the land, and he is shooting off a gun on the land and therefore presumably or at least hypothetically he maybe endangering other people?"
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3543.662,3544.739,That's possible.
1974.73-717,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3589.884,3593.148,"Going too far what kind of a term is that of, what specifically?"
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3593.148,3601.071,"No of departing from hunting, and engaging in some activity which endangers public peace."
1974.73-717,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3632.021,3646.041,"Most states that I am familiar with Mr. Morisset allow posting, that is a private land owner can say even though you have got a hunting license, even thought it is hunting season, you can't hunt on the land that I privately own."
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3653.326,3654.812,I think if the facts are similar --
1974.73-717,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3654.812,3657.371,Is the answer is yes or No?
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3657.371,3662.789,I can't answer yes or no because it's a difficult fact law question as it was in Winans.
1974.73-717,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3679.57,3684.028,"He doesn't have the right on his way to shoot a deer, am I right?"
1974.73-717,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3684.028,3688.852,"Well if it is a question of can he shoot the deer on this land, not can he pass over it?"
1974.73-717,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3688.852,3689.839,Or he would --
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3689.839,3691.452,"Alright, I understand that."
1974.73-717,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3698.931,3700.709,Even if (Inaudible) posted again?
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3700.709,3702.406,"Yes, yes."
1974.73-717,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3705.141,3705.635,But supposing --
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3705.635,3709.661,-- that says that the patents will be issued not subject to this agreement.
1974.73-717,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3709.661,3712.511,And patent and posted --
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3712.511,3713.25,Pardon me.
1974.73-717,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3713.25,3721.586,"Well, suppose it was fenced and posted, the private land, you could still climb over the fence and shoot a deer."
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3721.586,3727.289,Nothing in the agreement says that this will apply only to unclaimed or unposted lands.
1974.73-717,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3728.699,3733.104,This hunting took place on that post service --
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3733.104,3733.989,Pardon me.
1974.73-717,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3733.989,3735.829,Was this in the Colville National Park?
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3735.829,3741.954,"It was not on forest land, Mr. Justice Douglas, as far as we know, no, it does not appear that way in the maps."
1974.73-717,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3741.954,3751.348,But is there anything in the record that shows what the deer population of this area is?
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3751.348,3752.988,"No, there is nothing."
1974.73-717,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3764.618,3775.214,"Has there been a case before involving this kind of language in anything other than a treaty filed up, in the other cases, there are all involved treaties."
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3780.27,3781.402,That's correct.
1974.73-717,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3781.402,3783.312,"Now, has there been a case in this court before involving --"
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3783.312,3790.036,"To my knowledge, there is no case involving an act of Congress as to this particular point, this particular kind of right."
1974.73-717,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3791.956,3794.729,"Well, it's not restricted kind of right."
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3804.329,3804.678,That's correct.
1974.73-717,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3804.678,3811.237,"And my question is, is there any previous case in this Court dealt with any such language in a --"
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3811.237,3812.275,Act of Congress --
1974.73-717,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3812.275,3814.18,-- or in a Purchase and Sale agreement?
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3814.18,3826.848,"Not that I am aware, well, though there have been other purchases in the sale subsequent to 1871, and those purchases and sales have reserved rights and there may be, may be similar cases, but I don't know."
1974.73-717,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3826.848,3827.439,You don't know that?
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3827.439,3827.991,I don't know.
1974.73-717,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3827.991,3829.024,I don't know either.
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3829.024,3829.516,I see my time --
1974.73-717,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3829.516,3844.952,What you are saying is that an Indian of category of Okanogan has a greater right to hunt in this area than non-Indian citizen in the State of Washington with a license?
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3844.952,3846.133,Absolutely.
1974.73-717,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3846.133,3857.364,"Yes and that he derives that right because of â€“ in fact, that it existed before the government ever issued a patent on that land through anyone."
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3857.364,3861.038,"That's correct, exactly Your Honor."
1974.73-717,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3861.038,3863.903,"Now, that alone wouldn't, you are not relying on."
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3867.872,3879.336,"I am relying on; one the reservation of the right in 1872 and the fact that it's never been taken away, has never been mentioned except in the 1891 Agreement and there it is reserved, not taken away"
1974.73-717,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3879.336,3882.615,"Well then, aren't you relying on the language of the 1891 Agreement?"
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3882.615,3895.958,"Yes, but I want to make it clear the right does not fall completely if we completely take away the 1891 Agreement because it preexisted that agreement; it was simply reserved by that agreement."
1974.73-717,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3895.958,3911.384,"But wouldn't the â€“ if there hadn't been any such language and if there had been simply the 1906 legislation, would you have the same case?"
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3911.384,3915.075,The 1906 legislation refers only to the 1891 Agreement
1974.73-717,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3915.075,3922.795,"Right, and if there had been no such language in the agreement, would you have the same case or any kind of a case at all?"
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3929.363,3936.178,"That was 1906, authorized the appropriation, the 1907 acts authorized 300,000 a piece."
1974.73-717,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3949.636,3957.193,"-- when they sold the land, didn't they sell everything that went with it in the absence of the language on which you rely?"
1974.73-717,2,36341,mason_d_morisset,,3957.193,3978.069,"Well, that goes more to the disestablishment question and this Court has held that in many cases, where tribes have been terminated, reservations have been terminated, that the Hunting and Fishing Right continues unless the Congress explicitly says we take that away and I of course, agree with those rulings of the Court."
1974.73-717,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3982.459,3984.571,Thank you gentleman.
