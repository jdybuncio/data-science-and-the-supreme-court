1988.87-1252,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.934,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-1252, H. J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company."
1988.87-1252,0,36517,mark_reinhardt,,46.435,48.825,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1252,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,189.563,198.654,"Mr. Reinhardt, at least you take the position that there have to be separate criminal transactions for the pattern."
1988.87-1252,0,36517,mark_reinhardt,,198.654,199.795,--Your Honor--
1988.87-1252,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,199.795,203.496,"If not schemes, at least separate transactions."
1988.87-1252,0,36517,mark_reinhardt,,203.496,208.292,"--There has to be separate acts, a pattern of acts is the definition."
1988.87-1252,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,218.458,220.474,"Well, I'm not sure about that."
1988.87-1252,0,36517,mark_reinhardt,,231.422,239.17,"Your Honor, I think continuity can be thought of, of course, as a series, as you just pointed out, a number of transactions."
1988.87-1252,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,283.573,286.447,"Why is it that we require continuity, in your view?"
1988.87-1252,0,36517,mark_reinhardt,,286.447,300.238,"--The Congress continually, in its debate and as pointed out in Sedima, said that a pattern is made up of both relatedness and continuity, that that is what a pattern is."
1988.87-1252,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,300.238,311.109,Is not the reason that the concern of the statute is to prohibit activities that have an ongoing potential threat?
1988.87-1252,0,36517,mark_reinhardt,,311.109,312.937,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-1252,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,316.655,320.372,"Well, isn't the Ninth... the Eighth Circuit's scheme at least consistent with that?"
1988.87-1252,0,36517,mark_reinhardt,,321.776,326.166,"--It is consistent with that, Your Honor, but it is unduly restrictive in--"
1988.87-1252,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,326.166,326.993,But it's consistent with that.
1988.87-1252,0,36517,mark_reinhardt,,326.993,327.79,--Correct.
1988.87-1252,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,405.04,412.614,Are there certain crimes that are more susceptible of an inference of continuity and ongoing threat than others?
1988.87-1252,0,36517,mark_reinhardt,,412.614,413.849,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-1252,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,413.849,417.02,"Say, extortion, blackmail, drug dealing?"
1988.87-1252,0,36517,mark_reinhardt,,417.02,428.249,"Your Honor, the, I believe acts listed, the 40 or 45 acts listed by Congress are those that they in fact believed carried with it that threat."
1988.87-1252,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,428.249,430.561,"Well, I'm not sure."
1988.87-1252,0,36517,mark_reinhardt,,451.254,455.676,"Your Honor, I think there are two answers to that that occur to me."
1988.87-1252,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,535.924,539.189,This is a Law Review article to be published next month?
1988.87-1252,0,36517,mark_reinhardt,,539.189,539.516,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-1252,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,540.984,542.577,"Well, what value is that to us?"
1988.87-1252,0,36517,mark_reinhardt,,542.577,546.233,"--Your Honor, the value I see in it is that it was a definition that is--"
1988.87-1252,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,546.233,547.436,"Well, I'm not going to wait two months for it."
1988.87-1252,0,36517,mark_reinhardt,,547.436,548.419,--Excuse me?
1988.87-1252,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,548.419,550.404,I'm not going to wait two months for it.
1988.87-1252,0,36517,mark_reinhardt,,551.325,554.105,"Well, Your Honor, that was my information."
1988.87-1252,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,620.968,622.717,Excuse me.
1988.87-1252,0,36517,mark_reinhardt,,642.038,646.818,"Your Honor, given those facts alone, I would answer no, that they do not."
1988.87-1252,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,668.605,677.618,"Would each phone call in that situation be prosecutable and punishable by imprisonment for more than one year, each individual phone call?"
1988.87-1252,0,36517,mark_reinhardt,,677.618,693.126,"It perhaps would, Your Honor, yes, but pattern, Your Honor, carries with it not only the acts and the relatedness of those racketeering acts, but also the continuity, and I don't know if the continuity there would be present."
1988.87-1252,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,693.126,695.032,"Are you sure about, are you sure about the answer to that question?"
1988.87-1252,0,36517,mark_reinhardt,,701.529,708.354,"Your Honor, I am sorry, I was thinking if you were involved in mail fraud or attempting to get monies falsely through the--"
1988.87-1252,1,30274,john_d_french,,1214.29,1221.271,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1328.682,1331.711,And that was a Court ruling there.
1988.87-1252,1,30274,john_d_french,,1331.711,1349.97,"--Justice White for the Court pointed out that a pattern requires at least two acts of racketeering activity but does not mean two acts, and also that there are two factors, continuity and relationship, that have to combine to produce a pattern."
1988.87-1252,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1416.396,1420.909,xxx problem with the law that Congress passed.
1988.87-1252,1,30274,john_d_french,,1420.909,1425.721,"--I think there's a serious problem with it, Your Honor, but I can't do anything about that here."
1988.87-1252,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1516.544,1522.651,"Well, but, the Eighth Circuit has focused on separate schemes, and that... it seems to be almost alone in doing that."
1988.87-1252,1,30274,john_d_french,,1537.331,1539.221,"I am, Your Honor, and I will do that now."
1988.87-1252,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1577.44,1586.827,"You don't think that this, the facts in this case would meet the Seventh Circuit test for separate transactions on the allegations?"
1988.87-1252,1,30274,john_d_french,,1586.827,1592.153,"I think, Your Honor, that they would not."
1988.87-1252,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1657.252,1677.4,"Well, doesn't the Eighth Circuit two-scheme rule run headlong into 1962 subpart (b) which says it shall be unlawful for any person through a pattern of racketeering to acquire any interest in the control of an enterprise?"
1988.87-1252,1,30274,john_d_french,,1682.18,1686.225,"I keep reading commentators saying that, Your Honor, but I disagree, and I think it's wrong."
1988.87-1252,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1738.969,1750.308,"Well, that may be, and your example happens to fit the two-scheme rationale, but that doesn't answer the question that the two-scheme rationale doesn't fit the statute."
1988.87-1252,1,30274,john_d_french,,1759.913,1761.554,"Well, I don't think you do, Your Honor."
1988.87-1252,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1835.258,1836.929,But how does that fit the two-scheme rule?
1988.87-1252,1,30274,john_d_french,,1836.929,1839.334,"--Well, I think it would--"
1988.87-1252,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1839.334,1840.256,That you're defending.
1988.87-1252,1,30274,john_d_french,,1840.256,1841.709,"--Well, I think it would probably be three schemes, Your Honor."
1988.87-1252,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1920.614,1923.175,"Several people were bribed, weren't they?"
1988.87-1252,1,30274,john_d_french,,1923.175,1925.002,It says several people were bribed.
1988.87-1252,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1937.59,1945.697,"But may I ask you, if there were two, a series of bribes and a rate increase, another series of bribes and a second rate increase, if that would satisfy your test?"
1988.87-1252,1,30274,john_d_french,,1945.697,1952.491,"I believe that my test would be... I will give you a hypothetical that I think would satisfy my test, but it is not pleaded here."
1988.87-1252,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1982.62,1986.791,Not just possible; that would clearly come within it under your explanation as I understand it.
1988.87-1252,1,30274,john_d_french,,1986.791,1987.195,"I believe it would, Your Honor."
1988.87-1252,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1987.195,1987.711,Yes.
1988.87-1252,1,30274,john_d_french,,1990.679,1996.287,"I don't... I can't say at a minimum three because the Congress said two, and we're stuck with that also."
1988.87-1252,2,36517,mark_reinhardt,,2603.917,2605.963,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1988.87-1252,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2755.995,2763.587,"It is your contention that under paragraph 75 of the complaint, more than one rate proceeding could be referred to?"
1988.87-1252,2,36517,mark_reinhardt,,2769.1,2781.126,"Yes, fair and reasonable charges, yes, that there were many charges, that they received in excess of the fair and reasonable charges to which they would have been allowed."
1988.87-1252,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2781.126,2784.483,Many different rate proceedings were involved.
1988.87-1252,2,36517,mark_reinhardt,,2784.483,2794.652,"Yes, there were many rate proceedings over this period of time, Your Honor, and in fact, submitted with memorandum to the trial court was much material relating to different rate hearings."
