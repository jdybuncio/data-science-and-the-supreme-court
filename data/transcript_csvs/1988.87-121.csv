1988.87-121,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,7.546,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-121, Richard L. Dugger v. Aubrey Dennis Adams."
1988.87-121,0,36521,margene_a_roper,,73.889,77.561,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-121,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,127.994,131.067,Where was that raised in the cert petition?
1988.87-121,0,36521,margene_a_roper,,134.58,150.431,"The thrust of the entire cert petition, Your Honor, I would submit is that there was no significant change of law to excuse the application of all procedural barriers, and by that we meant not only the doctrine of procedural default, but abuse of the writ as well."
1988.87-121,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,161.697,162.646,"Well, that's a pretty specific question."
1988.87-121,0,36521,margene_a_roper,,169.782,186.872,"It was raised on the basis, I would submit, of a misapplication of the court below of the principles enunciated in Reed v. Ross which does deal with a change in law which is significant enough to constitute cause for procedural default."
1988.87-121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,404.556,411.19,"Ms. Roper, do you think it's clear at the time of trial that if the objection had been made, the trial should... the trial court should have sustained the objection?"
1988.87-121,0,36521,margene_a_roper,,411.19,415.393,"Under Florida case law, that would be clear at the time of trial, yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,415.393,418.636,"So, this is a case of clear error by the trial judge, in other words, in your view."
1988.87-121,0,36521,margene_a_roper,,418.636,422.517,I don't believe that it's a case of error at all on the part of the trial judge.
1988.87-121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,434.424,436.577,"So, it would have been a futile objection that mould have been made then."
1988.87-121,0,36521,margene_a_roper,,436.577,438.378,"Well, I don't think--"
1988.87-121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,438.378,440.117,"I mean, you're, saying the building blocks were there."
1988.87-121,0,36521,margene_a_roper,,444.401,445.871,--Yes.
1988.87-121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,445.871,451.126,But then what should the trial judge have done if an objection had been made in 1978?
1988.87-121,0,36521,margene_a_roper,,451.126,461.913,"I think the trial judge would have declared a mistrial as far as sentencing goes and had a resentencing if error was established, but our position is--"
1988.87-121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,461.913,464.314,"Well, we know what the facts are, but what is your view?"
1988.87-121,0,36521,margene_a_roper,,469.029,476.393,"--Not under the circumstances of this case, no, but the basis for the objection was there and that's our position."
1988.87-121,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,476.393,483.147,"What your're saying is that the basis for a true Caldwell claim was there, but this did not qualify under Caldwell."
1988.87-121,0,36521,margene_a_roper,,483.147,486.56,"Yes, that's exactly, Your Honor... that's exactly what I'm saying."
1988.87-121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,486.56,490.771,"So, then your position on procedural default really depends on the merits of the Caldwell claim."
1988.87-121,0,36521,margene_a_roper,,490.771,494.024,"There is a interplay of concepts in this case, and I--"
1988.87-121,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,494.024,497.006,"So, bottom line you don't think there's a valid Caldwell claim here anyway."
1988.87-121,0,36521,margene_a_roper,,499.329,500.058,--That's correct.
1988.87-121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1267.31,1275.395,"--Ms. Roper, Isn't... Isn't it true that the Florida Supreme Court has... has reversed a trial judge who doesn't accept the jury's recommendation?"
1988.87-121,0,36521,margene_a_roper,,1275.395,1279.349,--Yes.
1988.87-121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1279.349,1281.269,And does so with some regularity.
1988.87-121,0,36521,margene_a_roper,,1281.269,1283.092,"Yes, It does."
1988.87-121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1283.092,1286.074,"So, It's... It's not just a recommendation then."
1988.87-121,0,36521,margene_a_roper,,1287.055,1288.676,I--
1988.87-121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1288.676,1290.726,"--That must mean that it's not just a recommendation, musn't it?"
1988.87-121,0,36521,margene_a_roper,,1290.726,1292.418,"--I don't think that's correct, Your Honor."
1988.87-121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1319.767,1322.709,"Well, what about... what about Ferry v. State?"
1988.87-121,0,36521,margene_a_roper,,1356.263,1366.15,"Again, that's extraneous appellate language, and as I said before, if Tedder represents anything at all, It's either an admonition to trial judges or an appellate standard."
1988.87-121,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1494.559,1514.433,"Ms.... Ms. Roper, I hate to come back to it, but I... I... I've been thinking about it some more and I still don't know what you say the... what is the Florida Supreme Court's... what was the Florida Supreme Court saying in Ferry when it said the fact that reasonable people could differ renders the override of the jury's recommendation improper?"
1988.87-121,0,36521,margene_a_roper,,1517.923,1524.488,"I think what the Florida Supreme Court is saying is... again, the answer I have for it is that it's an appellate standard."
1988.87-121,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1589.584,1590.673,"Thank you, Ms. Roper."
1988.87-121,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,1593.935,1597.948,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-121,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1764.78,1772.935,"Mr. Tabak, do you think the doctrine of the Caldwell case should be applied to trials which took place before it was announced?"
1988.87-121,1,40591,ronald_j_tabak,,1772.935,1775.268,"I do believe so, but I also believe--"
1988.87-121,2,36521,margene_a_roper,,2972.452,2976.625,I would just like to briefly respond.
1988.87-121,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3088.428,3090.481,"Thank you, Ms. Roper."
