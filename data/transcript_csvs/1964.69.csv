1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,40.074,42.801,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.69,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,306.379,315.576,(Inaudible)
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,315.576,330.657,"Well, Mr. Justice Goldberg, my answer to your question would be that I suppose the city could have imposed a tax but that this tax is in the nature of a tax as this Court has struck and set aside in the Goldstein case."
1964.69,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,338.756,355.55,Are you saying that (Inaudible)?
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,355.55,366.262,"Well I don't know if I can go too far to say that Mr. Justice Goldberg, but I think we have to look at the statute at the fee requirement together with the other requirements of the statute."
1964.69,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,375.502,380.304,(Inaudible)
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,380.304,394.868,"Well, I think the sole relevancy that I may suggest in this Court is that the Court is held in cases like Goldstein and Murdock that the tax here is -- there it was used to restrain speech."
1964.69,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,401.179,405.144,(Inaudible)
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,405.144,420.151,"I'm using -- I'm using the tax together with -- with the manner in which the tax is here used, the purpose of the tax which is to pay the Board the sole function of which is to censor films."
1964.69,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,420.151,427.13,(Inaudible)
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,427.13,432.494,You mean the ministerial tax like a tax -- strictly ministerial tax.
1964.69,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,438.665,441.428,Is it that motion pictures have equal taxation?
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,441.428,442.512,No.
1964.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,598.597,602.544,Wouldn't that -- wouldn't that the situation in the Times case?
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,602.544,604.908,"No, it was not, Your Honor."
1964.69,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,726.711,734.458,(Inaudible)
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,734.458,734.674,Well --
1964.69,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,734.674,747.834,(Inaudible)
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,747.834,748.128,Well --
1964.69,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,748.128,752.448,(Inaudible)
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,752.448,753.061,"Well, we -- we --"
1964.69,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,753.061,759.601,(Inaudible)
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,759.601,764.764,"Well, Mr. Justice Goldberg, I'd like to answer that question this way."
1964.69,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,807.657,810.343,(Inaudible)
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,810.343,811.116,Well -- well --
1964.69,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,811.116,812.674,(Inaudible)
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,812.674,819.386,Well we -- we -- that is what -- what we believe the -- that was being alleged in the Times Film case.
1964.69,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,839.11,840.075,(Inaudible)
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,840.075,842.583,Because we have a situation here Mr. Justice Goldberg --
1964.69,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,842.583,853.147,(Inaudible)
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,853.147,854.228,"No, we're not saying that."
1964.69,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,995.807,1000.997,Unless there's – there's different rule to movies and books.
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,1000.997,1007.969,"Well, I would say Mr. Justice Douglas irrespective of whether or not there has to be a different rule."
1964.69,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1053.526,1064.417,(Inaudible)
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,1064.417,1066.329,"Yes, there is Mr. Justice Goldberg."
1964.69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1109.203,1113.182,"But in this particular case by hypothesis, there wouldn't have -- there wouldn't have been any appeal."
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,1116.64,1116.975,Well –-
1964.69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1116.975,1120.132,Is this a completely unobjectionable film by hypothesis.
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,1120.132,1121.941,"Well that is true, Mr. Justice Stewart --"
1964.69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1121.941,1123.241,(Voice Overlap) paying the $30 –
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,1123.241,1123.308,That -- that --
1964.69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1123.308,1125.689,"No play, no appeal, no –"
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,1125.689,1128.564,That is -- that is true and that is -- and that is the State's position.
1964.69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1195.53,1220.496,"(Voice Overlap) you either got to -- you don't have to of course but either this is Times Film and we're going to -- or it isn't, Times Film I think he correctly says decided on the -- by the Court on the -- on this proposition that you headed by -- to assume that the film there in question, no description of which was in the record was as violent objectionable film as you could possibly imagine."
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,1231.749,1235.032,And you have to assume that (Voice Overlap) because it was never shown.
1964.69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1235.032,1236.951,"Because it was never shown, right."
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,1250.191,1252.224,It was shown Mr. Justice Stewart –-
1964.69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1252.224,1253.049,By property.
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,1253.049,1253.471,-- that the film was shown.
1964.69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1253.471,1257.621,"Well in that case, then it was just a matter in this case; it's just a matter of paying the $30."
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,1257.621,1270.007,"Well, I think that -- in -- in -- in effect, I think the State of Maryland would concede 90 -- every film that's licensed is constitutionally unobjectionable which would entail 99.7% of all prints submitted to that Court."
1964.69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1270.007,1278.969,And you've also said I think in answer to Mr. Justice Goldberg's earlier question that you would concede that I mean a municipality or a state could impose a business tax on -- on -- on a movie theater.
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,1278.969,1283.0,"Yes, I would not concede that this is a business tax, Mr. Justice Stewart."
1964.69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1298.41,1299.269,Raise revenue.
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,1299.269,1301.038,Well raise revenue but they're doing that now.
1964.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1306.269,1315.719,It seems to me the essence of your position necessarily must be without regard to whether it's a picture which would have been licensed or not.
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,1351.809,1353.577,"That is our position, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1964.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1355.043,1360.382,"Yes but if that is your position, Mr. Bilgrey, I have the same difficulty as Mr. Justice Goldberg has."
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,1366.222,1368.373,"Well of course, I would welcome --"
1964.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1368.373,1370.839,I know you'd welcome it but (Voice Overlap)
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,1370.839,1371.218,I really don't think it does involve --
1964.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1371.218,1377.38,"What I'm trying to get to is whether acceptance to your position, but does it necessarily mean that we overrule Times Film?"
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,1377.38,1380.069,I really don't think it entails that and -- and in --
1964.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1380.069,1385.338,Then what's left -- what's left of this -- of this Maryland licensing law?
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,1385.338,1388.948,"I admit Mr. Justice Brennan that very little might be left of it, but if the State would --"
1964.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1388.948,1391.177,But what -- what at all is left of it?
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,1391.177,1392.023,"Well, something might be (Voice Overlap)"
1964.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1392.023,1406.55,"If an exhibitor doesn't have to submit in advance and he can't be punished for not submitting in advance, but that the question of penalty has to wait a prosecution for exhibiting something which is otherwise suppressible."
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,1408.2,1427.513,"Well, I think if Maryland wants to keep -- keep up this type of scheme to -- to pair it out what it believes to be the infinite decimal -- infinite decimal portion of film that it can legitimately keep out of Maryland, I believe that there might -- there might conceivably be some people who would sort of ban insurance policy and submit but I don't -- I think that that is all that would be left out."
1964.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1443.941,1450.09,"But once you leave it with the exhibitor, then the mandate of the law that operates this is no longer mandated."
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,1450.09,1466.772,"Well, it would still be a mandate, Mr. Justice Brennan if on a judicial determination, the film turns out to be not protected but we do not think that it should be a mandate if -- if the film turns out to be a protected film which happens of course in a vast majority of cases."
1964.69,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1540.828,1563.293,"Well, aren't you -- aren't you essentially claiming that you don't need to overrule the Times Film here because the State says to you or to your client that we don't claim this film that you want to show, it's obscene at all but nevertheless you have to -- you have to get a license."
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,1594.055,1602.656,"Well, on the facts of this case, Mr. Justice White, it's our position that the State has criminally convicted a man he -- for -- for --"
1964.69,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1602.656,1608.173,The State is insisting on licensing even though they -- they know it's not -- it's not obscene.
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,1609.56,1622.648,"Well the State is insisting on licensing without affording a chance to an exhibitor to come into -- to come in some place, the court or some place to -- and show that the film is -- is not obscene or is protected."
1964.69,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1624.036,1625.806,"Well, they purported you that, I presume."
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,1646.022,1649.442,"Well, whether or not they knew, they -- they -- it's our position that they should have purported --"
1964.69,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1649.442,1652.142,"Otherwise, that's how you avoid Times Film."
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,1652.142,1671.39,"Well, whether or not, they knew it's our position, Mr. Justice White that they should afford as it was pointed out in Kingsley Books and as it was pointed out by the Chief Justice in his dissent of the Times Film case that at some point, they should afford an exhibitor who does show a film, a chance to come in and prove the innocence of his film, constitutionally speaking."
1964.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1674.334,1675.395,"Well, you may."
1964.69,0,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,1675.395,1680.354,Thank you.
1964.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1680.354,1682.907,Attorney General Finan.
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,1682.907,1696.375,"Chief Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2319.415,2322.166,"You're pretty firm in that position, aren't you, that the standards would not be –"
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2322.166,2325.135,"Absolutely not, that's correct, Mr. Justice."
1964.69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2330.956,2332.557,That's what I thought your position is.
1964.69,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2332.557,2340.712,But the government (Inaudile).
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2340.712,2351.659,"But for a moment, let's take the situation regarding the invoking of what statutes Maryland have -- has on obscenity."
1964.69,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2443.354,2446.321,"Well, that's true of books, isn't it Attorney General?"
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2446.321,2447.36,That's correct Mr. Justice.
1964.69,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2447.36,2449.284,How does it work in Maryland on books?
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2449.284,2451.35,We have no censorship of books other than they --
1964.69,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2451.35,2452.274,"No, I mean the criminal fact –-"
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2452.274,2457.58,The sec -- Section 417 and 418 which I just mentioned of our criminal statute would be applicable.
1964.69,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2457.58,2460.57,But do they work pretty well on books?
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2460.57,2464.625,We might -- let me state this.
1964.69,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2499.228,2504.536,"Well, if you don't over burden to the books, you probably wouldn't be with movie."
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2504.536,2510.689,No but the situation is we feel that you can distinguish between books and between movies.
1964.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2555.509,2557.347,What other procedures Mr. Attorney General?
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2560.566,2562.094,Oh yes!
1964.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2562.094,2563.471,I mean before they get into court?
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2563.471,2570.092,"No, the Chicago's -- the Chicago ordinance for instance provide for the merits to look out it after the censorship court."
1964.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2570.092,2571.051,How is it in Maryland?
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2571.051,2576.083,"Maryland, it would go directly to the court which is the Circuit Court, right."
1964.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2576.083,2578.26,And then it's from the Circuit Court to the Court of Appeals?
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2578.26,2579.179,The Court of Appeals.
1964.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2579.179,2582.545,And is that an appeal of right from the Court of Appeals.
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2582.545,2583.798,That is on appeal of right to the Court of Appeals.
1964.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2583.798,2592.506,"Is there a -- according to the administrative level, there is no -- the only thing the Censorship Board does is to look at the film."
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2592.506,2594.231,They stand over the seal.
1964.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2594.231,2598.102,They doesn't purport to have any kind of a hearing.
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2598.102,2600.766,They -- yes they do.
1964.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2611.966,2616.9,"But the -- but then if it goes to Court, is it completely a de novo thing?"
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2616.9,2617.835,Completely de novo.
1964.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2617.835,2620.265,So it's not on the record.
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2625.965,2628.285,"No, that's correct."
1964.69,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2629.696,2677.445,(Inaudible)
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2677.445,2691.204,"Well, I think, Mr. Justice, there again, you're getting into the field of the responsibility of a federal government to feel it for any protection of public moral as I assume it does somewhat."
1964.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2799.188,2808.356,"Well, may I suggest Mr. Attorney General, I wonder whether the analogy is good because the argument has been made, and of course is practically on the First Amendment."
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2808.356,2808.893,On what?
1964.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2808.893,2812.792,On the First Amendment -- on the First Amendment --
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2812.792,2813.483,"First Amendment, right."
1964.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2813.483,2817.774,-- which does not sort of thing of course that would be involved is in the case that it would.
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2817.774,2826.762,I -- I realized that but -- we -- again we know that the First Amendment has never authorize obscenity.
1964.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2826.762,2827.816,Right.
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2827.816,2832.598,And those types of films are not in the protected group.
1964.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2832.625,2838.942,"Now this would tell you -- with this of course, what is the determination whether there is something is or isn't."
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2838.942,2849.652,"Well Mr. Justice, we of course feel that if Mr. Freedman is successful, he may as well forget about any state censorship."
1964.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2849.652,2856.176,Do you think that our decision last year in quantity of books has any bearing in the question we're discussing today?
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2876.281,2876.544,Well –-
1964.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2876.544,2878.191,Do you think that has any bearing here so?
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2878.191,2894.197,"Yes, I think it does Mr. Justice but I -- I feel that, again, I think that we must never overlook or fail to observe the traditional distinction made between literature and the --"
1964.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2894.197,2895.024,And motion picture.
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2895.024,2902.404,Of the motion picture where the -- you have many other influences coming in together to focus on the screen.
1964.69,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2902.404,2922.793,"I suppose the suggestion there was at least in the case of books, there has to be a prior judicial determine -- determination and adversary hearing on the issue of obscenity and you suggest that perhaps the distinction between books and motion pictures doesn't require that same sort of procedure in the case of motion picture."
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2922.793,2925.01,That -- that is our contention to have a –
1964.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2925.01,2940.932,"So you would say -- you would say Mr. Attorney General that if -- if -- if Maryland had a censorship law applicable to books like it has for movies, the quantity of books would -- would do away with your book censorship."
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2940.932,2942.686,Right.
1964.69,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2978.127,2983.572,From these books who are pretty lewd and that get picked at here.
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,2983.572,3016.871,"Yes but, Mr. Justice, I still feel that if censorship is completely banned, these movies will -- let us assume they want to show mostly they're from the foreign market as we know some film which -- and children from the ages, they can buy a ticket and walk in and they -- they might even have for adult consumption but the very few theater owners that go around checking whether or not the people coming in are over 18, 14 or whatever they might be."
1964.69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3047.293,3055.306,"With the vast majority of the states do just that, don't they, all but Kansas and your state and New York and Virginia?"
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,3055.306,3061.242,"Well Mr. Justice, if I may answer that in this manner."
1964.69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3065.721,3068.09,Municipality of Chicago and others --
1964.69,1,42666,thomas_b_finan,,3068.09,3070.171,Philadelphia?
1964.69,2,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,3299.556,3302.049,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.69,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3561.569,3562.953,May I ask you this question?
1964.69,2,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,3571.19,3574.559,"We think, Mr. Chief Justice, probably very little."
1964.69,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3579.18,3580.545,Wouldn't it be nothing?
1964.69,2,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,3580.545,3581.267,I beg your pardon.
1964.69,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3581.267,3582.406,Wouldn't it be nothing --
1964.69,2,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,3582.406,3582.82,It's -- it's --
1964.69,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3582.82,3585.119,Let's face the fact --
1964.69,2,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,3585.119,3599.131,"Well, in all capability, I think that Maryland may then do what 46 other states and I don't think it's 40 cities, I think it's only two cities and I think it's only 2% or 3% of our population and not 50% of our population."
1964.69,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3612.562,3615.202,Do you think the States have injunctions on the film?
1964.69,2,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,3615.202,3622.856,"Well, I think that quite a few states these days have injunctive proceedings such as that they have been sustained in the Kingsley Books, Your Honor."
1964.69,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3622.856,3624.442,They do apply in the movie?
1964.69,2,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,3624.442,3626.791,They -- they -- I don't think they apply to movies --
1964.69,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3626.791,3627.768,It's all for books --
1964.69,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3627.768,3629.666,New York did apply it --
1964.69,2,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,3629.666,3630.955,No New York does not.
1964.69,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3630.955,3632.812,Do you know of any state that applies to you?
1964.69,2,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,3632.812,3633.842,Not to my knowledge.
1964.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3633.842,3636.344,And why do you suppose they don't?
1964.69,2,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,3636.344,3642.117,"Well, they -- they might not find to see the problem as greatly as the State of Maryland sees it."
1964.69,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3652.422,3655.052,You mean the -- you mean the criminal prosecution.
1964.69,2,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,3655.052,3661.566,I mean criminal prosecution but I'm not saying that Maryland is necessarily relegated to that.
1964.69,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3661.566,3668.247,(Inaudible)
1964.69,2,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,3668.247,3684.889,Well I -- I suggest Mr. Justice that -- that -- that is even more difficult with respect to those media which enjoy a far greater circulation and impact than the motion picture medium which I think is a great medium and I --
1964.69,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,3684.889,3686.298,The impact?
1964.69,2,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,3686.298,3689.561,I don't think impact has any constitutional relevance.
1964.69,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3718.096,3722.147,"By that, what do you mean that the courts have overruled them in every --"
1964.69,2,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,3722.147,3731.125,"The Court of Appeals indeed has overruled (Voice Overlap) one or two years, I've had a few cases myself before the Court took me two years in this Mr. Chief Justice."
1964.69,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3731.125,3732.472,How many cases have they happen to --?
1964.69,2,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,3732.472,3733.438,They have three.
1964.69,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3733.438,3734.395,Three cases.
1964.69,2,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,3734.395,3734.722,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1964.69,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3734.722,3737.911,Suppose there have been cases where they haven't been appealed to the Court.
1964.69,2,23621,felix_j_bilgrey,,3737.911,3742.776,Because the exhibitors possibly made it perpetuated.
