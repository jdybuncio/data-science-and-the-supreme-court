1983.82-1349,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,5.136,We will hear arguments first this morning in United States v. Varig Airlines and the consolidated case.
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,10.775,14.838,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1349,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,264.468,268.747,What was the time lapse between the government's inspection and the accident?
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,268.747,272.916,The inspection would have taken place in 1965.
1983.82-1349,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,353.79,356.68,What was that certificate?
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,357.289,358.771,Type certificate.
1983.82-1349,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,358.771,360.334,"--That is the first one, is it not?"
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,360.334,365.957,"Yes, although the complaint in that case was not too clear as to exactly which certificate they were complaining about."
1983.82-1349,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,373.436,388.302,Are the various certificates cumulative in a sense that if you miss something that you should have caught in the first place you should catch it in the next or not?
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,388.302,397.363,"Well, the Airworthiness Certificate is the final certificate that is issued to each plane as it comes off the assembly line, and the FAA does not inspect each plane."
1983.82-1349,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,397.363,398.455,I understand that.
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,398.455,405.061,"If the FAA, for example, would revoke a type certificate it would have the result of voiding the Airworthiness Certificate."
1983.82-1349,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,409.28,416.308,But an Airworthiness Certificate does not necessarily inspect for what you would inspect for in a type certificate?
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,416.308,417.681,No.
1983.82-1349,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,417.681,429.739,"Mr. Geller, following the original certification of airworthiness, exactly what is the responsibility of the FAA with respect to inspection?"
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,429.739,430.737,With respect to each airplane?
1983.82-1349,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,430.737,432.379,"Yes, with respect to each airplane."
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,432.379,436.204,The FAA does no further inspections of individual airplanes.
1983.82-1349,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,436.204,443.124,It does have some responsibility to make sure that the manufacturer or operator of the aircraft--
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,443.124,456.54,"It has general responsibilities to make certain that the manufacturer is carrying out a program of maintenance, and it has, I am told, regular inspections of air carriers to make sure that they are in general complying with maintenance requirements."
1983.82-1349,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,460.821,463.649,--There is no further certification of--
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,463.649,466.659,No further certifications of individual airplanes.
1983.82-1349,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,466.659,467.848,--But they do check the maintenance?
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,467.848,473.706,They check the maintenance of air carriers in general... that is correct... but not any specific airplane.
1983.82-1349,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,545.082,552.675,"Well, Mr. Geller, is it all that unprecedented after the Court's decisions in Indian Towing and Rayonier?"
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,552.675,554.89,"I believe so, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.82-1349,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,693.083,697.318,"Mr. Geller, can a prison guard be sued by an inmate for negligence?"
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,697.318,699.959,--Prison guard or the United States?
1983.82-1349,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,699.959,701.456,Prison guard.
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,701.456,703.846,I assume a prison guard can be sued.
1983.82-1349,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,703.846,705.785,Can the United States?
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,705.785,713.919,"Under the Muniz case the United States can be sued for negligence by a federal prisoner, yes, for the sorts of torts that were involved in that case."
1983.82-1349,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,713.919,721.137,But certainly no private person would ever be sued for running a prison negligently.
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,721.137,734.224,"Well, Muniz is a slightly different case because the Court did an extensive study of the legislative history of the Federal Tort Claims Act in Muniz and determined that unquestionably congress had intended to cover suits by state prisoners."
1983.82-1349,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,754.479,757.414,How about negligent operation of a military aircraft?
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,757.414,760.21,--Negligent operation of a military aircraft?
1983.82-1349,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,765.21,773.723,"Well, it is out there carrying out a training mission, and they negligently operate the aircraft and it crashes."
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,773.723,778.281,"--Under Feres, of course, the United States could not be sued by any solider, but--"
1983.82-1349,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,778.281,779.407,"No, but how about--"
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,779.407,782.999,--A suit by civilians would be appropriate because the United States is itself--
1983.82-1349,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,782.999,787.593,--No private person is ever going to be sued for running a military aircraft.
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,787.593,795.447,"--Well, the Court has said in these operational cases that private persons do not have to be engaged in the identical activities."
1983.82-1349,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,799.712,809.629,"Well, isn't the parallel more accurately if Northwest Airlines falls on someone's house and then destroys the house, Northwest Airlines is liable."
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,820.438,822.061,"Precisely, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-1349,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,832.071,833.666,"Yes, but private people make inspections."
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,843.067,847.52,"--Yes, Justice, but that is one of the things that the Ninth Circuit said."
1983.82-1349,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,892.235,905.182,"Mr. Geller, there is nothing in the opinions of the Court in Indian Towing and Rayonier and Muniz to suggest that liability turned on direct operational responsibility."
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,910.369,915.228,"Justice O'Connor, I believe there is something in those opinions that support precisely what I am saying here."
1983.82-1349,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,959.429,968.393,"Well, but the Court rejected the government's argument of the government function defense in those cases."
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,968.393,974.091,"In those cases, Justice O'Connor, I think a different argument was made and rejected."
1983.82-1349,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1021.165,1047.733,"Mr. Geller, instead of kind of assuming that these are all either red squares or black squares, would it not be just as accurate to say that Feres and Dalehite was one mode of construction of the Federal Tort Claims Act and that Indian Towing and Rayonier and Muniz was a somewhat different one, and now the government is asking us to kind of return to Feres and Dalehite, which I think is perfectly proper for the government--"
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1047.733,1066.946,"I think that all of these distinctions are reconcilable, Justice Rehnquist, because I do think there is a basic distinction between operational activities, which were what was involved and what the Court emphasized was involved in Indian Towing and in Rayonier, and regulatory activities in terms of the private person language that Congress twice put into the Federal Tort Claims Act."
1983.82-1349,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1066.946,1072.694,--But it is almost impossible to reconcile the opinion in Dalehite with the opinion in Rayonier.
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1076.628,1081.363,"Only as to the parts of Dalehite that concern operational activities, the fighting of a fire."
1983.82-1349,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1179.337,1181.821,"Mr. Geller, may I ask you this question."
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1187.944,1203.203,We believe that it would because the decision of the Ninth Circuit in terms of its construction of the private person language and the Good Samaritan Doctrine does not rely on any facts that are unique to this case.
1983.82-1349,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1229.332,1230.752,Automobile safety.
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1230.752,1231.692,--Exactly.
1983.82-1349,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1239.266,1241.326,Environmental Protection Agency action?
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1241.326,1241.747,--Yes.
1983.82-1349,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1314.827,1328.526,"Mr. Geller, before you go on do the other countries who buy our older airplanes from our airlines, Venezuela, France, England, do they have counterparts to our FAA?"
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1328.526,1335.195,--We have bilateral treaties with a great many countries that do have similar arrangements.
1983.82-1349,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1362.511,1377.535,It is a reality or assume it is that throughout South America and Africa you will find even old DC-3's that were purchased from our airlines still functioning on shuttle flights.
1983.82-1349,0,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,1400.808,1402.399,"Presumably, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-1349,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1440.134,1441.367,Very well.
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,1446.709,1449.849,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1349,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1530.864,1567.551,"Mr. Gerry, with respect to that last hypothetical I put to your friend, suppose to make it more concrete the Venezuela Airlines bought a DC-3 from Northwest Airlines when those planes were discarded and it has been used in Venezuela for 20, 25 years and then you get the same fact situation you have got here, liability of the FAA of the United States through FAA inspection?"
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,1567.551,1572.752,Liability only if in the issuance of the original--
1983.82-1349,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1572.752,1575.642,I am assuming the same facts as you have in this case.
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,1575.642,1584.95,"--Liability only if in issuance of the original type certificate the FAA or its predecessor, the CAA, was negligent."
1983.82-1349,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1586.81,1589.29,Even if that was 20 or 25 years ago.
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,1589.29,1604.175,"--The actual facts are, Mr. Chief Justice, at the time of the certification of the DC-3 the CAA did not conduct itself in the same fashion as it did in 1958 when it certified the 707."
1983.82-1349,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1733.264,1739.761,"Well, I doubt that we would have granted certiorari if we did not feel this was an issue of some significance."
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,1739.761,1746.523,"--I agree with the Court, and, Justice Rehnguist, I think it is an issue of high significance."
1983.82-1349,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1765.907,1766.983,In your favor.
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,1766.983,1767.939,--Obviously.
1983.82-1349,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1784.337,1795.067,Were these aircraft subject to inspection in the countries to which the airline's purchaser is attached?
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,1795.067,1796.596,"Yes, they were, Your Honor."
1983.82-1349,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1851.325,1858.618,"In the Scottish case that you are just referring to, what was the time span between the FAA inspection and the accident?"
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,1858.618,1862.884,"About two and a half years, from 1965 to 1968."
1983.82-1349,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1862.884,1865.961,The Scottish case?
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,1865.961,1867.115,In the Scottish case.
1983.82-1349,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1867.115,1868.835,I thought that was the time on the other case.
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,1868.835,1886.702,"No, the other case was from 1958 at the time of the issuance of the original type certificate for the Boeing 707 and 1968, the time of the... 1973, the time of the accident, 15 years in that case."
1983.82-1349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1886.702,1892.169,When do you think the negligence occurred in the Varig case?
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,1892.169,1895.324,"In the Varig case, in the original type certification, Your Honor--"
1983.82-1349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1895.324,1904.757,There was not a repetition of that negligence when the plane was given an Airworthiness Certificate?
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,1904.757,1906.68,--Your Honor--
1983.82-1349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1906.68,1909.145,I just want yes or no.
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,1909.145,1910.428,--No is the answer.
1983.82-1349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1910.428,1914.706,How about in the Scottish case?
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,1914.706,1920.953,"It occurred at the time of the initial installation of the fuel line, and there was no--"
1983.82-1349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1920.953,1922.688,What kind of a certificate was that?
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,1922.688,1925.5,--That was a supplemental type certificate.
1983.82-1349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1925.5,1931.793,"And again the Airworthiness Certificate, there was no negligence then?"
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,1931.793,1937.572,"Well, the Airworthiness Certificate in the Dove case had initially been issued by the British government--"
1983.82-1349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1937.572,1938.227,Yes.
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,1938.227,1941.975,--some time earlier in the fifties.
1983.82-1349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1952.207,1963.715,Do you know whether or not the FAA ever delegates to the manufacturer the issuance of the type certificate?
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,1963.715,1970.293,"They never delegate the issuance of the type certificate, but they do delegate at the present time--"
1983.82-1349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1970.293,1974.525,Airworthiness inspection.
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,1974.525,1982.772,--They delegate some inspection activities to designated representatives called designated--
1983.82-1349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1982.772,1986.036,What kind of certificates are--
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,1986.036,1989.892,"--They do not issue certificates, Your Honor, at all."
1983.82-1349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1989.892,1995.468,"--I know they do not, but they are not type inspections that they delegate."
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,1995.468,2008.996,"They do at the present time delegate inspections that go into making up the type certificate, but they do not delegate the authority for issuance of the type certificate itself."
1983.82-1349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2022.676,2024.77,How about in the Scottish case?
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,2024.77,2025.3,No.
1983.82-1349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2055.993,2059.007,I take it you think that does not make any difference anyway.
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,2059.007,2062.661,"Yes, I do think it may make a difference."
1983.82-1349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2072.686,2078.496,What if he has the discretion to delegate it to somebody else?
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,2078.496,2081.433,No one in the field has that discretion.
1983.82-1349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2084.167,2084.838,All right.
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,2092.586,2094.961,If they do that--
1983.82-1349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2094.961,2097.414,Will that make a difference in your case?
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,2097.414,2099.067,--Not in my case.
1983.82-1349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2099.067,2103.816,"Of course that did not happen, but what if in some other case it happens."
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,2104.986,2129.257,"I might think it might, but the government in its manual says a DER, who is a designated engineering representative, while performing those duties which are part of his responsibilities as an agent of the administrator for all intents and purposes becomes an employee of the government and thereby may incur liability for the United States if he is negligent."
1983.82-1349,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2134.817,2135.663,Mr. Gerry.
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,2135.663,2136.662,"Yes, sir."
1983.82-1349,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2136.662,2145.876,Is it your argument that the present law exempts the responsibility of the manufacturer to inspect?
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,2145.876,2147.44,Absolutely not.
1983.82-1349,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2151.172,2152.358,You seem to be arguing that.
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,2152.358,2152.888,--No.
1983.82-1349,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2159.855,2162.527,But the government has got a bigger pouch?
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,2162.527,2166.742,--This is like any other area where there is more than one tort feasor.
1983.82-1349,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2185.063,2189.793,I take it no movement in that direction has yet been taken.
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,2189.793,2191.466,"It has not, Your Honor."
1983.82-1349,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2218.907,2223.497,Do the FAA attorneys have any jurisdiction over a question of that kind?
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,2223.497,2224.655,"I do not know, Your Honor."
1983.82-1349,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2224.655,2229.825,Only the Attorney General of the United States could make that decision.
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,2229.825,2230.668,"I agree with you, Your Honor."
1983.82-1349,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2260.078,2267.511,"Well, is there not considerable judgment or discretion in determining what is excessive vibration?"
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,2267.511,2281.319,"--I believe that there is judgment, but there is not policy discretion such as that which is provided in the Federal Tort Claims cases, Justice O'Connor."
1983.82-1349,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2323.66,2332.141,"Mr. Gerry, in the Dalehite case they said that the decision as to how to bag fertilizer was discretionary, did they not?"
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,2332.141,2338.092,"I most respectfully disagree, and I think that we are a long way from Dalehite."
1983.82-1349,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2338.969,2342.607,What do you mean when you say you think we are a long way from Dalehite?
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,2342.607,2370.266,"--Well, I think in those cases that have followed there is been a great deal of this Court's interpretation of what was in Dalehite, and although it has not been overruled in all of its aspects, as it should not be, I think in those aspects where there was only operational negligence such as in fire fighting that this Court has in Rayonier taken care of that problem."
1983.82-1349,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2375.156,2382.698,Unless maybe it decided to take care of Rayonier and Indian Towing the way you suggest those cases took care of Dalehite.
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,2387.978,2390.369,"I have found it that way, Your Honor."
1983.82-1349,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2523.763,2527.293,I suppose it is the inevitable cigarette disposal.
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,2527.293,2530.073,"--It has been, Your Honor."
1983.82-1349,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2684.665,2702.143,"On your theory as I understood your previous response, Mr. Gerry, 25 years after the airplane was built or 30 years the United States could be liable if it falls in Venezuela or Zambisi or some other place."
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,2705.578,2715.544,"--If they were negligent in the beginning, if the manufacturer was negligent in the beginning, they could if that negligence then became operative at that point."
1983.82-1349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2807.601,2817.253,"Well, you do not suggest it would have been difficult to... If you think this is such a glaring, obvious defect you would not think it would have been very hard to get a change."
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,2817.253,2823.391,"--No, I do not think so in this case, Your Honor, but the incentive is gone."
1983.82-1349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2836.964,2840.805,"Well, I suppose there is some incentive to produce a safe aircraft."
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,2840.805,2841.979,Yes.
1983.82-1349,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2849.318,2853.019,"You have to have proof of negligence, do you not?"
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,2853.019,2854.005,Absolutely.
1983.82-1349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2864.062,2872.902,That a reasonable designer should have known this was a bad deal.
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,2872.902,2873.604,--That is correct.
1983.82-1349,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2880.335,2895.452,"If technology developed subsequent to the original inspection and certification, it was not generally known at the time of the certification, that would not be the sort of case that you bring here."
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,2895.452,2902.948,"No, state of the art has always been a defense to a negligence action even if not to a strict lability action."
1983.82-1349,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2929.832,2935.436,The manufacturer was not available?
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,2935.436,2946.618,"The manufacturer in the United Scottish case went out of business and had only $100,000 worth of insurance."
1983.82-1349,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3017.226,3022.257,You mean the average person that rides on a plane is familiar with this statute?
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,3022.257,3038.14,"I think the average person that rides on the plane anyplace in the United States and the world, Justice Marshall, is familiar with the government's involvement in the aviation industry, that they--"
1983.82-1349,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3038.14,3042.812,That the government has to inspect every piece of that plane?
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,3042.812,3044.453,"--I do not think that is so, nor do I think--"
1983.82-1349,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3044.453,3045.904,"Well, you just said so."
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,3045.904,3047.468,"--Well, no--"
1983.82-1349,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3047.468,3050.762,You said the inspection examines every piece of the plane.
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,3050.762,3051.62,--I said that.
1983.82-1349,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3051.62,3056.682,"Well, does the average airplane rider know that?"
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,3056.682,3058.211,I do not think that--
1983.82-1349,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3058.211,3059.166,"If so, take me out of the group."
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,3059.166,3060.804,--I do not think--
1983.82-1349,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3060.804,3062.679,I did not know it until this case was filed.
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,3062.679,3065.631,"--I do not think they do, nor did I intend to say that they knew that."
1983.82-1349,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3092.26,3100.914,"Who that rides a plane has read that book that you just read from, the one where you say the inspector does this?"
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,3100.914,3103.242,--The owner of the aircraft--
1983.82-1349,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3103.242,3104.74,What is the name of that book?
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,3104.74,3109.021,--This is the manual procedure type certification--
1983.82-1349,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3109.021,3111.72,Does the average plane rider know anything about that book?
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,3111.72,3113.486,"--No, But the owner--"
1983.82-1349,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3113.486,3115.518,Has the average rider ever heard of that book?
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,3115.518,3117.483,"--I do not believe so, Your Honor, no."
1983.82-1349,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3136.274,3139.336,Why don't you argue that?
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,3139.788,3146.238,"--I did not mean, Your Honor, actual knowledge of each and every particular."
1983.82-1349,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3353.026,3355.104,Your time has expired now.
1983.82-1349,1,39303,richard_f_gerry,,3355.104,3358.602,--this much involved in aviation.
1983.82-1349,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3359.195,3361.366,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Geller."
1983.82-1349,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3361.366,3364.318,"Just a few things, Mr. Chief Justice."
1983.82-1349,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3592.767,3595.11,Did the District Court make any finding?
1983.82-1349,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3595.11,3597.688,--That case has not yet gone to trial.
1983.82-1349,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3597.688,3598.141,"Oh, the Varig case."
1983.82-1349,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3598.141,3604.013,"The Varig case has not yet gone to trial, but Mr. Gerry has asserted that it is undisputed that there was negligence in that case."
1983.82-1349,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3644.841,3646.401,"Well, not at the type stage."
1983.82-1349,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3646.401,3648.027,"At the type stage, Justice White."
1983.82-1349,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3648.027,3648.838,"Well, now, not then."
1983.82-1349,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3648.838,3650.699,"Even then, Justice White."
1983.82-1349,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3650.699,3652.337,So you disagree with your colleague?
1983.82-1349,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3652.337,3653.07,"Yes, we do."
1983.82-1349,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3670.831,3673.889,They do not have any discretion as to whether to have an inspection.
1983.82-1349,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3675.53,3681.871,The regulations make clear that it is the manufacturer that has no discretion whether to make the inspection.
1983.82-1349,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3688.134,3694.494,But the FAA cannot issue a type certificate without there having been an inspection by somebody.
1983.82-1349,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3694.494,3696.912,"That is true, but that is far from saying--"
1983.82-1349,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3696.912,3700.443,I am just saying that part of it is not discretionary.
1983.82-1349,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3700.443,3704.066,"--Well, but that is also not the basis for the Respondents' suit in this case."
1983.82-1349,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3721.529,3726.852,Is there not evidence as to... There is no evidence in this record as to who made the inspection in this case?
1983.82-1349,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3726.852,3727.929,In which of the two cases?
1983.82-1349,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3727.929,3728.771,In either one of them?
1983.82-1349,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3728.771,3729.504,That is correct.
1983.82-1349,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3745.344,3750.37,I would think in a good many cases you could discover who actually made the inspection.
1983.82-1349,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3750.37,3758.196,"--Well, even if you could, Justice White, the problem is you will never be able to know precisely what they inspected because they only have a duty to spot check."
1983.82-1349,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3764.147,3765.945,"Well, that is not true at the type stage, is it?"
1983.82-1349,2,33830,kenneth_s_geller,,3765.945,3767.302,"Yes, it is, Justice White."
1983.82-1349,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3797.055,3799.211,"Thank you, gentlemen."
