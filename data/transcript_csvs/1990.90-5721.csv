1990.90-5721,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.387,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 90-5721, Pervis Tyrone Payne v. Tennessee."
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,10.959,14.85,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-5721,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,128.928,143.308,"Are you suggesting, Mr. Lathram, that the jury's feeling of sympathy or perhaps outrage at the crime and what it's left the victims with is not a permissible factor at all?"
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,143.308,144.626,"--Oh, not at all, Your Honor."
1990.90-5721,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,148.89,153.485,"And outrage, presumably, if the facts are proven against the defendant."
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,153.485,155.925,"Certainly, Your Honor, I think they would definitely have outrage."
1990.90-5721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,158.086,165.781,"They have outrage, but do you say they may not take that into account in deciding the penalty?"
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,165.781,168.032,"--No, Your Honor, I'm not saying that at all."
1990.90-5721,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,220.378,233.034,"So suppose a juror said in the jury room, you know, some day I might meet this young man 5... young infant... 5, 10 years down the road, and I am very concerned about what kind of justice is done."
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,239.839,242.661,"Your Honor, I don't think so because I don't think we can impeach the verdict."
1990.90-5721,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,243.813,245.463,"Well, let's take the hypothetical."
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,251.537,256.422,"--I don't think the jury should consider it, but I don't think it would raise a problem for this reason."
1990.90-5721,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,269.179,290.633,"Well, if jurors can and will and do, take certain matters of elementary justice into account, it seems to me proper that prosecutors be able to argue about it under the supervision of the court, subject to the rebuttal by the defense counsel, and that it is just only realistic to allow this sort of argument."
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,290.633,295.776,"Your Honor, I think that we must presume that the jury is going to follow its instructions."
1990.90-5721,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,310.345,319.932,"Well, and I submit that a juror could say I'm concerned about what would happen if I would meet this young man or members of his family 5, 10 years down the line."
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,326.757,331.5,"--Your Honor, it... I would respectfully disagree, Your Honor."
1990.90-5721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,362.231,363.009,It's funny you should mention that.
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,386.006,387.877,"Yes, Your Honor, I think it must be excluded."
1990.90-5721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,387.877,388.257,Is that right?
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,388.257,389.568,"I do believe that, Your Honor."
1990.90-5721,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,393.41,398.024,I thought any mitigating evidence... this is mitigating evidence offered by the defense.
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,398.024,414.034,"--Your Honor, to me... I would respectfully submit that this is an arbitrary variable that... I can't imagine anything more arbitrary than to allow an offender's fate to depend upon the opinion of the survivor."
1990.90-5721,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,430.843,435.979,"Well, how about his fate depending on the fact that he had an unhappy childhood?"
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,435.979,447.897,"Your Honor, I think that certainly, as this Court has held, I certainly think that that constitutes mitigating evidence, because that is something that the jury can take into account when it assesses his character."
1990.90-5721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,502.622,503.032,"Well, I don't know."
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,546.269,554.335,"I think it is, Your Honor, because again, I think retribution is a punishment for an injury to society as a whole."
1990.90-5721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,582.644,588.097,What was the third thing the prosecutor did that you object to?
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,588.097,594.872,"--Your Honor, I characterized it as the worst form of psychological intimidation."
1990.90-5721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,594.872,595.262,Yes.
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,595.262,607.211,What he did is he painted a... of course he didn't need to paint a sympathetic picture of this... little boy because one cannot imagine a more sympathetic victim--
1990.90-5721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,607.211,610.113,"This hasn't got anything to do with Booth, has it?"
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,610.113,612.474,"--Yes, Your Honor, I think it does for this reason."
1990.90-5721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,634.866,635.097,No.
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,642.823,643.712,"Your Honor, I think that that's--"
1990.90-5721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,643.712,655.49,All he suggested to the jury is take into consideration the impact that this... that the father's death has had and will have on the son.
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,655.49,659.644,"--Your Honor, I would... if I may respond by--"
1990.90-5721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,659.644,660.265,Go ahead.
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,660.265,661.515,--referring to what he said.
1990.90-5721,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,701.893,710.108,"Well, I agree with you that opinion testimony is a troubling issue."
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,731.531,735.302,"Well, Your Honor, I... there are some other things I certainly want to talk about, but--"
1990.90-5721,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,735.302,746.101,"Mr. Lathram, I'm just wondering if that statement that Nicholas is going to want to know what type of justice was done, isn't the most natural response in the world."
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,771.747,785.326,"--Your Honor, I would like to think that when a juror brought this up during the course of deliberations, that the other jurors would say, we're supposed to decide whether this man lives or dies on the basis of the evidence in the case and the instructions given to us from the Court."
1990.90-5721,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,785.877,789.95,Was there an objection made at the time that this came in?
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,789.95,790.611,"--No, Your Honor."
1990.90-5721,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,790.611,797.904,"And yet you want us to rule now, as a matter of constitutional law, that a new sentencing hearing must be given."
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,797.904,802.517,"Your Honor, Payne's counsel at... in the two State proceedings did not object to this."
1990.90-5721,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,805.0,822.692,"It just seems to me it's exactly the kind of thing that if there were any question about it, that if an objection were made at the time, the trial judge could make some kind of statement to the jury and tell them to disregard any opinion testimony, if that's what the State law required."
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,827.223,827.774,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1990.90-5721,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,827.774,829.334,--strange.
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,829.334,829.955,"--Excuse me, Your Honor."
1990.90-5721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,851.601,856.343,Do you think the prosecutor would have been barred from just saying consider the impact of this death on the son?
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,856.343,858.754,--Not at all.
1990.90-5721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,858.754,861.158,You don't think that would be barred by Booth?
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,861.158,861.957,"No, sir."
1990.90-5721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,863.429,866.931,"But the way you interpret it, you think Booth does bar it?"
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,866.931,872.564,"I think Booth bars what this prosecutor did, but doesn't bar the hypothetical statement that you're--"
1990.90-5721,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,872.564,878.959,Is a prosecutor forbidden any poetic license at all in his argument?
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,895.589,897.339,"--No, Your Honor, I'm not."
1990.90-5721,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,920.206,923.698,But that really is a rather strained construction.
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,939.928,943.811,"--Your Honor, I think that the two key statements here are, first of all he said,"
1990.90-5721,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,987.61,989.272,"May I ask you a question here, Mr. Lathram?"
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,999.109,1004.362,"The Tennessee Supreme Court opinion is ambiguous, I think, Your Honor."
1990.90-5721,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1004.362,1009.795,"And so if you found no Booth violation, there... we really wouldn't have to reach the question of whether to overrule Booth, would we?"
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,1009.795,1013.846,I thing what the court held was that there may have been a Booth violation.
1990.90-5721,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1020.801,1021.693,You said was irrelevant.
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,1024.535,1025.604,It's difficult to tell.
1990.90-5721,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1027.547,1029.897,"It could have been irrelevant as a matter of State law, I suppose."
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,1029.897,1032.419,--It's possible that that could have been the case.
1990.90-5721,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1049.419,1059.577,"Mr. Lathram, suppose he hadn't referred specifically to the child, but had just said, you know, the citizens of this community, when they see this verdict come down, they're going to ask whether justice has been done."
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,1074.798,1077.44,"I think that would be a perfectly permissible argument, Your Honor."
1990.90-5721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1079.851,1081.983,Between that and referring to the child.
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,1081.983,1095.251,"--Yes, Your Honor, because what they're asking... I can't think of... again, I know I'm being somewhat repetitious, but to me, there's nothing more arbitrary than to allow a person's fate to depend upon the opinion of a single survivor."
1990.90-5721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1095.251,1100.433,Why isn't it arbitrary to have it depend on the opinion of the community or my perception of the opinion of the community?
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,1100.433,1108.949,"Because I think that when the jury applies its collective judgment, and it serves as the conscious of the entire community."
1990.90-5721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1118.226,1135.206,"But no, I may be a very kindly person and opposed to capital punishment if it were left up to me, but I am told by the prosecutor, you... you're not sitting to give vent to your own feelings, you are supposed to express what you think is the moral outrage of the community."
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,1148.856,1177.565,"This Court, Your Honor... and I think this will respond to it... this Court has, I think, in Booth and the majority opinion... and again, I'm separating this survivor opinion away from the victim impact, which I'm going to come to in just a minute... but this Court has never intimated, and in fact, all the State courts' decisions, I believe, and this is, I think, brought out in the Huertas argument, have indicated that it's improper for a survivor to express an opinion."
1990.90-5721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1191.212,1191.583,I agree.
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,1203.64,1204.241,"No, Your Honor."
1990.90-5721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1235.802,1243.058,Do you think this Court would permit the exclusion of testimony that the survivors do not want him killed?
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,1243.058,1244.016,Absolutely.
1990.90-5721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1244.016,1246.39,We've said all mitigating evidence has to come in.
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,1246.39,1253.664,"I think what the Court said, I respectfully submit, that what the Court said in Lockett was that all relevant mitigating evidence must come in."
1990.90-5721,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1298.112,1305.358,"Well now, counsel, what else in this case is arguably barred by Booth?"
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,1305.358,1312.422,"Your Honor, I would like to now turn to the grandmother's testimony and the arguments based on the grandmother's testimony."
1990.90-5721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1482.434,1483.373,Why isn't--
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,1483.373,1484.014,My big problem--
1990.90-5721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1484.014,1485.817,--Why isn't it arbitrary whether the death occurs?
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,1506.41,1517.778,"--It's exactly the same except that in that situation, Your Honor, society, working through the Congress, has made a valid, non-arbitrary classification of death eligibility."
1990.90-5721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1535.939,1536.598,"Well, but wait a minute."
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,1546.204,1548.836,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1990.90-5721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1548.836,1555.561,"Well, then how can you pretend that the legislature has set some rigorous penalty that mathematically follows?"
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,1555.561,1561.716,"Well, in the first hypothetical, all the jury is called upon to do is, first, determine whether a death occurred."
1990.90-5721,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1578.956,1586.741,They can take into account any mitigating circumstance and decide not to impose death on the basis of any mitigating circumstance that appeals to them.
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,1586.741,1600.592,"Your Honor, it's inconceivable to me, and perhaps... maybe it should be conceivable, but it's inconceivable to me that a defense lawyer could come in and say, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you've got to consider all mitigating evidence."
1990.90-5721,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1628.177,1632.471,"Mr. Lathram, let me make two suggestions and get your responses to them."
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,1695.834,1701.117,"I think that's correct, Your Honor, and I think that that is the point that we made in the first part of our reply brief in this case."
1990.90-5721,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1724.672,1726.483,Is that an Eighth Amendment concern?
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,1726.483,1735.067,"--Yes, Your Honor, I think it is because it injects, again, an arbitrary factor that I think would run afoul of Furman--"
1990.90-5721,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1735.067,1740.313,The valuation itself is an arbitrary factor because it is insupportable.
1990.90-5721,0,31598,j_brooke_lathram,,1741.642,1753.3,"--Yes, sir, it's the nonspecificity of whether or not somebody has led an exemplary life or a non-exemplary life, or has led a good... is a good person or a bad person, or left behind aggrieved survivors or not aggrieved survivors."
1990.90-5721,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1753.3,1754.73,Thank you Mr. Lathram.
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,1757.722,1767.209,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1990.90-5721,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1845.18,1858.097,"Mr. Burson, or General Burson, nothing you've said goes to comments concerning the views of the victim's family as to what penalty should be imposed."
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,1864.813,1865.233,Correct.
1990.90-5721,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1865.233,1867.804,But not to what penalty the father wants imposed.
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,1867.804,1868.906,Yes.
1990.90-5721,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1870.466,1871.528,What is the relevance of that?
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,1871.528,1876.403,"--it's our position that, as has been discussed, that is not present in this case."
1990.90-5721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1913.486,1929.518,"But General Burson, may I interrupt you at that point because, taking the other side of the coin, as Justice Scalia asked your adversary earlier, if we get survivor opinion that the death penalty should not be imposed and if you decide that's relevant, then it's relevant mitigating evidence and it must come in under Lockett."
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,1930.767,1931.729,"--No, sir."
1990.90-5721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1951.282,1956.586,"So, just to make sure I understand, your point is that it's permissible for the prosecutor to put this kind of evidence in, but not for the defendant."
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,1956.586,1957.504,--No.
1990.90-5721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1969.733,1973.426,But it is entirely the election of the prosecutor whether this kind of evidence can be received?
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,1973.426,1977.369,--I think that is a decision that would have to make on a State-by-State basis.
1990.90-5721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1978.729,1983.832,"But the State could decide, as a matter of its own law, that we will receive such evidence from the prosecutor and exclude it from the defendant."
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,1986.205,1989.497,"--Well, they have to make that decision within the parameters of due process."
1990.90-5721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1989.497,1990.286,"Well, I'm assuming that's the decision they make."
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,1990.286,1992.169,"Well, but they then make--"
1990.90-5721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1992.169,1995.2,"There will be no constitutional objection to that decision, in your view?"
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,1995.2,1996.411,"--No, I didn't say that."
1990.90-5721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1997.843,1999.282,"Well, what would be the constitutional objection then?"
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,1999.282,2003.426,"--Due process, Gardner v. Florida, may well be the objection then."
1990.90-5721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2003.426,2010.699,"So then you are saying, if a State adopts a rule that it will receive this evidence from the prosecutor, due process requires it must also receive it from the defendant."
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2010.699,2013.38,I think that would be a possible--
1990.90-5721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2013.38,2020.466,"So the defendant then, in such a State, would have the right to put on survivors who will testify they do not think the death penalty should be imposed?"
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2020.466,2022.156,--I think that's--
1990.90-5721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2022.156,2022.767,That would be your view?
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2022.767,2028.651,"--where that takes me, and in fact, Georgia in the Rowe Mine case, did allow that."
1990.90-5721,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2034.715,2035.697,Mr. Attorney General?
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2035.697,2036.197,"Yes, sir."
1990.90-5721,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2036.197,2041.831,What happened to the old-time theory that the crime was against the State and not the individual?
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2041.831,2044.443,"Well, I think at the very heart of our--"
1990.90-5721,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2044.443,2045.514,"It's about gone, hasn't it?"
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2045.514,2046.864,"--Yes, sir... no, sir."
1990.90-5721,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2054.768,2074.943,"My other question was the record in this case shows that the jury was shown pictures of the dead bodies, the brutal... blood all over the place, and everything that could be photographed was shown to the jury, and practically no defense."
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2078.293,2086.33,"--Well, I think the point is, it was relevant, it was probative, and the trial judge made that decision."
1990.90-5721,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2086.33,2087.458,What more did you need?
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2087.458,2088.331,"Well, I think that--"
1990.90-5721,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2088.331,2090.161,Can you imagine any jury not convicting?
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2090.161,2098.846,"--I think that they needed a... at least a characterization of the victim as a unique human being, other than just as a corpse."
1990.90-5721,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2103.02,2105.093,You mean you needed more than a bloody body?
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2105.093,2113.368,"Your Honor, I would respectfully say that the State was entitled to put on more than a bloody body, yes, sir."
1990.90-5721,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2113.368,2116.079,Do you think that--
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2125.146,2128.657,"With all due respect, I don't think the child was speaking for the State."
1990.90-5721,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2128.657,2132.85,"Well then, the title says Tennessee v. so-and-so."
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2135.02,2136.262,"Yes, sir."
1990.90-5721,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2136.262,2138.463,And it's a Tennessee problem.
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2140.614,2143.466,The child is a member of the Tennessee society.
1990.90-5721,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2143.466,2146.14,Will any other member come in and talk?
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2146.14,2152.492,I think that that would probably be left up to the trial judge and to the relationship of the--
1990.90-5721,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2152.492,2157.607,"Come off the street and say, I don't think this man should go, I think he should be killed."
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2159.848,2165.721,"--I think that that would be, again, guided by our concepts of fundamental fairness under the due process clause."
1990.90-5721,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2165.721,2167.912,xxx that what you want to talk about?
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2169.763,2171.195,"Yes, sir."
1990.90-5721,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2171.195,2183.773,"General, I take it you think that unless Booth is overruled, you are going to lose this case?"
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2183.773,2185.363,"Well, Your Honor, we--"
1990.90-5721,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2185.363,2192.749,Because you think that this victim impact evidence would not pass muster under Booth.
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2192.749,2205.306,"--The answer is, no, because we think that if you do not overrule Booth, that this was, as the supreme court... supreme court found harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt."
1990.90-5721,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2205.306,2206.017,"Oh, I see."
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2206.017,2210.121,But we do suggest that the information that came in--
1990.90-5721,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2210.121,2212.733,But you say... but you say it was error under Booth.
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2212.733,2214.022,--We say that Booth is--
1990.90-5721,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2214.022,2215.044,"Whether harmless or not, it was error."
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2215.044,2215.584,--Yes.
1990.90-5721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2285.679,2289.072,"General Burson, let me just ask one other question similar to the other one I asked you about."
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2296.268,2305.461,"As an Eighth Amendment proposition, we are not suggesting that that is necessarily prohibited."
1990.90-5721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2310.596,2311.007,"Oh, I understand."
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2311.007,2320.412,--in that what a state should be entitled to do is balance its particular legitimate policy interest against the introduction of this evidence.
1990.90-5721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2349.92,2358.896,"But you would say that if the State puts on evidence about the character of the victim, the witnesses could be cross-examined to test the credibility of that testimony?"
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2358.896,2359.547,Yes.
1990.90-5721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2359.547,2360.248,They could do that?
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2366.753,2369.705,I'm suggesting the State could make that choice.
1990.90-5721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2369.705,2370.256,Right.
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2389.607,2396.332,"What I am suggesting, and I think it is a significant difference, and yes, I do agree with counsel."
1990.90-5721,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2397.904,2398.295,I'm sorry.
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2399.825,2400.426,"--No, no, no."
1990.90-5721,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2449.217,2450.439,Yes.
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2472.641,2476.985,"Well, are we speaking now as a... as a statutory aggravating factor, because I think there is a difference in where we--"
1990.90-5721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2476.985,2477.166,Right.
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2485.391,2486.452,"--Oh, if the victim--"
1990.90-5721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2486.452,2486.763,If the victim--
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2486.763,2490.803,--is a family... father of a family of four.
1990.90-5721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2502.481,2503.302,"--Unless the question, is there a principle--"
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2503.302,2504.083,--name an aggravator.
1990.90-5721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2504.083,2506.264,--Is there a principle basis for drawing that distinction?
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2506.264,2507.185,There may well be.
1990.90-5721,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2525.847,2527.139,I think you have to say that.
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2531.69,2540.225,"I think the principle, Justice Scalia, would be that if it is too broad so as not to actually narrow the class, the vagueness of it."
1990.90-5721,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2545.2,2555.405,"General Burson, do you think that it would be permissible for the State to have evidence introduced to show that the victim went to church every Sunday and never took a drink?"
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2562.501,2573.157,"The type of evidence that we are arguing for is, as far as... again, there is the societal harm evidence, which may be embodied in a particular characteristic of the victim."
1990.90-5721,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2578.302,2580.202,You think that kind of evidence should come in?
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2580.202,2581.164,"--Well, as--"
1990.90-5721,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2581.164,2584.326,Is that what the State wants to do?
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2584.326,2584.725,--It depends on how far it goes.
1990.90-5721,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2593.791,2595.603,Is there any limiting principle?
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2600.446,2605.389,"--We would suggest, no, as far as the foreseeability."
1990.90-5721,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2632.646,2638.68,"And the full extent of the harm includes, in your view, the personal characteristics of the victim?"
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2638.68,2639.271,It may.
1990.90-5721,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2656.341,2664.516,"Well, the human characteristics, she was a nice mother, she always took them to Sunday school."
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2664.516,2673.343,I think those human characteristics are more appropriately viewed as to whether they are needed to paint a basic picture of this unique human being.
1990.90-5721,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2691.656,2707.556,"Laying aside, for the moment, the constitutional considerations, just from the standpoint of your expertise as an attorney general and as a prosecutor, would you recommend that every State in the Union permit all of the evidence that was introduced in this record?"
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2707.556,2725.408,"Well, yes, because I think that this was determined by the trial judge, and we had arbitrariness review, proportionality review."
1990.90-5721,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2730.33,2738.366,My concern is that prosecutors tend to go to the very limits of the law.
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2759.089,2763.773,"--We would suggest, in that regard, we have our due process principles."
1990.90-5721,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2770.626,2782.504,We have had no case that I recall in which we have set aside a death verdict for inflammatory... inflammatory arguments by the prosecutor.
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2786.287,2788.368,"--Well, I think that's just one of the points."
1990.90-5721,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2825.012,2831.347,"Incidentally, just to make the record clear, I take it you don't defend the stabbing of the diagram?"
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2831.347,2833.708,I'm not here to defend that.
1990.90-5721,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2841.863,2843.175,That was the meaning of my question.
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2843.175,2843.896,--to the issues before this case.
1990.90-5721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2843.896,2846.197,May I just ask one last question?
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2857.915,2878.478,"Well, I think this goes to... I think this... that is a very serious question, because I think what Booth and Gather suggest, contrary to what we have said, that we have to have a particularized decision on the defendant, what they are suggesting is a generic victim, an abstract victim, an invisible victim at the sentencing--"
1990.90-5721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2878.478,2882.901,"No, a victim... I suggest what the defendant knows about the victim may properly come into... into evidence."
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2888.275,2889.275,"--Well, I don't think--"
1990.90-5721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2889.275,2889.885,That's all Booth covers.
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2889.885,2891.127,"--I don't think in this case, we are."
1990.90-5721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2891.595,2892.236,"Well, that may be."
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2894.018,2896.219,"--Well, I think that Booth does apply."
1990.90-5721,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2921.735,2925.438,Does not that... does not that to assume that some human beings are not unique?
1990.90-5721,1,18503,charles_w_burson,,2925.438,2925.809,No.
1990.90-5721,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2929.241,2931.863,"Thank you, General Burson."

1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3037.213,3042.325,I think that's a matter that has to be decided by legislative bodies or in a particular case by the court.
1990.90-5721,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3042.325,3046.218,But you would take the view it's permissible to allow it by... constitutionally permissible--
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3046.218,3046.899,"That's a constitutional matter, yes."
1990.90-5721,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3046.899,3049.351,--to allow it for the prosecutor and deny it to the defendant.
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3049.351,3051.063,"As a constitutional matter, yes."

1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3072.656,3083.862,"Depending upon the delineation of aggravating and minimizing circumstances, that might well be admissible within the confines of a legislative definition."

1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3090.507,3108.209,"--I think that our position is that in order for the jury to hold the defendant fully accountable for the extent of the harm that's been inflicted upon the victim, its... his or her family or their community, that that kind of evidence is properly received as a constitutional matter."
1990.90-5721,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3112.293,3121.659,"Well, then why wouldn't evidence as to the unsavory nature of the victim be relevant as far as the defendant's case is concerned?"
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3121.659,3124.889,"I'm suggesting that that, again, is a matter for State law and there is nothing--"
1990.90-5721,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3124.889,3133.725,"Well, I'm asking you though, in the absence of State law, because I suspect in many of these situations, we don't have a directly relevant State law."
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3139.809,3140.951,--My own sense--
1990.90-5721,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3140.951,3142.981,And I'm just wondering what your theory is.
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3142.981,3154.659,--My own sense is that the defense counsel should not be permitted to denigrate the value of the life that already has found to have been taken under circumstances justifying death sentence eligibility.
1990.90-5721,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3172.93,3178.724,"Well, how about pure opinion testimony of a survivor as to the penalty?"
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3178.724,3183.927,"Opinion testimony, again, I don't think, as a constitutional matter, should be barred."
1990.90-5721,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3198.577,3205.293,"But the full extent... I mean, once a man is sentenced to death, what else can you do to him?"
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3205.293,3208.784,Nothing.
1990.90-5721,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3208.784,3212.508,"So, you don't... full extent doesn't help in this case, does it?"
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3212.508,3216.97,"Justice Marshall, what I am trying to convey is a sense--"
1990.90-5721,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3216.97,3224.854,"Well, what I'm trying to convey is that you... this case, they showed everything necessary to bring in a death penalty."
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3227.348,3244.639,"--We would suggest that in making the determination as to whether a death penalty eligible defendant is to, in fact, suffer the death penalty, it's important for the jury to have the full picture of the harm that was caused by the act which took the life of the victim."
1990.90-5721,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3244.639,3246.82,And anything in addition you can think of.
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3246.82,3251.501,"Not anything in addition you can think of, because a trial judge has and exercises the opportunity--"
1990.90-5721,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3251.501,3256.556,"Well, do you agree with me that there was enough there without that... the bloodied pictures, et cetera?"
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3256.556,3259.938,"--I didn't try the case, so I wouldn't want to make that judgment."
1990.90-5721,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3261.148,3262.089,"Well, you have tried other cases, haven't you?"
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3262.089,3262.92,"--Yes, I have."
1990.90-5721,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3262.92,3264.891,"Well, wouldn't you think that was enough?"
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3264.891,3276.148,"In this case, I think the prosecutor properly decided to admit the evidence, to sketch for the jury the full extent of the impact of the loss, to hold the defendant accountable for that."
1990.90-5721,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3276.148,3279.171,xxx overruling Booth?
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3280.122,3281.512,I do not think so.
1990.90-5721,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3281.512,3283.054,"Well, why Booth?"
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3283.054,3289.177,Because I think Booth goes to great pains to presume harm from this evidence.
1990.90-5721,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3289.177,3289.528,But the court didn't.
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3290.838,3294.43,The Tennessee court followed Booth.
1990.90-5721,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3294.43,3296.551,It didn't say so.
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3296.551,3299.143,"But found it to be harmless error, not--"
1990.90-5721,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3299.143,3299.874,It didn't say so.
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3299.874,3304.877,--It found the admission of this evidence to be error under Booth but found it to be harmless.
1990.90-5721,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3304.877,3305.347,That's right.
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3305.347,3309.641,"And we're suggesting that its finding of error is error, and we're urging this court to overrule it."
1990.90-5721,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3309.641,3312.974,And we have to go this... we have to go this one step further and overrule Booth?
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3312.974,3314.484,"Yes, we are."
1990.90-5721,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3367.969,3375.843,"Mr. Attorney General, do you understand that per se rule to apply to a matter that the defendant knew about, or are we only talk about a matter the defendant could not have reasonably foreseen?"
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3375.843,3380.387,"--Clearly, the highest case of culpability is on matters that the defendant knew about."
1990.90-5721,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3380.387,3382.678,But you don't understand Booth to exclude that evidence?
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3382.678,3383.089,No.
1990.90-5721,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3383.089,3383.81,"Oh, okay."
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3383.81,3402.153,"But what we're saying is that in order to assess the full impact of the act that the defendant carried out and to hold that defendant fully accountable, it's necessary to go beyond the ambit of simply what that defendant knew and to take into account the actual impact so that the jury has the full picture."
1990.90-5721,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3402.153,3410.267,"General Thornburgh, do you agree with General Burson that there are really two different sorts of victim impact evidence and that both can get in?"
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3430.56,3432.34,Let me recast that--
1990.90-5721,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3432.34,3434.411,Would both types be admissible in your view?
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3434.411,3443.129,"--Let me, if I might Justice Scalia, recast that dichotomy, because I think there is entirely too much focus upon the characteristics, per se."
1990.90-5721,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3482.313,3485.117,Then you're saying there is a difference between the two categories that Justice Scalia described?
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3485.117,3491.018,"Well, I am suggesting that in both categories, it's not the characteristics of the victim that govern--"
1990.90-5721,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3491.018,3492.67,But the second category doesn't show anything about harm.
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3494.601,3500.165,"--Well, that could have been... the loss of that life could have been of great harm to family, friends, community."
1990.90-5721,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3500.165,3506.76,"No, but just testimony limited to the fine, moral character of the victim, without any indication of harm--"
1990.90-5721,2,21611,dick_thornburgh,,3506.76,3512.814,"Well, real nice guys are... the loss of real nice guys is something of importance to this community, as to all the communities as well."
1990.90-5721,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3512.814,3515.118,"Thank you, General Thornburgh."
