1964.761,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,35.247,"Number 761, Melvin C. Jenkins, Petitioner, versus United States."
1964.761,0,28158,h_thomas_sisk,,36.588,36.827,Yes.
1964.761,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,36.827,38.424,You may proceed with your argument.
1964.761,0,28158,h_thomas_sisk,,38.424,42.085,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.761,1,38003,philip_b_heymann,,1253.151,1256.586,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.761,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1448.529,1449.915,You -- what did you say?
1964.761,1,38003,philip_b_heymann,,1449.915,1456.73,"Incidentally in this case Judge Holtzoff did not indicate that I don't believe what you -- he thought, what verdict he thought would be proper."
1964.761,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1461.078,1468.222,"I wonder -- I wonder if I had Mr. Heymann, I wish you would address yourself to it."
1964.761,1,38003,philip_b_heymann,,1593.096,1593.684,Mr. --
1964.761,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1593.684,1601.391,It just seems to me that that is weighing awfully heavily even before you get to the --
1964.761,1,38003,philip_b_heymann,,1601.391,1603.299,Supplemental charge --
1964.761,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1603.299,1608.854,-- to the -- later instruction where he said you must arrive with a verdict in this case.
1964.761,1,38003,philip_b_heymann,,1608.854,1618.332,"Mr. Chief Justice, I assumed or have no way of knowing that Judge Holtzoff meant when he said this is a simple case that it has very few witnesses."
1964.761,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1621.587,1625.523,They're all at one side except the defendant and (Voice Overlap) --
1964.761,1,38003,philip_b_heymann,,1625.523,1631.187,The defendant called one of their witnesses just simply to show that he couldn't identify the defendant.
1964.761,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1663.507,1672.446,"Well, I think it was very, very strong and I don't say that Judge Holtzoff misstated it in any way, saying what he want."
1964.761,1,38003,philip_b_heymann,,1694.751,1702.384,"Alright, you're saying that in a very -- that in the case it's very strong for the Government, the judge perhaps should not say that it's a simple case and perhaps that's right."
1964.761,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1711.559,1712.817,"Mr. Heymann, (Inaudible)."
1964.761,1,38003,philip_b_heymann,,1712.817,1714.18,"Yes, Mr. Justice Goldberg"
1964.761,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1714.18,1725.811,"-- the Chief Justice said, do you see a difference when a jury comes in and says, “Your Honor, we cannot agree on the evidence which is the passive quote.”"
1964.761,1,38003,philip_b_heymann,,1738.398,1746.059,"Well, until you said the last sentence, Justice Goldberg, I was going to be -- I was going to say I couldn't be more delighted that you asked that question."
1964.761,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1746.234,1748.146,What about the last sentence?
1964.761,1,38003,philip_b_heymann,,1748.146,1753.617,"Well, let me work up to it and enjoy the first steps."
1964.761,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1797.379,1799.582,But that isn't what they said.
1964.761,1,38003,philip_b_heymann,,1799.582,1805.005,They did say -- they said the jury cannot decide the case on either count because of insufficient evidence.
1964.761,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1805.005,1806.254,"Well, what is the meaning of that?"
1964.761,1,38003,philip_b_heymann,,1820.154,1820.905,Alright.
1964.761,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1821.714,1823.395,Did they say on either counts (Inaudible)
1964.761,1,38003,philip_b_heymann,,1823.395,1824.294,They said on both counts --
1964.761,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1824.294,1830.669,"The jury cannot come to the decision on both counts because of insufficient evidence, that's fairly ambiguous don't you think?"
1964.761,1,38003,philip_b_heymann,,1830.669,1832.274,"Oh, it should be -- couldn't be more ambiguous."
1964.761,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,1882.716,1899.254,"We think proper instructions of the -- by the judge if there had to be a supplemental instruction, Mr. Heymann to be that under the instructions I have given you and the Government must prove their case beyond unreasonable doubt, if the evidence is insufficient, your -- turn me a verdict of not guilty."
1964.761,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1899.254,1901.875,"Your Honor, I certainly wish he would have given that instruction."
1964.761,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1948.97,1956.593,"And he did tell them didn't he that they could find him guilty and one on the -- not guilty on the other,(Inaudible)"
1964.761,1,38003,philip_b_heymann,,1956.593,1959.002,I think he -- I'm -- I seem to --
1964.761,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1959.002,1965.584,"Because it seems to me, that's the import of the petitioner expressed in their notes."
1964.761,1,38003,philip_b_heymann,,1970.698,1970.941,Well the --
1964.761,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1970.941,1971.837,(Inaudible)
1964.761,1,38003,philip_b_heymann,,1971.837,1974.359,"The top of page 43, Justice Brennan --"
1964.761,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1974.359,1974.97,Which is it?
1964.761,1,38003,philip_b_heymann,,1974.97,1979.898,"The top of page 43 of the record, you will bring in a separate verdict on each of the 2 counts."
1964.761,2,28158,h_thomas_sisk,,2646.924,2650.507,"Just a few words, Your Honor."
1964.761,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2895.273,2897.04,Could you tell me what page in the record that the --
1964.761,2,28158,h_thomas_sisk,,2897.04,2898.567,Yes sir.
1964.761,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2898.983,2900.883,(Inaudible) in the following morning.
1964.761,2,28158,h_thomas_sisk,,2900.883,2901.587,I'm sorry.
1964.761,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2901.587,2906.978,"That motion when he say defense made the following morning, what page -- I don't find any printed record."
1964.761,2,28158,h_thomas_sisk,,2906.978,2908.938,"I don't believe it is in the printed record, Your Honor."
1964.761,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2908.938,2912.729,"(Inaudible) the cause of that, did you know?"
1964.761,2,28158,h_thomas_sisk,,2912.729,2930.177,"I think -- I'm guessing now, Your Honor, but I'm almost certain that's on -- well, I think it was approximately page 40 or 39 or something such as that."
1964.761,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2930.177,2931.669,Do you know the one I'm talking about?
1964.761,2,28158,h_thomas_sisk,,2931.669,2932.409,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.761,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2932.409,2934.615,On the burden of proof.

1964.761,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2935.902,2937.118,Thank you.
1964.761,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2937.118,2941.388,"Mr. Sisk, this man is an indigent, I understand."
1964.761,2,28158,h_thomas_sisk,,2941.388,2942.376,Yes.
1964.761,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2942.376,2950.572,And the Court has always appreciated the counsel representing the indigent defendants.
