1978.77-5903,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.194,We'll hear arguments next in Corbitt against New Jersey.
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,11.812,14.956,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-5903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,73.897,81.526,Does it make any difference for our purposes or whatever difference there maybe between non vult and nolo contendere from New Jersey?
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,81.526,82.21,No.
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,142.763,151.037,"As I understand it under your system in New Jersey if a defendant pleads not guilty, he may not waive a jury, is that correct?"
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,151.037,151.748,That's true.
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,152.036,153.753,He cannot have a bench trial on a guilty plea.
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,153.753,155.719,All trials must be jury trials.
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,156.224,158.435,You cannot have a bench trial on a not guilty plea.
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,159.348,160.32,Yes.
1978.77-5903,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,160.32,166.415,"Under mandatory life sentence, is he eligible for a parole after a number of years?"
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,166.415,174.86,"Under the mandatory life sentence, he's eligible for a parole as I understand it in 14 years, 8 months, and 10 days."
1978.77-5903,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,174.86,182.081,Is the usual experience still or this actually more often or not release on a parole at that time?
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,182.081,185.345,I honestly couldn't say Your Honor.
1978.77-5903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,235.368,252.541,"Mr. Smith, you cited in your brief our decision last year Bordenkircher against Hayes and this case strikes me as not too much different from the New Jersey legislature is simply enacting in the law but the prosecutor actually did in Bordenkircher."
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,252.541,257.18,"Well, I think there's a clear distinction to be made between this case and in Bordenkircher."
1978.77-5903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,281.557,288.494,But it has in the New Jersey legislature just specifies the terms of the plea bargaining in effect?
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,288.494,298.528,The New Jersey legislature as indicated that people who are willing to waive their constitutional rights maybe sentence to almost any term from probation up to life imprisonment.
1978.77-5903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,298.528,301.868,"But that's what the prosecutor did in Bordenkircher, wasn't it?"
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,301.868,325.492,"Well, in Bordenkircher, I think the answer to that is simply the prosecutor could've proceeded on habitual offender indictment at the very beginning so the defendant was eligible for a sentence of life imprisonment on the day that he was first indited as it were he start paid no penalty because he ultimately was sentence to life imprisonment."
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,337.82,340.983,Well on the other hand that he pleaded not guilty?
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,340.983,341.99,"That's true, Your Honor."
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,341.99,343.98,And then -- and he could've been found not guilty.
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,343.98,344.96,That's very true.
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,344.96,350.424,"And if having pleaded non vult, he couldn't possible have been found not guilty, isn't that correct?"
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,350.424,359.338,That's very true but I don't think that factor distinguishes this case from United States versus Jackson on which I rely.
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,375.952,392.265,"But in the Jackson case, the defendant could've pleaded not guilty and a way of the jury trial and the judge other than that statute, the federal statute could not possibly have imposed to their sentence."
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,392.265,393.713,That's true.
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,393.713,395.205,Only the jury could do it.
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,395.205,397.673,And this case is different only in that --
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,397.673,399.139,Here he can't waive with jury trial.
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,399.256,402.796,But both trials in murder cases must be jury trials.
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,424.526,432.715,And of course Jackson and all the death sentence which is emphasize by your state's Supreme Court.
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,432.715,433.141,That's true.
1978.77-5903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,488.449,497.718,"There was -- but there was certainly a burden in Bordenkircher too, was there not, as a result of the prosecutor's action?"
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,497.718,508.698,"Your Honor, I think that we have to face the fact that people who plead guilty whether or not there are plea bargains commonly received lesser sentences on crimes."
1978.77-5903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,534.16,542.071,"But then in Bordenkircher, the man was originally charge with something that wasn't his greatest and it was finally charge with after he refused the plea bargain."
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,542.071,552.704,"Well, I think that the opinion in that case knows that rather clearly that the prosecutor could've begun from the very first day on habitual offender indictment."
1978.77-5903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,564.449,573.617,"Well, but in New Jersey that your client could from the very first day have elected his jury trial and refuse to plead non vult and he did."
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,573.617,577.905,"And that's exactly what he did and for doing that, he paid this penalty."
1978.77-5903,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,596.213,607.065,"If a man charge with a first degree murder and if he sticks to a not guilty plea, you'll be trialed by jury."
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,607.065,608.748,That' true.
1978.77-5903,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,608.748,619.711,And his lawyer and the prosecutor talking and becomes clear the prosecutor would end up recommending 20 years if he plead guilty.
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,619.711,621.829,That's always a possibility.
1978.77-5903,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,621.829,634.358,"And why isn't that just the same and in senate to disregard his jury right, where the same burden on it?"
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,634.358,637.475,"Well, it certainly is an incentive to disregard his jury right."
1978.77-5903,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,637.475,648.573,"But it's the same -- it seems the same -- It's the same burden in the sense that he's got and he has to make up his mind about which the alternative, which decorum to jump on."
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,648.573,663.537,"Well, I think a distinction has to be made between offering the defendant incentives to give up his constitutional rights and penalizing him if he doesn't give up those rights."
1978.77-5903,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,664.779,675.179,"Well, the prosecutor says I'll never recommend 20 years if you obviously under this law and I'll never recommend 20 years if you'd go to trial, that's your penalty?"
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,675.179,683.735,"Of course, he must receive the life sentence if he is convicted upon the jury trial."
1978.77-5903,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,739.816,746.485,And also structures the limits and structures the bargain.
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,746.485,749.017,"Well, of course that could be done through any number of other --"
1978.77-5903,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,749.017,752.628,"Well, i grant you but it does that anyway."
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,752.628,754.903,"Yes, it does."
1978.77-5903,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,761.93,764.042,"You wouldn't want to do a way with it, would you?"
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,764.042,765.312,Certainly not.
1978.77-5903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,800.062,806.796,But do prosecutors make that kind of offer everyday of the week?
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,806.796,809.244,"Certainly, to lesser included the things and that's --"
1978.77-5903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,809.244,813.256,What's the difference if a prosecutor makes it or if a legislature makes it?
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,813.256,815.28,"Well, here we have as I said before."
1978.77-5903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,848.57,853.918,They give up the right to be found not guilty by a jury?
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,853.918,855.294,That's true.
1978.77-5903,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,860.631,871.707,"Mr. Smith, what happens in New Jersey if two-thirds of the way through the trial before a jury, he decides to plead guilty?"
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,871.707,882.49,"He decides to plead non vult in the middle of a trial, he still eligible for either sentence of life imprisonment or a sentence of up to 30 years in the state prison."
1978.77-5903,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,882.49,886.956,Does that help for each align?
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,886.956,899.6,"I suppose, it would help my argument because I can't see any distinction between a person who admits his skill halfway through a trial and a person who in fact insist upon his rights all the way and is convicted after the trial."
1978.77-5903,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,899.6,905.735,In the party alignment that once it goes into it he is irrevocably stocked with it.
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,905.735,907.615,"Well, that doesn't have to --"
1978.77-5903,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,907.615,909.129,"So, you don't need that point?"
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,909.129,914.029,To be the practice in New Jersey.
1978.77-5903,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1156.446,1177.293,"Will the New Jersey system be constitutionally acceptable in your view, if the statute didn't require that all not guilty pleas be trialed to a jury but simply require that if there was to be a waiver of a jury, it had to be by both sides?"
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1183.025,1187.925,"Well, if I understand Your Honor's question correctly."
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1269.313,1278.584,"Now, if he pleads not -- if he pleads not guilty to a charge and indictment of first degree murder, he can be found not guilty."
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1283.668,1285.93,"Well, if not in this particular case."
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1289.826,1291.017,"This was an arson, it was not a theft."
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1291.017,1296.937,"Right, it was -- if the jury was not charge here with either second degree murder or manslaughter."
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1301.463,1303.291,"Which is first degree murder in New Jersey, isn't it?"
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1303.291,1304.086,Correct.
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1308.374,1312.209,"Yes, but he wouldn't have been admitting a felony murder."
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1314.149,1316.812,"Well, he would've said Your Honor, I started the fire and I mean --"
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1316.812,1328.471,"Well, but isn't it -- am I not correct as a matter of technical New Jersey law, I just want to be sure I understand your law that when you plead non vult, it's not to a degree of homicide? It's just to murder, isn't that right?"
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1328.471,1328.621,That's correct.
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1328.621,1330.121,General as murder.
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1330.121,1331.429,Although --
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1331.429,1332.244,Is that correct?
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1332.244,1332.966,That's correct.
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1337.597,1342.557,"Yes, but is not guilty of, you're not pleading non vult to felony murder or the first degree murder?"
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1342.557,1346.734,"No, you're pleading guilty to non vult to murder and you're admitting a felony murder or first degree murder."
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1346.734,1350.365,But the jury found him guilty of felony murder.
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1350.365,1350.956,That's correct.
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1350.956,1355.646,"Had he pleaded non vult and it would not have been to a felony murder, correct?"
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1355.646,1356.704,"No, it would've been to --"
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1356.704,1357.44,Murder.
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1357.44,1370.297,"A non-specified degree of murder but as I've indicated before, he obviously and setting for the factual basis for his plea, he would've had to admit having committed a felony murder."
1978.77-5903,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1370.297,1382.77,Would you think it's unconstitutional for a state to require as I think some do every -- in a defendant's murder case to go to trial?
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1382.77,1385.137,"No, I don't think that would be anything unconstitutional about that."
1978.77-5903,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1388.116,1392.408,Even if it's accompanied by certain mandatory penalties?
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1392.408,1392.637,Well --
1978.77-5903,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1392.637,1397.901,"In other words, eliminating all possibility of plea negotiations."
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1397.901,1403.165,"Like I said, as long as the same range of penalties is available, I don't see any problem with it."
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1437.32,1459.574,"Just one -- if you're relying on Jackson, one very clear differences that in Jackson, if a defendant pleaded either guilty of kidnapping with harm to the victim in her state or if he pleaded not guilty with the same offense and waive the jury trial."
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1464.809,1465.04,That's correct.
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1465.04,1469.644,"Here, if he pleads non vult, he can be sentence to life imprisonment."
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1471.881,1473.182,"That's true, Your Honor."
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1495.114,1495.771,"I know, but if --"
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1495.771,1497.079,It maybe --
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1497.079,1500.848,but the sentencing judge may imposed it and may send him to the state prison.
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1500.848,1501.505,"That's true, but not --"
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1501.505,1513.433,And that makes us different from the Jackson case where there was absolutely no power in the absence of a jury recommendation under the statute to impose the sentence that a jury could've recommended.
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1513.433,1515.629,"That certainly a factual distinction, Your Honor."
1978.77-5903,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1538.766,1548.575,"Mr. Smith, I gather that New Jersey still uses in the murder indictment to your common law form just willfully following mislead of malice support so on and so forth."
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1553.146,1553.888,That is correct.
1978.77-5903,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1553.888,1559.37,"And that's why going back to your answer to my Brother Stewart, that's why you you'll say when he pleads."
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1563.158,1563.843,That's correct.
1978.77-5903,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1564.289,1572.467,And then the fact that it was a felony murder simply comes out in his admission as to the conduct which constituted the offense.
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1572.467,1577.503,When he said support the factual basis for a plea where he would have to admit it.
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1577.503,1582.863,"In this case, the jury found your client guilty of what, murder or felony murder?"
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1582.863,1583.934,"Well, that's interesting."
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1608.763,1611.388,Or could you make assumptions in criminal in cases --
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1611.388,1611.73,Well --
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1611.73,1613.157,-- when the jury hasn't found him guilty or not?
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1613.157,1619.321,"The situation there was that when, I first got this case after had been accepted by the New Jersey Supreme Court."
1978.77-5903,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1630.587,1635.665,"So, by hypothesis in this case, he was found guilty of felony murder."
1978.77-5903,0,32831,james_k_smith,,1635.665,1639.506,That's correct.
1978.77-5903,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1639.506,1641.919,Mr. DeCicco?
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,1641.919,1644.916,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1730.59,1732.951,Would you explain to me what that interest is?
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,1740.074,1744.461,The interest is to conserve scarce traditional and prosecutorial resources.
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1751.248,1755.708,But those are always present when you persuade the defendant not to stand trial aren't they?
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,1755.708,1756.641,That is correct and that correct --
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1756.641,1766.79,"So, then that is still true that the solo thing that this accomplish, tends to accomplish is to persuade to not stand trial and their buy products are there if it works out."
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,1766.79,1771.146,"Well, I wouldn't characterize it as a sole accomplishment."
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1777.414,1779.913,This statute allows him to avoid that?
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,1779.913,1780.53,"Yes, it does."
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1782.32,1785.872,He can't avoid that if he elects to exercise a constitutional right.
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,1785.872,1787.706,"Yes, he might and even avoided there."
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1807.653,1813.598,"Excuse me again, Mr. DeCicco, you say the Court has upheld statutory schemes such as this?"
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,1813.598,1821.424,It has upheld statutory and or Tom law schemes whereby the goals are unobtainable through any other --
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1821.424,1832.966,"Has it ever upheld a statutory scheme in which the range of penalties for one who stands trial is more severe than the range of penalties for the one who pleads not guilty, who pleads guilty?"
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,1832.966,1834.511,Not an statutory scheme but in Bordenkircher --
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1834.511,1836.049,"No, it doesn't upheld statutory scheme?"
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,1836.049,1836.734,No.
1978.77-5903,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1896.572,1901.563,"Unless it's stronger than that, the death penalty could not be imposed on a such defendant."
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,1906.646,1915.056,"In Jackson, the maximum permitted was greater should he choose to go to trial then the maximum and under the New Jersey statutory scheme."
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1917.525,1927.179,"Why is that different from just changing the minimum and rather that if one case, you can get either 30 days of life imprisonment, the other case, you must get life imprisonment, you have the same maximum."
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,1931.415,1940.579,"Generally speaking, I would say there is no material difference when you're speaking of disparity minimum sentences because that is an essence what all plea bargaining is about."
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1955.096,1964.701,That's true that plea bargaining in general but I don't see how that supports your notion that as long as the maximums or this maxima are the same and both alternatives.
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,1969.472,1972.155,"That is one of our distinctions of Jackson, yes."
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2030.93,2052.129,"Mr. DeCicco, if you rely in the death penalty as the distinguishing feature, are you suggesting that it would be impermissible for a prosecutor who would indicted the defendant for obtaining an indictment for a capital offense to offer as an inducement to a plea of guilty that he would waive, he would withdraw the capital charge and substitute a lesser charge."
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2060.724,2061.534,"Yes, I think it would be --"
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2061.534,2065.033,"If it is permissible, then how does that distinguish the Jackson case?"
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2065.033,2075.71,"Because I think that in Jackson and in death generally, whenever we are talking about that, we are talking about the extent of the encouragement."
1978.77-5903,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2153.99,2165.964,Did this particular defendant face any alternatives other than those of acquittal or conviction of felony murder?
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2165.964,2171.114,"In this particular case, it was trialed to the jury on a felony murder theory."
1978.77-5903,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2171.114,2171.575,And no instructions --
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2171.575,2173.133,And there were no other instructions --
1978.77-5903,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2173.133,2174.357,Included.
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2174.357,2182.71,We can't -- I would not and all I'll assume any jury nullification in this case either he was going to be convicted or he is going to be acquitted.
1978.77-5903,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2182.71,2185.571,And convicted of an offense for which the --
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2185.571,2186.754,Felony murder.
1978.77-5903,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2186.754,2188.977,Punishment was mandatory life imprisonment.
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2188.977,2191.331,"Yes, it was, that's correct."
1978.77-5903,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2197.791,2200.675,Right.
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2200.675,2212.968,"Mr. DeCicco on your maximum distinction, supposing a statute provided that for reckless driving or speeding, the penalty could be anywhere from a $10.00 fine to a maximum of 30 days in jail."
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2223.93,2227.679,I think the statute would be somewhat different from this.
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2227.679,2229.527,"In what respect, unless severe?"
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2229.527,2243.003,If I understand your hypothetical -- may I -- we are talking about a driving offense for which if he pleads guilty he will receive no term of incarceration and if he pleads -- if he goes to trial at the municipal level he will --
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2243.003,2246.876,"Who sets a fine should be up to $5,000.00 --"
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2246.876,2247.949,Um-huh.
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2247.949,2253.503,"From $10.00 to $5,000.00 with the judge's discretion but if he stands trial it's $5,000.00."
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2253.503,2255.351,We have the same maximum.
1978.77-5903,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2256.613,2257.493,Same case as this.
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2257.493,2260.005,I think it would be an essence the same case as this.
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2260.005,2261.604,And you said that's perfectly okay?
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2261.604,2261.767,Yes.
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2261.767,2266.524,"Now, it would be different though if the maximum was 30 days in jail instead of $5,000.00?"
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2266.524,2268.773,"Yes, that's Jackson."
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2270.449,2272.825,"No, no, no, out of the maximum in both cases."
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2277.029,2278.009,"Sorry, I misunderstood."
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2278.009,2283.534,"But and in the other case, the 30-day jail is automatically impose if he likes to stand on trial."
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2283.534,2284.6,That's correct.
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2284.6,2285.679,"And you'd say, how do you --"
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2285.679,2286.772,It would be the same case.
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2287.442,2288.566,But the same case as this?
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2288.566,2289.742,Yes.
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2289.742,2292.67,"And that -- well, how do you say that statute would be all right?"
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2292.67,2295.505,Yes.
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2311.494,2311.856,Even if --
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2311.856,2316.441,As in Jackson where you have the death penalty versus a mere term of years.
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2324.11,2328.109,Even if the maxima is the same -- maxima are the same?
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2328.109,2331.193,"It is possible even if the maxima is same, if there were in great disparity."
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2331.193,2332.101,All right.
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2339.417,2341.622,We're dealing here between life imprisonment --
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2341.622,2341.772,Is the maximum.
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2341.772,2345.196,But it's already been indicated the first parole eligibly --
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2345.196,2349.098,And what would've been the minimum if he'd pleaded that he taken a plea?
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2349.098,2352.36,The minimum could be zero but he could --
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2352.36,2353.234,That's quite a difference range.
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2353.234,2355.508,He could get up to 30 years.
1978.77-5903,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2355.508,2360.241,Is that greater or a lesser than the difference I gave to you of $100.00 to 30 days in jail and --
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2360.241,2370.294,"It's lesser because in practical terms, a murder defendant pleading guilty will not receive a non-custodial term or a fine merely."
1978.77-5903,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2378.707,2389.191,"As in the earlier situations with some of the questions are -- if he stands trial, he also has the opportunity to get no penalty at all, doesn't he?"
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2389.191,2389.714,That's correct.
1978.77-5903,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2392.447,2395.338,"Was that with during the Jackson case, wouldn't it?"
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2395.338,2399.895,"Yes, that was during the Jackson case but again he didn't face the same, he facing greater maximum --"
1978.77-5903,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2399.895,2400.898,But that much was during the Jackson case.
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2400.898,2402.972,And he will that habitual --
1978.77-5903,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2402.972,2412.308,"He could've been acquitted because we were in that case was -- we are not dealing there was a convicted person, we're we?"
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2418.696,2419.183,Right.
1978.77-5903,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2419.183,2420.643,In the Jackson case.
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2422.717,2422.946,Yes.
1978.77-5903,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2422.946,2425.791,Or were we dealing with somebody who'd been convicted by a jury?
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2425.791,2426.44,In Jackson?
1978.77-5903,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2426.44,2426.913,"Yes, in Jackson."
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2426.913,2429.042,"Well, we're dealing with someone who was convicted by a jury."
1978.77-5903,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2429.042,2433.694,I thought there had been a motion to dismiss the indictment and that the --
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2433.694,2434.099,"No, he had been convicted --"
1978.77-5903,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2434.099,2440.133,Did the district judge had found the whole statute unconstitutional?
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2440.133,2446.231,He had been convicted by a jury and this Court officiated the death penalty in that case.
1978.77-5903,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2446.231,2448.844,The District Court had held the entire statute unconstitutional.
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2448.844,2449.929,And this Court that doesn't help me out --
1978.77-5903,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2449.929,2450.165,In Jackson.
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2450.165,2454.74,"-- help me out, yes."
1978.77-5903,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2574.705,2584.928,"And instantly, I gather if he got life after a plea, his eligibility for parole is no different than if he got his mandatory life sentence after that jury."
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2584.928,2590.148,And there is absolutely no distinction between the two.
1978.77-5903,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2635.387,2642.405,"Why aren't they both convictions, the judges convictions and the charged the both convictions?"
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2642.405,2643.181,"Yes, they are."
1978.77-5903,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2643.454,2646.783,But I thought you said that they were different.
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2646.783,2647.165,They are.
1978.77-5903,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2647.165,2651.637,"Then one is a conviction and one is not, you're not saying that are you?"
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2651.637,2656.359,One is a conviction to murder in general -- in general category of murder.
1978.77-5903,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2658.206,2662.111,But when the other what is won before the judge the non vult?
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2662.111,2665.257,That is a conviction of first degree murder specifically.
1978.77-5903,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2665.257,2665.799,"No, no."
1978.77-5903,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2666.19,2667.162,"No, sir --"
1978.77-5903,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2667.162,2668.082,As a result of non vult --
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2668.082,2670.663,"Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you said before a jury, it's exactly it's --"
1978.77-5903,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2670.663,2674.703,But don't you have to explain to the judge what you did?
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2674.703,2675.313,"Yes, the factual --"
1978.77-5903,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2675.313,2680.375,"And don't -- doesn't the judge determine whether that's manslaughter, first degree or its like --"
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2680.375,2680.936,No.
1978.77-5903,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2681.119,2684.088,"Well, how does the judge determine how much time you'll get?"
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2684.088,2684.639,The judge makes his --
1978.77-5903,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2684.639,2686.938,Be careful what you're saying now.

1978.77-5903,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2694.715,2699.194,Would he give the same time for first degree murder as manslaughter?
1978.77-5903,1,29869,john_decicco,,2699.194,2708.946,The judge of course would determine the facts of the case these are the gravity and the heinous nature of the crime in determining whether to impose 25 or 30 or 20 --
