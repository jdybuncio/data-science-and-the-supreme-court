1984.83-1378,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,67.025,"Mr. Henry, I think you may proceed when you are ready."
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,67.025,70.06,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1984.83-1378,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,148.227,161.135,"You have just informed the Court by letter a day or so ago that this man has now been placed on parole, and you call the Court's attention to it."
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,165.522,173.092,"I learned about it, Your Honor, I learned of this last week for the first time and submitted authority with my letter."
1984.83-1378,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,260.166,269.089,Would it make any difference in your answer if he were to get up today and say my client's no longer interested in the habeas petition?
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,269.089,273.141,--It would make a difference from--
1984.83-1378,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,273.141,276.26,Or perhaps so far as I'm concerned I'm not going to press it.
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,276.26,294.573,"--the way you, the way you look at it from his point of view, but I think a what happens should be uniquely within the knowledge of Mr. Lucey, and if he were going to go down and say that today, hopefully that position would have been taken long ago rather than having him come in today."
1984.83-1378,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,294.573,303.179,"Well, now, as I understand it, as you said that he has been restored to his civil rights and finished his sentence, and he's been discharged, hasn't he?"
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,303.179,303.945,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1378,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,303.945,309.999,"Well, in that circumstance, he might have no further interest in this habeas petition, might he not?"
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,312.118,313.018,The possibility--
1984.83-1378,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,313.018,316.72,"But I just wondered if he were to do that, whether your answer to us would be any different."
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,316.72,330.813,"--It would not from our point of view, Your Honor, particularly because we are under orders to do a definite act, and particularly because at this stage of the proceedings, the conviction is there to be dealt with."
1984.83-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,332.579,342.019,"Well, the only thing that interfered with the state's interest in this case was the federal habeas corpus proceedings, right?"
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,342.019,344.887,"That was an intervening thing, and when that commenced--"
1984.83-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,344.887,358.796,"And if we held that the case was moot, we would vacate the District Court's judgment, the Court of Appeals and direct the District Court's judgment to be vacated, in which event there would be no threat to the state."
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,360.879,369.818,"--Perhaps not in this particular case but this issue has, if I might be frank, been quite burdensome to us."
1984.83-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,369.818,376.674,"Well, that may indeed be, but nevertheless, the precedential value of the Court of Appeals' judgment would be eliminated, certainly."
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,376.674,384.261,"That may be the case, and it was that possibility, Your Honor, which prompted me to bring in--"
1984.83-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,384.261,396.569,Wiping the slate clean would also leave the Defendant subject to these collateral consequences.
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,396.569,397.419,--It would indeed.
1984.83-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,397.419,402.889,"Which he is not subject to now unless we... if we affirmed, he would not be subject to those collateral consequences."
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,402.889,406.191,Well--
1984.83-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,406.191,407.258,Unless the state--
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,407.258,414.095,"--Depending on how the state did it, the possibility of an appeal could go forward and be affirmed."
1984.83-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,415.281,420.434,"--But if the state didn't, he would be in effect discharged from those collateral consequences."
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,420.434,423.969,"--That is arguably what could happen, Your Honor."
1984.83-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,426.254,426.754,"Yes, thank you."
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,426.754,433.492,The facts underlying the questions are straightforward.
1984.83-1378,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,529.97,542.961,"Mr. Henry, in the opposing brief is a citation of a case from the Kentucky Court of Appeals called England v. somebody, Spalding."
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,542.961,544.496,Dealing with the statement of appeal.
1984.83-1378,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,544.496,548.682,And it is not cited in either of your briefs.
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,555.436,556.704,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1378,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,556.704,561.774,"It seems to hold against you, and I wondered about your comments."
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,561.774,563.974,I would respond in two ways.
1984.83-1378,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,694.176,725.213,"As long as you're interrupted, Mr. Henry, and in somewhat the same vein, the Kentucky Supreme Court has suggested in the Stahl case that the proper remedy when an appeal is denied or dismissed because of counsel's error is for the trial court to have some new proceeding and allow a new appeal."
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,748.913,755.583,"Your Honor, the practice in Kentucky I believe can best be characterized as in disarray because of this type of case."
1984.83-1378,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,863.019,873.808,"Mr. Henry, let me go back to England v. Spalding, and this is the Kentucky Court of Appeals in 1970 which at that time was your state supreme court."
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,877.196,880.814,In 1970 our high court was called the Court of Appeals.
1984.83-1378,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,880.814,881.164,Court of Appeals.
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,881.164,891.087,"After our judicial amendment in the mid-1970s, our high court is now called the Supreme Court, our immediate appellate court, which came into existence--"
1984.83-1378,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,891.087,895.991,"That is correct, and this is what I am reading, then, from your state's top court in 1970."
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,918.939,946.106,"--The way I distinguish it, Your Honor... and I will be pleased to submit a supplemental letter in addition... is that in England v. Spalding the party did in fact file the required statement of appeal and did in fact, on the facts, put in all the information, as I read the case, with a minor exception which was that supplemental judgment."
1984.83-1378,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,977.912,990.969,"Of course, there's another sentence I didn't read, and that was that the section is designed to assist this Court in processing records, and compliance is not jurisdictional."
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,990.969,997.956,"In the sense of trial jurisdiction and appellate jurisdiction, that is correct."
1984.83-1378,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1048.306,1062.316,I suppose the best evidence of a view of a Kentucky appellate court of how the failure on this appeal should be treated is the decision of the Kentucky Court of Appeals in this case which dismissed this appeal.
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,1062.316,1065.351,"It did indeed, following the policy in--"
1984.83-1378,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1065.351,1069.136,And which is an intermediate appellate court now.
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,1069.136,1069.552,"--Yes, it is."
1984.83-1378,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1100.921,1102.023,Mr. Henry.
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,1102.023,1102.607,Yes.
1984.83-1378,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1102.607,1104.373,May I ask you a question?
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,1106.742,1108.094,"Yes, indeed, Your Honor."
1984.83-1378,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1108.094,1117.45,"And I got the impression from I think it was the Hammershoy case that perhaps if it had not been retained counsel but he'd been indigent, that maybe your state courts would have taken a different view of the matter."
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,1120.002,1131.226,"My understanding, Your Honor, is that our courts insofar as possible try to be in accord with the equal protection pronouncements of this Court."
1984.83-1378,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1155.825,1160.746,What is your best... what would be your best judgment under the Kentucky practice?
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,1169.668,1173.869,--Indigent in the sense that he had perhaps appointed public defender counsel?
1984.83-1378,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1173.869,1174.169,"Public defender, yes."
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,1174.169,1189.146,My observation and experience is appeals are dismissed regardless of whether counsel is retained or appointed so long as the rules simply are not followed.
1984.83-1378,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1211.412,1218.648,Thank you.
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,1218.648,1230.14,"Our Sixth Amendment analysis is this, our analysis of the so-called right found by the Sixth Circuit to effective assistance of counsel on appeal."
1984.83-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1280.706,1286.81,"Well, did the Court of Appeals say this right arose out of the Sixth Amendment?"
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,1286.81,1287.477,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1287.477,1287.995,It didn't.
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,1287.995,1291.364,The Court of Appeals did not explain the source of the right.
1984.83-1378,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1337.659,1353.854,"I guess the opinion isn't... doesn't really go into it with much clarity, but did the Sixth Circuit opinion not say that it recognized the due process right to the effective assistance?"
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,1353.854,1357.222,"--Yes, Your Honor, it does indeed, due process right to effective assistance."
1984.83-1378,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1357.222,1357.439,Yes.
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,1366.662,1366.912,This Court didn't either.
1984.83-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1439.191,1444.178,"Well, what about... I take it there is no claim of a denial of equal protection in this case."
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,1445.88,1450.498,"By stipulation of the parties, there is no equal protection issue here, Your Honor."
1984.83-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1450.498,1451.95,You were lucky.
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,1451.95,1467.226,"In a sense, I was, but I would say of opposing counsel, for his benefit, I think he made the correct, factually correct decision and recognized the reality of it, and I... it's more than luck."
1984.83-1378,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1469.909,1470.844,"Well, that may be, but still--"
1984.83-1378,0,30750,j_gerald_henry,,1470.844,1471.811,--to be candid about it.
1984.83-1378,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1650.328,1655.28,Mr. Radigan?
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,1655.28,1667.604,"Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors, let me, before I get into a discussion of the substantive issues that we have here in the case, let me take care of a few preliminary matters, if I may."
1984.83-1378,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1719.305,1720.722,"Mr. Radigan, I didn't follow you."
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,1722.674,1724.376,--He has served out his sentence.
1984.83-1378,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1752.377,1762.232,"Well, if he were indicted and went to trial on some other charge, could the conviction, the one now under discussion, be used to impeach his testimony?"
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,1762.232,1763.917,"Yes, Your Honor, it could under Kentucky law."
1984.83-1378,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1763.917,1765.869,"Then that is still quite a burden, isn't it?"
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,1765.869,1766.535,It is quite a burden.
1984.83-1378,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1776.241,1780.027,"Well, isn't that enough to keep this case alive?"
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,1780.027,1781.295,"That's my position, Your Honor."
1984.83-1378,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1788.365,1790.15,"Well, it can't be with respect to him."
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,1790.15,1791.534,"No, Your Honor, but as far as--"
1984.83-1378,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1791.534,1792.384,"Well, that's the rule."
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,1798.238,1810.998,"--I understand that, Your Honor, but the fact of the matter is that Justice O'Connor raised the question of does not the Stahl decision in 1981 eliminate this problem totally for Kentucky, and let me clarify that, if I may."
1984.83-1378,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1932.61,1959.744,"Well, Mr. Radigan, supposing that Mr. Lucey's counsel's failure in this case had not been to file a statement attached to his brief, or whatever it is that was found defective, but supposing instead that the Kentucky statutes provided you are going to challenge a criminal conviction by appeal, you must file a notice of appeal within 30 days, and his counsel simply had not done that, do you say that he is then denied effective assistance of counsel?"
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,1959.744,1960.477,"Yes, Your Honor, I do."
1984.83-1378,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1960.477,1966.148,"In other words, a state may not have any system regulating the filing of appeals?"
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,1966.148,1968.183,"No, no, and please let me clarify this."
1984.83-1378,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1968.183,1972.218,"When you say no, does that mean you are agreeing with me or you are not agreeing with me?"
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,1972.218,1995.5,"I am agreeing with you to the extent that there is a definite need in any type of case, Your Honor, to have, whether we are talking civil or criminal, whether we are talking trial or appeal, there is a necessity and indeed an absolute necessity to have some sort of rules of procedure for organizing and for documenting and for proceeding on any type of a case."
1984.83-1378,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2013.045,2034.744,"Well, now, then your response to my question about a 30 day time limit for filing a notice of appeal is that if the attorney didn't file that, the client ipso facto has been denied effective assistance of counsel, and so a rule requiring a timely filing of a notice of appeal in criminal cases, whether federal or state, is just not worth the paper it is written on."
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2034.744,2045.866,"No, Your Honor, I think there is a difference there because assuming... let's assume under your factual scenario that the client has told his attorney yes, I want to appeal my conviction."
1984.83-1378,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2059.71,2062.562,"Well, but I really want an answer to my question."
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2084.677,2087.629,"I agree with your conclusion, yes, Your Honor, that is very true."
1984.83-1378,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2112.76,2121.283,"And so the client gets an appeal at a later date, notwithstanding his attorney's failure to comply with the state statute."
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2121.283,2122.083,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1378,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2122.083,2123.052,"Well, then--"
1984.83-1378,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2125.502,2142.514,"I guess that saying it's ineffective assistance of counsel doesn't answer the inquiry because you then have to say does the Constitution, what does the Constitution require happen as a result of counsel's error, do you not?"
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2142.514,2143.799,I believe that's correct.
1984.83-1378,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2144.399,2170.283,"Now, could... is it possible that as long as the state has some recognized procedure by virtue of another application after the dismissal of the appeal to get some review or relief or a delayed appeal, possibly, under those circumstances, is that enough to meet any due process requirement?"
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2170.283,2207.206,"--I think, Your Honor, if you look at the Kentucky cases on those, the Hammershoy case that was mentioned to you, and the Stahl case in Kentucky, both of them recognized exactly the scenario you just presented, and both of those decisions recognizes the fact that in Stahl, because of overloaded public defender case, and in Hammershoy, Justice Rehnquist, because the attorney failed to file the notice of appeal within ten days, that those situations constituted ineffective assistance of counsel, and therefore there was a procedure to go back and to attempt to reinstate essentially that appeal in the trial court."
1984.83-1378,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2207.206,2209.508,"Yes, well, so... well, that's my inquiry."
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2235.225,2236.991,Now it does.
1984.83-1378,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2257.639,2269.613,"Well, do you agree that for a defendant under Mr. Lucey's circumstances today in Kentucky there wouldn't be a due process problem because of Kentucky's new procedure?"
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2269.613,2296.697,"If the courts in Kentucky did implement and recognize the fact that an individual cannot be denied his right to an appeal, his right to present and marshal those arguments to an appellate court through the negligence and inaction or whatever of his attorney and would reinstate that appeal, then indeed we have a situation that would indeed protect his rights."
1984.83-1378,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2296.697,2311.274,"Well, do you think that... just, I don't want to pursue this unduly, but let's suppose the state added a feature to the effect that we will allow a delayed appeal if there appears to be some arguable basis for it, is that enough?"
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2311.274,2316.492,"No, I don't think so, Your Honor, and I think that there are some problems in regard to that."
1984.83-1378,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2389.64,2397.63,"Well, are you saying that fundamental fairness under the due process clause carries with it a right to file a frivolous appeal?"
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2397.63,2399.213,"--No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1378,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2485.519,2488.521,But in Cronic we were talking about performance at a trial--
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2488.521,2489.556,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1378,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2489.556,2491.09,--which is clearly covered by the Sixth Amendment.
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2496.894,2501.447,"I think, Your Honor, that this Court has been very clear as far as its holding on that."
1984.83-1378,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2516.29,2529.18,"But you say notwithstanding the fact that there is no constitutional right to an appeal, there is some sort of due process right to the services of an attorney if a state grants you an appeal."
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2529.18,2533.732,"I think that there... this Court recognized that, in my opinion, in Douglas v. California."
1984.83-1378,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2533.732,2535.168,What about Ross v. Moffitt?
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2535.168,2541.572,"Ross v. Moffitt, of course, dealt with a second stage of discretionary appeal to the... for instance, the Supreme Court."
1984.83-1378,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2541.572,2549.094,"Nevertheless, it said that a state didn't need to furnish counsel in connection with appeal."
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2549.094,2555.415,"With a second stage appeal, that is correct, Your Honor, but this is... what we have in Mr. Lucey's case--"
1984.83-1378,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2555.415,2556.798,You're just looking at the facts of the case.
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2560.384,2563.77,"--Yes, Your Honor, it most definitely was, with all due respect."
1984.83-1378,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2574.709,2576.011,I know what the issue was.
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2576.011,2587.136,"--And the issue was whether or not the individual should be appointed a counsel on the second stage appeal, the discretionary review, or a petition for certiorari to this Court."
1984.83-1378,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2708.998,2725.959,"But now both Swenson and Anders that you have referred to are cases that are talking about indigents, and they are saying that you can't treat them worse at the appellate stage than you do people who have money to hire a lawyer or pay fee."
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2735.249,2742.569,"That is correct, and the specific on the language in this Court in Anders, this Court said that an indigent must have the same,"
1984.83-1378,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2808.53,2815.267,"I don't think you read those cases correctly, though I recognize that there may be two respectable points of view on it."
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2838.55,2841.085,"Well, no, and my client was not indigent."
1984.83-1378,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2842.419,2843.352,"Well, you--"
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2843.352,2844.804,"Yes, Justice."
1984.83-1378,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2844.804,2848.422,--You conceded apparently that there is no equal protection violation.
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2848.422,2849.155,"Right, that's correct."
1984.83-1378,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2849.155,2850.505,So that--
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2850.505,2863.813,"Well, but the question therefore is does there exist a due process standard by which this Court or any court in Kentucky has to measure the performance of the appellate counsel."
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2887.963,2888.546,--Mr. Radigan?
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2888.546,2889.546,"Yes, Justice Marshall."
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2889.546,2896.8,What about at the trial of the case where you have appointed counsel and he gives up in the middle of the case and goes home?
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2896.8,2905.406,"What we have there, Your Honor, in my opinion, is a violation both of equal protection and due process."
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2906.258,2906.574,How?
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2908.658,2923.283,"--The state simple, as this Court has stated in Collier v. Sullivan, the mere involvement of the state in the conviction of any individual is sufficient to implicate due process implications for trial counsel."
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2923.283,2925.469,But this is... the lawyer just walked out of the courtroom.
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2925.469,2926.435,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2926.435,2928.337,"Well, at that stage, what should the court do?"
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2928.337,2932.306,"The court should stop the trial and declare a mistrial at that time, in my opinion."
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2932.306,2933.241,"Well, you--"
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2933.241,2935.225,Because an individual--
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2935.225,2937.71,"--Well, suppose the individual walks out of the courtroom?"
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2937.71,2939.995,"--Well, that's a different circumstance, Justice."
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2939.995,2940.695,And what is different?
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2940.695,2954.988,"What is different is the fact that the attorney has an obligation to represent the client during that trial proceedings, and unless and until the individual concedes and admits that the attorney, that he does not want an attorney--"
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2954.988,2958.856,"Does the court have to enforce that right, or does the Bar Association enforce that right?"
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2958.856,2961.575,"--I think the court does, as well as the Bar Association."
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2977.104,2982.556,I just don't know what... the Court didn't know that this lawyer was not going to file.
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2982.556,2985.674,You are talking about Mr. Lucey's case?
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2985.674,2986.21,Yes.
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2986.21,2988.51,"Well, what... the court--"
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2988.51,2989.595,Did the court know that?
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2989.595,2991.528,"--No, the court, not before it happened."
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2991.528,2993.713,What could the court have done to stop that?
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2993.713,2995.815,What the court could have done in this--
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2995.815,2996.531,To stop that.
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2996.531,2999.267,--To stop this from occurring to begin with?
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2999.267,2999.817,Yes.
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,2999.817,3000.802,I don't think anything.
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3000.802,3003.252,So the court is not responsible for anything.
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3003.252,3004.754,"Well, the court is responsible--"
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3004.754,3008.289,But now you are going to make the court do something for what they are not responsible for.
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3008.289,3015.729,--The court does not have the responsibility to take and anticipate what an attorney will or might do at some time in the future.
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3028.303,3035.456,"Well, if I agree with you that he could do that and punish the attorney, I don't see what he could do about the case."
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3035.456,3051.299,"--If we have an option that is granted to a court to enforce certain principles or to enforce certain positions or requirements by counsel, then what we have is a situation where the court has an option."
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3119.026,3124.18,How could the Court of Appeals of appeals enforce its ruling other than to enforce it?
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3124.18,3125.047,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3125.047,3126.797,"Well, how can they do other than that?"
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3126.797,3129.13,What they can do is several actions.
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3179.33,3185.3,But I don't... your argument is that Kentucky must adopt the good rules of every other appellate court in the country.
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3185.3,3186.502,--I'm saying simply--
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3186.502,3187.969,"Well, I don't know what else you are arguing."
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3187.969,3190.97,--I'm saying that the Court of Appeals of Kentucky--
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3190.97,3202.678,How does a court enforce this rule that you must file within ten days other than to not accept anything after ten days?
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3202.678,3212.736,"--They can do that, Your Honor, but they can do it in a manner in which Mr. Lucey's rights and his personal decision to appeal his conviction would not be harmed in the end result."
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3212.736,3214.769,"Well, the rule is not being enforced."
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3214.769,3216.855,The rules would be enforced.
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3216.855,3219.64,"How could... well, how can you unring a bell?"
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3219.64,3236.768,"What you do is while you are enforcing the rules, you remand it, as Justice O'Connor recognized, as Kentucky courts have recognized in Stahl v. Commonwealth as a possible solution, you remand it to the trial court and you say you start over, and yet follow the rules this time."
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3242.438,3245.124,So you want to make the rule retroactive.
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3245.124,3246.507,"--No, Your Honor, no."
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3246.507,3247.992,"Well, what else are you saying?"
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3247.992,3249.959,I am saying that Mr.--
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3249.959,3250.944,Don't you want the rule?
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3254.813,3257.948,--If the rule is made retroactive?
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3259.182,3262.317,The rule which says you have five days to file that supplemental.
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3262.317,3265.954,"Oh, the deficiency notice that they are doing now."
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3265.954,3266.471,Yes.
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3266.471,3270.422,"If that had been in existence at the time, we would have been fine, but it wasn't."
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3270.422,3272.357,That wasn't my... it wasn't my question.
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3275.226,3275.826,"No, Your Honor."
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3277.511,3278.545,Why?
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3278.545,3279.811,He would still be denied his appeal.
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3279.811,3281.063,Why?
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3283.13,3286.967,Because that is not what happened in this circumstance.
1984.83-1378,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3286.967,3290.836,"Well, well, what do you want us to do, to say he ipsy dixie gets an appeal?"
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3290.836,3317.053,"I want this Court to say that Mr. Lucey has the right to effective assistance of counsel on appeal, that when he is denied that due process right, that indeed, what should occur is that there should be an appeal granted him anew, that he begin again and have the right to have his appeal, his conviction reviewed by an appellate court."
1984.83-1378,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3317.053,3318.153,May I ask a question?
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3318.153,3319.253,"Certainly, Justice Stevens."
1984.83-1378,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3319.253,3322.957,"From your colloquy, I gather this problem has arisen more than once in Kentucky."
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3322.957,3323.99,"Unfortunately, Justice Stevens--"
1984.83-1378,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3323.99,3339.399,"And which suggests there may be either some clever lawyers or some incompetent lawyers in Kentucky, and I am wondering if the revision in procedures includes some procedure for disciplining counsel who are found to have been so incompetent as to be unable to file a notice of appeal."
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3339.399,3350.69,"--Well, Your Honor, I hate to do this, but if I can refer you to a case called in Re Radigan, which is cited in Mr. Lucey's brief, the Supreme Court of Kentucky used me as an example of that."
1984.83-1378,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3393.267,3394.803,"Mr. Radigan, your time is about up."
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3399.873,3400.806,"Yes, Your Honor."
1984.83-1378,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3400.806,3404.591,You mentioned that you had consulted with your client about ten days ago.
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3404.591,3405.508,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1984.83-1378,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3405.508,3416.816,"Are you telling us today that he wants you to, as of today, not as of ten days ago, continue with the defense of the judgment of the Court of Appeals?"
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3416.816,3418.585,"I can't say as of today, Your Honor."
1984.83-1378,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3420.536,3423.488,"Well, that would make a difference to me on the mootness question."
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3423.488,3426.69,"If the Court wishes, I will supplement this--"
1984.83-1378,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3426.69,3429.206,"Well, at least for my benefit, I wish you would find out."
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3429.206,3429.423,"--Certainly, Justice Brennan."
1984.83-1378,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3429.423,3431.825,I would like to know whether he wants you to persist in this.
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3431.825,3433.01,Certainly.
1984.83-1378,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3433.01,3435.796,"You will advise the Court by letter, with a copy to your friend, of course."
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3435.796,3437.662,"I would be more than glad to, Your Honor."
1984.83-1378,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3453.34,3454.256,"You are out of time, counsel."
1984.83-1378,1,45968,william_m_radigan,,3454.256,3455.623,"--Oh, my apologies, Your Honor."
