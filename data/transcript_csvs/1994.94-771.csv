1994.94-771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.398,"We'll hear argument now in Number 94-777... 771, pardon me, the Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Chickasaw Nation."
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,11.51,14.292,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,98.818,101.78,"Was this argument raised before the court of appeals, Mr. Rothfeld?"
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,101.78,105.473,"It was not, Your Honor, but I think that should not preclude its consideration here."
1994.94-771,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,130.548,136.432,"Mr. Rothfeld, most of these gas stations, I understand it, are in Indian territory but not on the reservation."
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,141.504,145.849,"Well, I think, Your Honor, there was no doubt about the meaning of the word ""reservation"" at the time the act was written."
1994.94-771,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,146.61,147.829,It means Indian territory?
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,147.829,159.787,"--Well, I think that this Court had said some years before in United States v. Celestine that the term ""reservation"" is used in the land law to refer to any body of land, large or small, that has been reserved from sale by Congress for any purpose, and that--"
1994.94-771,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,159.787,161.61,"In the land law, but this is not land law."
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,169.824,170.913,"--Well, these--"
1994.94-771,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,170.913,173.076,"At least, it's highly questionable that it does."
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,175.999,178.55,"--Well, I think that it clearly does cover Indian reservations."
1994.94-771,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,198.633,204.587,"Well, Mr. Rothfeld, now, this Hayden-Cartwright Act point was not raised below, or dealt with."
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,204.587,206.157,"That is true, Justice O'Connor."
1994.94-771,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,206.157,213.082,"It would require us to interpret the meaning of ""reservation"" within that act I guess for the first time."
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,213.082,214.043,That's true.
1994.94-771,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,215.412,222.038,And there was nothing express in the petition for certiorari here that referred us to the Hayden-Cartwright Act.
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,222.038,234.276,"Again, that is true, Your Honor, but I think that the question presented in the petition is whether or not this Oklahoma law is preempted, and clearly to answer that question requires a consideration of the body of congressional legislation."
1994.94-771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,250.776,260.743,"Your first question presented, which I take it the Hayden-Cartwright Act would have to come under, or... it's not at all."
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,275.273,301.96,"--Well, I think, Your Honor, that's a highfalutin way of asking whether or not the statute... the State statute is preempted, and again it's difficult to resolve a question of preemption, and particularly a question of Indian preemption which the Court has looked at the entire body of Federal legislation to see if there is an extant Federal policy that bears on the question without considering whether there is a Federal statute in the area, and this Federal statute clearly expresses the intent of Congress as to the particular point that's at issue here, so I--"
1994.94-771,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,301.96,315.558,"Mr. Rothfeld, even if you're right that the Court could entertain this statutory argument, isn't it extraordinary for this Court to be a court of first view?"
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,332.121,347.63,"--Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg, again, we are presenting the question of whether or not this State law is preempted, and to answer that question we think that it would be appropriate for the Court to look to the entire body of Federal legislation to determine whether or not Congress has expressed a policy that bears on the particular tax."
1994.94-771,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,347.63,355.445,"It might also be appropriate for the Court to say, we leave that question to one side because it has not aired before the court of appeals."
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,355.445,359.92,"Well, I... certainly that's within the Court's discretion, Your Honor."
1994.94-771,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,390.537,396.502,Your references to doubt I guess are to the departmental view at the time.
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,403.167,407.912,"So far as I am aware, Your Honor, there is one lower court decision on this point which has construed it."
1994.94-771,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,418.006,419.218,Have you cited it?
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,419.218,420.597,"--It was not cited, Your Honor."
1994.94-771,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,426.512,431.256,The respondents say that we should dismiss this as improvidently granted.
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,437.721,455.073,"--Well, I think that the legislation that the tribe refers to in its brief is essentially dead for this term of the Oklahoma legislature, so there is no prospect that the case be mooted, and I think this is clearly... even if the Court were to conclude that this was not a ground that it can base its decision upon, this is not a ground for dismissing the case as improvidently granted."
1994.94-771,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,510.738,514.251,"Well, but it's one which I gather your client has embodied in a statute."
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,514.251,517.621,"--Well, I think that there is--"
1994.94-771,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,517.621,518.302,Isn't that so?
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,527.359,529.66,"--Well, that was the court of appeals conclusion, Your Honor."
1994.94-771,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,538.355,547.05,"Well, don't we draw... I mean, not to put too fine a point on it, but didn't Oklahoma win the last case by a little line-drawing of exactly that sort?"
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,556.918,558.75,"--Well, I think it would be the--"
1994.94-771,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,558.75,561.301,You did very well with formal line-drawing then.
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,561.301,562.241,"--I think it would be the Commission's preference to win both cases, Your Honor."
1994.94-771,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,562.241,562.622,Pardon me?
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,562.622,567.116,"I think I can confidently state that it's the Commission's preference to win both of those cases, and I--"
1994.94-771,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,567.116,568.054,I guess that might be its position.
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,568.054,569.647,--And I think that they are entirely consistent.
1994.94-771,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,580.752,584.266,It did not focus on economic effects.
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,588.617,594.922,"--No, that is certainly true, but there was a real difference, a real world difference between the two types of taxes that were at issue in that case."
1994.94-771,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,603.317,605.931,"Is there any... I mean, you're talking economic realities."
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,617.068,619.389,"--Well, I think that that's quite right, and that is a--"
1994.94-771,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,619.389,622.31,So don't we have to determine it on formalistic bases?
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,630.235,630.746,--No.
1994.94-771,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,640.032,647.717,"I'm saying if you do that there's no such thing as a tax on a retailer, because a retailer will always pass the tax downward to the maximum extent possible."
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,657.473,666.659,"No, that is absolutely right, and we therefore think that in determining whether a tax of this kind is valid, the Court should look to whether or not it has an impermissible effect on the tribe."
1994.94-771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,666.659,669.221,"But that's not what our previous cases have done, is it?"
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,673.983,681.029,"Well, I think that it's clear from the body of the Court's cases that it has not regarded legal instances as the be-all and end-all of the inquiry that is necessarily decisive."
1994.94-771,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,753.745,760.17,"It we reject your argument, I take it that Oklahoma could easily revise its taxing scheme in order to collect these taxes."
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,762.323,763.352,That's true.
1994.94-771,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,783.444,787.397,So the cost of adhering to our precedents is really rather slight.
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,796.304,798.926,"Let me respond in two parts to that, Justice Kennedy."
1994.94-771,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,836.599,851.041,"Well, surely the legislators of the State of Oklahoma and other States with substantial Indian reservations are well aware of our taxing jurisprudence, and it would be quite astounding for us to presume to the contrary."
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,851.041,860.265,"Well, I think that this case actually is an illustration of the problem, that the Oklahoma legislature I think had been laboring under the assumption that the legal incidence of this tax fell upon the consumer."
1994.94-771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,876.547,885.192,But you're... so you say perhaps the Tenth Circuit was wrong here in deciding the question of Oklahoma law as to where the incidence of the tax fell.
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,891.668,899.031,--The legislation that is dead would have declared the intent of the Oklahoma legislature that the tax fall upon the consumer.
1994.94-771,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,899.031,901.454,You claim this is a question of Federal law?
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,910.538,912.541,"No, no, we don't suggest that it's a question of Federal law."
1994.94-771,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,930.971,931.542,--Why?
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,931.542,934.824,It would otherwise be impossible to resolve--
1994.94-771,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,934.824,936.857,"I mean, they have to be able to determine what the Oklahoma law is."
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,936.857,937.626,"--Well, that's right."
1994.94-771,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,950.455,957.608,"Why should we not just accept the finding of the court of appeals on that question of State law, as we usually do?"
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,957.608,967.726,"Well, we think the court of appeals is clearly wrong, and the court has in other cases, as in Chemehuevi, a very similar situation, has said that the court of appeals got it wrong and has determined the legal incidence for itself."
1994.94-771,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1048.169,1056.745,"Are you saying then that if this pending law, or this law that is now dead, had passed, there'd be no difference at all in substance?"
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1056.745,1062.469,"--That is absolutely right, Justice Ginsburg, and I think that is the most powerful argument for why such a formalistic rule makes no sense."
1994.94-771,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1119.636,1121.977,I'm not sure what I understand you want us to look to.
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1130.703,1132.324,"I think, Justice Scalia, that--"
1994.94-771,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1132.324,1135.636,Who actually ends up paying the tax?
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1135.636,1144.702,"--I think the Court should look to the same considerations that it looks to outside of the tax context, where it looks to what the Court has called the particularized inquiry into the State, the tribal, and the Federal interest."
1994.94-771,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1158.559,1172.781,"I thought you were arguing to us that it was unrealistic to view the incidence of the tax as being on one party or the other, and now you're saying it doesn't matter who the incidence of the tax is on, you should just be... just look at the scheme and see if it's hurting the tribes too much."
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1172.781,1175.951,--I think it doesn't matter who the legal incidence of the tax is on.
1994.94-771,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1180.165,1180.977,Fine.
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1185.448,1188.179,But the Court has already held in Moe and Colville and--
1994.94-771,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1188.179,1215.258,"Right, so I mean, if you really want us to look to the economic effect, I take it if there are only a few gas stations owned by the tribe, and prices are competitive, and there are a lot of gas stations elsewhere in the State, that whether you say the consumer is paying it or whether you say the distributor is paying it, or whether you say somebody else is paying it, in the absence of the tax, the tribe could charge more money, which they'd keep, and in the presence of the tax, they'll have to give that extra money to the Government."
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1215.258,1226.725,"--That is true, Justice Breyer, but the Court has confronted that balance repeatedly in cases in which the legal incidence fell upon the ultimate purchaser and has found that the tribal interests in those circumstances do not outweigh the State's interest, and the--"
1994.94-771,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1226.725,1233.399,"But the point is, if you look at the formality of it, the formality isn't on the tribe, is it, or is not?"
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1233.399,1234.13,"--Well, the court of appeals held that it is."
1994.94-771,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1234.91,1235.26,"Yes, all right."
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1240.044,1253.343,"--No, on the contrary, I think that we do win on the reality, because the Court... the Court has judged taxes in which the legal incidence falls upon the purchaser, the taxes in Moe and in Chemehuevi, and in Colville, and in, most recently in Milhelm Attea."
1994.94-771,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1257.186,1259.516,"Well, isn't the economic... that's my question."
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1289.175,1296.412,"--If I may, Your Honor, I think the rule the Court has stated is that a State law is not invalid simply because it has an adverse economic impact on the tribe."
1994.94-771,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1314.443,1316.284,"We haven't said that, you've said it."
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1316.284,1317.335,"--No, no--"
1994.94-771,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1317.335,1321.857,We asked you how you determined who bears the incidence of the tax.
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1337.918,1340.791,--But I think the test is not as the Court has said it.
1994.94-771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1351.676,1357.871,"That's quite a different test than saying we ought to look at the economic impact, which I thought you were saying a moment ago."
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1357.871,1359.974,Maybe I have misspoken.
1994.94-771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1376.323,1392.864,"Well, in Chemehuevi, which was maybe 10 years ago... I just glanced at it again... there we reversed the Ninth Circuit because we thought it had been wrong in deciding where the legal incidence of the tax was, so at least we thought at that time, 10 years ago, that that was the test."
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1392.864,1400.339,"Well, again, I think that the Court has found it an easy and noncontroversial way to dispose of these cases on the ground that the legal incidence doesn't fall--"
1994.94-771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1400.339,1402.67,I think you may do us less than justice.
1994.94-771,0,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,1402.971,1421.324,"--Well, I don't presume to tell the Court what it was thinking when it resolved these cases, Your Honor, but as I said, it is I think clear from the tenor of the Court's opinion as in Sac and Fox and Colville, where it did not dispose of challenges on the ground that these taxes have a legal incidence that falls upon members of the tribe, that's the end of the matter."
1994.94-771,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1464.981,1466.614,"Very well, Mr. Rothfeld."
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,1470.385,1481.053,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-771,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1572.963,1580.888,Is there any difference that the consumer can see between what would have been if this law had passed and what is?
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,1590.113,1617.27,"Justice Ginsburg, I would say in answer to that that while it might be theoretically possible that a retailer might choose to ""absorb"" part of the tax and therefore there might be some theoretical difference, our inclination is the same as the implications of Justice Scalia's question, which is that you know, can you really see any difference between the tax and the... regardless of where the incidence would be, and the answer might well be no."
1994.94-771,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1655.846,1661.339,What do you do about the two provisions of law mentioned by your opponent?
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,1661.339,1661.819,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-771,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1662.31,1664.552,The definition section and the exemption section.
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,1664.552,1664.832,--That's right.
1994.94-771,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1715.615,1718.717,Is there a place in the briefs where we can find that that you're quoting?
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,1718.717,1719.107,--Yes.
1994.94-771,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1737.51,1738.78,Thank you.
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,1738.78,1739.601,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-771,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1771.782,1772.603,There's something on 36.
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,1774.163,1775.705,"501B, yes, Your Honor."

1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,1789.063,1793.145,"Yes, that... I believe that may be a... that may be a misquotation."
1994.94-771,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1799.2,1800.159,You're talking about C.
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,1800.159,1802.733,I'm given the petition by cocounsel.
1994.94-771,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2019.766,2021.028,"Mr. Arrow, can I ask you--"
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,2021.028,2021.175,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-771,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2021.175,2032.394,"--probably a stupid question, but does the place where the legal incidence of the tax falls determine whether the consumer or the dealer can deduct the payment for Federal income tax purposes?"
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,2037.566,2039.517,"I am not aware of any for that purpose, Your Honor."
1994.94-771,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2039.517,2047.375,It's... what difference... does it make any difference other than for this deciding whether the Indian tribes have to pay the tax.
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,2047.375,2066.766,"Your Honor, clearly in another non-Indian context this Court, as has been pointed out by Justice Souter as recently as the Jefferson Lines case, going back to Complete Auto Transit, has disregarded the formalities involved in a tax, but in this case, we submit to this Court that one either has a per se rule in this complex area, or one does not."
1994.94-771,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2078.804,2085.77,Doesn't the incidence of the tax have significance outside of the Indian law context?
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,2098.496,2098.786,Yes.
1994.94-771,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2116.898,2124.654,"Yes, but in either event, even if the retailer isn't the taxpayer in a technical sense, it still can have a statutory obligation to collect the tax."
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,2124.654,2132.649,"That... in 1931, Your Honor, the legal incidence could only be characterized as dual."
1994.94-771,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2224.319,2235.106,"Well, I have to confess that the thing that keeps running through my mind is, as I remember the Moe case, the Court said the tribe cannot market its tax exemption by selling to nonmembers."
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,2235.106,2235.927,"That's right, Your Honor."
1994.94-771,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2235.927,2242.661,"But the answer to that is, they can do it if... they can market the tax exemption if the incidence of the tax falls on the retailer."
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,2242.661,2243.282,"Precisely, Your Honor."
1994.94-771,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2252.078,2252.967,"Well, in an economic sense you certainly are--"
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,2252.967,2253.368,--Well--
1994.94-771,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2253.368,2256.51,--because you're able to sell it cheaper than the retailers who must pay the tax.
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,2256.51,2272.462,"--Well, in point of fact that doesn't occur, Your Honor, because the tribe has imposed its own fuel tax, which is precisely the same as the fuel tax imposed by the State, so therefore as a matter of economic reality in this particular set of facts there is no economic advantage whatsoever."
1994.94-771,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2274.292,2275.263,"They owe it to themselves, sure."
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,2275.263,2275.614,Well--
1994.94-771,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2275.614,2278.977,"You mean, if I take money out of one pocket and put it in my other, that's--"
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,2278.977,2280.016,--That is correct.
1994.94-771,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2288.711,2290.664,--You're saying they're not using it to sell more gas.
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,2290.664,2291.281,"That's right, Your Honor."
1994.94-771,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2291.281,2292.804,They're just using it to make more money.
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,2292.804,2293.693,"That's right, Your Honor."
1994.94-771,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2316.21,2322.745,"Do you know anybody in the State, other than Indians, who market more gas by charging less tax?"
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,2322.745,2325.726,--Who market more gas by charging less tax?
1994.94-771,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2325.726,2332.88,"Maybe I'm from the East here, and I'm always used to seeing, you know, the tax price and then it says, you know, plus 3, plus 2, whatever the tax is."
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,2342.716,2343.007,No.
1994.94-771,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2344.577,2351.422,"You know, if the incidence were not on the purchaser, I would expect that some people would charge the tax and some people wouldn't."
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,2351.422,2352.923,If the incidence--
1994.94-771,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2352.923,2353.353,If there's no--
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,2353.353,2355.744,"--If the incidence were not on the retailer, Your Honor?"
1994.94-771,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2355.744,2357.627,"--If... no, if the incidence were not--"
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,2357.627,2358.708,Not on the purchaser.
1994.94-771,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2358.708,2358.837,--on the purchaser.
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,2362.129,2362.51,Well--
1994.94-771,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2362.51,2365.23,"The gas stations don't show a tax charge, is what you're telling me."
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,2365.23,2365.53,--Yes.
1994.94-771,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2434.647,2438.521,How broad is the sweep of this treaty in your view?
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,2449.157,2449.748,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-771,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2473.354,2474.923,How do you get that out of the statute?
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,2480.738,2481.278,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-771,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2481.278,2489.644,"On the basis of just its language, I would think you'd have to say that a member of the tribe wouldn't have to obey general State laws."
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,2493.817,2498.51,"We think that it's possible that other, broader interpretations could be made."
1994.94-771,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2518.643,2519.164,Mr. Arrow--
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,2519.164,2519.573,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.94-771,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2519.573,2537.394,"--that about the member of the tribe that lives in the town, that's the one we're talking about, who can vote in the town as a resident, whose children can go to school there, who gets fire, police, all protection, why should that person not have to pay tax?"
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,2537.394,2539.127,"Yes, I understand the question, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.94-771,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2619.069,2620.249,"Thank you, Mr. Arrow."
1994.94-771,1,20499,dennis_w_arrow,,2620.249,2622.51,Thank you very much.
1994.94-771,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2622.51,2623.06,Mr. Engelmayer.
1994.94-771,2,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2623.06,2631.936,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.94-771,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2662.336,2669.012,"Well, Mr. Engelmayer, is your principle that if Congress hasn't abrogated the immunity, the State can't?"
1994.94-771,2,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2673.233,2673.784,Absolutely.
1994.94-771,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2681.428,2687.444,"Why is it not required in the case of one kind of legal incidence, if your theory is correct?"
1994.94-771,2,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2687.444,2688.484,--I believe it is correct.
1994.94-771,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2708.556,2713.841,And then... and you say you trace that back to a congressional determination of what?
1994.94-771,2,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2713.841,2726.558,"I think the basis for the per se rule, which relies on legal incidence, goes back historically to the sovereign immunity that tribes have had under the... vis-a-vis the States under the Constitution."
1994.94-771,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2964.723,2972.219,Do you know the answer to the question whether there's any consequence for Federal tax purposes placing the incidence on the retailer?
1994.94-771,2,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,2972.219,2973.15,"--I do not, Justice Ginsburg."
1994.94-771,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3007.692,3023.975,"I would think that what it meant to them at that time is that an Indian who was living in Indian country was not subject to State regulation, taxes or anything else, but the one who was living outside of Indian country would be subject to State regulation and State taxes."
1994.94-771,2,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,3023.975,3024.472,--I think the--
1994.94-771,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3024.472,3027.464,Why do you draw the line just for purposes of taxes?
1994.94-771,2,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,3041.114,3070.454,"--If I may respond this way, I think from the vantage point of the Indian signatory in 1830, having no idea that some day this territory would be... this land would some day become part of a State known as Oklahoma, or of any State, having no conception of this idea, even, of State income taxation, such an Indian, if they were trying to express the thought that no State shall ever interfere with the relationship between a tribe and its member, if they were trying to figure out how to put that in a treaty, it's hard to think of a more emphatic way than the language which the treaty uses, which is,"
1994.94-771,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3114.281,3116.574,Even though the members are long gone from the reservation?
1994.94-771,2,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,3116.574,3122.408,"Well, they're not long gone in the sense that they're working, in this case, for the tribe, and they're tribal employees."
1994.94-771,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3122.408,3126.45,"Well, how about a member that lives off the reservation and works off the reservation?"
1994.94-771,2,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,3126.45,3127.882,"For the tribe, Mr. Chief Justice?"
1994.94-771,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3129.092,3130.023,Not for the tribe.
1994.94-771,2,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,3130.023,3133.115,"--If it's not for the tribe, there's no tribal relationship with the members that's being disturbed."
1994.94-771,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3133.675,3135.456,"Well, that's a nice line you're drawing."
1994.94-771,2,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,3138.819,3139.36,--But this Court--
1994.94-771,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3139.36,3153.548,"The government of the descendents of the Chickasaw... it seems to me you're governing the descendents of the Chickasaw Nation if you regulate their conduct, whether with regard to charging them an income tax, or with regard to preventing certain actions of theirs by reason of criminal law, or anything else."
1994.94-771,2,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,3153.548,3154.019,--Justice--
1994.94-771,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3154.019,3159.952,"If you want us to give this a liberal interpretation, it means that nobody will govern the descendents of the Chickasaw Nation."
1994.94-771,2,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,3162.334,3176.483,"--I think if we were talking here about a treaty or a statute that had been enacted not having to do with the Indian context, I would probably agree with you that government probably would have something more to do with the process of governance, as you say."
1994.94-771,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3195.617,3196.358,It's a good line.
1994.94-771,2,37863,paul_a_engelmayer,,3198.507,3199.519,Thank you.
1994.94-771,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3199.519,3202.211,"--Thank you, Mr. Engelmayer."
1994.94-771,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3204.222,3205.834,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1994.94-771,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3235.231,3241.565,"If there's no difference, how do you explain the reluctance of the... or the nonaction by the Senate in killing this bill?"
1994.94-771,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3241.565,3243.568,Of the State--
1994.94-771,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3243.568,3244.296,Oklahoma.
1994.94-771,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3244.296,3257.967,"--I think that the State was of the view that it should get this issue resolved, that it should not be bound by a semantic rule to resolve its law around something which is meaningless, and I think the Court--"
1994.94-771,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3257.967,3261.64,"But since that would clarify it for the future, there wouldn't be any possible doubt."
1994.94-771,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3263.351,3273.448,"--Well, if the Tax Commission is correct in its contention here that that rule should not have legal effect, the legal incidence rule, then there is no need for the State to modify its rule in accordance with this."
1994.94-771,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3273.448,3277.869,"I think the reason they did it, Mr. Rothfeld, is they were worried that it would prejudice this litigation."
1994.94-771,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3282.173,3284.604,"Well, I think they may have been concerned that it would moot the case."
1994.94-771,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3284.604,3288.375,So is the reason that they didn't pass it because they didn't want to moot the case?
1994.94-771,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3288.375,3292.469,"Well, I can't speak for all the motivations of the--"
1994.94-771,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3292.469,3293.77,You can speak for the Tax Commission.
1994.94-771,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3296.252,3304.567,"--Well, past tax obligations are precluded... a suit to collect those precluded by the tribe's sovereign immunity, which is one problem with this type of rule."
1994.94-771,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3305.378,3314.995,"But is it your view that the only reason... if it made no difference, it's hard to see why they didn't pass it, unless they were worried that it might make the significance of this case less significant and maybe we would dismiss it."
1994.94-771,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3314.995,3316.966,"--Well, I think they may well have been concerned--"
1994.94-771,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3316.966,3317.894,Given your new argument.
1994.94-771,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3317.894,3320.278,--They may well have been concerned that it would moot the case.
1994.94-771,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3324.179,3324.89,"Not a weakness, but--"
1994.94-771,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3324.89,3326.65,--I think they thought there was unnecessary--
1994.94-771,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3326.65,3326.99,--All right.
1994.94-771,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3338.568,3340.751,"--I'm sorry, I may not be following the--"
1994.94-771,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3340.751,3365.626,"Well, there's a problem for us in this case in that there's a new issue brought that wasn't argued below that isn't obvious how it comes out one way or the other, yet is determinative, and so that makes it a harder matter to reach the issue that this was granted cert to decide, and in the meantime, it's additionally confused because they could moot... or not moot it, but they could get rid of the problem by changing the law, and so that somehow feeds into this mix, too--"
1994.94-771,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3365.626,3367.048,"--Well, it will always be the--"
1994.94-771,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3367.048,3368.368,--and that's why I ask the question.
1994.94-771,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3368.368,3376.074,--It will always be the case that where there's an argument about the meaning of legal incidence that it's possible to avoid it by changing the State law.
1994.94-771,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3415.18,3418.22,"But if you don't have the per se rule, supposing it's not a sale to a consumer."
1994.94-771,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3427.697,3445.589,"--I think probably not, and the reason is because the Court has said, looking to the economic reality, that the State can't tax value generated on the reservation by a tribal enterprise, and that explains the outcome, I think, in cases like Colville and Moe, in which the Court said that the State could not tax sales by the tribe to tribal members of goods for use on the reservation."
1994.94-771,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3464.983,3476.38,"I'm not sure that I... maybe it's obvious, but why is it... supposing the ski resort attracts skiers from all over the State, most of whom are not Indians, and don't they market their tax exemption if they don't have to pay any taxes?"
1994.94-771,3,19917,charles_a_rothfeld,,3476.38,3483.983,"Well, I think that's true, Your Honor, but the lines the Court has drawn in cases like Hebezon is whether or not there is value generated on the reservation by the tribe."
1994.94-771,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3483.983,3485.295,"And you... well, okay."
1994.94-771,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3485.295,3486.737,"Thank you, Mr. Rothfeld."
