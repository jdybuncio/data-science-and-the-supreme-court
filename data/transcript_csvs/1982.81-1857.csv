1982.81-1857,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.264,We will hear argument next in Oregon versus Bradshaw.
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,98.102,101.178,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.81-1857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,225.614,227.112,May I interrupt with one question?
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,231.564,241.559,"As far as the record is clear, Your Honor, he first received actual counsel sometime after his arraignment the following day."
1982.81-1857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,244.979,249.322,Is there any evidence that the state made any effort to get him counsel before that time?
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,249.322,265.098,"There is evidence that the state... there is not only evidence, there is testimony by Corporal Hays that he suggested that he call an attorney and Corporal Hays further testified that he believed that there was time for him during his stay at the station house to have called an attorney."
1982.81-1857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,276.889,279.592,"Well, was he represented by retained counsel in the proceeding that followed?"
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,279.592,281.091,"--I do not believe so, no."
1982.81-1857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,281.091,282.87,He was represented by appointed counsel?
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,282.87,283.386,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-1857,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,283.386,288.696,"And so... but no effort was made to obtain appointed counsel until after his arraignment, is that right?"
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,288.696,296.756,"That's correct, bearing in mind, of course, that the events I'm describing occurred on a Sunday evening, during the weekend period of time in a small town on the Oregon coast."
1982.81-1857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,382.597,386.875,On what basis is it alleged that he changed his mind?
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,389.874,391.593,"--No, he didn't say that precisely, Your Honor."
1982.81-1857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,391.593,395.044,"Well, where did we get the conclusion that he did change his mind?"
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,395.044,401.948,"Well, the trial court, of course, heard the testimony of the corporal, and the defendant was present in the courtroom, and then various of the other police officers."
1982.81-1857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,427.28,433.388,"Is the testimony also undisputed that before that, he asked for a lawyer and that he didn't get one?"
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,433.388,435.732,"--It is undisputed that he said,"
1982.81-1857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,438.965,440.37,And that he didn't get one.
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,440.37,442.243,"Yes, but the interview was promptly terminated--"
1982.81-1857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,442.243,443.853,Does the record show that he didn't get one?
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,443.853,446.118,"--Yes, the record shows that he did not get one."
1982.81-1857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,446.118,448.412,And then he was continually questioned?
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,448.412,449.303,"No, sir."
1982.81-1857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,470.248,471.67,Is that where the waiver comes in?
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,471.67,475.121,"No, that's where the initiation comes in and that's where the waiver faults."
1982.81-1857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,475.121,476.778,What is the initiation you are talking about?
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,476.778,477.495,"What, I'm sorry--"
1982.81-1857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,477.495,480.198,"What is... the initiation comes in, you say?"
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,480.198,482.744,"--The initiation, and that is our first--"
1982.81-1857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,482.744,483.306,What is that?
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,484.18,487.491,--The initiation of dialogue between the accused and the police.
1982.81-1857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,487.491,488.241,"Oh, I see."
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,491.474,503.36,"That might well have been the initiation of dialogue within the meaning of this Court's decision in Edwards versus Arizona, and that is precisely what we are here to determine today and that is our first contention."
1982.81-1857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,542.718,547.654,"Couldn't he... as I understand the question, what are you going to take... what are you going to do with me?"
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,553.48,555.792,I think that--
1982.81-1857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,555.792,559.353,"I don't... is there anything in there to suggest that to you, that I want to be questioned?"
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,559.353,561.117,--Let me answer your question--
1982.81-1857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,561.117,561.711,Yes or no.
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,565.741,572.035,"--There are two separate questions... there are two separate responses to your question, if I may, and they are terribly important so I would like to give them in order."
1982.81-1857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,671.932,673.071,I know that's out of context.
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,673.071,673.884,"--I'm sorry, sir."
1982.81-1857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,673.884,676.242,I know that is out of context.
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,677.539,684.162,"Well, but it is within the context, if I may offer, of both Footnote 9 of the Edwards decision and of the language of that decision."
1982.81-1857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,706.199,714.649,That rule about not asking any questions after asking for a lawyer did not originate with Edwards.
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,724.864,726.238,--I understand the origins of--
1982.81-1857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,726.238,726.738,Right.
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,729.659,735.531,"--Well, I'm not contesting our compliance with the Miranda doctrine, and in fact that's precisely what's in--"
1982.81-1857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,735.531,740.84,"But the Miranda doctrine, I thought, said that when he asked, when he says I want a lawyer, you quit questioning."
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,740.84,754.414,"--That's right, and the Edwards decision, which construes the Miranda decision, says there must be no further questioning by the police after a right to counsel is asserted, and that was scrupulously honored by the police in this case."
1982.81-1857,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,833.522,846.657,"Well, what if... suppose he said, I want a lawyer and the police terminated, said all right, the discussion is over, and the defendant then says well, when am I going to get my lawyer?"
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,850.531,856.732,"Your Honor, I... it's not clear to me what the Court precisely meant by reopening the dialogue, except that I--"
1982.81-1857,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,856.732,859.386,"I know, but I'm interested in what you think reopening the dialogue is."
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,867.93,868.368,--Yes.
1982.81-1857,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,868.368,875.412,"--Please tell my mother, or could I have a drink of water or give me some writing paper, that's reopening a conversation?"
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,875.412,876.067,Yes.
1982.81-1857,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,897.621,898.043,"Oh, really."
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,904.478,905.665,--Well.
1982.81-1857,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,907.399,912.584,"Certainly, may I have a glass of water just can't be what the Court meant in Edwards."
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,912.584,916.536,"--Well, I don't know whether the Court did or not but let me suggest this--"
1982.81-1857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,916.536,920.535,"Well, suppose he says, now I lay me down to sleep, would that do it?"
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,921.207,923.112,--That is not the initiation of dialogue.
1982.81-1857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,926.454,927.86,"Oh, then there is some point."
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,927.86,928.765,"Well, sure."
1982.81-1857,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,936.201,942.885,"Then a question about when am I going to get the lawyer that I just asked you for, that reopens the dialogue?"
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,945.228,952.178,"I think it certainly calls for a response and I think that it would reopen the dialogue, but let me be very clear about what we are asserting."
1982.81-1857,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,969.89,972.249,And then it's just a question of voluntariness and the totality of the circumstances?
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,972.249,975.997,"--Yes, but we don't believe that that is necessarily an easy test to be met, Justice White."
1982.81-1857,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,975.997,976.606,"Oh, I understand."
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,977.137,989.524,"We're simply saying that we believe this Court was establishing a threshold that said we don't want the police simply to go back and reask and reask and reask a person, well, do you really waive your right to counsel, did you really mean it."
1982.81-1857,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1006.438,1016.262,"Well, what if the defendant says I'd like a glass of water and the police officer says, fine, I'll go get you one, did you really mean to waive your rights or did you really want an attorney?"
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1016.262,1017.324,Fine.
1982.81-1857,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1028.852,1030.804,"Of course, you don't know what he's said yet."
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1045.391,1047.436,It probably would not be met in those cases.
1982.81-1857,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1047.436,1048.64,But it's a factual inquiry?
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1048.64,1049.921,"Yes, it's a factual case."
1982.81-1857,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1178.291,1184.116,"Mr. Frohnmayer, at what point would you say that police interrogation resumed?"
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1189.582,1196.58,"Well, of course, the policeman had already offered that theory of the case in the tape-recorded interview at the police station."
1982.81-1857,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1238.47,1242.749,"But under Innis, you would concede that there was some interrogation there in the car?"
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1242.749,1249.685,"I would concede that at some point there was interrogation, certainly by the time the individual was interviewed following the polygraph test."
1982.81-1857,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1279.05,1292.965,"Would you characterize the statements made by the police officers in the hearing of Innis, in Innis against Rhode Island, were suggestive and prompting type of statements?"
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1292.965,1296.433,"--I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice--"
1982.81-1857,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1296.433,1306.991,"Were they suggestive, were they prompted... were they prompting statements, to prompt an accused, an arrested person to open up?"
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1306.991,1311.271,"--Well, we have two different occasions on which that might have occurred."
1982.81-1857,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1360.532,1369.98,"Well, didn't the Court indicate in Rhode Island against Innis that the statements made by the police were indeed suggestive and of a prompting nature?"
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1371.666,1374.478,"Yes, well, I believe that that's correct."
1982.81-1857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1406.59,1407.84,I can tell you one.
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1415.135,1417.727,I think it would have been a nonresponsive response.
1982.81-1857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1433.501,1434.548,Did he say that?
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1434.548,1436.095,He reminded him of it.
1982.81-1857,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1436.095,1441.296,"He just gave him the same Miranda warning over again, the boiler plate."
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1441.296,1442.84,"No, sir."
1982.81-1857,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1681.042,1681.729,"Very well, Mr. Attorney General."
1982.81-1857,0,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,1681.729,1682.901,"Thank you, sir."
1982.81-1857,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1682.901,1683.978,Mr. Babcock?
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,1683.978,1686.788,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.81-1857,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1899.282,1912.604,"Isn't there some dispute in the record, Mr. Babcock, as to when the statement was made, whether it was made before being shipped from Rockaway to Tillamook, or whether it was made during the car journey?"
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,1912.604,1918.227,"Your Honor, I've taken this portion of the transcript, and I'll read it very shortly... no, I don't believe so."
1982.81-1857,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1919.742,1924.005,"I thought the Oregon Court of Appeals said there was, or am I thinking of the wrong--"
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,1924.005,1925.349,"--Your Honor, I don't think so."
1982.81-1857,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1960.538,1969.504,"--Well, here's what the Oregon Court of Appeals said, at least what it seems to me it's saying and that is on page eleven of the petition for certiorari."
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,1995.259,2003.897,"No, Your Honor, I think what had happened with the Court of Appeals was they construed Edwards as a per se rule and really didn't get into weighing exactly what happened."
1982.81-1857,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2028.527,2030.745,Did the trial court make a finding on this point?
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2030.745,2031.65,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1857,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2031.65,2036.133,So you're simply really arguing what's basically a factual question to us.
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2036.133,2042.052,"Well, I'm just using... yes, I'm just using... again, I'm just using Officer Hays' testimony about when the remark occurred."
1982.81-1857,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2045.77,2048.535,"Well, I don't think the Oregon Court of Appeals agreed with you."
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2048.535,2049.892,"I don't think they addressed it, Your Honor."
1982.81-1857,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2049.892,2050.783,No.
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2052.704,2061.982,"The assumption was, since they applied... I mean they applied this rule, the assumption was, I thought, that although they didn't give a reason for it, was that when he made this remark it was not initiation."
1982.81-1857,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2100.451,2109.149,"In Innis against Rhode Island, how did the challenge to the events become initiated?"
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2115.601,2120.661,"I think that's a... Your Honor, I think that's a classic case of initiation by the accused."
1982.81-1857,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2122.473,2122.879,The accused?
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2122.879,2123.753,--Innis.
1982.81-1857,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2124.8,2143.651,"It was the police officer who said to his colleague, in the hearing of Innis, who was two or three feet away, it will be a terrible thing if the children in the retarded school get hold of this gun and the ammunition, or words to that effect."
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2148.54,2153.475,"--Well, Your Honor, I think the question there was whether or not there was interrogation."
1982.81-1857,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2158.676,2164.332,Did not the crucial event come immediately after the policeman said that?
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2164.332,2165.581,"--It was short in time, Your Honor."
1982.81-1857,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2165.581,2166.518,Innis then said--
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2166.518,2168.392,I'll show you where the shotgun is.
1982.81-1857,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2168.392,2169.298,--I'll tell you where it is.
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2176.233,2179.153,"Well, Your Honor, assuming that--"
1982.81-1857,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2179.153,2182.105,Isn't that... wouldn't that a reasonable reading of Innis?
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2182.105,2191.241,"--I think, of course, if that's a reasonable reading of that, then, of course, it would have to have been concluded that that was interrogation, Your Honor."
1982.81-1857,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2191.241,2194.177,"Well, except the courts concluded that it was not interrogation."
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2194.177,2194.724,It was not interrogation.
1982.81-1857,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2194.724,2196.506,"And therefore, it is not a reasonable reading."
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2196.506,2201.785,I conclude then that the initiation in that case was Innis.
1982.81-1857,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2203.831,2207.002,His response was what opened it.
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2208.377,2208.89,--Yes.
1982.81-1857,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2390.974,2397.798,Your basis for saying it's virtually simultaneous is the fact that it happened right after he was handcuffed?
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2397.798,2399.579,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-1857,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2399.579,2412.839,"Well, I suppose then if the second hypothesis of the Oregon Court of Appeals that it occurred in the car from Tillamook to... Rockaway to Tillamook is right, he certainly wouldn't... he would have been handcuffed before he got in the car, I suppose."
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2412.839,2413.386,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1857,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2413.386,2417.104,So either you're wrong or the second hypothesis of the Oregon Court of Appeals is wrong.
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2417.104,2427.474,"The court... Your Honor, I don't know... again I'm reading off of what Officer Hays says before he puts him in the police car."
1982.81-1857,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2441.015,2448.747,"Do you suggest that there is anything unusual about handcuffing where there is a murder, a homicide case?"
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2448.747,2449.341,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1857,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2449.341,2453.011,"I wasn't sure, because you mentioned it several times."
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2453.011,2453.729,"No, I'm sorry."
1982.81-1857,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2504.896,2508.13,Let me clear up one other factual matter.
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2510.971,2521.53,"Your Honor, as I understand this, he was arrested, the officer said to him I'm going to arrest you for furnishing."
1982.81-1857,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2521.53,2521.951,Right.
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2521.951,2524.029,"Then he said, you can't leave."
1982.81-1857,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2565.247,2567.917,"Well, there's a dispute on whether he said that in the police station or not."
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2590.329,2590.97,--The handcuffing.
1982.81-1857,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2590.97,2591.564,No.
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2599.873,2605.87,"Yes, and Your Honor, it's... the point I make on that, if there is a point to be made, that there is--"
1982.81-1857,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2605.87,2612.134,You're the one who emphasized the importance of the proximity in time and that's why it seemed to me you ought to be pretty sure of your facts.
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2612.134,2613.227,"--Well, yes, sir."
1982.81-1857,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2620.974,2635.061,"But of course, there's no reason to think that any of the Oregon courts have engaged in fact-finding, were bound to believe the officer's testimony perhaps against the best interests of the state as opposed to the defendant's testimony against his best interests."
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2648.587,2648.978,Yes.
1982.81-1857,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2804.854,2809.243,Is there anything in the record as to how long it takes to go from Rockaway to Tillamook?
1982.81-1857,1,24918,gary_d_babcock,,2809.243,2809.884,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.81-1857,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2865.315,2869.344,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Attorney General?"
1982.81-1857,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,2869.344,2874.014,"Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1857,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2906.204,2916.325,"What is your version of the record, or do you think it's important, as to when Bradshaw asked him what's going to happen to me now."
1982.81-1857,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,2916.325,2920.682,Our view is frankly that the timing of the statement is not relevant to the question of initiation.
1982.81-1857,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2920.682,2921.869,"Well, what if it were?"
1982.81-1857,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,2923.025,2930.538,"Our view of what is to happen to me now, is that it took place either at the station or shortly after he went into the police car."
1982.81-1857,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2930.538,2941.832,"And of course, the officer testified that he... he then asked me at this time, which was at the end of the tape recording, I handcuffed him there and then he asked me, at this time."
1982.81-1857,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,2952.297,2957.247,"Well, our view is that it may be relevant to one of many factors in the Johnson versus Zerbst formula."
1982.81-1857,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2971.163,2976.238,And it doesn't matter... in your view it could have happened in the police car and it wouldn't make a bit of difference.
1982.81-1857,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,2976.238,2978.52,That's correct because that's the question of initiation.
1982.81-1857,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2978.52,2981.097,"Or at the station, it wouldn't make any difference."
1982.81-1857,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,2981.097,2981.582,That is correct.
1982.81-1857,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2981.582,2987.376,"Mr. Attorney General, this 16 and 17, what was this, a hearing or the trial itself?"
1982.81-1857,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,2987.376,2990.172,"At six... I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1982.81-1857,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2990.172,2992.092,At page... you just read from page 17.
1982.81-1857,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,2992.092,2994.17,I don't believe--
1982.81-1857,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2994.17,2995.826,Of the Joint Appendix.
1982.81-1857,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,2995.826,2996.592,--On the Joint Appendix.
1982.81-1857,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2999.122,3002.932,"Sixteen and 17 and 18, around in there."
1982.81-1857,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,3008.101,3013.365,"Yes, that would be at the pretrial hearing, which is required in Oregon under State versus Brewton and which is the Jackson versus Denno hearing of the state, yes."
1982.81-1857,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3109.748,3111.404,I think that's... your time has expired.
1982.81-1857,2,20843,david_b_frohnmayer,,3111.404,3112.653,"--Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice."
1982.81-1857,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3112.653,3113.669,"Thank you, counsel."
