2001.00-10666,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,12.005,20.023,Mr. Ingram.
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,20.023,41.23,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The petitioner in this case is asking the Court to rule that the brandish clause of 18 United States Code, Section 924(c) is an element to be charged and proved beyond a reasonable doubt and not merely a sentencing enhancement, based on two separate and independent bases."
2001.00-10666,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,142.319,150.793,"But it's not so... it seems to me that... I understand your argument, but it's not so clear as it was in Jones."
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,173.026,176.435,"Your Honor, if I may address each of those concerns."
2001.00-10666,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,304.544,305.654,Can I... can I go to Apprendi?
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,345.047,345.749,--I agree with that.
2001.00-10666,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,345.749,346.803,That's what Apprendi is about.
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,376.712,377.879,Yes.
2001.00-10666,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,380.622,380.988,Both.
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,380.988,382.667,--latter statute that you have described.
2001.00-10666,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,382.667,382.873,Both.
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,384.407,384.886,No.
2001.00-10666,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,386.164,386.619,All right.
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,449.843,453.538,"Your Honor, that is not a problem that the defense bar does not already face."
2001.00-10666,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,467.638,477.737,"Yes, but still under the present law, if you have a good claim as to whether it's one kilo or two and the evidence is in dispute, you find the guilty verdict come in."
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,488.425,494.57,"As a practical matter, in Federal court, the... the Federal judges at sentencing rely on the trial evidence."
2001.00-10666,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,529.569,541.403,"Well, let me rephrase Justice Breyer's question slightly or... or make the point that I think underlies part of his question."
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,549.034,557.624,"I think it can create some problems, as we just described, but they're not problems that we don't face in other areas and on other--"
2001.00-10666,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,557.624,559.399,"Well, given Apprendi, of course, you face the problem."
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,570.577,572.612,--I do not think they're real disadvantages.
2001.00-10666,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,578.756,582.868,"Well, but the case Justice Breyer puts to you shows a very real difficulty."
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,582.868,586.283,"And as I've described, that is a difficulty that we face already."
2001.00-10666,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,587.857,588.84,Because of Apprendi.
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,588.84,590.919,"--No, Your Honor."
2001.00-10666,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,694.613,704.935,What about things like the Federal Sentencing Guidelines which also have the effect of increasing the range of the penalty within certain limits?
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,717.087,718.581,"I disagree, Your Honor, and--"
2001.00-10666,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,718.581,719.227,Why?
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,719.227,725.707,--and I do agree with your statement that there are lots of things that the guidelines allow the judges to consider.
2001.00-10666,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,747.397,750.227,But they may be unconstitutional under your theory.
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,750.227,758.221,"They are not because we contend that the guidelines, unlike mandatory minimums, still leave the judge with lots of discretion."
2001.00-10666,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,760.099,776.68,"The question is under your theory of Apprendi, which imposes constitutional limits on discretion for judges, that can be given to judges, how many of the sentencing factors are going to fall by the wayside?"
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,776.68,786.386,--I... I submit that none of them will because none of those factors mandate a particular penalty to the exclusion of any mitigating offense.
2001.00-10666,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,802.382,812.392,"Well, that's exactly the kind of thing that presumably under your argument would have to go to the jury, whether he possessed a firearm, or the quantity of drugs involved."
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,812.392,824.787,"--No, it is not, Your Honor, because the judge in such a case would still have the ability to depart, or first of all, to reduce the offense level for other mitigating facts in the case."
2001.00-10666,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,824.787,831.492,You're... you're saying that just the level is kind of inchoate until the sentence comes out because there are other factors that could be applied?
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,831.492,844.199,"The... the sentencing guideline range, once established, is mandatory unless and until the judge determines that there is a legally permissible basis to depart downward or upward."
2001.00-10666,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,850.15,855.318,"So long as... so long as the upward or downward departure is there, you say Apprendi doesn't cover it."
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,855.318,856.164,That's correct.
2001.00-10666,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,856.164,857.811,"Or downward, anyway."
2001.00-10666,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,857.811,858.545,"Oh, I see now."
2001.00-10666,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,858.545,859.688,Downward or upward?
2001.00-10666,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,860.407,862.357,I said upward or downward.
2001.00-10666,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,862.357,862.723,I know.
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,873.157,875.138,"Well, I think it is in this case."
2001.00-10666,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,877.659,884.396,"I mean, suppose a judge could not depart downward under the guidelines, could only... only depart upward, you'd have a mandatory minimum, wouldn't you?"
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,884.396,885.234,--You would have.
2001.00-10666,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,885.751,886.069,Okay.
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,896.007,896.501,--That is correct.
2001.00-10666,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,896.501,897.908,Suppose a judge--
2001.00-10666,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,897.908,911.567,"--How... how does a judge have the opportunity to depart downward under the guideline if the guideline says if he had a gun, you're supposed to go up?"
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,915.295,916.715,Because that--
2001.00-10666,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,916.715,919.546,"--purpose is if he has a gun, you increase it."
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,922.361,926.008,--Because the judge still... that... that does not bind the judge at that level.
2001.00-10666,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,927.071,937.497,"Suppose... suppose the judge says, now, it's the policy in this court and in this jurisdiction, counsel, that if you come in and your defendant has a gun or has brandished a gun, I'm going to go upward."
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,951.638,962.297,--Because the... the constitutional rule announced by the Court is that if a legislature mandates an increase in the prescribed range of penalties.
2001.00-10666,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,973.347,973.705,So--
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,973.705,976.328,And... and he is subject to an abuse of discretion standard on appeal.
2001.00-10666,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,976.328,984.29,"--So... so, in your view, Apprendi stands for the proposition that legislatures cannot control judges in the sentencing process."
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,984.29,984.888,No.
2001.00-10666,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1000.522,1006.827,"Well, I... I think Apprendi is clearly binding here, and... and we have to decide how... how it should be applied."
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,1024.988,1032.429,Is your question why would this... why would the Apprendi doctrine not apply where the judge has discretion?
2001.00-10666,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1032.429,1034.452,"That's part of my concern, yes."
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,1034.452,1054.09,"Well, I think the answer to that is that constitutionally the... the rule announced in Apprendi is that where a legislature mandates a particular mandatory minimum or maximum, then that is where the constitutional demands that the... those facts be tried by beyond a reasonable doubt--"
2001.00-10666,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1054.09,1061.538,"Where... where a judge has discretion, I suppose no single fact requires a certain sentence."
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,1062.233,1062.895,--That's correct.
2001.00-10666,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1062.895,1067.799,"By definition, where the judge has discretion, no single fact requires a certain sentence."
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,1067.799,1068.605,That is correct.
2001.00-10666,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1068.605,1079.05,"But as a practical matter, even in... in this, suppose this judge thought that the... Harris should not have gotten more than 5 years."
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,1110.19,1111.509,That is true.
2001.00-10666,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1112.692,1113.042,It's true?
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,1125.939,1126.569,--No.
2001.00-10666,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1130.631,1132.301,That was the question.
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,1139.212,1140.763,"--No, he does not, and I misunderstood the question then."
2001.00-10666,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1140.763,1141.353,No.
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,1149.472,1164.74,"Our position is once the judge does conclude, by a preponderance of the evidence, that brandishing exists, he has no authority to give anything less than the mandatory minimum, no matter what other mitigating facts he may conclude may be present in the case."
2001.00-10666,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1164.74,1166.091,What you're saying is he has to--
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,1166.091,1166.409,He is bound by that.
2001.00-10666,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1166.409,1169.913,--What you're saying is he has to be honest when he decides the brandishing issue.
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,1169.913,1171.375,Yes.
2001.00-10666,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1171.375,1172.158,Okay.
2001.00-10666,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1172.158,1175.46,And I suppose he has to confront the brandishing issue.
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,1183.42,1187.283,"Yes, it does, by a preponderance of the evidence standard."
2001.00-10666,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1212.113,1213.12,Close on brandishing.
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,1221.455,1224.014,--That is what... that is what he at least implied strongly.
2001.00-10666,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1251.189,1258.493,"--Suppose on... on remand, if you prevail here,... well, I guess there would have to be a new... a new trial on the sentencing point."
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,1273.333,1277.061,"If I understand Your Honor's question, then yes."
2001.00-10666,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1279.356,1279.77,No brandishing.
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,1279.77,1295.454,"--did not brandish... that is, if it was considered to be an element and the jury determined that he did not brandish... then first of all, he would be not guilty of the crime, because that would be an element that must be proved, and any element that is not proved beyond a reasonable doubt means that he would be not guilty of the crime."
2001.00-10666,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1307.529,1316.97,"Are you saying that if he were charged with this offense and charged specifically with brandishing, and the jury found him not to have brandished, he would have to be acquitted?"
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,1316.97,1318.225,That is correct.
2001.00-10666,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1318.225,1323.017,Wouldn't... wouldn't there be a lesser included offense of everything in the statute except brandishing?
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,1323.017,1324.335,"Well, that is true."
2001.00-10666,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1330.992,1336.526,But... but the prosecution would be entitled to a charge on a lesser included offense.
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,1336.526,1337.516,That is correct.
2001.00-10666,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1337.516,1338.291,But... but wait.
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,1347.491,1349.529,Yes.
2001.00-10666,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1352.248,1353.487,Well--
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,1353.487,1356.958,"--with that policy, nevertheless that is... that is the case under the status of the law now."
2001.00-10666,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1372.226,1373.737,"--Well, I'm quite surprised at that."
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,1395.441,1398.576,We are suggesting that brandishing must be proved--
2001.00-10666,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1398.576,1400.061,That's this Court's case I take it--
2001.00-10666,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1400.061,1400.459,--That... that... I--
2001.00-10666,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1400.459,1401.862,--which maybe we should reconsider.
2001.00-10666,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1401.862,1402.324,Why don't you let him answer?
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,1405.017,1427.336,"--By... by saying that the brandish must be an element to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, we are not contending that if the jury finds the defendant not guilty on that particular element, that the judge might not be able to consider, by a preponderance of the evidence, that fact, in... in addition to any other number of mitigating and aggravating facts, in... in determining the appropriate sentence."
2001.00-10666,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1427.336,1429.047,I'm surprised at that.
2001.00-10666,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1429.047,1433.229,But the appropriate sentence within his discretion.
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,1433.229,1434.131,That is correct.
2001.00-10666,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1434.577,1449.325,"And... and it is true that under the guidelines a judge can find something that the jury didn't find because the standards are different, beyond a reasonable doubt in the one case, and the judge said, well, I'm... I would think, too, it wasn't proved beyond a reasonable doubt, but there is a preponderance of the evidence."
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,1455.5,1467.199,"--It is... it is quite common that the judge finds by a preponderance of the evidence both conduct that was not even charged and conduct that was charged and... of which the defendant was found not guilty, because of the difference in the standard of proof."
2001.00-10666,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1467.199,1468.763,So... so--
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,1468.763,1473.181,"That is... that is... I'm not happy with that either, but that is the case law and that is the law as... as it stands."
2001.00-10666,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1473.181,1480.005,"--So, what have you accomplished if... if they just rewrite the guidelines to say you get 5 years for brandishing?"
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,1480.005,1481.676,What we will have accomplished--
2001.00-10666,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1481.676,1501.522,"The consequence will be that even if the jury finds no brandishing as an element of the crime, the... the judge may... and indeed, under the guidelines, must... add 5 years for brandishing if he thinks, by a preponderance of the evidence, there was brandishing, which is the situation you're in now."
2001.00-10666,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1501.522,1509.571,"And if I can pile onto Justice Scalia's question, you now have the worst of both worlds because you have the disadvantages we referred to at first, and yet the judge can still go upward."

2001.00-10666,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1559.597,1562.766,But the guidelines can require him to give a higher sentence.
2001.00-10666,0,45089,william_c_ingram,,1570.844,1573.075,It would not be mandated in the same sense.
2001.00-10666,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1606.101,1607.731,"Very well, Mr. Ingram."
2001.00-10666,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1609.226,1621.157,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court's decision in McMillan v. Pennsylvania forms the backdrop for both the statutory and the constitutional questions in this case."
2001.00-10666,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1673.42,1695.275,"Well... well, given the precedent of Apprendi, suppose the judge says, now, you know, the jury finds an enhancement because of harassment, and the judge says, well, under... let me begin again."
2001.00-10666,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1722.757,1730.927,"Justice Kennedy, there are several significant differences between the issue in a case like this and the issue in a case like Apprendi."
2001.00-10666,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1875.286,1884.937,"But if that's so, do you... do you accept what... what your... what the petitioner said in respect to my second statute, if you remember it?"
2001.00-10666,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1902.747,1904.154,It--
2001.00-10666,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1904.154,1906.233,Or if there is... if the gun isn't discharged.
2001.00-10666,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1908.063,1910.366,"--It might, Justice Breyer."
2001.00-10666,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1914.99,1915.933,"No, no, no."
2001.00-10666,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1927.331,1927.93,If it's--
2001.00-10666,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1927.93,1935.53,"Now, at that point, Apprendi is a constitutional rule, and therefore does the discharger not have to be presented to the jury?"
2001.00-10666,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1935.53,1939.784,"--As I understand Apprendi, it would."
2001.00-10666,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1950.367,1939.784,All right.
2001.00-10666,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,1966.498,1990.425,"The significance of it concerning a minimum is that under this statute, once the jury returns a verdict of guilty, using or carrying a firearm during in relation to an underlying drug trafficking offense, the judge has the authority by virtue of that jury verdict to sentence from 5 years to life in prison."
2001.00-10666,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2004.098,2004.64,All right.
2001.00-10666,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2024.681,2038.571,"Well, the two most significant factors, as I've tried to say... and I'll try one more time... is that in Apprendi, the defendant could not have gotten a sentence above 10 years based on the jury's verdict alone."
2001.00-10666,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2070.399,2073.915,"So, Apprendi is just a draftsmanship problem, really."
2001.00-10666,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2118.284,2140.694,"The difference in that statute, Justice Scalia... and I agree that that would not trigger the rule that this Court announced in Apprendi... is that as the Court's opinion in Apprendi notes, if Congress writes the second kind of statute and says the range is 1 to 25, it is exposing all defendants who are sentenced under that statute to a possible sentence of 25 years."
2001.00-10666,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2243.203,2244.401,"So, if you tell the--"
2001.00-10666,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2244.401,2246.664,--May I ask you a question on... on a different topic?
2001.00-10666,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2262.81,2273.336,"Justice Stevens, it's unclear what impact this decision will have on the sentencing guidelines, I assume on the assumption that the Court extends Apprendi to mandatory minimums."
2001.00-10666,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2370.973,2371.283,Right.
2001.00-10666,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2377.953,2378.704,That's correct.
2001.00-10666,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2378.704,2379.158,--under the guideline.
2001.00-10666,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2392.773,2397.077,"No, not in the sense that Your Honor is asking the question."
2001.00-10666,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2468.613,2492.653,"Mr. Dreeben, apart from one being within the jury zone and the other not, is there a rational distinction between saying, judge, you can't add on 2 years at the top and saying you can't subtract 2 years at the bottom?"
2001.00-10666,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2492.653,2509.994,"The rational distinction, Justice Ginsburg, is that in the former case, the defendant has a right to a jury trial that has to find him guilty on all the facts that are going to determine the longest possible time that he can spend in prison."
2001.00-10666,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2643.749,2646.277,Is that the implication of Apprendi?
2001.00-10666,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2646.277,2648.716,--That is the--
2001.00-10666,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2648.716,2650.715,"Is that where we're headed, in your view?"
2001.00-10666,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2650.715,2678.549,"--I hope not, Justice O'Connor, because I think that the Apprendi rule, as bounded by the history that the Court relied on and the explicit statements of its holding, coupled with the Court's recognition that, yes, legislatures can write statutes that will achieve similar results to Apprendi but will do it in an acceptable form, all of those things suggest that the Court did not have a broad ruling on it."
2001.00-10666,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2678.549,2686.086,Do you have a sense of how the application of Apprendi is working out in the system now?
2001.00-10666,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2691.763,2707.047,"Well, retrospectively Apprendi has caused a considerable amount of judicial chaos as courts have attempted to sort out harmless error, plain error, and retroactivity considerations, one of which is before the Court next month in the Cotton case."
2001.00-10666,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2764.286,2766.237,"--defense bar complained about that, have they?"
2001.00-10666,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2766.237,2767.764,--The defense bar has been--
2001.00-10666,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2767.764,2772.844,I'm... I'm unaware that they are... are keen on getting rid of Apprendi.
2001.00-10666,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2772.844,2780.573,"--Their primary desire to date so far, Justice Scalia, has been to get all of the old sentences in the pre-Apprendi regime overturned."
2001.00-10666,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2786.062,2787.284,But as far as you're concerned--
2001.00-10666,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2787.284,2787.65,--To get it expanded.
2001.00-10666,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2787.65,2813.748,"As cases like this reveal, there's been an effort to expand Apprendi to what could be viewed as its widest logical implications, because although I've presented a theory for why Apprendi should be read narrowly to avoid disrupting the traditional ability of legislatures to structure sentencing, there is obviously within the opinion the seeds of a much more fundamental change in the--"
2001.00-10666,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2813.748,2828.352,"Yes, but those are extensions... extensions on the... on the basis that you've said, which I now understand, is you say, well, there has to be a jury finding for anything that will lead to a longer maximum term, the highest possible term."
2001.00-10666,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2852.26,2861.574,--I don't think that it would be true for a defendant like the defendant in Jones who was convicted by the jury of a crime that carried a 15-year penalty.
2001.00-10666,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2861.574,2865.494,"No, there are some... there are some exceptions, but they're saying in general."
2001.00-10666,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2901.719,2902.694,The Government could do that.
2001.00-10666,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2902.694,2903.42,They could do it.
2001.00-10666,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2903.42,2909.156,The States have a much wider range of mandatory minimum sentencing programs.
2001.00-10666,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2919.269,2924.813,"Well, having read those, do you have any impression in respect to the practicalities of it?"
2001.00-10666,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,2924.813,2939.849,"--I think that the States will suffer increased practical problems compared to the Federal Government because in the Federal Government, the mandatory minimums are in relatively specific areas and we could, indeed, go forward and charge and prove them to a jury."
2001.00-10666,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2984.274,2987.338,May I ask you just a short... so I don't lose the point?
2001.00-10666,1,35719,michael_r_dreeben,,3000.619,3000.619,"--Under 18 U.S.C., section 3553(e)."
2001.00-10666,2,45089,william_c_ingram,,3346.327,3364.596,"Responding to the questions about the effect that a ruling in our favor will have on the lower courts, first of all, as noted, there will be no prospective impact."
