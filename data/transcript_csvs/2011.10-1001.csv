2011.10-1001,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.997,"We will hear case next in Case 10-1001, Martinez v. Ryan."
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,6.887,10.947,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1001,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,128.853,137.334,"If your main position is right, then wouldn't the same go for 2255 proceedings?"
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,182.908,183.971,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-1001,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,183.971,194.871,And so 2255 would no longer be the interests of justice so require because if it's your first opportunity to raise the point the court must appoint counsel for you.
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,196.044,203.805,"In a situation -- The Federal system is a little more complicated than Arizona, but not much, because of Massaro."
2011.10-1001,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,203.805,206.834,Because of the what?
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,206.834,229.233,"Our position would be in the Federal system, if a Federal defendant wished to file a 2255, that he would be entitled to appointed counsel, but as far as this case is concerned, only with respect to any claim of ineffective assistance at trial."
2011.10-1001,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,229.233,241.135,Do you want us to hold that there is a right to counsel whenever a Petitioner asserts a claim that could not have been asserted at an earlier point in the proceedings?
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,241.135,250.115,"Yes, Your Honor, with the caveat, if the State allows that kind of proceeding."
2011.10-1001,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,277.587,285.039,"That's a very far-reaching proposition that extends well beyond claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial, wouldn't it?"
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,285.039,285.304,--Yes.
2011.10-1001,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,285.304,305.969,"If many years after someone is convicted an allegation is made that the prosecution failed to turn over exculpatory evidence and that the information supporting the claim has just recently come to light and could not have been previously discovered, there would be a right to counsel there; wouldn't that be the case?"
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,305.969,311.669,"If the State -- if the State provided that proceeding, that -- then the State would not have to."
2011.10-1001,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,321.476,325.196,Why would it be excessive if it could not have been raised earlier?
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,325.196,332.332,"Your Honor, as I understand the situation, we've got newly discovered evidence of perhaps a Brady violation."
2011.10-1001,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,351.432,354.43,What if the State doesn't but the Federal government does?
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,360.978,363.681,"--I think that's correct, Your Honor."
2011.10-1001,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,365.163,368.114,So you haven't really given us a solution for the States.
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,371.566,391.663,"--Well, but the Federal system itself has a statute of limitation, though I believe that the statute would probably begin to run, in Justice Alito's hypothetical, with the discovery of a Brady violation."
2011.10-1001,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,402.859,428.6,"If you permitted this counsel to raise a claim that could not have been raised on the direct appeal, is the counsel limited to that point, or can the counsel representing the client bring up other things?"
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,428.6,429.302,"No, Your Honor."
2011.10-1001,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,446.311,454.04,"But could it be that the counsel could also bring up a Brady claim, a newly discovered evidence?"
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,457.18,478.263,"The holding in this case won't be so limited, but I would agree that Douglas and Halbert would imply that Brady, at least many Brady claims, would be such that the 2255 or the State post-conviction would be the first opportunity to present."
2011.10-1001,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,478.263,478.7,What if the -- I'm sorry.
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,522.617,528.929,"I'm saying, Your Honor, that the State does not have any duty to pay the lawyer in those circumstances."
2011.10-1001,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,534.865,536.222,It's not a question of pay.
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,551.825,557.899,"--Your Honor, I think the appointment could be limited to the first-tier review."
2011.10-1001,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,557.899,558.117,I'm sorry.
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,570.955,581.325,"Yes, Your Honor, and in fact in that example pursuing the ineffective assistance claim requires pursuing the Batson claim."
2011.10-1001,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,581.325,592.445,"--So the lawyer -- the State would be required to provide counsel not simply to raise the threshold ineffectiveness argument, but to go ahead and raise the arguments as to which he was ineffective."
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,592.445,607.159,"Well, Your Honor, in the situation in which the ineffectiveness of counsel is based on the failure to make a Batson claim, the failure to make an objection at trial, I would agree with you, absolutely."
2011.10-1001,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,611.031,613.64,What about other claims that don't follow on?
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,625.65,625.994,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-1001,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,625.994,629.572,"--on the various issues, 12-minute intervals?"
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,629.572,630.914,"Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-1001,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,630.914,634.708,And the State pays for some issues and not for other issues?
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,634.708,635.676,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2011.10-1001,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,645.737,647.437,"How does this work now, counsel?"
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,681.565,684.641,"Well, I think the States could run this in different ways."
2011.10-1001,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,715.19,725.388,"So what you are essentially saying, every State is obligated to appoint an attorney on the first leg?"
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,725.388,735.367,"--Every State is obligated to treat these, what are really parts of the appeal, the initial appeal, the same way they do the rest of the--"
2011.10-1001,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,735.367,748.796,"Counsel, there is a huge reliance interest that has developed since Finley and its progeny, and States don't routinely appoint post-conviction counsel."
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,748.796,749.658,--I--
2011.10-1001,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,749.658,754.092,What are we going to do about that reliance interest and the burdens on States?
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,754.092,760.998,"--Well, Your Honor, I -- I guess I would say two things about that."
2011.10-1001,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,766.711,771.929,"Well, I know -- I know for a fact that most do in capital cases."
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,776.694,782.161,"I don't know the percentage, Your Honor, but I know there are several States."
2011.10-1001,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,782.161,783.674,I don't understand.
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,809.071,809.571,Yes.
2011.10-1001,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,809.571,810.102,All right.
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,812.57,815.347,He didn't have an effective lawyer.
2011.10-1001,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,815.347,818.345,"Ah, so now you are talking about the second round."
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,829.513,831.463,"No, Your Honor, that is not the issue in this case."
2011.10-1001,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,831.463,832.134,What is the issue?
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,832.134,843.598,The issue in this case is whether the ineffectiveness of the first post-conviction counsel constitutes cause to excuse the--
2011.10-1001,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,843.598,843.895,All right.
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,896.67,903.838,"--Well, Your Honor, we are actually, once we take it past two, I -- I'm not on board with the hypothetical."
2011.10-1001,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,903.838,908.194,"No, no, no -- but I'm not -- I'm not ridiculing as it sounded your claim."
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,947.82,948.225,"No, Your Honor."
2011.10-1001,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,948.225,948.74,Okay.
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,948.74,949.317,That is not my argument.
2011.10-1001,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,949.317,950.85,"Now let's start at ground zero, sorry."
2011.10-1001,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,952.255,963.501,"Why isn't that where your argument leads, to the proposition that you can never procedurally default irrevocably an ineffective assistance of counsel claim?"
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,963.501,981.555,"Well, Your Honor, on a theoretical level, I don't think this Court's decisions in Douglas and Ross and Halbert give us a clear answer about whether there's a right to effective assistance of second post-conviction counsel--"
2011.10-1001,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,981.555,985.459,But we want to know what rule you are advocating in this case.
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,985.459,985.974,--I--
2011.10-1001,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,985.974,997.781,We want to know why you are not advocating for what Justice Breyer and Justice Alito indicate is an endless right to claim that all previous counsel were ineffective.
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,1008.247,1034.066,"--Well, Your Honor, the -- the theory that you get counsel for first-tier review limits it to that first tier, because when you go after the effectiveness of the -- of the first post-conviction counsel, that is necessarily going to involve review of the effectiveness of trial counsel."
2011.10-1001,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1034.066,1035.548,But -- I understand that.
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,1048.261,1058.929,"Your Honor, I don't think there is a right to a counsel and therefore not a right to effective counsel in the second--"
2011.10-1001,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1058.929,1062.224,But you can -- you can have a -- you don't have to give him a counsel.
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,1095.226,1096.165,--That's correct.
2011.10-1001,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1096.165,1096.586,All right.
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,1121.513,1126.044,"Well, Your Honor, I think I'm on the same page with that example."
2011.10-1001,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1126.044,1127.323,"Yeah, okay."
2011.10-1001,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1127.323,1129.511,But there can't be a claim--
2011.10-1001,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1129.511,1139.91,Can I leave this argument with the judgment that you have offered me no limiting principle on how many proceedings there must be--
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,1139.91,1140.912,Well--
2011.10-1001,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1140.912,1147.533,--before there's an end to the argument that previous counsel were inadequate?
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,1159.919,1160.746,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2011.10-1001,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1160.746,1162.808,"And if you want to say there shouldn't be, then that's fine."
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,1162.808,1165.292,"--No, Your Honor, there shouldn't."
2011.10-1001,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1185.659,1193.625,"So Mr. Bartels, before you do that, I mean, I understood you to be saying that you would draw a line after the first post-conviction proceeding; is that correct?"
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,1193.625,1194.296,"Yes, that's correct."
2011.10-1001,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1194.296,1200.84,"And the briefs go back and forth as to whether that line -- you know, what lies behind that line."
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,1202.95,1206.043,"Yes, Your Honor, theoretically."
2011.10-1001,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1215.568,1219.02,--What I understand you to be saying is exactly that.
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,1222.813,1223.66,Yes.
2011.10-1001,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1223.66,1229.345,"And the sensible place to draw the line in your view is after the first-tier review; that's your argument, right?"
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,1229.345,1230.889,"Yes, Your Honor, because I--"
2011.10-1001,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1230.889,1242.698,"The problem with that is you can answer that by saying: Yes, we have to draw a line someplace and the Court has already done that, and it did it in Douglas and it was after first tier of review on direct appeal."
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,1254.194,1276.826,"--Well, Your Honor, that principle doesn't work very well in a system like Arizona's where you can't bring this one claim on the direct appeal, and you can -- and Mr. Martinez, well, couldn't -- you can file your first post-conviction and litigate it while the appeal is pending before it's final."
2011.10-1001,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1276.826,1296.394,"So you would be happy with a system that said, no, you don't have to raise it in collateral review, you have to raise it on direct appeal, which is very unworkable, because if you are arguing ineffective assistance of counsel in a direct proceeding, presumably it's usually the same counsel; he's not likely to bring the claim."
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,1299.845,1300.001,Well--
2011.10-1001,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1300.001,1301.514,--that's there now.
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,1301.514,1302.356,"--No, Your Honor."
2011.10-1001,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1315.198,1323.129,"Well, but the person who decides what arguments you are going to make on appeal is usually the person who handled the trial in these types of cases."
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,1323.129,1325.363,"Well, Your Honor, that's not true in Arizona."
2011.10-1001,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1325.363,1332.175,"In Arizona, the usual case in criminal cases is that somebody else handles the appeal on direct proceedings?"
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,1332.175,1333.002,It may be from the same office.
2011.10-1001,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1361.694,1367.958,Ineffective assistance of appellate counsel certainly can't be dealt with on direct appeal; right?
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,1367.958,1369.315,"No, that's correct."
2011.10-1001,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1369.315,1376.767,"So even if you get a different counsel to -- to take the appeal, you could always claim that that counsel was ineffective in habeas, right?"
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,1376.767,1379.111,"Your Honor, I -- two things about that."
2011.10-1001,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1402.819,1419.233,"If there is a right to counsel whenever someone asserts a claim that couldn't have been raised earlier, why does the State not have the obligation to provide counsel to contest the constitutionality of the representation that was provided on appeal?"
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,1419.233,1441.787,"--Well, Your Honor, the -- the reason is that -- in terms of this first tier, second tier analysis from Douglas and Halbert, you are not going to be able to look at the effectiveness of appellate counsel without looking at the issue of prejudice."
2011.10-1001,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1513.804,1518.569,A trial judge doesn't have to be wrong for there to be ineffective assistance of counsel claim at trial?
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,1518.569,1520.566,--No.
2011.10-1001,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1530.267,1538.499,"I was wondering what you would say -- some of these statistics is just that these claims succeed very, very rarely."
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,1546.789,1566.859,"Well, Your Honor, it would be because Douglas and Halbert have done that balancing in saying that in this situation, the first tier review, the probability of an incorrect result without counsel is sufficiently high that there should be counsel."
2011.10-1001,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1575.369,1582.681,So the -- post-conviction application would go to the trial judge; right?
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,1583.742,1584.444,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2011.10-1001,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1584.444,1619.792,"--So both in the trial judge with this Anders type speech that doesn't raise ineffective assistance of counsel, but it's such an obvious claim to make that when the -- when the judge reviews that brief, if the trial judge thought that this defendant was abysmally represented, wouldn't -- wouldn't the Court say, sorry, I'm not going to accept this Anders speech."
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,1631.768,1641.859,I think there would be something like that with the right to counsel for these ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims.

2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,1658.557,1660.429,Are we talking about the Martinez case itself?
2011.10-1001,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1660.429,1661.977,--Yes.
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,1665.959,1674.44,"There was, Your Honor, but it was nothing but a summary of the trial transcript, and provides no basis for the trial court -- the problem with ineffective--"
2011.10-1001,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1674.44,1688.996,"Doesn't the trial court, I mean the excuse -- the excuse of counsel is not automatic, the trial judge has to look at it and say, no, there is -- there's no issue for you to pursue, so I'm going to excuse you."
2011.10-1001,0,38727,robert_d_bartels,,1688.996,1700.711,"--Well, under the current system, the trial judge has no duty to make any Anders determination because the Arizona courts have upheld there is no right to effective appointed counsel."
2011.10-1001,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1700.711,1702.868,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,1705.098,1719.077,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1001,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1736.024,1740.993,"Mr. Cattani, can I ask about your interests here, because your State is one that does appoint counsel."
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,1760.419,1772.882,--I think they come primarily from the logical extension of the rule that would require a second post-conviction proceeding to eliminate the claims of ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel.
2011.10-1001,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1789.768,1797.952,"Well, if we just said there is, you know, we can only draw a line in this context and we're going to draw the line here, and this is where it sticks."
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,1800.078,1804.746,--The additional costs would be implicated with a second post-conviction proceeding.
2011.10-1001,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1804.746,1822.489,"Well, it's only a cost if that second counsel, however its secured, can actually make a credible or sustainable claim that appellate counsel, the first tier counsel, was ineffective."
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,1822.489,1828.611,"I think it's -- if the nature of ineffective assistance claims, they are easy to raise and difficult to litigate."
2011.10-1001,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1842.088,1844.416,Federal courts handle them routinely.
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,1844.416,1845.165,--Pardon me?
2011.10-1001,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1845.165,1850.336,"Federal courts handle them routinely on papers, and most of them are denied."
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,1865.672,1868.077,I don't -- I don't have the statistics.
2011.10-1001,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1872.702,1873.139,Exactly.
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,1873.841,1874.98,In noncapital cases.
2011.10-1001,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1876.949,1880.12,Can I go back to just clarify the record for a second?
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,1894.287,1897.16,"At hearing, Levitt was appointed to prosecute the direct appeal."
2011.10-1001,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1897.16,1902.346,What gave him the authority to file the 32 motion?
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,1915.871,1923.135,"Well, she was representing Emitz and Martinez, and the rules allow the filings of both convictions petitions."
2011.10-1001,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1923.135,1926.181,By an attorney appointed just on the direct review?
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,1926.181,1932.63,"Well, I don't think there is anything that would prevent her from representing him in a number of different ways."
2011.10-1001,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1936.207,1940.003,So what would have been -- what was the tactical advantage of doing what she did?
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,1948.954,1953.839,--I don't know that there was necessarily a tactical reason.
2011.10-1001,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1963.273,1964.29,"Well, you know that she didn't."
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,1976.924,1978.94,I don't know that she had one.
2011.10-1001,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1995.681,1998.415,But she files essentially an Ander's brief that says: I don't see anything.
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2004.6,2012.551,"If she thought that there would be a claim, that after looking at it further, decided that the claims were not tolerable is, I think, what happened in this instance."
2011.10-1001,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2012.551,2028.952,"Is it routine, or does it happen often that lawyers who perceive a trial issue that can only be raised on collateral review to think that it makes sense to raise that right away so that the appeal -- and then the appeal is delayed until that's resolved?"
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2028.952,2030.605,It is what happened in Arizona.
2011.10-1001,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2052.911,2053.831,All right.
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2113.087,2119.491,"Well, I think it's better viewed through the lens of procedural due process."
2011.10-1001,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2138.064,2140.781,Don't guess where I'm going here.
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2177.609,2183.388,"--Well, I think you're -- you're not right from the standpoint that we do have to provide procedural due process."
2011.10-1001,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2185.197,2185.325,All right.
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2200.008,2204.145,"Well, I think that goes well beyond this Court's previous--"
2011.10-1001,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2204.145,2204.691,But would that is done.
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2264.088,2267.336,"--I think it is blocked by precedent, certainly by F and Giarratano."
2011.10-1001,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2267.336,2267.992,Because?
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2267.992,2274.862,"The problem with just shifting -- because this Court has said that there is no right to counsel and thus no right to the effective assistance of counsel, and--"
2011.10-1001,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2274.862,2277.974,"Well, that's where you would have to make the exception."
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2305.758,2308.648,"--Well, I think it does create an infinite continuum."
2011.10-1001,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2308.648,2313.428,"Well, in a sense it does, but he's never going to win the infinite continuum."
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2313.428,2314.754,But the other problem with it is--
2011.10-1001,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2314.754,2316.973,You never have to give him a lawyer at all.
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2316.973,2328.345,"--That's correct, but if you don't, then the problem is you shift over to Federal court, and on Federal habeas you are then in the position of litigating claims that are untethered to any State court decision."
2011.10-1001,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2341.619,2347.974,The question is whether there is cause external to Petitioner to overcome procedural default.
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2372.81,2388.802,"Well, I think it would, but it's even more problematic here in that the procedure is that the attorney files a notice, gives a notice to the defendant that she's been unable to find any tolerable claims and gives the defendant an opportunity to file his own pleading."
2011.10-1001,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2410.807,2428.537,"And how much time in the procedure you described, when appointed counsel does inform Martinez: I'm not bringing up any claims for you, so if you want to pursue relief you have to do so on your own."
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2435.191,2437.359,I don't recall the specific time.
2011.10-1001,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2451.416,2463.006,"Mr. Cattani, if you handled this through the regular appeals process, the person would receive the benefit of counsel."
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2467.674,2472.89,Well the person -- Here he received the benefit of counsel because it's appointed in Arizona.
2011.10-1001,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2480.561,2481.076,"Yes, exactly right."
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2481.076,2483.638,I don't think so necessarily.
2011.10-1001,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2504.972,2506.314,But those -- those were--
2011.10-1001,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2506.314,2506.641,Try--
2011.10-1001,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2506.641,2514.764,"--cases in which you could not raise -- pardon me, in which you could raise the particular issue at hand."
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2516.234,2518.153,"--Well, I don't think it's ever--"
2011.10-1001,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2518.153,2528.837,"The question is whether or not the rationale of those cases, which you state correctly, is applicable to a different set of circumstances."
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2528.837,2539.799,"--Well, I'm -- I'm not sure I'm following, because I think the procedure that errs on the following is -- is something that was in place at the time of Finley and Giarratano."
2011.10-1001,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2547.531,2554.277,"But -- but those were, correct me if I'm wrong, cases -- those were not cases in which the issue could only be raised on collateral."
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2554.277,2567.025,"--Well, I think in -- in Massaro this Court noted that it -- it would be rare for any -- for any -- for a defendant to be entitled to relief on a claim that could be raised on direct appeal."
2011.10-1001,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2567.025,2573.662,"--Well, Massaro indeed said there are good reasons for withdrawing this issue and putting it in a different kind of process."
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2595.842,2598.638,That's -- it's a difficult question.
2011.10-1001,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2607.537,2610.93,Even though now it's part of the regular appeals process.
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2619.317,2634.561,"Well, I think more important than the -- than the label that's been put on it is the nature of the -- of the argument that's being advanced, and it's a collateral attack, whether it -- whether the State choose to call it as part of the appeal."
2011.10-1001,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2637.731,2639.338,So now you are creating a different rule.
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2650.116,2659.705,"--Well, I think that's the -- the logical extension of what this Court announced in Finley versus -- Finley and Giarratano, that we -- we've drawn this distinction between--"
2011.10-1001,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2659.705,2669.106,"Well, I don't think as Justice Kennedy says that we ever really considered that question in Finley and Giarratano, because we were assuming there that all the things had been through the appeals process."
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2669.106,2679.884,--But I guess I'm not certain that the timing would -- would make a difference of when -- of whether you had a direct appeal first or whether the collateral proceeding occurs first.
2011.10-1001,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2696.629,2710.418,"Well, Justice Kagan's question indicates that there are States, as you know, where on direct appeal they can allow for an evidentiary hearing on IAC."
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2735.207,2739.002,"Well, I don't think we are suggesting that would be the desired outcome."
2011.10-1001,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2742.547,2750.434,"You are suggesting that there is no constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel on direct, when he conducts some supplementary proceedings."
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2751.292,2755.761,"--I guess the suggestion is that it's a collateral, that's a collateral proceeding."
2011.10-1001,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2762.507,2764.789,You mean -- that makes no sense to me.
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2786.762,2790.572,"If they've sent something back for a new hearing, I think that's something different."
2011.10-1001,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2792.837,2794.667,Is that involved in this case?
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2796.492,2797.244,--I don't think we need to.
2011.10-1001,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2798.305,2799.631,It's another case.
2011.10-1001,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2799.696,2811.205,"Well, the reason I think it's relevant is that if you were to say that there needed to be effective assistance of counsel there, then I would have asked you, what is the difference between this case and that case?"
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2816.047,2827.727,"--Well, and that's why I think it's more important to -- to assess the inquiry that's being done, whether it's a collateral inquiry as opposed to whether we are labeling it part of the -- the direct appeal or not."
2011.10-1001,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2833.958,2839.237,--There seems to me a rational line between collateral attack and attack in the same proceeding.
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2843.628,2844.44,Uh--
2011.10-1001,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2844.44,2844.97,Yes !
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2844.97,2846.283,"--Yes, I agree."
2011.10-1001,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2848.062,2868.41,"Would you explain to me why don't we consider this adverse boost to your proceeding, because this post-conviction proceeding, it began -- it began the same time as the direct appeal, but it ended before this case became final."
2011.10-1001,1,33800,kent_e_cattani,,2876.657,2879.406,"Well, it is a first-tier collateral attack."
2011.10-1001,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2923.03,2924.044,"Thank you, counsel."
2011.10-1001,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2938.055,2940.601,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2011.10-1001,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2964.294,2966.467,47 States and the Federal Government does?
2011.10-1001,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2966.467,2966.794,That's right.
2011.10-1001,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2986.098,2991.955,"Well, it's pretty -- it's small comfort to the lawyer who -- declined, who doesn't get one, that everybody else does."
2011.10-1001,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,2991.955,3002.654,"Mr. Chief Justice, I understand, but I think this is an area where States are permitted to draw different lines, and what Petitioner is saying -- take the Federal system, for example."
2011.10-1001,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3015.85,3025.724,"Well, not if you adopt the -- the one proceeding rule that I think counsel for the Petitioner was suggesting."
2011.10-1001,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3043.139,3046.293,I think that is exactly where he would stop.
2011.10-1001,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3090.541,3091.711,What about not going that far?
2011.10-1001,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3126.276,3129.633,"Here's the primary problem with that, Justice Breyer."
2011.10-1001,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3145.438,3155.371,"No, but it didn't face the issue of what about a claim that you have a constitutional right to bring up at least once?"
2011.10-1001,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3191.822,3195.398,"Justice Breyer, I think we just see the case in fundamentally different ways."
2011.10-1001,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3210.329,3224.933,"No, we are saying it the same way, just as if his lawyer, when he could raise the fact that the judge was sleeping, didn't raise it because he was staring at the ceiling and had been drinking too much."
2011.10-1001,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3243.459,3256.687,"--Justice Breyer, I think this case presents a much narrower question, which is, when he comes in, in his second post-conviction proceeding and says although I didn't raise it last time around, I have cause to excuse that default because my lawyer was ineffective."
2011.10-1001,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3266.37,3278.083,What you haven't told me is a reason why he shouldn't have had effective counsel in the first post-conviction proceeding?
2011.10-1001,2,33557,jeffrey_b_wall,,3331.156,3331.764,--That's right.
2011.10-1001,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3353.75,3355.595,But they didn't -- only the first--
