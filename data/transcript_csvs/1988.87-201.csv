1988.87-201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.717,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-201, Gerald E. Mansell v. Gaye Mansell Forbes."
1988.87-201,0,20681,douglas_b_cone,,52.085,55.478,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-201,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,199.321,209.887,"Before you even get into that, the, the... the appellee has raised an argument in, in reply to the government's second brief."
1988.87-201,0,20681,douglas_b_cone,,236.314,237.947,"--Well, no it's not."
1988.87-201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,443.74,455.629,"--Well, certainly, under the savings clause of the federal act, the wife's proposed interpretation is certainly an arguable one here."
1988.87-201,0,20681,douglas_b_cone,,470.488,480.936,"Well, to, to begin with, number one, it's not a property right, it's income earned after the termination of active service."
1988.87-201,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,482.286,484.977,"Well, California law controls that, I assume."
1988.87-201,0,20681,douglas_b_cone,,486.729,487.348,--I don't think so.
1988.87-201,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,487.348,489.631,Does California say it's not a property right?
1988.87-201,0,20681,douglas_b_cone,,489.631,491.913,California says it is a property right--
1988.87-201,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,491.913,492.474,All right.
1988.87-201,0,20681,douglas_b_cone,,493.133,494.034,--No federal law--
1988.87-201,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,494.034,495.924,--So then the question is whether or not it is.
1988.87-201,0,20681,douglas_b_cone,,495.924,498.407,--That's exactly right.
1988.87-201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,508.702,526.284,"Well, but when, when Congress took another stab at this, and enacted the act that we're asked to interpret here, it certainly was their intention to overrule McCarty and to leave a role for the states in determining marital property questions."
1988.87-201,0,20681,douglas_b_cone,,526.284,527.185,A couple of responses.
1988.87-201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,532.969,535.42,They effectively overturned it.
1988.87-201,0,20681,douglas_b_cone,,542.036,543.919,--That was... that was their intent.
1988.87-201,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,566.122,568.823,"Well, what do you think the savings clause reserved for the states?"
1988.87-201,0,20681,douglas_b_cone,,568.823,582.024,"I think that's addressed in the congressional record, where they described the purpose, the section by section analysis, where it says that that is specifically to preserve existing non-preempted remedies."
1988.87-201,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,584.645,596.103,"We certainly invited Congress to pay attention to the McCarty situation, in the McCarty opinion."
1988.87-201,0,20681,douglas_b_cone,,596.103,597.224,"Yes, you did."
1988.87-201,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,879.747,882.739,"We'll resume there at 1:00 o'clock, Mr. Cone."
1988.87-201,0,20681,douglas_b_cone,,882.739,883.37,--Thank you.
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,1317.053,1320.496,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-201,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1377.224,1379.665,Did they speak of res judicata in that opinion?
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,1379.665,1380.506,No.
1988.87-201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1419.391,1429.537,"Of course, that would happen if there were no waiver provision here, if Congress simply gave somebody a disability, or the, the military person who's injured the first day on the job."
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,1430.879,1432.539,That... that's correct.
1988.87-201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1432.539,1440.584,"And the law would be clear that California couldn't get the rest of his estate, in, in, in... just set off the disability benefits against the rest of his estate."
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,1440.584,1441.455,That's correct.
1988.87-201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1448.591,1459.698,"So it's, it's not an absurd situation that, that you're painting that someone who has disability benefits should have the guaranteed cushion that California allows, plus his disability benefits."
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,1464.602,1467.333,"If the guaranteed cushion that you're speaking of... yes, you're correct."
1988.87-201,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1503.198,1513.022,"So you're saying that when a military retiree converts part of his longevity benefits to disability benefits, the same principle applies?"
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,1513.022,1513.883,Yes.
1988.87-201,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1516.635,1519.206,"But I... here you've got a problem, it seems to me, with federal law."
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,1519.206,1526.192,"--Well, the problem... we don't have a problem with federal law, because in this particular case there was no attempt to try to do anything that contravenes 3101."
1988.87-201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1558.924,1560.954,Why didn't... why didn't we reject that in Wissner?
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,1560.954,1566.808,"You didn't reject it in Wissner because in Wissner there was a claimed property right in the insurance benefits, and there was an offset."
1988.87-201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1669.455,1672.029,"Well, they only eliminated other federal wealth."
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,1682.895,1684.605,That's correct.
1988.87-201,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1693.621,1703.218,"So, so under your example, if you have two different cases, in one veteran spouse has no property, and the other he has $50,000."
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,1710.144,1712.014,No.
1988.87-201,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1717.756,1722.471,So isn't... so isn't that a penalty being paid by reason of receiving your disability?
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,1722.471,1723.6,"--No, it is not a penalty."
1988.87-201,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1783.501,1791.356,"But you still have... you still have disparate... disparate treatment of veterans, depending on the amount of property in the community property estate."
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,1796.968,1798.07,--Yes.
1988.87-201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1871.218,1885.647,xxx this would be the same argument if in a case when a husband and wife get divorced and prior to that time he's given up part of his retirement pay to get disability.
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,1885.647,1890.17,"I'm sorry, I don't quite understand the question."
1988.87-201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1890.17,1905.12,"Well, suppose there was a divorce today and the, the officer, the retired officer, had been getting... had been getting retirement pay but he had already given up part of it in order to get disability, so he's getting both disability and retirement at the time of the divorce."
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,1905.12,1905.891,Yes.
1988.87-201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1905.891,1919.669,The wife would be able to get one half of his retirement pay just as though he hadn't given up any of it?
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,1919.669,1922.421,She would be entitled to get one half of the longevity pay--
1988.87-201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1922.421,1923.102,Right.
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,1923.102,1929.565,"--Of the net longevity pay still available, and then she would have to seek to collect the remainder of her one half of the longevity pay through other assets."
1988.87-201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1932.679,1933.288,"Yes, I understand, I understand."
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,1953.161,1958.275,"That's my argument, that he should not be entitled to reduce her half of the estate through something solely within his action."
1988.87-201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1960.496,1967.83,So that... this case really doesn't turn on the fact that there has already been a settlement and they've... things like that?
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,1967.83,1972.064,"I think it does turn on it, because what I'm speaking about generally is a law of the state of California."
1988.87-201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1978.728,1985.541,"Well, should we decide that... if we just decided the case on that ground, we wouldn't be deciding the case I just described to you."
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,1985.541,1986.522,--That's correct.
1988.87-201,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1986.522,1996.18,"When you say it was, it was... gee a final judgment, are those... are the matters such as the one in question not subject to being reopened under California law?"
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,1996.18,1998.64,They are not subject to being reopened under California law.
1988.87-201,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2039.256,2044.389,But why... there doesn't seem to be anything in the California decision saying that this can't be reopened.
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,2044.389,2048.363,"There was nothing in the California decision on... yes, that said it could be reopened."
1988.87-201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2059.092,2067.116,You're really saying that there is a way that you could win this case but on a ground the court below didn't use.
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,2067.116,2068.095,Yes.
1988.87-201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2068.095,2070.987,Please affirm on the grounds of res judicata.
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,2070.987,2072.018,Yes.
1988.87-201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2079.064,2095.043,"Well, the court below disposed of it on... disposed of it on this other ground, though, that, that California can... can... needn't take that... car disregard the waiver of the retirement pay."
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,2095.043,2095.704,--Yes.
1988.87-201,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2095.704,2097.096,Which really is a ruling on the merits.
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,2103.661,2104.64,I don't know.
1988.87-201,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2106.432,2112.206,Does California have a rule that they do not reach federal or Constitutional questions unless there's a necessity to do so?
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,2112.206,2114.379,I'm not aware of such a rule.
1988.87-201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2122.474,2124.184,"In any case, that's a state law question."
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,2134.441,2138.455,"If there's an express reservation to that effect in the opinion of the Court, then I think it would be appropriate."
1988.87-201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2147.571,2149.983,"xxx if we decide on the merits, you may win."
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,2149.983,2151.755,"I would certainly hope so, Your honor."
1988.87-201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2154.336,2158.437,Did you argue res judicata to the California Court of Appeal?
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,2158.437,2159.308,"Yes, I did."
1988.87-201,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2159.308,2160.57,And they said nothing about it?
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,2160.57,2161.849,They said nothing about it.
1988.87-201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2237.14,2249.04,"Well, if you win on the merits, how much... for how much can you ask the federal government to pay you?"
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,2249.04,2255.052,The maximum amount that the federal government will allow to be garnished is 50 percent of the disposable retired longevity pay.
1988.87-201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2255.052,2264.138,So that's... so the only disposable longevity payment that's left here is the original amount less what was waived?
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,2264.138,2267.119,"Less the applicable taxes and other matters, yes."
1988.87-201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2267.119,2275.855,"So you won't be able to levy, to garnish the federal government for all that you think you're entitled to?"
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,2275.855,2276.666,That's correct.
1988.87-201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2282.34,2283.091,I understand it.
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,2285.662,2289.485,I would hope to find some... part of an estate somewhere that I could get something out of.
1988.87-201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2289.485,2289.946,Yes.
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,2292.868,2295.991,"I cannot get it out of the remaining retirement pay, because there's not enough left."
1988.87-201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2295.991,2296.699,Yes.
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,2296.699,2298.472,Especially with the--
1988.87-201,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2298.472,2307.975,"Well, you can't... the most that you can... the most that you could garnish the federal government for would be 50 percent of what's left."
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,2307.975,2310.249,"--Fifty percent of the disposable retired pay, yes."
1988.87-201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2310.249,2317.442,"Mr. Cornell, you're, you're obviously quite right that you'll have different results in two different estates where the assets are the same."
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,2339.008,2340.758,That statute--
1988.87-201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2340.758,2342.421,And amounts waived?
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,2344.341,2348.375,--Because they wanted to be consistent and guarantee to the disabled veteran that he would actually receive those benefits.
1988.87-201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2352.434,2353.936,But you're saying he doesn't receive it.
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,2359.871,2360.682,"No, that's not--"
1988.87-201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2360.682,2361.932,So long as he has other assets.
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,2361.932,2363.374,--If he has an estate.
1988.87-201,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2363.374,2363.862,So long as he has other assets.
1988.87-201,1,20690,dennis_a_cornell,,2363.862,2365.464,But the actual pay will not be taken away from him.
1988.87-201,2,20681,douglas_b_cone,,3001.03,3002.542,"Yes, I'm going to waive the remainder, Your Honor."
1988.87-201,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3002.542,3003.373,Very well.
