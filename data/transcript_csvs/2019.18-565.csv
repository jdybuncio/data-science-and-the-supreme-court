2019.18-565,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.16,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 18-565, CITGO Asphalt Refining Company versus Frescati Shipping Company. Mr. Phillips."
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,10.16,162.36,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The basic issue in this case is what ought to be the default rule for what is the generally referred to as safe-port or safe-berth clause in the standard charter party form that has, frankly, governed the transportation of ocean-going vessels for a very, very long time. There are -- the court below concluded that -- based on the language referring specifically to ""staying afloat and safely,"" that this imposed a strict liability on the charterer, my client, who designated that Paulsboro, New Jersey, would be the port of entry for these particular goods. That is an extraordinary interpretation under the circumstances in which my client is now facing well in excess of $140 million in -- in -- in an award based solely on an accident that was, candidly, unknown and unknowable at the time that the designation was made and, candidly, at any time until the actual allision occurred. The question then is, is there a different or better or more sensible default rule that the Court might turn to? And it seems worth spending a second and just focusing on the exact language of this clause, which is at the appendix to the Petitioners' brief at 8a. ""The vessel shall discharge at any safe place or wharf"" -- that, of course, says nothing about any obligations of any of the parties -- ""which shall be designated and procured by the charterer"" -- so that is the obligation of my client to designate and -- and procure the space -- ""provided that the vessel can proceed thereto, lie at, and depart therefrom always safely afloat, any lighterage being at the expense, risk, and peril of the charterer."" And it seems to me the difficulty with saying that this is an unlimited source of liability on a strict liability theory is that why would you identify lighterage as the specific remedy to be worried about unless what you're really concerned about is, has the charterer made essentially a safe choice as far as everyone can tell, and then, when the captain gets there, if for whatever reason the captain in his or her judgment decides it's not a safe choice and decides to go off into another port or to offload some portion at the expense and the risk, all of that is then imposed upon the charterer."
2019.18-565,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,162.36,169.24,"Mr. Phillips, this has been the rule for some time in the Seventh Circuit -- in the Second Circuit --"
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,169.24,170.04,Second Circuit.
2019.18-565,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,170.04,174.64,-- including an opinion by Henry Friendly.
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,184.44,191.48,That's -- that is precisely what the Court said about Norfolk Southern versus James Kirby in terms of how do you interpret the contract.
2019.18-565,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,228.52,229.0,Contrary to -- to the -- to the --
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,229.0,230.16,-- construction of this clause.
2019.18-565,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,230.16,234.64,-- to the other treatises.
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,267.72,351.04,"The -- the difficulty, I think, with looking at other forms and other clauses and other contracts between other parties is -- is, candidly, there's no evidence that ties any knowledge of any of that to the decision that was made between the Star Tanker and my client when they entered into the -- into the charter party arrangement in this particular case. It's true that there were other options available, but the question is, what did the parties intend when they chose this language under these circumstances? And against the backdrop -- because I -- I do think the text itself tells you that the basic problem this is designed to deal with is what do you do when you show a -- when you pick a place that's safe, it turns out it's not safe, and then the -- then the captain has to act in response to that, what's the -- what's the outcome? But, if you put it contextually and look at other provisions of this contract, where you have the general exceptions clause that says that the -- that there -- that for perils of the sea, neither the charterer, nor the owner of the ship, nor anybody else is responsible for those kinds of injuries. And so that suggests to you that for what we're looking at, unknown and unknowable hazards, that that's -- that that's not what the parties expected would be imposed on the charterer by simply designating at the time a safe port. Second --"
2019.18-565,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,351.04,362.48,"Mr. Phillips, even if we're looking just to this contract, these parties, you said, well, look, there is the Second Circuit, but we have the Fifth Circuit on our side."
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,406.8,411.44,"Well, but those are -- but those are choice-of-forum clauses."
2019.18-565,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,415.44,416.32,"Well, we know what happens --"
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,416.32,417.36,-- for the Second Circuit rule.
2019.18-565,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,417.36,419.32,-- we know what happens in arbitration in New York.
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,423.56,424.64,They tend to follow the --
2019.18-565,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,424.64,425.24,And certainly --
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,425.24,426.48,"-- Second Circuit rule, although the --"
2019.18-565,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,426.48,430.36,"-- certainly, the Southern District of New York is following the Second Circuit rule, isn't it?"
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,430.36,430.92,To be sure.
2019.18-565,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,438.44,438.72,"Well, I know --"
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,438.72,438.92,-- and properly so.
2019.18-565,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,438.92,443.16,"-- there was some strange circumstance, you know, it didn't -- didn't end up going to arbitration."
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,456.64,456.76,Right.
2019.18-565,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,456.76,467.48,"So even if we're just looking to this particular contract between these two parties, I -- I guess I'm thinking these two parties thought that this was going to be adjudicated in New York --"
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,467.48,467.76,But --
2019.18-565,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,467.76,468.96,-- under New York rules.
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,468.96,501.44,"-- but even under -- even under that interpretation, which I don't think is a fair way to interpret this, because it seems to me that when you're engaged in a very broad contract entry position, to say that this was -- that this was something that was entertained because they knew how New York law worked in certain ways, I don't think is a fair way to interpret the contract. But I -- but -- but even aside from that, if you actually look at the arbitration decisions that our friends cite and -- and examine them, they say things like, of course, the charterer is not the insurer against all risk that takes place."
2019.18-565,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,558.16,558.56,"Well, can I just --"
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,558.56,559.08,-- ought to be for.
2019.18-565,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,559.08,566.76,"-- can I just ask, Mr. Phillips, about the text, because the text does say a safe berth, yeah?"
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,566.76,567.84,"Yes, Your Honor, safe -- safe place."
2019.18-565,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,567.84,570.68,"Safe place or wharf, right, safe place or wharf."
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,597.28,601.72,"No, I would think that that is, in -- in fact, a warranty, but I think that --"
2019.18-565,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,601.72,605.68,"Even though, like I -- I said, I didn't know that this car was ready to break down."
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,608.32,627.24,"Well, my guess is, first of all, I mean, I hate to -- to fight your hypothetical, but my guess is that's -- that's something that is at least potentially knowable, although I -- I can envision a circumstance where it wouldn't be. Here, you're talking about something that is absolutely unknown and unknowable under these particular circumstances."
2019.18-565,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,628.0,628.56,"Well, absolutely --"
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,628.56,628.92,"-- the term ""safe"" --"
2019.18-565,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,628.92,629.32,"-- I mean, there are ways of --"
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,629.32,631.52,-- doesn't mean as against all possible risk.
2019.18-565,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,631.52,631.96,Aren't there --
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,631.96,633.32,It doesn't have to mean that.
2019.18-565,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,649.44,649.76,What if --
2019.18-565,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,649.76,650.04,"Well, Mister --"
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,650.04,650.32,-- of the port.
2019.18-565,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,650.32,655.12,"-- what if we think the text can be read your way, but it can also be read the other way? What should we do then?"
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,655.12,666.44,"Then you should go to the other criteria, which is the context, which I've already identified, and the billion dollars of liability insurance that the other side has. I think the case law tends to support us more."
2019.18-565,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,717.08,731.96,"Well, if we get to custom and usage, which is what you seem to be talking about, can that be decided on the record that we have? Isn't that a factual question? And was that fact decided by the district court?"
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,731.96,754.52,"No -- well, it wasn't decided by the district court because the court of appeals in its prior opinion had basically said this is a strict liability to the limits of the earth holding, and, therefore, there was no opportunity for the district court to entertain that. On the other hand, what we -- what we do know in terms of transactional costs and insurance I think is probably knowable from common sense."
2019.18-565,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,773.92,788.28,"Well, along those lines, Mr. Phillips, I'm trying to -- I'm trying to figure out the difference between your rule and -- and your colleague's suggested rule. As I understand it, you would like us to essentially impose a negligence standard, a due diligence standard."
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,846.48,853.76,"The -- the answer to your question, Justice Gorsuch, is that we did make an abnormal occurrence argument."
2019.18-565,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,858.44,858.76,Yeah.
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,858.76,869.24,"-- footnote to the six times that we referred to abnormal circumstances. And, again, put it in the context of the litigation, which is the district court had held that we were not liable under these circumstances."
2019.18-565,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,884.88,885.28,Okay.
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,885.28,886.76,-- at every stage that argument.
2019.18-565,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,887.8,888.04,Yeah.
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,888.04,896.4,"-- for that issue, that would -- you know, if you vacate the -- the -- the decision and send it back to is this a peril of the sea or is this a natural occurrence --"
2019.18-565,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,896.4,896.8,I got you.
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,907.32,922.52,"The due diligence standard, frankly, doesn't go to the question, to my mind, to the question of this particular obstruction. The due diligence goes to the question of whether you -- whether you did due diligence in selecting the port or the berth in the first instance."
2019.18-565,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,940.84,941.32,"Mr. Phillips, you --"
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,941.32,942.68,And we did our due diligence there.
2019.18-565,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,942.68,955.64,"-- you've been using terms like strict liability and due diligence, and those -- those sound in tort to me, and yet we're dealing with a contract. The contract doesn't say anything like that -- any familiar tort terms."
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,967.24,984.92,"I'm not sure I'm the one who's introduced them into the -- into the contract case, other than I think the lower courts, frankly, are the ones who've decided that the better way to conceptualize the problem is in -- is in these terms. You know, from my perspective, I'm perfectly comfortable if the question is, is this a safe port, there was no breach of the contract."
2019.18-565,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1005.96,1006.8,"Well, but it's not --"
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1006.8,1006.84,-- in that --
2019.18-565,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1006.84,1007.92,-- it's not a safe port.
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1014.72,1015.36,Right.
2019.18-565,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1038.84,1048.28,"Under the contract, and separating out tort law and contract law, under tort law, it happens because there is an accident."
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1051.24,1052.2,Right.
2019.18-565,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1052.2,1071.16,"Under contract law, why should the vessel bear the risk of someone else's choice? Because of the unknown and unknowable? The voyage is -- the vessel is there only because of the charterer's choice, not because of its own."
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1071.16,1071.72,Right.
2019.18-565,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1071.72,1098.24,"And so, if we're talking in terms of contract, why does that make any sense to view it in any other way than to say the charterer picks, the charterer has the expense, risk, and peril of lighterage -- and lighterage, in my mind, can include all the charges related to the transfer to a safe berth. There was no ability to do that."
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1105.6,1106.04,"Well, I -- I --"
2019.18-565,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1106.04,1106.4,Which is --
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1106.4,1106.52,Right.
2019.18-565,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1106.52,1116.6,"-- if you're talking about the parties' expectations, why would the vessel think it should be responsible for losses occasioned by someone else's choice?"
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1116.6,1129.92,"Because all that the choice imposed as a -- as an obligation on my client was to identify someplace that is safe in the sense that it -- there are no obvious risks, that it is not obviously un- --"
2019.18-565,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1129.92,1130.0,I don't see --
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1130.0,1130.84,-- inappropriate.
2019.18-565,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1130.84,1132.36,-- those words anywhere in the contract.
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1132.36,1137.36,"Well, that -- they only make sense in the context of what is the remedy by choosing poorly."
2019.18-565,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1243.76,1270.6,"Back to the text, it does say ""safe place or wharf which shall be designated and procured by the charterer."" So the words ""designated and procured"" are not just the place but the fact that it's safe as well. So, if it turns out not to be safe, just as a matter of logic, it hasn't designated or procured a safe place or wharf."
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1270.6,1294.92,"Well, the question -- it seems to me the question, Justice Kavanaugh, really is, does safe mean that you -- you -- that you will assure that regardless of what happens, if it -- if it gets hit by a meteor, if it gets -- if somebody, a vandal, goes on the -- on the ship while it's in a berth and blows it up, that that's all on the charterer? Did the charterer assume all of those obligations?"
2019.18-565,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1294.92,1299.68,"Well, it says designated or procured, and procured a safe place."
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1304.92,1334.0,"I mean, I do think that's one interpretation you can give to it. The other interpretation, which is much more sensible in -- in terms of maritime commerce and the rest of the provisions and the other protections that the other parties have against this particular liability, is -- is to say it's safe in the way the U.K. Supreme Court said. It's safe for this ship under these circumstances on that particular day as a prediction made at the time that the prediction is made."
2019.18-565,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1334.0,1334.56,So --
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1334.56,1339.6,And there's no question we satisfied that standard under these circumstances.
2019.18-565,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1351.8,1352.2,So --
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1352.2,1352.96,-- completely safe.
2019.18-565,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1352.96,1366.92,"-- Mr. Phillips, what you're saying is sensible seems to be doing a lot of the work there, in contrast to the language that Justice Kavanaugh read. And, again, this goes back to the question of what you're supposed to do in tort and what you're supposed to do in contract."
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1383.68,1387.28,"I don't -- I mean, obviously, in the abstract, I don't -- I don't disagree with that proposition."
2019.18-565,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1399.32,1399.52,Well --
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1399.52,1409.56,"-- which talks about unless otherwise in this charter expressly exempted, they shall not be responsible for any loss arising out of the peril of the sea."
2019.18-565,0,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1468.8,1470.92,I knew I'd get somebody.
2019.18-565,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1474.68,1476.52,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Ross."
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1476.52,1495.32,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The sophisticated commercial parties in this case chose a form contract to govern the transport of oil from Venezuela to Petitioners' berth on the Delaware River."
2019.18-565,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1557.96,1584.92,"Ms. Ross, I'm -- I'm going to pose to you the same sort of question I posed to Mr. Phillips, which is I'm not sure what the difference or delta is between the two proposed tests at the end of the day. Yes, this is a contract case, but Mr. Phillips has argued for something like a due diligence, right? I think of it as really a negligence-type standard. You've argued for something more like strict liability, right, that it's a warranty, absolute."
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1620.0,1623.04,"So, Justice Gorsuch, I disagree that they wind up in the same place."
2019.18-565,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1655.0,1655.76,Like -- like what?
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1655.76,1659.92,"So, for example, there's an old -- so Mr. Phillips mentioned a meteor."
2019.18-565,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1686.28,1686.44,"Well, the --"
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1686.44,1686.92,-- event that causes --
2019.18-565,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1686.92,1701.16,"-- U.K. Supreme Court has recently just held, though, that a big storm that sweeps into the port also counts as an abnormal occurrence, if you want, though that surely -- those types of storms have not been unknown to that port in the past."
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1718.96,1724.0,"So I think the fact, Your Honor, I -- I agree that a large weather event could be an abnormal occurrence."
2019.18-565,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1746.84,1751.68,"I know you're -- you're liking to focus on the facts of the case just as much as Mr. Phillips, and for that I admire you."
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1755.88,1756.28,Sure.
2019.18-565,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1756.28,1756.92,Okay.
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1767.0,1773.48,"So, I mean, I will -- I'm happy to get to administrability grounds, but I think the number one reason would be that's not what the text of the contract says and it's not --"
2019.18-565,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1773.48,1777.08,"But the text of the contract also doesn't have abnormal occurrence in it, right?"
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1777.08,1777.2,Well --
2019.18-565,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1777.2,1781.0,"So you're -- you're arguing for an atextual position yourself, I think."
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1786.52,1786.68,Sure.
2019.18-565,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1786.68,1789.0,"Are you -- are you arguing for that position, Ms. Ross?"
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1789.0,1818.32,"So -- so we're not saying that the abnormal occurrence possibility does not exist, but I don't think it's atextual. And if the Court will just bear with me, I think that is one example of a -- a set of doctrines that have grown up around this clause that show that this clause has a long lineage, but also are just sort of applications of causation principles. If there is an abnormal occurrence, Petitioners' failure to designate a safe berth is not the cause of the vessel's injury. Now that is also true of the bad navigation and seamanship doctrine."
2019.18-565,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1881.76,1882.2,Well --
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1882.2,1884.76,-- beginning in the 1930s.
2019.18-565,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1884.76,1891.28,"-- the Association of Ship Brokers and Agents publishes the -- the form on which this contract was based, doesn't -- doesn't it?"
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1891.28,1892.04,"It does, Your Honor."
2019.18-565,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1892.04,1895.12,And which interpretation does it think is the correct one?
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1895.12,1897.24,So it has not taken a position in this case.
2019.18-565,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1915.8,1918.32,"Well, I think it's done more than not take a position."
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1943.44,1947.72,So I think it's clear for the same reason that Judge Friendly said it was clear in Paragon Oil.
2019.18-565,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1971.72,1972.32,But there is --
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1972.32,1974.56,-- expressly explains the warranty.
2019.18-565,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1974.56,1978.36,"-- a lot of authority both ways on this -- on this issue, is there not?"
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1978.36,1979.52,"There is not, Justice Alito."
2019.18-565,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1981.96,1990.36,"Well, there's the -- there's the Gilmore and Black treatise, which is we have long regarded as one of the leading, if not the leading, admiralty treatise."
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,1991.2,1992.12,"So that's correct, Your Honor."
2019.18-565,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2028.48,2035.56,You -- you mentioned some time ago that it's not abnormal to have debris in the Delaware River.
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,2037.0,2037.96,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.18-565,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2037.96,2055.36,"Is that what we look at, or do we look at the actual event, which is, you know, the anchor leaps up from the bottom, you know, damages the hull, then returns to the bottom? I mean, that -- that -- that's a pretty abnormal occurrence, even if there are a lot of anchors."
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,2055.36,2062.16,"So it's possible, Your Honor, that some court might, with actual evidence about that question, decide that that is an abnormal occurrence."
2019.18-565,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2081.44,2081.72,You --
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,2081.72,2096.32,"This case has gone through two trials with a total of 71 days of testimony. I think the idea that at this point Petitioners would come in and raise, in their reply brief no less, this idea of an abnormal occurrence and then this Court would remand would be quite surprising."
2019.18-565,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2096.32,2098.68,You earlier mentioned causation principles.
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,2105.24,2107.28,To the abnormal occurrence?
2019.18-565,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2107.28,2107.64,Uh-huh.
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,2107.64,2109.68,"So, Justice Kavanaugh, I mean --"
2019.18-565,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2109.68,2114.96,"A line draw -- the line of causation, is it damage caused by the condition of the port, for example?"
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,2114.96,2115.48,Yes.
2019.18-565,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2135.36,2140.08,"And if it's weather or a meteor, obviously, that's not the condition of the port."
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,2145.8,2170.52,"Well, I think people would argue about weather just in terms of how frequent that type of a storm is and things of that nature. But putting that to one side, I don't think that you would -- again, I think based on the limited evidence we have here, and common sense, I don't think that the presence of debris on an industrial river would be in the same vein as a meteor or the outbreak of a war or something of that nature. And that is where we see -- or -- or as sort of a once-in-a-generation storm even. That is --"
2019.18-565,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2170.52,2182.48,Do you think we can sort of take judicial notice of the fact that an anchor popping up like this in a port that is very heavily used is more foreseeable than a big storm?
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,2182.48,2209.32,"So, Your Honor, my suggestion, if I -- if I were to be sort of bold enough to make one, would be that the Court not address this particular question at all because Petitioners haven't preserved it. And so I think it would be perfectly appropriate for the Court to say in a different case, where Petitioners have not gone through two trials and failed to ever raise this question, it might be appropriate for a -- a -- a United States court to consider the scope of the abnormal occurrence doctrine, but that that's not this case."
2019.18-565,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2209.32,2214.12,You -- you referred to the fact that it's the London courts that have done the work on this.
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,2214.12,2214.36,Uh-huh.
2019.18-565,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2214.36,2221.4,"Have -- has the Second Circuit or any of the New York arbitrators, do they recognize this doctrine or not?"
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,2221.4,2235.52,"So, Justice Kagan, to my knowledge, there are statements, including in the Third Circuit's opinion here, that sort of acknowledge that this safety definition includes a carveout for abnormal weather or other occurrences, is usually how it's phrased in the American cases."
2019.18-565,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2293.88,2303.52,"I mean, arbitrators don't have to interpret the law the same way a court does, and to the extent they do it, it's not reviewable by a court."
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,2306.84,2312.6,"So, Justice Alito, I certainly take the point that arbitrators may not be bound in the same way that lower courts would be."
2019.18-565,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2347.32,2347.96,I don't know.
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,2361.28,2381.8,"So I think, Justice Alito, the way I would phrase it, if I might, is that the -- the arbitration decisions are really confirmation of the industry's understanding because these are expert arbitrators. And, again, going back to where I started this morning, the industry had and has had, I believe since the 1950s, two sort of standard form contracts that govern."
2019.18-565,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2386.4,2387.04,Excuse me.
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,2387.04,2387.88,-- express due diligence --
2019.18-565,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2387.88,2396.04,"With respect to that issue, your -- Mr. Phillips says that you can't get insurance, that a ruling in your favor will destroy the industry."
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,2397.48,2397.96,If I might.
2019.18-565,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2397.96,2398.36,Yes.
2019.18-565,1,62958,erica_l_ross,,2398.36,2399.12,Sure.
2019.18-565,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2426.72,2432.56,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Goldstein."
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2432.56,2445.44,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I thought I would come at this from the perspective that Justice Alito asked about. What if we regard the text as in equipoise? It says safe, and that could mean different things in different contexts."
2019.18-565,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2657.24,2665.64,Who is responsible -- who is responsible for negligence of the master? Is the master an employee of the ship's owner or is --
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2665.64,2665.96,Yes.
2019.18-565,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2665.96,2672.72,"So -- so, if the master is negligent, then the charterer is not responsible?"
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2672.72,2673.04,Yes.
2019.18-565,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2673.04,2687.84,"Then so what we have is a situation where the master is negligent and the charterer is not responsible, but where the master isn't negligent, then suddenly the charterer is responsible?"
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2687.84,2689.04,It's not -- it's not suddenly.
2019.18-565,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2691.2,2694.28,"Then why would somebody do it that way? I mean, that -- that's --"
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2694.28,2702.4,"Well, Justice Breyer, here's -- here's the little bit of the bait and switch if I can -- can say, and that is my friend is very concerned that someone would be held liable without fault."
2019.18-565,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2714.68,2718.68,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, well, but they still go back to the original thing."
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2734.32,2735.12,That would be odd.
2019.18-565,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2735.12,2736.56,He's supposed to know that.
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2736.56,2737.24,Yes.
2019.18-565,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2737.24,2741.28,"And then, when he does that incorrectly --"
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2741.28,2742.04,Yes.
2019.18-565,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2742.04,2742.96,-- mistakenly --
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2742.96,2744.24,Yes.
2019.18-565,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2744.24,2746.2,-- that's your problem? It's the owner's problem?
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2746.2,2746.48,Yes.
2019.18-565,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2750.48,2751.12,All right.
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2757.56,2758.04,Right.
2019.18-565,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2758.04,2759.96,"And, suddenly, the charterer is liable."
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2759.96,2760.36,There's --
2019.18-565,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2760.36,2764.24,"I guess people have operated under this rule, as you say, for a long time."
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2764.24,2764.88,Long time.
2019.18-565,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2764.88,2765.68,"Well, isn't it because --"
2019.18-565,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2765.68,2766.16,But why?
2019.18-565,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2766.16,2767.44,-- the charterer chose the port?
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2767.44,2767.8,Yes.
2019.18-565,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2770.92,2771.08,Who?
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2771.08,2771.64,He did.
2019.18-565,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2775.12,2775.28,Yeah.
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2775.28,2778.88,I want it to go to Paulsboro and I promise it'll be safe.
2019.18-565,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2811.12,2814.88,But Gilmore and Black think that the language is ambiguous.
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2816.68,2818.6,"Well, Gilmore -- let's just be clear."
2019.18-565,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2821.28,2822.44,"Yeah, but they're pretty good."
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2822.44,2831.12,"And as my -- my colleague from the Solicitor General's Office says, what Gilmore and Black says is we recognize that all the authority is on the other side."
2019.18-565,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2835.72,2836.8,Because?
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2836.8,2839.68,Because we just think it -- it doesn't make sense.
2019.18-565,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2840.04,2842.4,And it doesn't make sense in their view because?
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2842.4,2846.36,Because it would just make -- it would -- it's not fair to the charterer.
2019.18-565,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2847.84,2848.48,Because?
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2848.48,2850.08,"It doesn't go a lot farther than that, Justice Breyer."
2019.18-565,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2850.08,2854.04,"Well, Gilmore and Black are not -- I mean, they're -- they're very good experts."
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2854.04,2854.12,They were.
2019.18-565,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2854.12,2856.96,They don't make things up. So -- so -- so why?
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2856.96,2860.56,"Justice Breyer, they actually didn't say they are making it up, just to be clear."
2019.18-565,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2860.56,2860.88,Yeah.
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2860.88,2863.4,They recognize that the authority says one thing.
2019.18-565,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2916.52,2917.0,I got that.
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2920.32,2920.64,Yes.
2019.18-565,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2926.0,2935.76,"I mean, Mr. Goldstein, would it be fair to say Gilmore and Black were incredibly smart men? There are two kinds of treatises in the world."
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2943.84,2944.36,Yes. (Laughter.)
2019.18-565,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2944.36,2947.32,Don't you think Gilmore and Black is the second kind of treatise?
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2947.32,2948.04,"I do, yeah."
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2953.04,2976.12,"-- and I'm sure they appreciated all the citations of the Court. But, if you were to actually cite them in your opinion, you would be citing Gilmore and Black says the rule should be X. My point, or I was trying to start from Justice Alito's question, is what actually, if you thought the text was in equipoise, what would you look at, how the industry actually treats things? You would not cite Gilmore and Black against me on that position, on that question."
2019.18-565,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2976.12,2985.28,"Well, if we thought that the -- the text was perfectly ambiguous, couldn't we say we are incredibly smart people, and we think -- (Laughter.)"
2019.18-565,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2985.28,2986.36,-- that the better rule --
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2986.36,2986.72,Yes.
2019.18-565,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2986.72,2988.52,-- is the Gilmore and Black rule?
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2988.52,2997.28,"Justice Alito, I learned a long time ago that if the question is couldn't -- could the Supreme Court do X, the answer is yes. (Laughter.)"
2019.18-565,2,42731,thomas_c_goldstein,,2997.28,3018.24,"What -- it would be somewhat of a departure from this Court's decisions saying that you, in these kinds of cases, look to two things, and that is the industry practice and how the United Kingdom has interpreted maritime contracts. And so, while you could depart from that understanding, it would not be in a contract case what the parties actually expect because it is the case that they can get insurance."
2019.18-565,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3152.08,3154.4,"Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Phillips."
2019.18-565,3,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3154.4,3162.64,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and, again, may it please the Court: First of all, both of my friends refer specifically to these two forms."
2019.18-565,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3188.32,3188.72,But those --

2019.18-565,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3189.36,3191.56,-- those -- those other -- those other contracts were not a mystery.

All I'm saying is the fact that there are other alternatives does not tell you anything about the contract that the parties understood when they entered in -- into this agreement. With respect to abnormal occurrence, again, that is clearly an atextual analysis, again, by my friends over here."
