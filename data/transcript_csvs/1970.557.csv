1970.557,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,38.028,"We will hear argument next in number 557, United States against International Minerals and Chemicals Corporation."
1970.557,0,29884,john_f_dienelt,,41.26,44.92,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.557,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,244.094,247.986,"Mr. Dienelt, who was the District Judge in this case?"
1970.557,0,29884,john_f_dienelt,,254.954,255.28,"Well, --"
1970.557,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,255.28,256.6,Is that Judge Porter?
1970.557,0,29884,john_f_dienelt,,256.6,258.471,"Yes, he was Your Honor."
1970.557,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,258.471,259.007,"Well, I thought --"
1970.557,0,29884,john_f_dienelt,,259.007,262.735,"I gather it was, I didn’t know."
1970.557,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,879.931,881.121,Let me ask you this.
1970.557,0,29884,john_f_dienelt,,881.121,882.194,Yes sir.
1970.557,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,882.194,905.928,A hypothetical question. Suppose by some coincidence the man engaged in a manufacturing and handling of sulfuric acid also had a division that handled olive oil and by sheer inadvertence of employees got the sulfuric acid in the olive oil tanks and tank cars --
1970.557,0,29884,john_f_dienelt,,905.928,906.496,Mixed out.
1970.557,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,906.496,914.384,What impact would that have on a criminal charge for failing to label the sulfuric acid accurately?
1970.557,0,29884,john_f_dienelt,,915.327,927.729,"I think it would be defense, Your Honor, that that would be a claim that I didn’t know what I'm was shipping and I think that it would be a question for the jury as to whether to believe that."
1970.557,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1079.745,1086.694,There was a reference somewhere in the legislative history however to the concurring opinion in the First Circuit.
1970.557,0,29884,john_f_dienelt,,1086.694,1087.147,That’s true.
1970.557,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1087.147,1088.724,"The St. Johnsbury case, was there not?"
1970.557,0,29884,john_f_dienelt,,1088.724,1089.589,There was.
1970.557,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1120.95,1122.565,Had the Boyce case been decided?
1970.557,0,29884,john_f_dienelt,,1122.565,1134.627,The Boyce case had been decided and so had St. Johnsbury and as we've argued that we don’t believe the Boyce case reached the point of the deciding whether knowledge of the law was an excuse.
1970.557,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1311.191,1315.944,"We don’t deal here however with a regulated industry as such, do we John?"
1970.557,0,29884,john_f_dienelt,,1315.944,1318.297,Not as such -- its carrier and ships --
1970.557,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1318.297,1321.621,The carriers are regulated but the shipper might be anybody.
1970.557,0,29884,john_f_dienelt,,1321.621,1321.945,That’s --
1970.557,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1321.945,1326.794,"You or I might be a shipper, a casual shipper, any member of the public --"
1970.557,0,29884,john_f_dienelt,,1326.794,1328.562,That that’s correct.
1970.557,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1352.754,1359.514,What you're saying is that anybody in sulfuric acid business is bound to know that it’s a dangerous substance?
1970.557,0,29884,john_f_dienelt,,1359.514,1387.701,"Precisely and is bound to know the regulations regarding transport of a dangerous substance so that if it fails to follow those regulations knowingly, it can be convicted under the statute and for that reason, we think this Court should find that the information did sufficiently alleged all the essential elements of the crime in this case and that the case should be remanded for a trial."
1970.557,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1389.78,1391.249,Very well.
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,1394.807,1398.332,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.557,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1506.174,1520.648,"Are we at page 4, Mr. Spencer of the Government’s brief contains one of the accounts to the information as representative. I suppose you would concede that this is accurate--"
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,1520.648,1520.938,"Yes, it is Your Honor."
1970.557,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1520.938,1524.224,An accurate introduction of its representative.
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,1539.028,1539.582,That’s correct.
1970.557,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1545.495,1547.436,Which was in violation?
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,1547.436,1549.186,Which was in violation of the regulation.
1970.557,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1557.125,1563.369,And what would you -- what do you say that should have been included or added to this count of the information to make it valid.
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,1563.369,1570.597,They should have been charged that the defendant knowingly violated the regulation by doing whatever acts they alleged.
1970.557,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1570.597,1574.717,"So if had said, in knowing violation of 49 CFR, it would have been --"
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,1574.717,1575.244,Yes.
1970.557,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1575.244,1576.171,Valid and sufficient.
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,1576.171,1578.828,"That makes it a very vital difference, Your Honor."
1970.557,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1580.087,1581.896,What does the statute says though?
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,1581.896,1584.55,"The statute says, “Whoever knowingly violates --"
1970.557,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1584.55,1586.255,Whoever knowingly violates?
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,1586.255,1587.411,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.557,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1589.284,1595.316,"Well, you say that argument is -- you first have to know about the regulations before he can knowingly violate."
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,1595.316,1599.066,I say -- I say he must be charged with a “knowing violation”.
1970.557,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1630.457,1634.747,What if their rights in the indictment is --
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,1634.747,1636.474,"If there, I'm sorry Your Honor."
1970.557,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1640.602,1651.097,If a knowing violation means if knowing and doing an act which happens to be a violation of the statute they would indict this.
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,1651.097,1652.239,"Yes, that’s correct."
1970.557,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1655.96,1657.685,"Well, that’s what the argument is about?"
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,1657.685,1660.553,"That’s what the argument about, yes."
1970.557,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1676.995,1694.496,"Your arguments of necessity assumes that you have to be in the sulfuric acid business and not know that it’s a such dangerous substance that it’s regulated by a lot of statutes and rules about having, doesn’t it?"
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,1694.496,1695.845,"Not necessarily, it --"
1970.557,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1695.845,1698.708,"Well, take that first part."
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,1706.274,1710.231,"Yes, but that has -- that doesn’t have anything to do with the violation of this particular regulation."
1970.557,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1710.231,1712.278,Let’s take this one step at a time.
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,1714.417,1717.281,I don’t think necessarily that he is bound to know --
1970.557,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1717.281,1725.356,"Doesn’t he provide in his own handling of it, a lot of very special kinds of containers?"
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,1725.356,1736.552,I think if you got to a question of proof that that would certainly be an issue as to whether or not he negligently failed to be aware of the regulations.
1970.557,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1736.552,1739.144,That’s what the Government is complaining about here.
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,1746.832,1750.66,"Well, no the charge does not track the statute, Mr. Chief Justice."
1970.557,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1751.435,1755.131,I thought Justice White’s observation made that pretty clear?
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,1755.131,1756.356,I don’t believe so Your Honor.
1970.557,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1772.84,1779.325,What about what Justice Holmes and Judge Magruder and Justice Jackson had to say on the same subject?
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,1779.325,1780.767,They didn’t address themselves to that subject.
1970.557,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1780.767,1781.909,I thought they did?
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,1781.909,1782.253,No.
1970.557,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1900.922,1902.734,I think we’ll suspend for lunch--
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,1902.734,1907.886,Thank you.
1970.557,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1907.886,1909.856,"Mr. Spencer, you may continue."
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,1909.856,1913.672,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1970.557,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1958.097,1967.021,"When you take that position Mr. Spencer, you're now getting into the merits of what the jury might do with it, are you not?"
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,1967.021,1967.676,Only to the --
1970.557,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1967.676,1968.518,Intent?
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,1975.374,1976.023,"I think -- oh -- yes, Your Honor."
1970.557,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1976.023,1997.281,"Take the jury for example, specifically conclude that the man that’s engaged or a company that’s engaged in the manufacturing and processing of sulfuric acid knows that it’s an inherently dangerous substance and infer from that, all the necessary elements of the criminal act?"
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,1997.281,1999.017,"That is correct, that could."
1970.557,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2291.885,2298.202,Are you telling us Mr. Spencer that 834 (f) has no impact on this case.
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,2298.202,2298.466,No.
1970.557,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2320.087,2324.466,"Mr. Spencer, then in -- this charge is under 834 (f)?"
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,2324.466,2325.345,This charge is under 834 (f) --
1970.557,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2325.345,2330.252,"That languages is whoever uses knowingly violates, is it not correct?"
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,2330.252,2334.003,That is correct.
1970.557,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2409.373,2412.808,But I come back to my original question on that.
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,2419.671,2419.859,Because --
1970.557,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2419.859,2430.882,"-- these languages whoever knowingly violates and an indictment that says that this defendant did knowingly failed to show on the shipping papers, the proper names sulfuric acid?"
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,2430.882,2447.009,"Because Your Honor, when they get to a jury, they’re going to argue that this particular violation and the wording of the information that carriers no element of a culpable intent as this Court has said in Boyce and as they said in St. Johnsbury, and --"
1970.557,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2447.009,2450.199,"Well, is that something for us to try to worry about now?"
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,2450.199,2451.67,I should say it is.
1970.557,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2470.245,2470.727,"What language, Mr. Spencer."
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,2470.727,2472.59,-- so reluctant to do that in this case.
1970.557,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2472.59,2480.682,What language before the indictment would satisfy the position you take?
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,2480.682,2480.949,The --
1970.557,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2480.949,2483.023,What should this indictment have said?
1970.557,1,28137,harold_e_spencer,,2483.023,2489.661,It should have said that the defendant did knowingly violate the regulation.
1970.557,2,29884,john_f_dienelt,,2650.589,2653.596,I only have about two brief points.
1970.557,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2727.591,2731.868,(Inaudible) --?
1970.557,2,29884,john_f_dienelt,,2731.868,2759.083,"Well, that was the second point, Your Honor. Our position is that it just isn’t clear enough as to what Congress meant when it revised the statute that we can’t get enough guidance with respect to what the Congress intended to impute to them and intent to override what we consider to be a fundamental proposition that that ignorance of the law doesn’t excuse its violation."
1970.557,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2899.599,2900.569,"Thank you, Mr. Dienelt."
