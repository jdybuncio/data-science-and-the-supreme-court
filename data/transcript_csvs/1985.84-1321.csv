1985.84-1321,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,72.642,"Mr. Appel, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1985.84-1321,0,17394,brent_r_appel,,72.642,75.267,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.84-1321,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,486.384,500.785,"Mr. Appel, I take it you take the position that under these circumstances the attorney had a duty to challenge his client's proposed false testimony?"
1985.84-1321,0,17394,brent_r_appel,,500.785,501.549,"Well, I think there's no question--"
1985.84-1321,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,501.549,514.871,What standard do you think should be employed to determine when the facts are sufficient to impose such a professional obligation on the lawyer?
1985.84-1321,0,17394,brent_r_appel,,514.871,523.571,"--Under the Iowa Code of Professional Responsibility, which follows closely the ABA Model Code, a lawyer cannot knowingly used perjured testimony at trial."
1985.84-1321,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,525.008,531.568,"Does the lawyer have to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, or just have a mere suspicion, or what?"
1985.84-1321,0,17394,brent_r_appel,,531.568,533.755,"--Well, he must have more than a mere suspicion, clearly."
1985.84-1321,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,533.755,535.332,"What standard, then?"
1985.84-1321,0,17394,brent_r_appel,,540.096,548.156,"I think, once again, a lawyer has to know... and under the Model Penal Code definition, for instance, of what ""know"" is, it means a high probability."
1985.84-1321,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,569.552,572.13,"Mr. Appel, let me interrupt just a minute."
1985.84-1321,0,17394,brent_r_appel,,592.544,593.777,--I think they do.
1985.84-1321,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,651.13,660.734,"Well, but can't we say that without affirmatively adopting some standard, from heaven knows where, as to what the duties of a lawyer are in this situation?"
1985.84-1321,0,17394,brent_r_appel,,670.057,672.245,"Yes, it has."
1985.84-1321,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,717.132,722.739,One of the elements of an inadequate assistance of counsel is there's got to be some prejudice.
1985.84-1321,0,17394,brent_r_appel,,722.739,723.505,Yes.
1985.84-1321,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,723.505,733.345,"Now, the argument for the defendant has to be that his being deprived of perjured testimony is prejudice."
1985.84-1321,0,17394,brent_r_appel,,733.345,733.627,Right.
1985.84-1321,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,733.627,741.108,"I'd say all you have to do is convince us that that isn't so and you win your case, don't you?"
1985.84-1321,0,17394,brent_r_appel,,741.108,741.404,To start with--
1985.84-1321,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,741.404,742.748,Without all these other arguments?
1985.84-1321,0,17394,brent_r_appel,,742.748,749.371,"--That's absolutely correct, and I think the Court of Appeals erred in applying what amounted to a per se approach."
1985.84-1321,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,816.781,817.186,"Well, that's hard to say."
1985.84-1321,0,17394,brent_r_appel,,831.087,831.259,--Surely.
1985.84-1321,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,841.098,847.299,Even if what the lawyers did might be subject to sanction--
1985.84-1321,0,17394,brent_r_appel,,847.299,847.768,That's correct.
1985.84-1321,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,847.768,849.252,--under the state rules of ethics.
1985.84-1321,0,17394,brent_r_appel,,849.252,850.704,That's entirely correct Indeed--
1985.84-1321,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,850.704,856.0,Then why do we have to argue so much about the conduct of counsel?
1985.84-1321,0,17394,brent_r_appel,,869.322,874.1,"--I think that helps demonstrate, number one, the lack of prejudice in the case."
1985.84-1321,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,888.079,891.094,I guess I didn't hear if you answered my question.
1985.84-1321,0,17394,brent_r_appel,,895.795,897.263,I think it would be a different case.
1985.84-1321,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,932.921,937.685,The Supreme Court of Iowa can't lay down a Canon of Professional Ethics that violates the federal Constitution.
1985.84-1321,0,17394,brent_r_appel,,937.685,937.982,That's--
1985.84-1321,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,937.982,941.637,"Or rather, it can, but it won't prevail on federal habeas."
1985.84-1321,0,17394,brent_r_appel,,941.637,941.776,--That's correct.
1985.84-1321,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,974.466,978.746,"Is there a separate right of the defendant to be heard, do you think?"
1985.84-1321,0,17394,brent_r_appel,,978.746,979.964,--I think there--
1985.84-1321,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,979.964,985.978,"Is that involved here at all, as opposed to any Sixth Amendment right to counsel?"
1985.84-1321,0,17394,brent_r_appel,,985.978,1001.564,"--Yes, the Court of Appeals indicated that there was a right to testify, and that by being put in the position of having to choose between the right to effective assistance of counsel and the right to testify, the lawyer in this case violated both."
1985.84-1321,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1002.751,1008.468,Doesn't the right to testify carry with it the right to testify truthfully?
1985.84-1321,0,17394,brent_r_appel,,1008.468,1009.248,--I think that's correct.
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,1643.712,1652.084,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1985.84-1321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1707.685,1716.869,"Yes, but the Court of Appeals would put all cases in one bag."
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,1745.655,1755.291,"--I don't believe that's what the Court of Appeals was saying, but the limited portion of their holding is simply that an attorney cannot threaten or actually disclose."
1985.84-1321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1755.291,1761.179,Even no matter what the degree of certainty that the client is going to commit perjury?
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,1761.179,1763.788,That is the holding of the Court of Appeals.
1985.84-1321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1763.788,1763.992,Yes.
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,1764.631,1766.756,That... and the reason--
1985.84-1321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1766.756,1770.8,"So as the case comes to us, that's the given, that the client was going to commit perjury?"
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,1770.8,1773.658,--That is how the Court of Appeals assumed it.
1985.84-1321,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1776.798,1777.095,"No, no."
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,1777.845,1778.485,That's correct.
1985.84-1321,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1810.66,1813.658,"Mr. Grady, let me follow up on a question that the Chief Justice asked your opponent."
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,1827.215,1830.995,"--That's a wholly different matter, and the reason for that--"
1985.84-1321,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1830.995,1831.838,"Now, why is it different?"
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,1831.838,1863.216,"--The reason for that is that the purpose of the attorney-client privilege as set out in this Court's cases... for example, Upjohn and Fisher... indicates that for the defendant to be able to give the lawyer the defendant's version of what happened is necessary for the attorney to be able to advise the client, to develop a strategy of the defense, and to actually intelligently exercise the client's option whether or not to take the stand."
1985.84-1321,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1863.216,1872.525,"Yes, but I am assuming a case in which the client has given his version of what happened and then, having given the version, says, yes, but I'm going to testify differently, and what I testify to will be false."
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,1876.82,1877.399,"Well, okay."
1985.84-1321,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1903.856,1907.636,"Well, has perjury ever been recognized as part of the adversary system?"
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,1907.636,1908.324,"--No, it hasn't."
1985.84-1321,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1931.814,1934.922,But I wonder how much of an impairment there is at all.
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,1949.353,1974.373,"Well, again, that's why in cases such as Harris of course the defendant can be cross-examined about prior inconsistent statements, a perjury prosecution is proper, and of course the judge can enhance a sentence if in fact the judge believes that the client... or, excuse me... the defendant is going to perjure... or has perjured himself."
1985.84-1321,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1974.373,1984.667,"Well, in this particular case when your client said, I'm going to perjure myself, what redress do you think the lawyer should take?"
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,1984.667,1985.994,Okay.
1985.84-1321,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1990.54,1992.57,"Well, I don't need any facts for my question."
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,1992.57,1994.319,Okay.
1985.84-1321,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1994.319,1995.647,I'd like to get an answer to it.
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,1995.647,1996.101,Okay.
1985.84-1321,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2035.349,2037.036,"And it didn't say that he did not, did it?"
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,2037.036,2038.661,Well--
1985.84-1321,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2038.661,2039.817,It's just silent on it.
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,2039.817,2041.286,"--Well, I think the record--"
1985.84-1321,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2041.286,2042.784,"Well, we'll take a hypothetical."
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,2042.784,2043.253,--Okay.
1985.84-1321,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2043.253,2049.407,"The witness says, I'm going to perjure myself and I'm going to say that I saw a gun."
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,2049.407,2050.204,Okay.
1985.84-1321,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2050.204,2053.981,What can the lawyer do?
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,2056.527,2058.309,Okay.
1985.84-1321,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2069.273,2072.226,"Well, the client says, I'm going to perjure myself."
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,2072.226,2072.476,Okay.
1985.84-1321,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2084.58,2086.985,Or during the trial.
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,2086.985,2088.813,Or during the trial.
1985.84-1321,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2094.949,2097.854,"Well, at the same time as it is in this trial."
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,2097.854,2100.853,"--Okay, which would be shortly before trial?"
1985.84-1321,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2100.853,2101.166,Right.
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,2101.166,2101.963,Okay.
1985.84-1321,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2127.859,2129.327,I'm still asking what he could do.
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,2130.546,2131.155,--Right.
1985.84-1321,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2131.155,2132.53,"Now, what else could he do?"
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,2132.53,2143.213,"Well, if I might explain, the problem with the withdrawal method is that at that point if another attorney is appointed then the client's simply going to tell the attorney the last story."
1985.84-1321,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2143.213,2149.647,What else could an attorney do other than to withdraw?
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,2149.647,2150.1,Okay.
1985.84-1321,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2171.655,2174.857,"Well, did the attorney stop him from testifying here?"
1985.84-1321,1,37909,patrick_reilly_grady,,2174.857,2176.075,--In this particular case?
1985.84-1321,2,17394,brent_r_appel,,3526.938,3529.218,Just briefly.
1985.84-1321,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3579.464,3591.865,"But wouldn't you think this was a relatively rare case, where a lawyer... where the defendant just says, I'm going to commit perjury, and it's so clear?"
1985.84-1321,2,17394,brent_r_appel,,3597.456,3597.769,Sure.
1985.84-1321,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3597.769,3599.847,--you wouldn't be here at all.
1985.84-1321,2,17394,brent_r_appel,,3599.847,3601.299,It's a relatively rare case.
1985.84-1321,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3618.166,3626.837,Or even if the lawyer is himself completely convinced that the story his client is telling is false.
1985.84-1321,2,17394,brent_r_appel,,3626.837,3629.241,--We don't have a disagreement.
