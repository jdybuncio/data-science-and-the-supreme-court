1975.64_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.15,We will hear arguments first this morning in number 64 original the State of New Hampshire against the State of Maine.
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,16.754,20.301,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.64_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,212.752,215.208,"What is that about, one square mile?"
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,215.208,225.775,"Your Honor, the way I have visualized it is that about 2 ½ times the area between the Capital and the Lincoln Memorial."
1975.64_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,225.775,229.076,About 640 acres in a square mile are they?
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,229.076,230.662,"Okay, if that is what it is."
1975.64_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,239.158,247.038,(Inaudible)
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,247.038,254.859,"No, we have made no calculation of the area that we may have lost in the harbor."
1975.64_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,304.677,310.384,(Inaudible)
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,310.384,315.968,"Your Honor, it is merely demonstrative, it is not evidence, it would not be the line that you would adopt in a decree or in anything like that, it is just …"
1975.64_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,315.968,321.022,(Inaudible)
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,321.022,325.138,"Your Honor, it was not the consent decree. It was marked by a range lines …"
1975.64_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,325.138,328.442,(Inaudible)
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,328.442,330.318,It is pretty near that your Honor.
1975.64_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,330.318,334.319,(Inaudible)
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,334.319,337.193,In this river it is the channel of …
1975.64_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,337.193,340.102,Is it incredible
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,340.102,341.9,It maybe incredible sir …
1975.64_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,341.9,344.456,(Inaudible)
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,344.456,345.581,Yes sir and it was based on the …
1975.64_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,345.581,350.635,(Inaudible) that is what you agreed.
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,350.635,353.031,"Your Honor, it is the main ship channel."
1975.64_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,355.994,377.703,"(Inaudible) Is there any question in the case, I noticed New Hampshire is not quite happy with our recent (Inaudible) perhaps it was a time of dismay, but New Hampshire Legislature never did agree with the agreement, did it?"
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,377.703,379.966,"No your Honor, there is not."
1975.64_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,379.966,393.678,"Is there any question of the validity of the Executive of New Hampshire, or I should ask, (Inaudible) question of state law, may have been in agreement of this kind without full legislature?"
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,393.678,407.23,"Your Honor, the position of the State of Maine is that is not an agreement it is merely a suggested judicial resolution, which the Special Master had the power to enter, as the proper exercise of the original jurisdiction."
1975.64_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,407.23,411.505,"It depends, it is not upon the consent of both states."
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,411.505,427.816,"Your Honor, it is not a consent to which both States were bound, as we have seen by the actions and behaviors in the State of New Hampshire in this case to date and neither state is felt bound to enforce it against their citizens or citizens of other States."
1975.64_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,441.373,447.257,"In case of the land, whatever you call it, the center or what -- Jointly submitted by the two States?"
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,447.257,448.362,It is a …
1975.64_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,448.362,451.514,You have that still?
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,451.514,456.364,"It is a line, which the New Hampshire legislature does not agree with and never agreed with it."
1975.64_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,501.733,508.538,"Is the ship channel that you referred to, is it an artificial channel that has been dredged out?"
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,508.538,509.719,I really do not know the answer you Honor.
1975.64_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,511.327,513.37,(Inaudible)
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,513.37,528.48,"It is marked by Bowee Gosport Harbor, it is marked by the range lines in Piscataqua River, which are lights connecting, so that Mariners can determine whether they are on the main channel, as they came in to the river."
1975.64_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,528.48,540.985,Is there any authority from this Court as to whether a proposed consent decree needs the ratification of the legislative branches of the two States?
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,540.985,541.485,Yes your Honor.
1975.64_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,563.928,566.051,That is congressional approval …
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,566.051,568.95,I am sorry …
1975.64_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,568.95,582.051,"I was thinking, in terms of what sort of authorization do counsel representing two States in an original action of this Court need in order to consent?"
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,582.051,602.241,"I think New Hampshire has answered that in its motion to support the jurisdiction of the Special Master, to enter the consent decree, which was filed with the Special Master and I honestly do not have it in my mind the principles, but they have answered that with respect to their authority and determined at that time that their Attorney General did have authority to enter it."
1975.64_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,602.241,618.94,"What if both of the states, the two states entered into the agreement, which you have entered and then move to dismiss the original action by stipulation of both parties, then there would be no original action left, would there?"
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,618.94,620.192,That is right your Honor.
1975.64_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,620.192,636.828,"And, would the terms of that agreement then entered in to between the two States, present problems of enforceability, if citizens of one state or the other elected not to imply with it?"
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,636.828,637.471,"Yes your Honor, I believe …"
1975.64_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,637.471,643.468,That is why you want this Court’s action …
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,643.468,658.08,"Yes your Honor, there is no question that if this agreement was reached outside the context of your exercise of original jurisdiction, that would we have to find congressional approval under Article 1, Section 10 of the Compact Clause."
1975.64_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,742.386,747.278,(Inaudible) that the legislature is taking on it?
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,747.278,750.2,The State of Maine legislature has taken no action.
1975.64_orig,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,764.203,766.079,That means they have done nothing.
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,766.079,770.458,Our legislature has done nothing.
1975.64_orig,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,770.458,782.585,"If the Special Master had accepted the consent decree would the location of the line have been self evident, would the decree itself, have identified the precise location of the …"
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,782.585,792.741,"Yes your Honor, the decree establishes the location of the thalweg and the termination of the thalweg and the straight line portion of the boundary by latitudes and longitudes."
1975.64_orig,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,792.741,797.786,"Mr. Attorney General of New Hampshire, then agreed at one time to the location of the line?"
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,797.786,812.113,"Yes your Honor, in filing that motion for joint judgment, he indicated that “I do not only agree with it, but it was an appropriate application of law and the fact and it was the best interest of the State of New Hampshire at that time.”"
1975.64_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,812.113,820.397,"Could you tell me, what legal principle would support this straight line in the Harbor here?"
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,820.397,825.712,The principle which supports it is the principle of Maine channel or thalweg.
1975.64_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,825.712,830.26,You do not really suggest that on the ground that is what you would find the thalweg?
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,837.151,845.756,"Your Honor, we have agreed to it, but we have agreed to it by reference to charts, which indicate the depths of the water and I understand …"
1975.64_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,845.756,848.094,There is ought to be a straight line like that.
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,848.094,851.287,It turns out to be a relatively straight line.
1975.64_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,851.287,854.334,That is of course that Mainers sail expect.
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,854.334,857.401,"Yes your Honor, it is definitely the course that Mariners sail."
1975.64_orig,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,862.168,865.175,But it does not mean where Mainer’s sail does it?
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,867.102,868.572,The Main part of the channel.
1975.64_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,868.572,874.84,"Mariners sail, what is safe to sail and if a straight line is more convenient, they sail straight line."
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,874.84,884.955,"But, the indication that this is the safest place to sail and therefore the deepest is that the largest vessels that come in to the area, stay right on that range line, all the time they are coming in."
1975.64_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,891.786,898.268,It is deep enough for the largest ships in that line.
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,898.268,901.19,"Yes, your Honor."
1975.64_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,901.19,914.405,You can conclude that the two parties were mistaken in their agreement that this was indeed a thalweg?
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,914.405,915.928,"Yes, your Honor."
1975.64_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,915.928,920.105,The fact that you consented to it would not conclude us from saying …
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,920.105,923.638,"No your Honor, if you decided that …"
1975.64_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,923.638,924.719,This was not the thalweg.
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,924.719,927.109,"The thalweg was the proper principle, but …"
1975.64_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,927.109,933.108,"The consent agreement should be rejected, if what is to be determined."
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,937.956,946.075,"I would agree that the consent decree should be that the Court would have the power and should not maybe project some consent decree, but they should not accept the Master’s line."
1975.64_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,959.185,964.751,(Inaudible) you are going to get the arguing that he adopted their own principle.
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,964.751,965.292,"Yes, I am, your Honor."
1975.64_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,965.292,967.58,I mean wholly aside from the consent decree.
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,967.58,968.057,"Yes, your Honor."
1975.64_orig,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,968.057,969.779,I mean from the consent itself.
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,969.779,977.254,"Right, why I am arguing the consent decree is so hard, because the Master has indicated that if you have jurisdiction to enter it, that you should enter it."
1975.64_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,982.836,986.607,(Inaudible)enter it.
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,986.607,990.349,I think you have exercised your original jurisdiction.
1975.64_orig,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,990.349,995.298,Would we not have to agree that this indeed is in law of the thalweg?
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,995.298,998.275,"You would have jurisdiction, I believe whether you agreed or not."
1975.64_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1009.759,1020.53,Suppose that you concluded that the 1740 or something in history indicated that the thalweg was not the proper basis.
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,1024.911,1025.89,"No, your Honor."
1975.64_orig,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1027.737,1031.241,(Inaudible) as you might have to reject the consent.
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,1031.241,1033.589,"Yes, it might be a reason for rejecting it, you Honor."
1975.64_orig,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1225.754,1228.959,Will you let us have the page citation for finding that?
1975.64_orig,0,21919,edward_bradley,,1228.959,1231.824,I am sorry.
1975.64_orig,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1289.55,1298.551,"Very well, Mr. Upton."
1975.64_orig,1,40656,richard_upton,,1298.551,1302.277,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1975.64_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1344.937,1347.615,"And, you affirmatively support the rest of the Master’s decree?"
1975.64_orig,1,40656,richard_upton,,1347.615,1349.229,"Yes, you Honor."
1975.64_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1349.229,1355.478,Including his decision that the geographic middle is the right division in the river.
1975.64_orig,1,40656,richard_upton,,1355.478,1357.962,You Honor that is our position.
1975.64_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1357.962,1360.967,Although it was not?
1975.64_orig,1,40656,richard_upton,,1360.967,1365.408,"But, the geographic middle, we believe he is correct in this ruling."
1975.64_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1369.554,1373.029,It is a principle or you think that the geographic middle is the right …
1975.64_orig,1,40656,richard_upton,,1373.029,1383.575,We do and in my reply brief I have argued the point strongly as I know how with citations to the proceedings of the Boundary Commissioners in the appendix.
1975.64_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1386.549,1391.803,Is it your position or what is you position?
1975.64_orig,1,40656,richard_upton,,1398.347,1398.881,I think that.
1975.64_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1409.878,1420.529,"Having decided that the geographic middle is the correct legal principle historically in this situation, do you think that the states were then, disentitled to agree otherwise?"
1975.64_orig,1,40656,richard_upton,,1420.529,1426.37,"I think, now we got the Master’s findings on that we never tried to agree on this point in our agreement."
1975.64_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1429.69,1433.479,"Does the basis for the agreement, falls out, the agreement falls at."
1975.64_orig,1,40656,richard_upton,,1433.479,1433.987,"Yes, your Honor."
1975.64_orig,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1433.987,1439.675,There was not your legislature approval --
1975.64_orig,1,40656,richard_upton,,1439.675,1442.445,That is our position.
1975.64_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1486.501,1500.689,"Get the chart which is appended to your exceptions in brief, filed December 23, where are these Whaleback Reef rock?"
1975.64_orig,1,40656,richard_upton,,1500.689,1521.652,"Number three you Honor, the black ink is the Whaleback Reef, Figure 3, just to the left of the line marked, closing line of harbor."
1975.64_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1521.652,1524.534,"I do not see, but the line does not go from there, though."
1975.64_orig,1,40656,richard_upton,,1524.534,1550.125,"No, but we are informed that the Master -- see in the footnote on pages 42 and 43 of the Master’s report, bottom of page 42."
1975.64_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1574.106,1576.629,(Inaudible) headlight point.
1975.64_orig,1,40656,richard_upton,,1576.629,1577.228,"No, you Honor."
1975.64_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1580.562,1591.511,"I see, and this chart shows, as I understand, that the difference in the boundary line that would result."
1975.64_orig,1,40656,richard_upton,,1592.776,1593.942,If I am correct.
1975.64_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1597.783,1598.799,"Points A and B, then."
1975.64_orig,1,40656,richard_upton,,1598.799,1609.409,"350 yards, it makes a difference, because it deflects the straight line boundary all the way from there up to the Isle of Shoals, a distance of 6 miles."
1975.64_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1615.995,1617.086,Are they parallel?
1975.64_orig,1,40656,richard_upton,,1617.086,1617.705,"No, they are not."
1975.64_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1629.638,1643.494,"Mr. Upton, before you start, since you are interrupted, I am kind of new on this kind of litigation, what is the standard of review that we should apply in deciding how grossly err, the Master must be before we take another look?"
1975.64_orig,1,40656,richard_upton,,1643.494,1648.912,"As I view it, the Master’s report is entitled to a strong presumption of correctness."
1975.64_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1648.912,1653.482,It is not enough for you merely to persuade us that he might have done a better job.
1975.64_orig,1,40656,richard_upton,,1653.482,1658.862,"If he committed an error of law, of course questions of law may always be corrected in this Court."
1975.64_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1658.862,1670.434,"I did not understand you to contend that it would never in any situation be appropriate to use this projections, low water projections, whatever they are called, or are you just saying that this particular case it is inappropriate."
1975.64_orig,1,40656,richard_upton,,1670.434,1686.247,"I say your Honor, that it is contrary to any of the precedent in the National law that I have been able to find its contrary to the holdings of all, the writers in this field we have cited in pages 7 to 9 about brief and it is contrary to the holdings of this Court in United States versus Louisiana."
1975.64_orig,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1686.247,1693.764,"Were those holdings in particular bad situations or do you read those saying as a matter of law, it is never appropriate to use this kind of reference?"
1975.64_orig,1,40656,richard_upton,,1693.764,1718.67,"Your honor, One of the tests they use is that proposed by Mr. Badge, a former geographer of the State Department to draw a parallel lines at the end of each off shore formation to the shore and if the amount of water area between the island or off shore formation and the shore is greater than the off shore formation, then it cannot be assimilated to the shore and used as a point of reference."
1975.64_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2036.925,2041.279,Was that just a resolution by your legislature or was it approved by the Governor?
1975.64_orig,1,40656,richard_upton,,2041.279,2047.125,"That one, you Honor, was a law, which passed and was approved by the Governor, the one I just quoted."
1975.64_orig,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2056.993,2058.725,Some 200 miles out to sea.
1975.64_orig,1,40656,richard_upton,,2058.725,2063.476,"That was the next section of that chapter, Your Honor."
1975.64_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2063.476,2073.072,"When you entered into the compromised agreement, I take it that those who were acting on behalf of the State of New Hampshire felt it was consistent with that first act of the New Hampshire"
1975.64_orig,1,40656,richard_upton,,2073.072,2083.373,"We felt that it could only be made consistent your Honor, if this Court approved it and adopted it and made it a judgment of this Court and that case it came within the exception of the statute."
1975.64_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2083.373,2093.75,"And, of course you do not know whether this Court will approve it or adopt it until you have submitted it to the Master, he in turn has submitted to the Court and this Court has decided one way or the other, I suppose."
1975.64_orig,1,40656,richard_upton,,2093.75,2105.364,"That is correct your Honor, the matter rests in the hands of this Court at this moment, because you do have the power, I believe if you find that as a law to enter the consent decree."
1975.64_orig,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2105.364,2115.386,"Well, in a sense, it is like a stipulation, we settle it, personal entry claim where two lawyers get together and agree and they have to submit it to the Court."
1975.64_orig,1,40656,richard_upton,,2121.171,2129.597,"That is true, although in the case of a personal entry case, the parties have the power to make such a settlement without the intervention of the Court."
1975.64_orig,2,21919,edward_bradley,,2886.809,2908.003,"I would like to refer briefly to the questions that were raised with respect to whether a factual determination is required in determining whether these low tide elevations, the Special Master used qualified for the test under the Geneva Convention."
1975.64_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3083.792,3099.614,"If we were to agree on geographic middle, are you suggesting that on this record that would be inappropriate without Maine having a further opportunity, to have a determination of inland waters?"
1975.64_orig,2,21919,edward_bradley,,3099.614,3100.972,"Your Honor, we never had the opportunity …"
1975.64_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3100.972,3103.406,Is that what you are arguing?
1975.64_orig,2,21919,edward_bradley,,3103.406,3110.635,"I am arguing that we should have a determination of hearing on geographic middle, on inland waters and also, the rejection of thalweg."
1975.64_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3110.635,3115.419,What relevance this determination of inland waters have on the determination of geographic middle?
1975.64_orig,2,21919,edward_bradley,,3115.419,3125.842,The Master felt that he had to determine the location of the geographic middle by a closing line across inland waters to determine the end point of the straight line terminates to the boundary.
1975.64_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3125.842,3134.446,"You said, you might be able to persuade them to the contrary as to the closing line, which then would have an effect on the location of the geographic middle?"
1975.64_orig,2,21919,edward_bradley,,3134.446,3141.873,"No, I am only saying that if you choose the principles we adopted in our judgment for consent decree, it is unnecessary to determine the extent of inland waters."
1975.64_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3144.506,3146.725,I will disagree with you on that.
1975.64_orig,2,21919,edward_bradley,,3146.725,3148.048,If you disagree with us …
1975.64_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3148.048,3152.542,On the principles on which you have based the consent decree.
1975.64_orig,2,21919,edward_bradley,,3152.542,3157.521,"Then, if you do, Your Honor, I believe that you should send it back to the Special Master for determination."
1975.64_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3162.068,3164.146,What is it you wanted to know?
1975.64_orig,2,21919,edward_bradley,,3164.146,3164.78,I have suggested …
1975.64_orig,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3164.78,3168.531,We disagree with the principles on which the consent agreement.
1975.64_orig,2,21919,edward_bradley,,3168.531,3172.793,I am suggesting your Honor that you do not have the proper development of the case at this point.
1975.64_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3195.943,3199.259,"(Inaudible) for the Special Master, did you?"
1975.64_orig,2,21919,edward_bradley,,3199.259,3200.849,"Yes we did, with respect to the …"
1975.64_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3200.849,3209.077,"And, I suppose the purpose for stipulating it was to help him in determining whether he should accept or reject your consent decree."
1975.64_orig,2,21919,edward_bradley,,3209.077,3227.243,"Just the concept of thalweg your Honor, I had nothing to do with the concept that he ultimately adopted and we believe that if he is going to not only reject our consent decree, but adopt an entirely new principle that we ought to have an opportunity to present our case with respect to whether that is appropriate or not."
1975.64_orig,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3227.243,3240.902,"You said that the only trial you had was basically a truncated one devoted to the authorization for the consent decree, rather than a fight on the merits."
1975.64_orig,2,21919,edward_bradley,,3240.902,3241.366,"Yes, your Honor."
1975.64_orig,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3257.176,3267.403,"You do not think that there is enough on the record for the Master to have not only rejected the consent decree and do have said, “I will not accept the thalweg as the principle for division.”"
1975.64_orig,2,21919,edward_bradley,,3271.484,3274.0,"Yes, your honor."
1975.64_orig,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3274.0,3276.409,(Inaudible) evidence is used or argued?
1975.64_orig,2,21919,edward_bradley,,3276.409,3279.045,"No sir, I want to go back through the documents."
1975.64_orig,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3281.773,3288.066,"My brother Brennan tried to get from you what you wanted to present, as of now."
1975.64_orig,2,21919,edward_bradley,,3288.066,3294.26,"As of right now, I do not have a full -- we have not develop the cases entirely as it should have been to this point."
1975.64_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3304.667,3305.94,"But, Mr. Bradley, let me understand."
1975.64_orig,2,21919,edward_bradley,,3319.968,3320.416,"No, your Honor."
1975.64_orig,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3323.227,3324.338,He has the right line.
1975.64_orig,2,21919,edward_bradley,,3324.338,3328.586,He has the right line.
1975.64_orig,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3330.497,3330.944,Thank you.
