1995.95-323,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.906,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 95-323, United States v. Thomas R. Noland."
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,10.088,16.172,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1995.95-323,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,163.918,180.839,"Mr. Jones, do you agree that a tax penalty claim in theory could be subordinated if there were some sufficient reason for finding fault with the Government... misconduct?"
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,180.839,184.753,I agree that the principles of equitable subordination can apply to all claims.
1995.95-323,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,209.987,223.237,"Yes, but I took your position basically to be that in a particular case, no equitable subordination absent a showing of inequitable conduct."
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,223.237,224.309,--That is correct.
1995.95-323,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,225.939,229.011,And in theory the Government could engage in such conduct.
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,229.011,231.212,"--In theory, it could."
1995.95-323,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,245.351,263.954,"Of course, those of us who look to legislative history have got one problem from your standpoint, and that is, it may be that the person who made the statement about the intent was wrong in describing what courts had been doing, but the intent still seems to be there, and what is the tie breaker?"
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,269.027,281.814,"Well, let me... that is... the court of appeals relied on what you're referring to, which is a fragment of a single sentence of the floor statements of the sponsors of the bill, but let's consider that statement in its context."
1995.95-323,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,350.171,360.028,But isn't there also a statement in that report that is not simply case law frozen as of a point in time but case law as further developed?
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,360.028,385.493,"We certainly agree that when Congress codified these principles it intended for the courts to continue developing them, and it is appropriate for the courts to continue devising rules that guard against creditor misconduct and that deprive the wrongdoer of the fruits of its wrong, but nothing in those ordinary, equitable principles provide any support for the novel contention that a court in equity can simply disregard a statute that it disagrees with."
1995.95-323,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,404.524,408.598,"The same statement, Mr. Jones, appears... I mean, it was obviously carefully drawn up."
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,412.541,414.562,"That is my understanding, yes."
1995.95-323,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,414.562,417.073,"I mean, it's almost like a committee report."
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,424.019,429.082,And in both statements what they say is that this is what existing case law does.
1995.95-323,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,430.243,431.705,"--That's a mistake, but--"
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,431.705,431.925,--Yes.
1995.95-323,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,431.925,442.044,"--insofar as it shows what the expectation or the intent of Congress is concerned, it seems to Congress expected and intended that a penalty would be subject to this doctrine."
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,450.038,468.009,"I think read in its entirety, which, of course, if we're going to read the legislative history we have to do that, read in its entirety, what the history manifests is an intent to incorporate existing case law and then a misdescription of one aspect of that case law."
1995.95-323,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,500.47,513.328,"Before you do, Mr. Jones, could you give us an example of the rare case in which a tax penalty claim could be subordinated, and you quoted the legislative history to that effect."
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,515.341,516.119,Yes.
1995.95-323,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,516.119,519.052,--and I was trying to envision such a case and couldn't come up with one.
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,519.052,536.713,"Well, the situation that would exist with respect to private creditors is a situation where the claim was obtained by fraud or by ruse, or was obtained through some unfair manipulation of the bankruptcy process."
1995.95-323,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,546.159,557.666,"Well, what about a case in which some factotum of the Government said the payment, let's say to an ERISA plan or whatever it may be, is due in January, and in fact it was due in December and the Government is not estopped?"
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,572.506,580.042,"I certainly believe that there are situations that could occur, and I'm obviously not here to try to anticipate all of them."
1995.95-323,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,689.835,696.097,"Mr. Jones, am I correct that every lower court that has confronted this issue has come out the way the court came out here?"
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,696.097,707.026,"No... well, there has been a recent set of cases that have said equitable subordination doesn't require proof of creditor misconduct."
1995.95-323,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,714.839,728.448,"I mean, under this statutory provision, under the provision we're dealing with here, is there any case that comes out the way you say this case should come out, denying the subordination on the grounds that the statute says otherwise?"
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,730.401,744.579,"Since the enactment of the Bankruptcy Code, I believe that the courts of appeals that have addressed this issue have agreed with the proposition that we don't agree with, and that proposition is that this fragment in the Senate... in the floor statement changed the law when Congress said they were intending to--"
1995.95-323,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,744.579,749.942,"--Well, of course, it isn't just the... the concurring opinion didn't rely on that in the court below, am I correct?"
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,752.043,756.657,"--Well, the concurring opinion I don't think ultimately reached the question that we're reaching here."
1995.95-323,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,762.702,763.863,And did apply in this case.
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,763.863,765.013,"--And did apply, but I mean... but--"
1995.95-323,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,765.013,767.534,So she didn't read that as requiring creditor misconduct.
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,767.534,775.739,--The point of the... you and I might draw different understandings of the concurring opinion.
1995.95-323,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,781.324,782.223,Yes.
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,782.223,782.724,And we--
1995.95-323,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,782.724,783.445,She joined the judgment.
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,783.445,784.955,"--She joined the judgment, and--"
1995.95-323,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,784.955,786.537,And she did not rely on legislative history.
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,788.748,794.222,"--I didn't understand that she specifically discussed the question of how it applied, she was--"
1995.95-323,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,794.222,794.472,Well--
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,794.472,796.302,--addressing the question of whether it applied.
1995.95-323,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,796.302,799.485,"--How did she get to join the judgment if she didn't... you know, if she agreed with you?"
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,799.485,803.317,"The court perceived... no, she... I didn't mean to say she agreed with us."
1995.95-323,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,837.829,841.012,"But she didn't have to discuss it, because she held that it did apply."
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,841.012,844.194,"Well, she certainly didn't disagree with anything that the panel--"
1995.95-323,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,844.194,852.101,"No, but her basic point, as I read it, the reason she wrote was she didn't think it was necessary to look at legislative history because she thought the plain language of the statute covered the case."
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,852.101,854.572,--I think that--
1995.95-323,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,854.572,855.451,That's why I thought she wrote separately.
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,855.451,861.384,"--Justice Stevens, I don't mean to be arguing with you or quibbling with you, I just had a slightly different perception of what point she was addressing."
1995.95-323,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,861.384,867.829,"What is your position... all right, everyone seems to agree that principles of equitable subordination apply."
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,870.401,870.651,That's correct.
1995.95-323,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,870.651,871.663,What are those principles?
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,871.663,871.993,Those principles--
1995.95-323,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,871.993,872.434,"Yes, all right."
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,899.311,900.159,--I--
1995.95-323,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,900.159,907.295,"So is the... is it your view that, no matter what, if you didn't do something bad and you're a creditor you cannot be equitably subordinated?"
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,907.295,913.059,--That is a precise statement not only of our position but of this Court's position in the Comstock case.
1995.95-323,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,913.059,913.3,All right.
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,953.796,960.882,"Justice Breyer, I think that you have the timing and the courts wrong in your description of those two cases."
1995.95-323,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,962.932,963.213,Yes.
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,963.213,979.511,"--and it held that the doctrine is designed to deprive the wrongdoer of the fruits of his wrong, and that every case prior to the Bankruptcy Code held the same thing, except there was a Second Circuit decision that you were referring to involving the subordination of a shareholder's claim against the corporation."
1995.95-323,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1006.749,1009.533,Brought as shareholder as opposed to brought as creditor?
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1009.533,1016.228,"Yes, sir, brought in their capacity as a shareholder is a shareholder interest which is the last to be paid."
1995.95-323,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1022.623,1023.294,Let's assume you're right about it.
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1024.055,1026.236,"No, sir, I--"
1995.95-323,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1026.236,1026.586,Well--
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1026.586,1029.508,--Stirling Homex is the case we're talking about.
1995.95-323,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1029.508,1029.689,--Yes.
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1029.689,1032.108,The reasoning in Stirling Homex--
1995.95-323,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1032.108,1032.509,Stirling Homex.
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1032.509,1042.144,"--that was manifestly incorrect is, you will notice toward the end of the court of appeals opinion in that case they relied on a bill that had been past the House."
1995.95-323,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1089.285,1091.248,It always... let's assume it always has been.
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1120.256,1121.288,"--Justice Breyer, we--"
1995.95-323,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1121.288,1124.63,"And so there could be a case... I mean, there could be a case."
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1126.06,1153.418,"--Justice Breyer, we agree completely that what the courts are disposed to continue to develop are the principles of equitable subordination, and we don't think that developing them would be to take a doctrine that all understand at the time of its incorporation into the code was based solely on creditor misconduct and specifically did not permit courts to disregard priorities it agreed with, and then, quote, develop this doctrine into a polar opposite, which is what we've ended up with in the court."
1995.95-323,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1153.418,1164.194,"--What the court here says is that the doctrine didn't develop into this area before the code, because before the code nonpecuniary loss tax penalties did not exist--"
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1164.194,1165.156,"Well, that's--"
1995.95-323,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1165.156,1166.195,--and that's how they explained--
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1166.195,1166.515,--No--
1995.95-323,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1166.515,1168.368,--the lack of any pre code development.
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1168.368,1180.915,"--Justice Scalia, they said that pre... well, I'll accept that terminology didn't exist, but actually what had happened were the decisions of this Court, three decisions of this Court."
1995.95-323,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1292.339,1298.494,The answer to Justice Scalia was that prepetition tax penalties were out of the queue--
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1298.494,1299.263,--Were not allowed.
1995.95-323,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1299.263,1300.184,--the absolute bottom.
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1300.184,1300.565,They weren't--
1995.95-323,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1300.565,1302.636,The postpetition tax penalties were Number 1.
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1302.636,1303.176,--Number 1.
1995.95-323,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1303.176,1311.602,"All right, so then that supports an argument that, sure, creditor misconduct is perhaps not always required."
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1318.206,1319.868,"Here, it's not--"
1995.95-323,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1319.868,1322.84,"Is that... I mean, I'm making work because I'm interested in that aspect of it."
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1322.84,1328.534,"--As I will discuss in the next case to be argued, we think the principles of equitable subordination are the same in both contexts."
1995.95-323,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1329.455,1343.433,"Well, if they're the same, it's pretty weird that Congress, without even mentioning it or thinking about it, where there's a prepetition tax penalty would have decided without saying a word to jump them from the absolute bottom, behind shareholders, to absolute Number 1--"
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1343.433,1343.774,--Oh--
1995.95-323,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1343.774,1348.326,"--without any mood... room for flexibility, because that would be the effect of it, prepetition."
1995.95-323,0,33864,kent_l_jones,,1348.326,1352.089,--They didn't jump prepetition tax penalty claims from bottom to Number 1.
1995.95-323,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1405.204,1406.596,"Very well, Mr. Jones."
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,1408.586,1416.061,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1995.95-323,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1554.67,1561.145,"Mr. Pikna, the problem that I have in the case is a very broad conceptual one."
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,1630.922,1634.585,"Your Honor, this is not a categorical rewriting of the statute."
1995.95-323,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1639.388,1649.082,"Yes, but the individual elements determine what goes into the category, and you are saying that certain category members should not be given the priority that their categories give them."
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,1649.082,1657.788,"--Your Honor, we're merely saying that in order to evaluate equitable subordination, one of the elements which a test may consider is the nature of the claim."
1995.95-323,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1660.332,1664.372,"And Congress considered the nature of the claim when it established the categories, didn't it?"
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,1664.372,1665.363,"--It did, Your Honor."
1995.95-323,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1665.363,1670.556,"I mean, this isn't something that Congress a) overlooked, or b) could not provide for."
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,1670.556,1684.566,"Your Honor, if we were to take the position that Congress, by establishing categories, determines definitively the priority to be accorded, then Congress has stated that general unsecured claims are to be paid in order of distribution under 726."
1995.95-323,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1684.566,1686.568,"No, but one doesn't say that, and that's not what the Government is saying."
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,1723.681,1733.068,"Your Honor, if the court ruling were that all nonpecuniary loss tax penalty claims are automatically subordinated without more, we would agree that there is a new--"
1995.95-323,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1733.068,1748.208,"Well, you're just saying we're only going to attack a portion of the category rather than the whole category, but it's still a category mistake, in effect, that you're claiming on Congress' part, and at least a partial categorical reordering that you're claiming for the court's authority under the statute."
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,1748.208,1756.793,"--Your Honor, it is a category, if the Court seeks to call it that, in the same sense that claims that were arising through misconduct are categories."
1995.95-323,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1756.793,1769.861,"But the distinction is that each misconduct claim is judged on its merits as a particular misconduct claim, and it is the kind of claim that simply cannot be provided for any more precisely in advance."
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,1795.529,1815.291,"Your Honor, the nonpecuniary loss tax penalties we agree are fundamentally different from pecuniary loss tax penalty claims, and we believe that in the context of administrative expense claims Congress chose not to expressly draw the distinction because the vast majority of cases that are filed are not just Chapter 11 cases."
1995.95-323,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1821.045,1825.978,"No, but I think... with respect, I think your answer doesn't go to my categorical problem."
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,1850.705,1855.199,"Your Honor, that would be a much broader statute which would permit the courts to--"
1995.95-323,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1855.199,1858.72,"We would be citing Schechter if that had been the case, wouldn't we?"
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,1858.72,1862.503,"--Your Honor, I don't recall which case specifically, but that would permit... that would eliminate the statute at that point."
1995.95-323,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1862.503,1875.181,"That's right, and it seems to me that to a degree, the degree being only the one category that you're arguing about, that is what you are arguing that the courts are able to do in this case."
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,1875.181,1876.002,Your Honor--
1995.95-323,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1876.002,1880.464,It seems to me an example of what we both agree would have been improper.
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,1880.464,1896.824,"--Your Honor, it is an example of one part of the test of the elements of equitable subordination that we believe it is appropriate for courts to consider, and the reason... the courts have already recognized that penalties by their very nature are punitive."
1995.95-323,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1914.775,1951.15,"Mr. Pikna, the first item under any tax, under 503, is any fine, so Congress was certainly thinking in terms of penalty, so we have fine, and then penalty, and you are not urging any... in any case, where there was a fine or a penalty, on your theory wouldn't there be equitable subordination as long as the State didn't have enough to pay all the general creditors?"
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,1951.15,1953.561,"No, Your Honor, we're not urging that position."
1995.95-323,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1953.561,1964.04,"Well, give me a circumstance in which the estate does not have enough money to go around, that has been a nonpecuniary tax penalty."
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,1968.351,1999.382,"Your Honor, if, for instance, the postpetition claims in a case are $1 million, all of the postpetition claims, and the nonpecuniary loss tax penalty claims are perhaps $10,000, a very small portion, and if there is a small amount of funds to distribute, perhaps $100,000 in the case, the impact of the nonpecuniary loss tax penalties relative to the other claims that are recognized is de minimis, and that is the concept that was in part adopted by the majority in Nicholas v. United States."
1995.95-323,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2000.822,2007.817,"So if it's a small penalty it comes out in top and the Government gets it, but if it's a large penalty the Government doesn't?"
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2007.817,2008.398,--Your Honor--
1995.95-323,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2008.398,2011.05,"The same thing with a fine, a small fine, the Government--"
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2011.05,2011.989,"--Those are some of the factors, Your Honor."
1995.95-323,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2013.521,2019.415,"--Well, could one bankruptcy court decide a case like that one way, and another bankruptcy court decide the case the other way?"
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2023.319,2037.006,"Your Honor, equitable subordination by its nature requires that the court exercise its discretion, and if one court views the discretion to be applied in a different manner than another court, it's possible that the same fact pattern could result in two different outcomes."
1995.95-323,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2037.006,2042.362,"So we'd have different outcomes all over the country, depending on the judgment of individual bankruptcy judges?"
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2042.362,2062.864,"It's possible, but it's unlikely, Your Honor, and we do not believe it is likely because we believe that the courts of appeal will establish standards as they have generally, and the courts of appeal are uniform in their position that nonpecuniary loss tax penalty claims do not require misconduct as a necessary element in order to reach the subordination question."
1995.95-323,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2062.864,2067.617,"Do you have any other exceptions, other than de minimis, which I don't consider much of an exception."
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2069.887,2070.648,Your Honor--
1995.95-323,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2070.648,2072.139,De minimis non corat lex.
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2073.71,2074.502,--Your Honor--
1995.95-323,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2074.502,2075.393,That applies across the board.
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2081.097,2082.126,"--No, Your Honor."
1995.95-323,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2082.126,2086.4,"It is the fineness that causes the subordination, isn't that right?"
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2086.4,2087.371,"Not totally, Your Honor."
1995.95-323,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2087.51,2087.84,What else?
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2087.84,2096.445,"--in a reorganization context, if the company is in Chapter 11 and operating, there may not be a reason to subordinate penalties even though they are punitive by nature."
1995.95-323,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2102.599,2109.454,"Mr. Pikna, do you say that because in the Chapter 11 the company may survive, may come out?"
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2120.211,2125.076,"Your Honor, if there's not enough to go around the creditors would have to vote for the plan."
1995.95-323,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2131.871,2136.674,"So what I don't understand on your theory is, in a case where we know there is not enough to go around--"
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2136.674,2138.053,Your Honor--
1995.95-323,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2138.053,2148.551,"--like your Chapter 7 case, is there any situation in which a fine would not be subordinated, a fine or a penalty, nonpecuniary penalty would not be subordinated to the claims of the general creditors?"
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2148.551,2152.883,"--Your Honor, an environmental fine may be an example of such a fine or penalty."
1995.95-323,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2165.551,2172.907,Then the court just decides for itself what types of claims are very important and what are less important?
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2172.907,2184.754,"Your Honor, it does that through reviewing other decisions of higher courts and through the policy expressed through the Congress through its enactments, through the statutes, and through the legislative history they can review."
1995.95-323,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2184.754,2200.303,"What if Congress has made different findings... you know, I think Congress probably thinks that most of its laws are pretty important and deserve priority, and the bankruptcy court just sorts it out depending on the recital at the beginning of the statute as to how important it is?"
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2200.303,2205.737,"Your Honor, the bankruptcy court has to consider all of the claims, not just the Federal claims."
1995.95-323,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2214.194,2222.349,"You can correct me, but I find it hard to imagine any policy that has traditionally been considered stronger than the policy of collecting taxes."
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2235.837,2237.339,"--Your Honor, we believe that--"
1995.95-323,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2237.339,2238.539,Do you think the environment's more important?
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2238.539,2239.43,--Your Honor--
1995.95-323,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2239.43,2240.969,I'm no sure our cases would support that.
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2240.969,2242.511,"--Your Honor, I use--"
1995.95-323,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2242.511,2243.152,For better or worse.
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2243.152,2244.282,--I understand.
1995.95-323,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2244.282,2245.654,But that's what our cases seem to say.
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2247.243,2250.286,"Your Honor, we express that as an example."
1995.95-323,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2271.84,2293.844,"Can you just answer two technical questions that I... one was Justice Scalia's initial question, which the Government said... is this correct, do you agree with the Government in this, and do I understand this correctly that, prior to the Bankruptcy Code a penalty on a postpetition tax did, in fact, receive a first priority?"
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2293.844,2295.276,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-323,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2295.276,2295.517,All right.
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2362.779,2368.603,"Your Honor, the subordination provisions are applicable in all chapters."
1995.95-323,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2387.576,2413.103,"All I'm trying to do is to explore if there's any circumstance, other than de minimis, in which it would make sense, given all the equitable authority in the world, to subordinate a postpetition tax penalty, and I'm struggling to think if there's any such circumstance, and so far, given your answers, I think the answer is no, there is no such circumstance that would be special."
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2428.182,2432.904,"Your Honor, it will also vary on the nature of the debtor and who bears the penalty."
1995.95-323,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2560.58,2561.771,But isn't that always the case?
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2573.938,2575.14,"No, Your Honor, because--"
1995.95-323,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2575.14,2579.384,"Isn't a fine relating to a nonpayment of tax, isn't it always going to come from the creditors?"
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2579.384,2588.169,"--Your Honor, a fine may, but 503 applies to not just liquidation cases, it applies to Chapter 9, Chapter 13, Chapter 11, Chapter 12, all cases in which the debtor operates."
1995.95-323,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2595.132,2600.746,"Those other cases, when you take the money away from the debtor you're effectively taking it away from the creditors."
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2604.499,2605.42,"--That's true, Your Honor."
1995.95-323,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2605.901,2606.369,So--
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2606.369,2611.264,"--there is operating, and when it's operating, it should be punished for what it is doing wrong."
1995.95-323,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2613.084,2613.405,--I see.
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2625.322,2634.719,"Your Honor, it's being taken away, we recognize that, but we believe that there is certainly a vital distinction in the liquidation context, and the--"
1995.95-323,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2634.719,2635.29,You're saying--
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2648.577,2650.219,"--That's not totally correct, Your Honor."
1995.95-323,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2659.484,2663.307,"Yes, but we're not concerned with priorities, are we, at that stage?"
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2663.307,2671.671,"--Your Honor, we are in the sense that you can only pay during the operation costs and expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business, and that's what 503(b) states."
1995.95-323,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2763.274,2766.274,"That wasn't the factor emphasized by the Court in those cases, was it?"
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2768.875,2784.036,"--Your Honor, the factor that was emphasized by the Court was misconduct in a... in terms of trying to promote its claim for financial loss ahead of other claims for financial loss, but from that there was a silence on nonpecuniary loss claims."
1995.95-323,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2789.739,2794.874,"Well, is there any suggestion in those cases that that sort of a distinction would have been made by those courts?"
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2794.874,2832.888,"Your Honor, we do not believe that particular concept was addressed, other than, in Pepper v. Litton the Court recognized the broad equitable powers of bankruptcy courts to adjust the debtor creditor relationship, and that same policy has also been recognized by this Court in the energy resources case when, in dealing with the context of trust fund taxes, this Court recognized in an operating Chapter 11 case the importance of permitting the designation of the responsible officer type of trust fund taxes to be paid ahead of the nonresponsible officer types of taxes and interest."
1995.95-323,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2832.888,2844.085,"Mr. Pikna, it does appear that the Members of Congress had in mind the requirement of misconduct as a principle of equitable subordination, doesn't it?"
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2844.085,2848.399,"Your Honor, that is one of at least two or three things that Congress had in mind."
1995.95-323,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2915.211,2921.376,"Well, misconduct comes in through the language of 510(c), where it says, principles of equitable subordination, doesn't it--"
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2921.376,2922.157,"Yes, Your Honor."
1995.95-323,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2922.157,2928.281,"--because it was those principles, the misconduct, that had been the dominant theme of those three cases that you referred to."
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2928.281,2932.385,"Yes, Your Honor, that comes in, but that is not a limitation, that is an example."
1995.95-323,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2937.988,2954.878,"Yes, but certainly in each of those three cases it seemed to me when I read them that the stress was on the conduct of a particular individual in pursuing the claim, not on any general transposition of the priorities that had been given by Congress."
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2954.878,2960.362,"Your Honor, they were looking at the conduct, but those were the facts presented in that case."
1995.95-323,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2977.563,2979.015,And the statute said that.
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2979.015,2980.364,"Yes, Your Honor, it did."
1995.95-323,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2980.364,2984.778,"Well, so that really isn't much of a precedent for your argument here."
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,2988.29,2999.107,"Your Honor, the statute said that, but the Court interpreted the statute, and in interpreting the statute stated that all penalties... it did not just say these particular nonpecuniary loss tax penalties, and that is the critical theme."
1995.95-323,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3076.388,3086.934,"Well, it won't help the creditors in that case, but future trustees will know that by not paying taxes they're not going to make more money available to the creditors."
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,3088.126,3089.245,Your Honor--
1995.95-323,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3089.245,3090.156,Which is worthwhile.
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,3090.156,3095.019,"--Your Honor, it is not the trustees, it is the officers of the corporation."
1995.95-323,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3095.019,3095.61,"Thank you, Mr. Pikna."
1995.95-323,1,40145,raymond_j_pikna,,3097.322,3097.573,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1995.95-323,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3097.573,3100.795,"Mr. Jones, you have 5 minutes remaining."
1995.95-323,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3112.212,3123.259,"A choice in the sense that each are liable separately, but when either pays, it reduces the liability of the others."
1995.95-323,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3130.475,3136.867,"I take it if you went after the officer, he'd then be just a general unsecured creditor against the corporation."
1995.95-323,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3136.867,3139.889,--Congress has dealt with that specifically.
1995.95-323,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3146.905,3147.115,No.
1995.95-323,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3151.546,3151.917,Yes.
1995.95-323,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3151.917,3157.052,Does that officer then become a general unsecured creditor against the corporation for having paid the corporate--
1995.95-323,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3157.052,3161.072,I frankly don't know whether the officer... what the nature of the officer's claim against the corporation would be.
1995.95-323,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3164.345,3169.267,--The argument was there's no incentive because the penalty isn't passed through.
1995.95-323,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3169.267,3177.335,"Well, the penalty that's been discussed, the responsible officer penalty, only applies in narrow... in particular situations."
1995.95-323,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3183.767,3192.883,"But I understood that the officer's not liable for the penalty, and counsel's point, counsel for the respondents, said, well, there's no incentive here because the officer is never liable for the penalty."
1995.95-323,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3192.883,3195.845,"Oh, for the tax penalty."
1995.95-323,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3195.845,3196.105,Yes.
1995.95-323,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3196.105,3197.557,"Well, certainly for the... yes, that's correct."
1995.95-323,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3198.439,3198.819,Yes.
1995.95-323,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3198.819,3201.68,For the late payment or the underpayment penalties--
1995.95-323,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3201.68,3202.071,Only the corporation is--
1995.95-323,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3202.071,3204.551,--Only the corporation would be liable for those penalties.
1995.95-323,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3214.348,3220.052,"--So the point was that there was no inducement, or no incentive, because the officer's never going to be liable for the penalty anyway."
1995.95-323,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3220.052,3236.922,"Well, this Court addressed, of course, the question of whether this is a fair result in the Nicholas case, and the Court said that the first priority for postpetition tax penalties is necessary to ensure that the debtors abide by the same rules that all other people conducting business abide by."
1995.95-323,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3273.637,3278.101,"He's identified, I take it, not this case but a very unusual situation."
1995.95-323,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3313.682,3314.313,I may--
1995.95-323,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3314.313,3317.055,"Now, that's what I'd raised before because I got that somehow out of the briefs."
1995.95-323,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3317.796,3325.59,"--I heard you ask that question, and even hearing you describe it again I'm not 100 percent sure I understand the question, but let me tell you what I think the answer is as I understand it."
1995.95-323,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3326.761,3327.512,"--Well, maybe I don't... yes."
1995.95-323,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3327.512,3329.073,--If you're in a Chapter 11--
1995.95-323,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3329.073,3329.373,Yes.
1995.95-323,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3329.373,3336.198,"--And the question is, can you get unanimity, and the answer is no, but is there some way to cram it down?"
1995.95-323,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3355.269,3355.52,Right.
1995.95-323,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3355.52,3358.352,"In an 11, the court has to recognize it, too."
1995.95-323,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3358.352,3365.267,"Right, and that's why what the bankruptcy trustee wants to say, well, were I in a 7, I'd take the $10 million and put it at the end of the queue."
1995.95-323,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3365.267,3366.178,"No, but you can't do that."
1995.95-323,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3366.178,3369.29,"I have that power, and therefore I don't have to count it against--"
1995.95-323,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3369.29,3374.363,"You don't have that power in a 7, because in a 7 we're talking about postpetition tax penalties."
1995.95-323,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3377.696,3379.706,--Unless they could be equitably subordinated--
1995.95-323,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3379.706,3379.937,Well--
1995.95-323,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3379.937,3382.548,"--but that's... see, what I'm trying to do is to find--"
1995.95-323,2,33864,kent_l_jones,,3382.548,3384.518,"--If they could be equitably subordinated, I agree."
1995.95-323,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3393.537,3395.46,"Thank you, Mr. Jones."
