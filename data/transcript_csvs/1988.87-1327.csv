1988.87-1327,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.762,"We'll hear argument next in No. 87-1327, the Cotton Petroleum Corporation v. New Mexico."
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,46.513,50.278,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1327,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,116.329,129.246,"Mr. Israel, the New Mexico court I believe found that the taxes here did not interfere with the tribe's economic development or its sovereignty."
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,130.246,131.402,That's their finding.
1988.87-1327,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,131.402,132.027,Yes.
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,135.026,139.353,I don't think you should because I think the record contradicts the finding of the New Mexico court.
1988.87-1327,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,139.353,143.617,What standard do we apply in reviewing their finding in that regard?
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,146.257,153.159,"Well, I think the Court has the record to consider side by side with the court of appeals' finding."
1988.87-1327,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,153.159,153.784,De novo?
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,153.784,154.987,"Yes, Your Honor."
1988.87-1327,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,163.046,172.355,"Well, are either the royalties produced or the production rates significantly affected by the state taxes?"
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,172.355,173.183,"No, Your Honor."
1988.87-1327,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,204.701,208.232,"Well, you say transcript, page such and such, unrebutted."
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,214.745,216.182,"Yes, that's true."
1988.87-1327,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,216.182,218.432,"So, so, how does that bear on it?"
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,222.086,222.555,Well--
1988.87-1327,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,222.555,223.727,The trial court heard the witnesses.
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,223.727,225.196,--That's true.
1988.87-1327,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,229.648,233.661,"Well, supposing the trial court chose to disbelieve your witness."
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,236.301,240.518,Well--
1988.87-1327,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,240.518,245.609,What does the tribe... what does the tribe involved here feet about this tax?
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,245.609,246.656,"--Well, the tribal chairman--"
1988.87-1327,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,246.656,247.531,Have they taken a position?
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,247.531,247.968,--Yes.
1988.87-1327,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,264.698,273.273,"Yes, but it doesn't... it didn't... it didn't... the tribe doesn't claim that their self-government or their economy is being hurt by New Mexico's tax."
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,273.273,277.084,"--Well, the amicus brief of the tribe say it has a chilling effect."
1988.87-1327,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,300.981,314.788,"Do I understand correctly that from now on... I mean, after this thing arose... the tribe took the position that it would be a partner in any oil and gas deals and thereby preclude the state from having any taxes on it?"
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,316.49,317.427,No.
1988.87-1327,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,334.345,334.892,Uh-hum.
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,334.892,350.79,"The fact of the matter is... and we cited it in our reply brief on page 13... that in considering... and that's House Report 736... in considering the Mineral Leasing Act of 1982, Congress rejected the notion of a express authorization for state taxation."
1988.87-1327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,360.584,362.395,"Where, where is that in the U.S. Code?"
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,363.723,365.972,U.S. Code Administrative News.
1988.87-1327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,365.972,368.66,This is not a statute--
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,368.66,368.957,xxx.
1988.87-1327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,368.957,369.503,--you're talking about.
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,370.409,372.954,This is the 1982 Mineral Leasing Act.
1988.87-1327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,372.954,374.22,--It's in the Leasing Act?
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,374.22,374.984,Yes.
1988.87-1327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,374.984,377.766,It says that... that we shall continue to apply our prior law?
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,377.766,380.219,"No, it's in the House Report, 736."
1988.87-1327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,380.219,380.734,I see.
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,384.874,385.748,No.
1988.87-1327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,390.246,393.667,"Congress said something, and Congress hasn't said a thing in fact."
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,396.65,402.258,"--In the Mineral Development Act, it simply authorized the tribes to develop joint ventures."
1988.87-1327,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,425.578,430.138,"Well, what if it were a joint arrangement here with the tribe?"
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,435.793,437.198,I don't see that there's any difference.
1988.87-1327,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,437.198,438.401,You don't.
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,438.401,447.945,"If it's... if it's tribally owned production, if it's a 100 percent tribal operation, clearly the ability to resist state taxation is stronger."
1988.87-1327,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,470.561,475.684,"Well, is there authority now for... for joint arrangements?"
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,475.684,477.387,"Yes, the 1982 Act."
1988.87-1327,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,477.387,479.995,And the tribe is not taking advantage of that?
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,479.995,480.386,No.
1988.87-1327,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,507.001,508.923,xxx joint venture is a separate entity I take it.
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,508.923,509.704,Yes.
1988.87-1327,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,521.934,534.772,"But our cases have, as you pointed out in McClanahan and cases... impose very definite limits on the extent to which the state can tax a tribal activity denominated as a tribal activity."
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,547.829,557.263,"Well, Chief Justice, if as a result of a joint venture agreement you had a 100 percent Indian-owned operation, I think I have a easier case today."
1988.87-1327,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,636.576,648.056,"Well, what do you... what do you say about the argument that the, that the old leasing acts really kind of permit tax... taxing reservation activities like this?"
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,648.056,653.445,"Well, that's... that's kind of the state's attempt we think to change the rules and kind of revisit Blackfeet."
1988.87-1327,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,700.975,703.659,"Well, Congress didn't read it out either in 1938."
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,703.659,704.003,--That's clear.
1988.87-1327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,739.193,741.395,What do you mean by federal production?
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,741.395,746.206,"--Federal oil and gas production, enormous amounts of federal oil and gas production."
1988.87-1327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,746.206,747.128,"From, from federal lands--"
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,747.128,748.987,"Federal lands, yes, Justice Scalia."
1988.87-1327,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,757.125,764.277,--One might think that an express mandate was more required in the case of federal lands than in the case of Indian lands.
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,764.277,774.962,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I, I guess I would, would resist that a little bit because the... there is no... there is no equivalent of an Indian Reorganization Act for federal lands."
1988.87-1327,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,791.719,799.935,"Well, don't some of our cases hold that federal production on federal lands couldn't be taxed without some sort of congressional approval of it?"
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,799.935,809.103,"Well, that... that's the... that is years ago, and then during the... the '30s the breakdown of that intergovernmental immunity began in this Court's decisions."
1988.87-1327,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,835.858,842.622,"Normally, normally when you rely on a preemption argument, don't you look for something Congress said to support the notion Congress intended preemption?"
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,842.622,875.295,"--Yes, and I think... I think... New Mexico complains that the preemption teachings of this Court in the Indian area are kind of... are asked with preemption elsewhere, and I think in our reply brief we pointed out that there are certain areas of the law, admiralty, sedition, and in the foreign areas where the Court... including the Indian area, where the Court has said this is presumably and presumptively a subject of federal concern and, therefore, the test for preemption is somewhat different."
1988.87-1327,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,994.654,999.98,Is there room in that balancing test to take into consideration what Congress intended?
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,999.98,1001.98,--Absolutely.
1988.87-1327,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1001.98,1017.832,"And looking at the old leasing acts, there certainly is some room there to indicate or to find that Congress intended the states to still be able to do some taxation of non-Indian producers, isn't there?"
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,1017.832,1025.735,"If, if the world stopped in 1928, I would absolutely agree with you and we wouldn't be here because we wouldn't be wasting our time."
1988.87-1327,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1174.147,1177.286,You say a tripe should be treated just like another state then.
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,1177.286,1179.693,"Well, I think for purposes... I think--"
1988.87-1327,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1179.693,1181.113,Have we ever held that?
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,1181.113,1183.534,"--In a broad sense, no, you have not."
1988.87-1327,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1185.206,1188.064,"So, you're asking us to extend our doctrine then."
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,1188.064,1203.198,"--In the Commerce Clause question that we... I have raised and the Court has asked me to consider, in a limited sense only, Mr. Chief Justice, we say, yes, states should be treated... tribes should be treated as states in a limited sense only."
1988.87-1327,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1254.538,1258.879,A tribe which lies wholly within the geographic boundaries of the state.
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,1258.879,1260.442,"Correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.87-1327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1276.435,1297.193,"Well, after you... after you throw it into, into the Commerce Clause matrix, you still have to decide under the Commerce Clause which... which of the states, given conflicting state taxations, is the one that has authority to tax or how it should be apportioned."
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,1305.657,1316.045,"Well, Mr. Justice Scalia, I think there's teachings in... in this Court's recent case law that supports our view: Commonwealth Edison and Jicarilla Tribe v. Merrion."
1988.87-1327,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1326.852,1331.803,"Well, it's local to the state as well as local to the reservation inasmuch as the reservation is in the state."
1988.87-1327,0,21033,daniel_h_israel,,1332.928,1335.459,"Well, and I think that's fair to say."
1988.87-1327,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1413.553,1415.318,"Very well, Mr. Israel."
1988.87-1327,1,28014,harold_d_stratton,,1417.178,1427.174,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.87-1327,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1556.171,1571.193,"So, does the state's authority to tax or its lack of authority to tax depend upon the particular royalty agreement, or does it depend upon the economic market for oil and gas drilling?"
1988.87-1327,1,28014,harold_d_stratton,,1571.193,1578.722,"Justice Kennedy, I believe the state's ability to tax depends upon whose income it is."
1988.87-1327,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1593.108,1595.653,What about a joint venture?
1988.87-1327,1,28014,harold_d_stratton,,1595.653,1599.402,"Justice O'Connor, a joint venture would work the same way."
1988.87-1327,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1612.226,1625.689,"Well, if market conditions were such that the Indians could be successful in leasing their lands only it they gave a reduced royalty in order to account for a state tax, would that change the case?"
1988.87-1327,1,28014,harold_d_stratton,,1625.689,1629.141,"I don't believe that it would change the case, Justice Kennedy."
1988.87-1327,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1640.934,1644.385,"So, then Dr. Parker's findings, et cetera, are simply irrelevant here?"
1988.87-1327,1,28014,harold_d_stratton,,1644.385,1648.119,Dr. Farker's findings regarding the production?
1988.87-1327,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1648.119,1660.285,"Yes, and the... and the fact that the, the ability of the tribes to develop their resources was, was not adversely affected by the tax."
1988.87-1327,1,28014,harold_d_stratton,,1662.613,1665.175,"I don't believe it's irrelevant, Your Honor."
1988.87-1327,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1682.994,1688.431,"So, then... so, then the fact that there's a royalty arrangement is not necessarily dispositive."
1988.87-1327,1,28014,harold_d_stratton,,1693.398,1696.414,"--Well, Your Honor, that's not our case."
1988.87-1327,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1714.311,1730.728,"Well, while you're on that point, is it the 1927 Act or the 1938 Act that carries... that controls the case because if you say the 1938 Act, we have the... the Crow Tribe case to contend with, don't you?"
1988.87-1327,1,28014,harold_d_stratton,,1730.728,1734.18,"Yes, Your Honor, we do have to contend with the Crow Tribe case."
1988.87-1327,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1949.005,1954.908,Do you think the Montana v. Blackfeet is a little inconsistent with your argument or not?
1988.87-1327,1,28014,harold_d_stratton,,1954.908,1961.093,"--Your Honor, Montana against Blackfeet is not inconsistent with my argument for the following reasons."
1988.87-1327,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1992.737,1996.127,"Well, did it talk at all about the 1938 Act?"
1988.87-1327,1,28014,harold_d_stratton,,1996.127,1997.581,"--Yes, Your Honor, it did."
1988.87-1327,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1997.581,1998.222,What did it say about it?
1988.87-1327,1,28014,harold_d_stratton,,1998.222,2013.809,"It said that the 1938 Act was the act under which those particular interests were leased, but that the 1938 Act under liberal canons of construction did not for the purposes of taxing Indian's interests incorporate the provisions of the 1927 Act."
1988.87-1327,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2034.268,2040.095,"So, the 1938 Act did change to some extent what the prior law was with respect to taxation?"
1988.87-1327,1,28014,harold_d_stratton,,2040.095,2044.342,"--Your Honor, the 1938 Act said nothing about taxation."
1988.87-1327,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2044.342,2046.467,"Well, I know but what about the Blackfeet case?"
1988.87-1327,1,28014,harold_d_stratton,,2046.467,2050.418,"Well, the Blackfeet case... in 1985 this Court held--"
1988.87-1327,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2050.418,2053.229,That the '38 Act did something.
1988.87-1327,1,28014,harold_d_stratton,,2053.229,2058.307,--It held that the '38 Act did not incorporate the '37 Act as applied to Indians' interest.
1988.87-1327,2,21033,daniel_h_israel,,2915.893,2917.235,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.87-1327,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2926.716,2928.544,So--
1988.87-1327,2,21033,daniel_h_israel,,2928.544,2949.769,"The impact on the tribe is not, so much in this particular refund action, but really the larger question as the Court has recognized in Bracker, in Ramah, in Mescalero, and as the tribe itself indicates in its amicus brief, the larger question is its ability to make the reservation attractive, to eliminate this penalty."
1988.87-1327,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2949.769,2954.267,--But if you said in the New Mexico Court of Appeals that it is not a preemption case--
1988.87-1327,2,21033,daniel_h_israel,,2954.267,2956.767,"I didn't say that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.87-1327,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2956.767,2962.983,"--Well, but I... let me read again what the New Mexico Court of Appeals said you said, and I asked you whether that was a correct statement."
1988.87-1327,2,21033,daniel_h_israel,,2976.509,2977.728,"No, it is not, Mr. Chief Justice."
1988.87-1327,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2977.728,2978.759,The court was wrong then in saying it.
1988.87-1327,2,21033,daniel_h_israel,,2978.759,2979.416,Yes.
1988.87-1327,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3118.16,3124.205,"You emphasize the 14 percent, but supposing you had a case in which the tribe didn't impose any taxes of its own."
1988.87-1327,2,21033,daniel_h_israel,,3130.608,3130.997,Yes.
1988.87-1327,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3130.997,3135.433,"So, really the 14 percent isn't relevant to the legal analysis, I don't think."
1988.87-1327,2,21033,daniel_h_israel,,3135.433,3143.055,"Well, it gives rise to a Commerce Clause claim, that if you didn't have the taxes, then you have only a controlling acts of Congress, a preemption claim."
1988.87-1327,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3158.721,3165.516,"So, from its vantage point, it would be exactly the same if it had negotiated a more favorable lease instead of added on top of it this... this tax."
1988.87-1327,2,21033,daniel_h_israel,,3165.516,3166.795,And that's what the tribe has said here.
1988.87-1327,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3179.697,3181.728,When... when were these leases signed again?
1988.87-1327,2,21033,daniel_h_israel,,3182.088,3183.493,These were early leases in the 1950s.
1988.87-1327,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3183.493,3184.962,--And they started taxing them when?
1988.87-1327,2,21033,daniel_h_israel,,3186.946,3187.446,In the 1970s.
