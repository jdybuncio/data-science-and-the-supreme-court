2008.07-869,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.022,"We'll hear argument next in Case 07-869, Ysursa v. Pocatello Education Association."
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,9.855,54.217,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is narrowed to a single, but from the Petitioner's perspective a critical, dispute over the scope of internal State sovereignty: whether the First Amendment trumps the otherwise existing authority of the Idaho legislature to direct political subdivisions of the State to take an action, here restricting access to their payroll systems, that the subdivisions could take independently without violating the Amendment."
2008.07-869,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,85.32,89.605,Didn't the statute also prohibit private employers from doing that?
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,89.605,95.259,"As construed by the district court, it did."
2008.07-869,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,127.111,130.729,And you concede the statute was unconstitutional as applied to them?
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,130.729,134.765,"The district court concluded that the -- yes, Your Honor, we did."
2008.07-869,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,134.765,136.717,And you agree with that conclusion?
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,136.717,137.783,We do.
2008.07-869,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,137.783,143.204,And what is the difference between the private employer and the county agency?
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,143.204,164.783,"Well, the principal difference is that one is a private employer -- that is to say, engaging in private speech -- while the public employer is a -- is a subdivision of the State of Idaho, subject, we would argue, to the plenary control, pursuant to the Idaho Constitution, of the Idaho legislature."
2008.07-869,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,164.783,169.235,I think Justice Stevens's question highlights for me one of the confusing parts of this case.
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,196.589,199.105,"Your Honor, in a word, the answer is no."
2008.07-869,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,230.16,235.88,"Do I understand that the counties, if they elected to, could decide not to -- not to do the checkoff?"
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,235.88,242.95,"Prior to the adoption of the statute in 2003, yes."
2008.07-869,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,242.95,256.357,And so why should counties be different from -- from -- I'm still puzzled about why counties -- county employers are different from private employers in terms of the State interest in preventing the checkoff.
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,256.357,259.559,"Well, there is a fundamental difference, Your Honor."
2008.07-869,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,283.674,304.171,"If you -- if you think of the case as a principal-agent case so that the principal can direct the agent as to what to do, the agent being the county, then it seems to me that the unions might still have an argument that this is an unconstitutional condition."
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,342.427,348.331,"--It might, Your Honor, but that situation, of course, is not the situation presented here."
2008.07-869,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,348.331,348.914,Why isn't it?
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,358.187,369.927,"Because the statute at issue here, Justice Kennedy, speaks across the board to a specific kind of conduct, political activities."
2008.07-869,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,382.135,382.968,"Yes, because the State couldn't--"
2008.07-869,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,382.968,387.586,You stand up and say that this isn't viewpoint -- that this is -- that this is viewpoint-based.
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,390.305,393.757,"Your Honor, they are incorrect about that."
2008.07-869,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,401.146,405.814,But does it get at any speech other than union speech?
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,432.882,433.882,--The answer is no.
2008.07-869,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,443.421,448.224,"But, in practice, is there any other application?"
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,448.224,456.395,"Well, there is no evidence in the record, Your Honor, as to any other entity who is affected by the statute."
2008.07-869,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,466.519,485.481,Are there -- are there in counties some charitable drives that occur annually and that permit employees to donate to those charities through deductions from their wages?
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,485.481,486.6,"--There are, Your Honor."
2008.07-869,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,486.6,491.568,And would they presumably be covered by this?
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,512.898,518.718,"Well, to the extent that the -- the contribution was for political activities--"
2008.07-869,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,518.718,520.252,"Oh, it's only political activities?"
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,520.252,520.835,--That's correct.
2008.07-869,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,520.835,521.337,I see.
2008.07-869,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,523.32,532.759,"But if in fact there is a charity, which charity in Idaho is a charity that makes all of its contributions to help support right-to-work laws."
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,537.794,541.829,"Your Honor, again, it depends."
2008.07-869,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,544.281,544.664,You don't know.
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,605.049,620.176,"Your Honor, in fact, we argued below that there was no constitutional right of access to the payroll system for purposes of making political contributions."
2008.07-869,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,622.061,626.865,"There certainly, I would think, would be a problem if the right-to-work people can get there."
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,645.224,652.146,"--Well, the -- I would suggest that a remand for that purpose would be futile."
2008.07-869,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,684.968,691.354,--Would -- would they include contributions to an organization that makes contributions to political parties--
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,691.354,691.938,"Yes, to the--"
2008.07-869,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,691.938,695.223,--such as a right-to work-organization?
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,695.223,702.412,"--To the extent that the -- the organization is, for example, a political action committee, it would."
2008.07-869,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,769.39,774.925,Does the State give some particular favor to unions?
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,787.185,787.852,"No, Your Honor."
2008.07-869,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,807.247,820.323,"But unions do have a special prerogative which -- which no other organizations, as far as you're aware, have in the State, which is to have money deducted from people's payrolls?"
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,820.323,823.108,That's -- that's correct.
2008.07-869,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,823.891,828.143,"--No other organization other than the Federal, State and local governments."
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,828.143,829.179,--True.
2008.07-869,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,893.002,893.454,Yes.
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,935.448,944.554,"Well, I would agree that -- that unions have, and particularly these -- particularly the Respondents have a special benefit."
2008.07-869,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,973.637,984.512,"May I ask a question about, say, an attempt to deduct contributions to a charity like the United Fund?"
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,991.183,994.135,Local governments have discretion.
2008.07-869,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,994.135,995.968,They have discretion to do that?
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,995.968,996.551,That's correct.
2008.07-869,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,996.551,1002.372,"With respect to the union situation, the statute takes away that discretion."
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1002.372,1003.091,With respect--
2008.07-869,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1003.091,1009.728,"And the question is why is there -- why is there a State interest in taking away that discretion for unions, but not as to charities."
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1009.728,1018.166,"--Well, it takes away that discretion with respect to any third party who might receive amounts for political activities."
2008.07-869,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1018.166,1019.233,For political activities.
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1028.689,1046.151,"The reason, as we articulate in our brief, is the desire to avoid either the appearance or the reality of public employer involvement in, in this instance, electoral politics."
2008.07-869,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1046.151,1047.936,I see.
2008.07-869,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1047.936,1060.76,"Are there other areas in which the State exercises the authority you're asserting here with respect to county employers, telling them what they can and can't do?"
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1060.76,1068.349,"Outside the area of elections, not with respect to payroll deductions."
2008.07-869,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1068.349,1069.816,I mean more generally.
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1087.311,1103.439,"Your Honor, the -- the county -- counties in Idaho and I suppose in most States act as political subdivisions of the State."
2008.07-869,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1111.943,1112.578,I'm looking for--
2008.07-869,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1112.578,1113.712,No.
2008.07-869,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1114.212,1115.83,--I'm looking for a specific example.
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1130.007,1141.362,"Your Honor, let me go back to the election context for a moment to try to address that question."
2008.07-869,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1210.126,1213.161,"Well, that's -- since I asked the question, I think it's necessary."
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1227.386,1238.241,"Well, Your Honor, for example, with respect to -- take open meetings, for example, take public records, for example."
2008.07-869,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1265.927,1266.994,What about a Hatch Act?
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1275.449,1284.472,"Your Honor, it does, but not -- not in connection with their public employment activities."
2008.07-869,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1284.472,1287.424,I don't know -- I don't know what that means.
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1287.424,1299.582,"It means that there is no prohibition under State law, for example, for a public employee to engage in political activity."
2008.07-869,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1308.188,1308.604,That's interesting.
2008.07-869,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1310.771,1330.284,"The general proposition that underlies your argument that the local entities are creatures of State law and they cannot receive Federal powers from the Federal Government when the States object, is that -- is that an acceptable proposition?"
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1330.284,1336.438,"It would be an acceptable proposition to the extent that Federal law doesn't pre-empt State law, Your Honor."
2008.07-869,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1336.438,1336.805,Right.
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1336.805,1349.515,"In this instance, we would argue that the First Amendment does not interpose some kind of barrier to essentially vulcanize local government from State legislative control."
2008.07-869,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1349.515,1367.125,"There is -- there is a case out of the Ninth Circuit, and it was affirmed by this Court on a procedural point, but not on a -- not on the merits -- out of the neighboring State of Washington, where the State says a locality cannot build a dam more than 25 feet high."
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1384.836,1391.675,"Depending on -- on the facts, I -- I would agree that it is certainly possible for the State law to--"
2008.07-869,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1391.675,1398.496,"Because there the local entity has powers greater than what the State wants to give it, even over the State's objection."
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1398.496,1406.268,"--Well, but -- but, Your Honor, that is, I think, beyond cavil; that is to say that Federal law--"
2008.07-869,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1406.268,1408.418,I -- I didn't hear you.
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1409.386,1411.237,"--Beyond cavil, beyond--"
2008.07-869,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1411.237,1419.39,"Really, if the State can -- can opt not to do something, it can't tell its subdivisions, we don't want you to do it, either?"
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1428.179,1430.281,"--Well, it -- it depends on--"
2008.07-869,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1430.281,1435.352,It seems to me that that is the argument you should be making here.
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1435.352,1442.839,"--Your Honor, perhaps it was -- it was an argument that we don't have to make in this instance."
2008.07-869,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1449.16,1460.733,"But I thought your whole argument was that the counties are simply instrumentalities of the State, and the State has full power over them."
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1487.135,1494.223,"--It is beyond cavil if the Federal law, in fact, supersedes State law."
2008.07-869,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1495.306,1504.662,"That depends -- I mean the whole case turns on -- and the response to Justice Kennedy, I think, would be -- if the Federal Government is simply saying you can do it if you want, that's one thing."
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1519.106,1520.306,--That's correct.
2008.07-869,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1520.306,1529.397,And don't -- don't you suffer from -- doesn't your position suffer from a -- a more serious problem that doesn't even implicate the pre-emption doctrine?
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1580.226,1583.845,"I disagree, Justice Souter."
2008.07-869,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1599.271,1611.679,"Well, it has distinct rights under the First Amendment if State law creates a corporate form of -- of -- of business organization."
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1638.08,1655.108,"I disagree to the extent that there is any attempt to equate a private corporation with essentially an agent or an arm of the State such as a county, which has been delegated governmental functions."
2008.07-869,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1655.108,1655.475,All right.
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1674.486,1680.807,"Well, that is -- certainly is the distinction between a private corporation and, for example, a county."
2008.07-869,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1680.807,1683.259,That's the only distinction that you can maintain.
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1703.672,1708.14,"And -- and the very nature of the entity, itself, Your Honor."
2008.07-869,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1710.926,1712.611,"What -- what do you mean by the ""nature of""--"
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1712.611,1727.871,"--A county or school district performs functions assigned to it by the State legislature to carry out the function, to carry out activities that are public in nature."
2008.07-869,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1727.871,1730.037,"--Yes, it's doing -- it's doing a governmental job."
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1730.037,1730.823,That's correct.
2008.07-869,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1730.823,1736.441,"We understand what that is, so I understand that point."
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1736.441,1760.342,"Your Honor, I -- I can only repeat that the distinction between the private corporation and the -- and a political subdivision of the State is that, in fact, one is an entity created by the legislature for the very purpose of carrying out State governmental functions."
2008.07-869,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1768.162,1768.962,No.
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1812.441,1815.06,"And Your Honor, I think I responded."
2008.07-869,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1815.06,1827.968,"You don't think that under our Federal system, the States have greater powers deciding how they are going to organize themselves than they have with respect to the regulation of artificial private entities that they choose to permit under State law?"
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1827.968,1828.402,Yes.
2008.07-869,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1832.104,1833.904,"Counsel, we'll give you a minute for rebuttal--"
2008.07-869,0,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,1833.904,1834.573,Thank you.
2008.07-869,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1834.573,1846.864,--Since our questioning has taken away from your time.
2008.07-869,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,1848.031,1852.935,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: This case turns on three points.
2008.07-869,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1881.252,1925.816,"Mr. Collins, suppose -- I gather Idaho doesn't have it, but suppose Idaho wanted a Hatch Act similar to the Federal Hatch Act that prohibits Federal employees from engaging in political activity, and suppose it decided that not only should the State employees at the capital not engage in political activities, but it's a problem for any governmental employee to do that; they ought to be neutral and we don't want patronage to be passed out on the basis of whether they are campaigning for one party or another, and we don't want them to be coerced into campaigning for one party or another."
2008.07-869,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,1957.852,1958.821,"Not at all, Your Honor."
2008.07-869,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1958.821,1959.421,Why not?
2008.07-869,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,1959.421,1979.118,"We don't take that position at all, because, as the Court has indicated in Letter Carriers and Broadrick and other cases, there is a compelling interest in a statute which says that government employees -- and it could be State or local -- will not be performing their jobs as servants of politics."
2008.07-869,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1979.118,1982.57,You're saying -- you're analogizing these to private entities.
2008.07-869,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,1983.82,1984.939,That's not our point.
2008.07-869,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1984.939,1986.205,This is not a creature of the State.
2008.07-869,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,1998.66,2010.285,"We are saying that, Your Honor, because the only defense that the State can possibly offer here to this content discrimination is the forum notion that the State has introduced."
2008.07-869,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2010.818,2011.337,Now--
2008.07-869,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2011.337,2012.87,--It's not a forum analysis.
2008.07-869,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2012.87,2015.189,--Let me just establish something at the outset.
2008.07-869,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2028.497,2029.43,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2008.07-869,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2029.43,2030.282,All right.
2008.07-869,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2039.97,2040.47,Yes.
2008.07-869,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2054.73,2074.311,"And if -- and if a State had a system in which all payroll deductions were -- by local entities -- were routinely controlled by the State, the State did all the pay roles for the local entities, then it -- in that case the nondeductibility would also be permitted, I take it."
2008.07-869,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2074.311,2080.464,"--Yes, Your Honor, and let me explain because those are two -- the answer to both questions is ""yes"" but for two very different reasons."
2008.07-869,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2121.505,2122.755,Did you have any doubt how they would?
2008.07-869,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2133.246,2163.499,"--What I'm suggesting, Mr. Chief Justice, is that since we are beginning with a content-based restriction -- and I do want to emphasize it's a law here which says that for all employers -- public, private, or State -- the only expenditure you can't make through payroll deduction is for political activities, and also the only resource of an employer that can't be used for any kind of political activity is payroll deduction, this being in a statute targeted at employee support of union activity."
2008.07-869,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2215.098,2239.147,"Well, if the State wants to, it's because it can exercise a heavy hand and control its local units, but if it wants to give the local units discretion, then it has to leave it to the local units whether or not they want to enact such a ban."
2008.07-869,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2240.249,2240.582,--No.
2008.07-869,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2252.223,2260.746,"My question really is, if you look at this at the most basic level, we have two important concessions."
2008.07-869,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2284.057,2310.105,"--Your Honor, functionally that's the question, but I think analytically we don't see it that way because the question is, as we see it, is the State, with regard to this challenged statute in its application to the local governments, acting in a capacity that entitles it to be free from the normal First Amendment scrutiny that it acknowledges it would fail -- and that's where our point is."
2008.07-869,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2318.444,2322.829,"It's at that part, just where you are, that I've always had a hard time not for lack of trying."
2008.07-869,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2375.114,2399.645,"Well, Justice Breyer, the -- the concept of content discrimination may blur on some edges, but one thing that the Court has been clear on is that when a government says speech -- one form of speech will not be allowed and that will be political speech, that is treated as requiring heightened scrutiny."
2008.07-869,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2400.112,2408.335,"It doesn't -- for example, in biology class, the school board says: You know, biology teacher, I want you to teach biology; I don't want you to teach politics."
2008.07-869,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2422.726,2427.28,"--Well, first of all, Your Honor, all of those would pass muster either because--"
2008.07-869,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2427.28,2427.847,They might.
2008.07-869,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2435.201,2445.472,--They would pass muster either because they are within exceptions to heightened scrutiny -- because not all content distinctions require heightened scrutiny -- or they would pass muster even under heightened scrutiny.
2008.07-869,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2479.359,2484.613,"--Since we are in confessional mode, I've never understood forum analysis."
2008.07-869,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2519.782,2523.15,"Well, two points in response to that, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-869,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2554.669,2564.311,You say there is a sufficient -- presumably you concede there is a sufficient justification for this content-based restriction as to State employees.
2008.07-869,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2564.311,2582.772,"--What we say as the State employees, Justice Alito, is that if falls under the Regan-Findley line of cases; that you don't even get to a First Amendment scrutiny because it's under the doctrine that when the government says we won't spend our money on something, that's not an infringement of speech in the first place."
2008.07-869,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2583.872,2589.192,So if there is State money involved in these payroll systems that would be sufficient?
2008.07-869,1,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2589.192,2598.132,--If the State said you can't use our money for payroll deductions of this kind then it would arguably be into that category.
2008.07-869,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2600.234,2607.154,--Isn't there -- isn't there some State tax money that goes to fund local units?
2008.07-869,2,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,2621.147,2657.986,"There is State funding, but the reason, I believe, why the Respondents -- excuse me the Petitioners -- have conceded that the subsidization case law does not apply to this statute in its application to the local governments, is that what the subsidization cases are talking about -- cases like Regan, Rust, Findley -- are situations where we'll say the State is involved in developing a program which it will pay for, and it says because we are paying for that, our priorities are to be honored."
2008.07-869,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2698.193,2720.475,"No, but another way of looking at it is to say in each of these instances -- whether we are talking about the State taxing in order to perform functions at the State level or whether the State is authorizing taxation for functions for functions to be performed at the local level -- in all of these instances, the State is in the position to say not that it is sort of our money, but to say it is public money."
2008.07-869,3,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2746.857,2755.113,"--Because, Your Honor, I think the courts never applied the Regan subsidization analysis in that kind of--"
2008.07-869,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2755.113,2756.981,But I'm -- I'm asking you why shouldn't--
2008.07-869,3,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2756.981,2757.815,--It shouldn't--
2008.07-869,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2757.815,2779.431,"--Why shouldn't we, on the theory that what is important is not which particular coffer the penny goes into, but the fact that it is public money, i.e., money being raised from taxpayers under a statute passed by the State authorizing taxation; and it is going to -- and its justification for taxation is the performance of public functions."
2008.07-869,3,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2793.171,2795.937,"--For the following reason, I think, Justice Souter."
2008.07-869,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2834.498,2861.815,"Yes, but what you're saying is, I -- you're saying in effect that I -- that you reject my -- my hypothetical assumption here, that what we ought to regard as the proper characterization of the money is not ""our"" State money, but public money raised under a system of public taxation; and you're saying you should not go -- you should not characterize the funds that way."
2008.07-869,3,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2862.798,2863.281,"--No, I--"
2008.07-869,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2863.281,2866.517,"--because if you do characterize the funds that way, it seems to me you're in trouble."
2008.07-869,3,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2866.517,2867.052,--Now--
2008.07-869,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2867.052,2869.252,But why shouldn't I characterize them that way?
2008.07-869,3,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2869.252,2894.953,"--The -- even characterizing -- even characterizing it that way, the reason that I think the analysis breaks down as to applying subsidization law, is that the subsidization law doctrine, subsidization doctrine -- Regan and those cases -- as the Court has explained it, it is to protect the prerogatives of the government that is making decisions about how it wants particular programs to be operated."
2008.07-869,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2894.953,2902.54,The State -- the State legislature is making a decision as to how it wants the -- the programs which comprise local government to be operated.
2008.07-869,4,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,2902.54,2913.896,"But the difference, Your Honor, in all of the other cases one could look at Regan and the like, there is a program where the government is involved in its manifold details."
2008.07-869,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2943.998,2953.869,"Well, but the point in the case that you concede that the government may make that choice is that the government is subsidizing it by the activity which the government is refusing to perform."
2008.07-869,5,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,2969.177,2986.888,"But the difference for First Amendment analysis, I would submit, Your Honor, and the reason why I think the subsidization doctrine has been confined in the areas it's been confined, is when we are talking in this case, for example, about the State, the State determines whether it's going to have a payroll deduction system."
2008.07-869,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3032.1,3036.635,"Mr. Collins, may I interrupt you and ask you the converse of the question I asked your opponent?"
2008.07-869,5,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,3076.962,3104.214,"Your Honor, we conceded that reluctantly under the view that where the question is whether the State -- our claim against the State would say we are -- we are going to require the State to start devoting money that it doesn't want to spend as we -- we have chosen given the force of cases like Regan, not to make that contention, but to accept the ruling that the State's refusal to spend money on its own programs is in a different category."
2008.07-869,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3104.214,3113.921,But this is not a case involving a State's decision not to spend the time and energy to do payroll deductions because they do them for everybody else.
2008.07-869,5,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,3122.86,3126.229,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2008.07-869,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3136.085,3136.485,How can it not be clear?
2008.07-869,5,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,3147.725,3161.466,"--Well, in Davenport, Your Honor, the Court did indicate that a statute that applies to public and private, even though it's a unitary statute, you have to analyze it separately in the two contexts."
2008.07-869,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3210.28,3210.997,I see your argument.
2008.07-869,5,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3210.997,3217.034,"Suppose the State at the State level says this is a contentious area, we want to stay out of it."
2008.07-869,5,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,3251.44,3271.953,"Because I think the difference here, Your Honor, as I understand the case law, is that when the State is simply saying we choose not to spend our own money on this activity, it does not have the same burden of explaining why it's made that choice that it has when it reaches out and says, and by the way, we don't want local government or even private government--"
2008.07-869,5,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3271.953,3272.853,"Well, of course, that's the interest."
2008.07-869,5,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,3288.113,3290.749,--And we have no quarrel at all with that notion.
2008.07-869,5,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3305.706,3309.158,I -- I -- I'm not sure that's right.
2008.07-869,5,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,3315.478,3336.724,"If the -- if the State wants to have a uniform law for itself -- for public employer -- employees, its own employees and local government employees because of some unitary interest that the State wants to pursue, there is nothing wrong with the state pursuing that objective."
2008.07-869,5,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3398.06,3403.512,"I'll read Russo again, but I didn't think Pocatello, Idaho, was part of the state of major."
2008.07-869,5,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,3403.512,3418.806,"--I just meant that no -- it's this simple, Justice Kennedy, and the point I'm trying to make is that for someone to get access to political -- to a payroll deduction system of the State government, it needs an affirmative grant from the State."
2008.07-869,5,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3453.691,3454.474,Could you help me with this?
2008.07-869,5,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,3465.915,3474.438,"--It's fine with me, but if you analyze it in any way that says that heightened scrutiny is applicable and there is no exception--"
2008.07-869,5,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3474.438,3474.921,Why is that?
2008.07-869,5,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,3475.557,3483.861,"MR. COLLINS -- the problem with constitutional condition -- if it were a condition on the local governments, then it's not really--"
2008.07-869,5,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3483.861,3499.405,Are you saying -- is it your view that heightened scrutiny applies whenever a government tells any group that wants to raise money for political purposes in any way they want involving the government that it can't?
2008.07-869,5,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,3499.405,3501.005,"--No, Your Honor."
2008.07-869,5,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3501.005,3501.572,No.
2008.07-869,5,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,3518.967,3528.739,"The -- well, there are exceptions to heightened scrutiny where the government is acting as a proprietor."
2008.07-869,5,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3530.608,3537.678,But then you are making -- say it always applies except in a few little exceptions.
2008.07-869,5,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,3557.438,3562.758,"--Well, if the government is allowing other speech it would be heightened scrutiny."
2008.07-869,5,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3562.758,3574.816,"You cannot -- you have to use heightened scrutiny when the FDA, for example -- you know, the case I wrote in -- the FDA says you cannot advertise on a label for a drug."
2008.07-869,5,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,3579.903,3588.242,"It -- if it's -- if it's commercial speech, it might fall under a different standard."
2008.07-869,5,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3601.55,3606.352,And regulation of government employees is the same?
2008.07-869,5,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,3606.352,3617.06,--It basically would trigger the -- the heightened scrutiny except where the government is involved.
2008.07-869,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3654.566,3656.099,Why are you -- why are you focusing on heightened scrutiny?
2008.07-869,5,29833,jeremiah_a_collins,,3672.61,3675.396,"If I may answer that question, Mr. Chief Justice?"
2008.07-869,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3730.196,3731.113,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-869,6,20073,clay_riggs_smith,,3739.183,3743.421,Two points that I think are critical.
2008.07-869,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3802.125,3802.859,"Thank you, counsel."
