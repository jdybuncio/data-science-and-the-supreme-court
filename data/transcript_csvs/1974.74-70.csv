1974.74-70,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,55.577,"We'll hear arguments next in 74-70, Goldfarb against Virginia State Bar and others."
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,64.783,67.667,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1974.74-70,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,268.569,273.873,Does this record show whether any such disciplinary proceedings have ever been embarked on --
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,273.873,280.103,It does Your Honor and it suggested Mr. Chief Justice that there have never been any disciplinary proceedings brought for that very reason.
1974.74-70,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,314.626,335.2,Is there any indication in that stipulation or any of the findings of the District Court as to whether this adherence came about because of a fear of disciplinary action or because of a desire to persuade the client that the fee had to be charged on a pecuniary motive basis?
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,335.2,338.131,I don't think there's anything that directly responds.
1974.74-70,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,362.223,363.837,"May I ask Mr. Morrison, what page?"
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,363.837,367.816,That's page 19 in the appendix to the petition for writ of certiorari.
1974.74-70,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,369.006,370.202,What color?
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,370.202,373.035,Blue.
1974.74-70,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,373.035,375.293,It is in the regular appendix?
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,375.293,381.002,"No Your Honor, that was one of the findings of fact that was included in the trial court's opinion."
1974.74-70,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,390.586,394.33,"That's finding 20, is it, stipulation?"
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,394.33,395.273,That is right.
1974.74-70,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,395.273,396.211,Yes.
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,398.484,406.849,It is no small wonder that the Goldfarb's were unable to find a lawyer who would charge them less than the minimum fee for title examination for their home.
1974.74-70,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,434.056,443.161,I take it you're asserting that the Virginia State Bar effectively enforced the minimum fee?
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,443.161,444.389,That is correct.
1974.74-70,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,471.336,484.77,"So, the Virginia State Bar you're saying invited the local bar associations to promulgate minimum fees and then enforce them through the ethical mandates?"
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,484.77,485.217,Precisely.
1974.74-70,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,490.141,498.686,"Well, do you suggest that the Virginia State Bar was acting outside the scope of its authority under the Virginia law?"
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,498.686,507.192,I would say Your Honor that the Virginia Bar has been given the authority to issue ethical opinions by the state court of Virginia.
1974.74-70,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,518.902,525.003,"Are you suggesting that there isn't any clear authority in Virginia law, you're saying for that?"
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,525.003,539.41,"I would say that's correct, Your Honor but that even if there were authority under Virginia law that is we, in this case are not, I don't believe deciding a question of whether that the issuance of these reports is somehow violation of Virginia law."
1974.74-70,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,545.078,547.062,"But you can't have it both ways, I don't think."
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,573.972,578.954,"Well, we do say that it was in administrative agency the state for only very limited purposes."
1974.74-70,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,592.235,598.781,"So, you're saying that it was acting outside the clear scope of its authority and so far as fee schedules were concerned?"
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,598.781,630.336,"That's right, Your Honor, but I would say that even if we decided as a matter of state law that the authority was so broad to the Virginia State Bar that there was nothing that prohibited the State Bar from issuing fee reports or these ethical opinions that under this Court's decision in Parker versus Brown that that would not be sufficient to create an antitrust exemption that there needs to be more and that as we'll show later on that they have not met those tests here."
1974.74-70,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,658.27,676.576,That is by opinions of 98 and 170 in 1962 and 1968 and further by being a brooding on their presence that was – that threatened to enforce these as -- on the basis of violation of ethics if there were violations of these minimum standards?
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,676.576,686.75,"And further the issuance of the two fee reports; remember 1962, the State Bar issued the fee report, that was the first time that one was issued in Northern Virginia, fee schedule followed back and the --"
1974.74-70,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,686.75,691.521,The fee report had to do with the comparative study of doctors and lawyers' incomes and so on?
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,691.521,692.694,Only very slight Your Honor.
1974.74-70,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,721.651,730.097,Where there in fact disciplinary proceedings initiated against people who charged less than this minimum fee schedules?
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,730.097,730.642,"No, Your Honor."
1974.74-70,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,730.642,731.053,Never?
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,731.053,732.164,Never.
1974.74-70,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,732.164,734.964,I mean never as far as this record this goes?
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,734.964,739.258,The State Bar has so represented and we are unaware of any cases.
1974.74-70,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,755.126,762.128,"And the ethical violation would be soliciting business, would it be beyond that theory?"
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,762.128,771.044,"That is on that general theory, although there need be a specific requirements of solicitation in the sense that the lawyer need not advertise or go out to tell people that he --"
1974.74-70,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,771.044,771.854,But if he undercuts the other lawyer --
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,771.854,787.1,"But if he consistently undercuts, if he charges three quarters of a percent of the purchase price or break -- makes the break at 25 instead of $50,000.00 that's considered unethical or if he charges on the basis of time or the value of the services --"
1974.74-70,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,787.1,790.094,That fact alone would support disciplinary action?
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,790.094,791.202,That is precisely correct --
1974.74-70,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,791.202,793.757,"But on the theory of solicitation of it, is that it?"
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,793.757,798.395,"In that general theory, yes Your Honor, that fact alone would be sufficient."
1974.74-70,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,802.318,803.65,Some evidence?
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,803.65,806.008,"That's right, but there must be more, there must be more."
1974.74-70,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,809.719,831.074,"I think there's a general public interest factor they call it social interest in not having system which permits lawyers to charge, let us say, a straight $15.00 for every title examination, $15.00 not $50.00?"
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,831.074,831.617,"Yes, sir."
1974.74-70,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,831.617,845.889,"And then gradually get most of the or a great deal of the work, but for $15.00, obviously performing shoddy professional work as it would have to be?"
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,845.889,856.78,I would certainly never counsel this Court or any one to adopt any sort of situation under which the lawyers were required to charge any sort of minimum fee such as that.
1974.74-70,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,859.482,870.103,Would that not be a possible consequence of no standards for fees?
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,870.103,871.262,"I don't think so, Your Honor."
1974.74-70,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,878.76,883.48,"Minimum schedules have been disappearing, have they not over the country as a whole?"
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,883.48,884.313,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.74-70,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,938.986,948.754,"Well, what if you just out of a law school and hung up your shingle and somebody comes to you and asks for a divorce, how do you know what to charge him, if you don't have some guidance from somewhere?"
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,948.754,955.359,"Your Honor, I would say first thing I would do before I hung up my shingle is I will go around and talk to my fellow members of the bar."
1974.74-70,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,967.63,977.442,"Well, isn't that one purpose of at least a suggested minimum fee schedule is to kind of distill the experience of other lawyers and say, this is about what we get for it?"
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,977.442,989.752,"Your Honor, that maybe a purpose, but that would be a purpose at almost any other form of price fixing and we don't allow any antitrust laws and I think Congress wisely said, “No, that's not what we're going to permit.”"
1974.74-70,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,989.752,996.495,But it will be all right for a lawyer to go out and talk to 10 other lawyers and see what they were charging and charge the same thing himself?
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,996.495,999.986,"If he felt that was a fair, just and reasonable fee, absolutely Your Honor."
1974.74-70,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1006.187,1011.641,Haven't corporations got in trouble during just that?[Laughter]
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1011.641,1022.906,"If they've asked them what they in fact charged Your Honor with respect to a particular matter perhaps so that if they're asking, “What are you charging for a particular price?”"
1974.74-70,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1040.401,1057.684,"I realize you don't have very much time, but are you going to refer at all to the possible impact of this case depending on its outcome on group prepaid legal services?"
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1057.684,1060.637,"Your Honor, that is a matter of great concern to me personally."
1974.74-70,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1124.586,1130.883,"Mr. Morrison, did the Fairfax Bar make any statement when they withdrew their fee schedule recently?"
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1130.883,1139.091,"There is Your Honor in its brief in opposition to a certiorari, there is a resolution which is their full statement."
1974.74-70,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1147.324,1152.165,Does that statement contain a justification for their action?
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1152.165,1154.617,"I wouldn't want to characterize it one way or the other, Your Honor."
1974.74-70,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1154.617,1156.341,"Alright, I'll ask the other side."
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1156.341,1162.943,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1974.74-70,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1313.403,1318.568,"May I just, if I may before you get into that, I want to be sure I understand your previous point."
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1345.02,1361.176,"That's certainly true, Your Honor and to the extent to which the special status of the bar becomes relevant of course it is in the rule of recent cases where like every other characteristics of a business or an industry we certainly must look to the obligations of that industry in its peculiarities."
1974.74-70,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1361.176,1381.072,"That people in their learned profession let's say you had three or four PhD's and a couple of doctors or divinities, a divinity and maybe a dentist and an MD, all members of learned professions, but that they could conspire to violate the antitrust laws if the effect of that were on the general public, is that it?"
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1381.072,1381.872,That's correct.
1974.74-70,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1382.841,1394.132,"If but on the other hand if the effect were wholly within divinity school or university graduate school, they might be learned profession exemption, is that it?"
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1394.132,1401.229,"I gave an example in my brief, Your Honor of lawyers agreeing that 60 years is an appropriate time for title examination."
1974.74-70,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1419.808,1422.642,What about agreements not to advertise?
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1422.642,1426.137,"Your Honor, that of course is not the very case we have before us."
1974.74-70,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1447.864,1451.274,"Well, I thought you say, if it comes on a per se, what do you think about that?"
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1451.274,1460.379,"Your Honor, I read the case cited by American Bar Association and if I have to extrapolate, I would say that that probably is a per se violation."
1974.74-70,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1471.053,1475.376,"How about a rule, how about agreements not to solicit otherwise than advertising?"
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1475.376,1482.629,I would say Your Honor that it is under the same rule and that if the bar needs an exemption; there are two ways that the bar can get an exemption.
1974.74-70,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1490.675,1495.855,If that was a -- you would say if there was a specific state statute that forbade solicitation?
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1495.855,1498.433,"That's right, where the state has made a decision to --"
1974.74-70,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1498.433,1499.923,You have pure Parker against Brown.
1974.74-70,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1499.923,1527.042,"Exactly, Your Honor, or if Congress as Congress has so often done for other business problems, labor unions, the airlines, fair trade laws, there are whole raft of areas in which Congress has said, no competition is not to be all and end all for everybody, not on the state by state business, but for everybody and we want those situations to be covered by another rule."
1974.74-70,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1833.211,1834.442,Very well.
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1842.043,1844.249,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-70,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1950.122,1952.787,We'll resume there at 1 o'clock.
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1966.743,1967.415,Mr. Chief Justice --
1974.74-70,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1967.415,1975.677,"Mr. Solicitor General, I don't mean to entrench on your very short time, but is somebody from your side of the elect is going to discuss interstate commerce?"
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1975.677,1979.182,"Well, we had hoped that Mr. Morrison would, he did not."
1974.74-70,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1984.326,1989.53,And these -- were these particular plaintiffs no lender outside of Virginia?
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,1989.53,1991.91,"Well, I don't think the plaintiffs have to affect interstate commerce."
1974.74-70,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1999.159,2004.717,In the specific cases or in the generality of their law practices?
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2004.717,2014.931,"Well, I think in this case, the effect upon the interstate commerce Mr. Chief Justice is the particular fees being charged on closings of the real estate."
1974.74-70,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2014.931,2016.923,With the particular people who are plaintiffs?
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2016.923,2052.347,"The particular people who are plaintiffs are people who purchased a home and had somewhat inflated cost with the minimum fee schedule, but it's not necessary that the plaintiffs be in interstate commerce as long as the violation affects interstate commerce and I think under cases like Employing Plasterers case and Burke against Ford, and so forth where it is necessarily true that the -- and the law infers it and the law implies it that the flow of mortgage money into the state for example will be diminished as the price rises, that standard price theory upon which the interest law operates."
1974.74-70,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2052.347,2055.931,Where do you get that legal inference from?
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2055.931,2056.675,A legal inference?
1974.74-70,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2056.675,2057.254,Yes.
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2057.254,2068.455,"Well, I think it was first enunciated in the Joint-Traffic case in 1897 by Mr. Justice Peckham when he said that a restraint of trade was a lessening of the flow of commerce which could be inferred from a rise in the price."
1974.74-70,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2068.455,2071.848,And that that same would carryover to mortgage money into Northern Virginia?
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2071.848,2090.853,"Yes, and the Employing Plasterers case and the Employing Lathers case in around Chicago I believe the court inferred that the flow of building materials into the area would be diminished as the prices were raised artificially and that gives you the necessary effect upon interstate commerce I believe."
1974.74-70,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2141.729,2154.579,That maybe one thing for a box of matches and at least some people have thought in the past including the Justice Holmes and others that that was perhaps a different thing when it came to the services of professional people?
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2154.579,2164.116,"Well, I think the bar Mr. Chief Justice has perfect authority to disciple for shoddy work which deprives the client of effective legal representation."
1974.74-70,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2175.823,2181.818,Is there much evidence that that has been done?
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2181.818,2184.599,I -- across the country as a matter of fact --
1974.74-70,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2184.599,2185.058,Anywhere?
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2185.058,2195.512,"-- professional discipline is perhaps not been as effective as it should be, but I think now we're discussing and in this case, there's been discipline for cutting fees."
1974.74-70,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2395.415,2415.179,"Well, what about the State Supreme Court proving a ethical standards that indicate that ethical conduct are reasonable fee as you take in to account of fee schedules as an element?"
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2415.179,2417.219,You mean in the terms of state action Mr. Justice White?
1974.74-70,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2417.219,2419.985,Yes.
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2429.858,2454.372,"I think the -- in this case, I think Canon 12 says that of the fact is that it maybe considered are customary fees which may not be fee schedules or I think maybe the market range of fees, but that aside, perhaps I can answer your question best moving to the case where a state Supreme Court does put out a fee schedule and says abide by it as a matter of ethics."
1974.74-70,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2477.218,2485.383,"But that statute said, “You may impose fee schedules if you want it Mr. Supreme Court” and Supreme Court did."
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2485.383,2485.555,Oh!
1974.74-70,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2496.256,2497.742,There is nothing close to that here you say?
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2497.742,2499.376,Nothing close to that at all.
1974.74-70,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2499.376,2508.091,"Well Mr. Solicitor General, suppose you have -- you're under a state constitutional system where the legislature can't do this sort of thing, but the court may?"
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2508.091,2508.226,Oh!
1974.74-70,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2530.499,2532.946,If it's that fees?
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2532.946,2535.049,If it's that fees but does anything else that is --
1974.74-70,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2535.049,2540.073,Do you suggest that the whole state agency here has set the fee in this case?
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2540.073,2542.193,"No, the state agency I don't believe has set a fee in this case."
1974.74-70,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2542.193,2549.626,"Because what I thought that this problem Lathrop and Donahue involved a state Supreme Court, but did have legislative authority."
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2553.445,2554.54,Uh-huh!
1974.74-70,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2611.42,2614.663,But how about an agreement not to advertise?
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2614.663,2621.534,I think the agreement not to advertise becomes between the examples I just gave and the straight price fixing which we have here.
1974.74-70,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2621.534,2623.21,So do I since I have asked the question.
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2623.21,2626.374,Yes.[Laughter]
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2626.374,2645.055,"And to say that this is per se illegal, I think it's not to say that advertising is and frankly I think the question of the relationship of advertising where the ban upon it to the lawyers, to the legal professions, professional and ethical obligations is a question that would have to be decided on a full record."
1974.74-70,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2654.704,2656.606,"And the same goes for solicitation, I suppose?"
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2656.606,2659.381,"I believe so, yes, Mr. Justice White."
1974.74-70,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2681.545,2686.571,"It would be a little hard to communicate that without advertising, wouldn't it?"
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2686.571,2689.453,"Well, I think most I mean the better services, Mr. Chief Justice?"
1974.74-70,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2689.453,2689.966,Yes.
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2689.966,2691.041,I think --
1974.74-70,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2691.041,2695.291,Except as it passes by word of mouth for the man's reputation?
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2695.291,2698.705,"Yes, it would be but I trust that --"
1974.74-70,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2698.705,2701.093,Or a woman's reputation?[Attempt to Laughter]
1974.74-70,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2701.093,2710.844,Wouldn't the agreement among bankers as respect to increase on purchase [Indiscernible]
1974.74-70,1,38778,robert_h_bork,,2710.844,2713.673,By the Sherman Act I certainly think it would Mr. Justice Douglas.
1974.74-70,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2758.591,2760.339,"Mr. Booker, you may proceed."
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,2760.339,2763.981,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-70,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2883.622,2885.356,Mortgage money?
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,2886.818,2887.399,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.74-70,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2887.743,2894.863,"Isn't that by the decision in this Court in Interstate Commerce Commission, all mortgage money?"
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,2894.863,2898.444,"If Your Honor please, this money did not move out of Virginia."
1974.74-70,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2898.444,2900.115,How did it get there?
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,2900.115,2904.187,"The money -- it was a Savings and Loan Association in Arlington, Virginia, Your Honor."
1974.74-70,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2912.295,2916.368,"The flow of mortgage money is not an interstate commerce, you say."
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,2916.368,2918.626,Whether the flow of mortgage money is in interstate --
1974.74-70,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2918.626,2923.304,You said one phrase which this Court has used.
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,2923.304,2930.562,We submit that not in this instance has certainly no showing that the money which the Goldfarb's borrowed flowed in interstate commerce.
1974.74-70,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3013.062,3017.641,Did you mean he used the phrase disobey the Canons of Ethics?
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,3017.641,3024.662,The Canons of Ethics prescribe what an attorney must consider in fixing the fee Your Honor.
1974.74-70,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3026.178,3031.073,Could he follow those canons if it set it at less to this fee?
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,3031.073,3031.74,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1974.74-70,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3031.74,3035.693,Could he follow the canons that set the fee at less than this?
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,3035.693,3037.176,"Absolutely, he could have Your Honor."
1974.74-70,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3037.176,3039.272,And what would happen to him if he did?
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,3039.272,3044.709,"If he consistently did it for the purpose of solicitation, he could be disciplined."
1974.74-70,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3044.709,3048.241,"Let's say if he just consistently did it, he would be disciplined?"
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,3048.241,3050.23,"He might or might not be disciplined, Your Honor."
1974.74-70,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3237.677,3243.398,How about Judge Bryan's findings on page 9 and 10 of the appendix?
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,3248.815,3265.598,"Yes Your Honor, but that as a conclusion of law, we submit in this Court as the Fourth Circuit has the right to review that and the Fourth Circuit did review that and the Fourth Circuit concluded there were no substantial effect on Interstate commerce."
1974.74-70,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3268.785,3277.715,Do you agree with the Solicitor General that the test is whether the defendant's activities affect Interstate commerce rather than whether the plaintiff's activity was in the interstate commerce?
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,3277.715,3279.257,"No sir, we do not."
1974.74-70,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3710.765,3721.269,Do you have any doubt that the Virginia legislature could provide by law that minimum fee schedules were against the law in Virginia?
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,3721.269,3723.978,Virginia has an antitrust law.
1974.74-70,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3730.14,3737.078,"What if the Virginia legislature in its next session were to say, “We don't care whether the federal antitrust laws apply or not."
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,3743.602,3746.353,"Certainly, the problem of Interstate commerce is solved by that."
1974.74-70,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3781.64,3784.415,Does is it still have to run in [Inaudible] statute?
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,3784.415,3786.202,"Yes, it does Your Honor."
1974.74-70,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3789.642,3792.945,"I still withdraw from it, would it come."
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,3798.182,3802.81,"Well, I'm -- that's all I chimed in, Your Honor."
1974.74-70,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4224.18,4233.845,"Mr. Booker, this doesn't bear on this case, but I'm looking at the next case down the road."
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,4255.503,4258.672,"Your Honor, I speak only for a Bar Association."
1974.74-70,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4291.642,4295.646,Your retroactivity point goes only to the damages?
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,4295.646,4296.66,That's correct Your Honor.
1974.74-70,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4296.66,4298.86,Was there a prayer for an injunction here?
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,4298.86,4299.969,There was.
1974.74-70,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4299.969,4301.036,Is that moot or not?
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,4301.036,4304.943,It is moot because the Fairfax Bar Association has rescinded its schedule.
1974.74-70,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4304.943,4308.221,I thought so.
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,4314.106,4318.288,"In this case if there is to be prospective application only, that's correct Your Honor."

1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,4354.774,4364.037,We would suggest to that point the case is moot Your Honor because the fee schedule has been rescinded and because if there is no question --
1974.74-70,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4364.037,4372.469,"(Voice Overlap) antitrust principle, does continuance of the antitrust violation doesn't guarantee that should not be gathering injunction?"
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,4372.469,4378.047,"Your Honor, I hesitate to reach that point because we say there is no antitrust violation here, but assuming we're wrong on that."
1974.74-70,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4378.047,4378.449,Yes.
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,4378.449,4401.599,"Assuming we're wrong on that, we say that the fact that a practice which everyone regarded as a proper practice until a suit was brought in this case but which has now been discontinued, was discontinued long before they have been in the definitive statement by this Court is moot."
1974.74-70,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4411.725,4413.773,But you're not -- you're just speaking of Fairfax County Bar?
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,4413.773,4414.885,I am Your Honor.
1974.74-70,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4418.075,4425.541,"May or may not be moot even if you're right about the mootness to your client, it may or may not be moot as to the Virginia State Bar?"
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,4425.541,4429.958,It may not be and I speak not to the mootness as to the question as to the Virginia State Bar.
1974.74-70,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4429.958,4435.99,"Mr. Booker, would you give me your answer to the question I asked to Mr. Morrison?"
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,4435.99,4436.826,"Yes, sir."
1974.74-70,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4436.826,4444.042,As to what is the Fairfax Bar's stated justification for the rescission of the schedule?
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,4444.042,4455.886,"If Your Honor please, the Fairfax Bar Association has long since exhausted all of its resources and ability and means to defend this litigation."
1974.74-70,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4497.523,4501.194,"So, you're not charging a minimum fee schedule?"
1974.74-70,2,34192,lewis_t_booker,,4501.194,4517.107,"We are not, Your Honor."
1974.74-70,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4517.107,4519.911,Mr. Attorney General.
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,4519.911,4523.707,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.74-70,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4906.51,4914.614,Was there a good deal of variation among the various localities of the state?
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,4914.614,4916.927,That is exactly correct sir.
1974.74-70,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4966.287,4974.195,"Mr. Attorney General, what is the State Bar done since the injunction was issued?"
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,4974.195,4978.99,As far as issuing advisory opinions?
1974.74-70,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4978.99,4981.204,As far as this case is concerned?
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,4981.204,5003.482,"Well, sir of course as far as the State Bar is concerned, the State Bar was not found to have then in violation of the Sherman Act and as a consequence the State Bar has proceeded to continue with respect to its operations as mandated by the rules of court adopted by the Supreme Court of Virginia."
1974.74-70,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5003.482,5006.141,In regard to minimum fees?
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5006.141,5015.91,I know no instance in which an advisory opinion has been requested Your Honor of the State Bar since this case started with respect to minimum of fees.
1974.74-70,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5027.019,5031.512,Is there any more suggested fee set up?
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5031.512,5040.116,I know of no plans of the Virginia State Bar to send out another report such as was set out in 1962 and 1969 Your Honor.
1974.74-70,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5040.116,5052.341,Do you -- if the Supreme Court has not required any local bar to make up a minimum fee schedule or has it required lawyers to follow it?
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5052.341,5061.986,I think that the record reflects Your Honor that in 1962 there were some 21 minimum fee schedules in effect local associations of --
1974.74-70,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5061.986,5066.426,But the Supreme Court hasn't required local bars to propound them?
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5066.426,5070.726,"Well, that was my point of course because there are many more local bar associations in 21 (Voice Overlap)."
1974.74-70,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5070.726,5088.22,"Yes and I suppose if it did require, Fairfax would not have discontinued its fee schedule and certainly the State Bar has neither required nor suggested that local bars have a minimum fee schedules."
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5088.22,5094.258,"As far as the State Bar is concerned, it is not required to local bar associations adopt the minimum fee schedule."
1974.74-70,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5095.82,5096.702,"Now, --"
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5096.702,5097.157,Excuse me --
1974.74-70,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5097.157,5104.938,-- and you're still suggesting however that there's enough official action than the fee schedules to satisfy Parker?
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5104.938,5108.66,"As far as the State Bar is concerned, I don't think there any question about it sir."
1974.74-70,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5108.66,5113.122,"What do you mean, or you mean it does or it doesn't?[Attempt to Laughter]"
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5113.122,5119.985,"Well, I mean that in fact, the Parker doctrine applies to the State Bar."
1974.74-70,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5119.985,5124.852,"Well, it hasn't required anything of the local bar association?"
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5124.852,5132.744,"Well, as representing the State Bar sir, the suit is against the State Bar as well as against the local bar association."
1974.74-70,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5142.074,5149.508,Has the Supreme Court required the State Bar to adopt or suggest minimum fee schedule?
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5149.508,5151.941,I think if you take a look at the --
1974.74-70,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5151.941,5153.77,"Well, it hasn't, hasn't it?"
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5156.31,5162.198,"As far as what the State Bar has done in this instance which is the issue advisory opinions, there are two of them."
1974.74-70,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5193.525,5208.746,"Well, would you suppose that Parker against Brown is satisfied or the exemption that comes into being if the state simply passes a law and says the sellers of tobacco in the state may now agree if they want to on prices."
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5208.746,5228.273,I think Your Honor that this case is complete different from the Asheville Board of Trade which I assume you maybe referring to because there was a local association of warehousemen who said about to restrict their prices and restrict selling space on the floors of the warehouses.
1974.74-70,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5231.619,5233.734,How about my question though Mr. Attorney General?
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5243.16,5244.779,"No sir, it does not."
1974.74-70,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5244.779,5259.605,"And so if the Supreme Court simply authorize the State Bars to propound but didn't require it, if you want to propound fees, go ahead, if you --"
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5259.605,5269.841,I thought I alluded to that point earlier in saying that the State Bar has not promulgated the fee schedule here which is applicable to all attorneys in the state.
1974.74-70,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5311.582,5321.746,Do you think the State Bar would be with its authority if it to put out an order to as an administrative agency of the state which you suggested that it is.
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5337.834,5343.555,It is not because that has not been authorized by the legislature or the Supreme Court of Virginia.
1974.74-70,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5350.075,5351.362,"Well, but it isn't?"
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5351.362,5353.172,"No, and it hasn't been done."
1974.74-70,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5353.172,5354.871,"Yes, all right."
1974.74-70,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5355.474,5355.968,"Attorney General, --"
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5355.968,5356.464,"Yes, sir."
1974.74-70,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5356.464,5377.358,"In Virginia is there any state law or court regulations specifically and explicitly regulating fees to be paid in the administration of a state -- of the decedent's estate, do you have probate courts or I'm sure you have the equivalent whatever you call them?"
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5377.358,5377.761,"No, sir."
1974.74-70,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5377.761,5392.131,"In many states, there are statutes or court rules which explicitly provide what the fee shall be to counsel for the executor or administrator of a decedent's estate."
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5393.318,5396.046,"No sir, we do not."
1974.74-70,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5396.046,5404.823,"And are those, I guess then are covered by or the of 1969 State Bar Report, are they?"
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5404.823,5408.146,"Well, that would as again just a report, it was not a requirement that in fact those fees to be charged."
1974.74-70,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5408.146,5409.76,Yes.
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5410.952,5411.974,That is correct sir.
1974.74-70,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5411.974,5423.806,"This was simply by way of a service of the State Bar association to its local components, is that what you suggest about that analysis?"
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5423.806,5432.144,"Well, I think, may it please Mr. Chief Justice that you have as far as the Code of the Professional Responsibility two concerns."
1974.74-70,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5462.771,5470.952,"You say that they all showing that excessive charges, do have any opinions on that?"
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5470.952,5484.949,"Well, I think DR 2-106 clearly states that a lawyer shall not enter into an agreement for charge or collect an illegal or clearly excessive fee."
1974.74-70,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5484.949,5486.674,And was that the case that was involved?
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5493.583,5496.724,You're talking about the present case that --
1974.74-70,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5496.724,5499.207,"Well, in that case there."
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5506.357,5516.315,All I'm trying to suggest to the Court is that the Code of Professional Responsibility deals with both aspects excessive fees on the one hand and solicitation on the other.
1974.74-70,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5516.419,5527.43,"Well, I find an excessive fee as being very unethical but I have great difficulty in finding a lower than minimum fee unethical?"
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5527.43,5533.83,"Well, sir, I think that if you take a look at the --"
1974.74-70,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5533.83,5535.119,Go ahead in your response.
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5535.119,5537.904,"Alright, thank you sir."
1974.74-70,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5563.217,5566.125,"But this is to be a presumption, doesn't it?"
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5566.125,5568.814,"No sir, I don't -- I would not regard it as a presumption."
1974.74-70,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5572.932,5577.791,A violation of ethics when you don't charge me as much as you should?
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5577.791,5578.258,"Well, sir, I think --"
1974.74-70,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5578.258,5583.408,I think that's very ethical for some.[Laughter]
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5583.408,5584.4,I think that --
1974.74-70,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5584.4,5587.815,"You do agree, don't you?"
1974.74-70,3,16592,andrew_p_miller,,5587.815,5591.121,"I'd enjoy representing you on some occasion, Your Honor."
1974.74-70,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5592.481,5594.319,Thank you Mr. Attorney General.
1974.74-70,4,16500,alan_b_morrison,,5599.544,5601.387,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1974.74-70,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5646.514,5653.853,"But you are however attacking this minimum fee schedule only insofar as that is involves title examination, are you?"
1974.74-70,4,16500,alan_b_morrison,,5653.853,5657.948,The complaint is directed in that solely toward title examination.
1974.74-70,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5671.377,5674.905,Even though they would clearly not affect interstate commerce at all --
1974.74-70,4,16500,alan_b_morrison,,5674.905,5675.36,I think that's right.
1974.74-70,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5675.36,5681.889,-- writing a local -- little old lady's will in a small town and right in the middle of the state?
1974.74-70,4,16500,alan_b_morrison,,5681.889,5684.557,"That's right, Your Honor.[Laughter]"
1974.74-70,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5687.817,5689.772,Or didn't have any out-of-state property?
1974.74-70,4,16500,alan_b_morrison,,5689.772,5690.585,That's right.[Laughter]
1974.74-70,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5806.521,5807.24,Thank you gentlemen.
