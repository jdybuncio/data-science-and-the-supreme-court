2014.13-684,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.456,"We'll hear argument next in Case 13-684, Jesinoski v. Countrywide Home Loans."
2014.13-684,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,10.439,12.891,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-684,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,79.783,87.522,"Well, let's talk -- let's talk about the first thing you say rescission is affected by."
2014.13-684,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,144.476,148.777,"--Well, Congress could have written Section 1635(a) that way, but it didn't."
2014.13-684,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,175.011,175.745,"Well, wait, wait, wait, wait."
2014.13-684,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,192.472,196.941,"--Well, the statute actually does say that in the (b) provision, Justice Scalia."
2014.13-684,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,215.572,247.374,"Yes, but -- but in common law you had to give back in what you had received, and you have -- you -- you are urging that the statute creates a system in which a -- a creditor who has a secured interest, simply because somebody comes up almost 3 years later and says, you didn't give me two copies of this particular document, I got only one copy, and even if that's not true, immediately the secured interest is converted into an unsecured interest."
2014.13-684,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,256.732,261.551,"Well, the language of the statute actually makes that very clear, and so do the regulations."
2014.13-684,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,297.424,299.576,Could you just explain how you -- how you think this would play out?
2014.13-684,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,317.787,318.353,--Correct.
2014.13-684,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,318.353,322.138,"And what if the obligor says at that point, I don't have it, I've spent it."
2014.13-684,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,322.138,322.705,Okay.
2014.13-684,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,322.988,323.538,Then what happens?
2014.13-684,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,324.923,332.01,"--The statute answers that question, Justice Alito, in 1635(b), and that's the second page of the addendum to our blue brief."
2014.13-684,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,332.01,332.427,How does it answer it?
2014.13-684,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,332.427,341.715,"It answers the question by making clear that the process that you set forth is what's supposed to happen automatically, but then the very last sentence, which reads,"
2014.13-684,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,406.908,411.543,"Well, suppose -- suppose the rescission notice is really improper."
2014.13-684,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,441.829,442.681,That -- that's right.
2014.13-684,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,474.633,484.758,So -- so the borrower has to send its notice that it's not -- does not agree with the right to rescind within the 3-year period?
2014.13-684,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,484.758,486.943,"The -- the -- yes, that's right."
2014.13-684,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,489.562,496.982,"Suppose -- suppose the -- suppose the notice comes 3 days before the 3-year period ends, and the bank just doesn't have time?"
2014.13-684,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,496.982,507.689,"--No, the bank under the procedures in Section (b) has 20 days in which to tend -- to pay back the loan proceeds that had been conferred to the borrower."
2014.13-684,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,537.559,549.366,"Mr. Frederick, the bank, as soon as it receives the notice of rescission -- one of the benefits for people who don't want to pay a mortgage is that it suspends the mortgage payments; correct?"
2014.13-684,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,549.366,550.416,That's correct.
2014.13-684,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,550.416,551.1,All right.
2014.13-684,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,552.652,553.585,Although if I could interrupt--
2014.13-684,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,553.585,554.335,--isn't it -- I'm sorry.
2014.13-684,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,554.335,554.654,--Sorry.
2014.13-684,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,559.906,566.645,"But for those who don't, the bank can file a declaratory judgment suit?"
2014.13-684,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,566.645,567.145,That's correct.
2014.13-684,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,567.145,568.028,All right.
2014.13-684,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,570.964,571.38,That's correct.
2014.13-684,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,637.169,654.964,"Before -- before you do, Mr. Frederick, you are recognizing that the only recourse the lender has if the borrower is -- is claiming something that is baseless, the only recourse is to bring a declaratory judgment action?"
2014.13-684,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,654.964,655.647,No.
2014.13-684,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,710.284,715.771,So why do you think it is that Congress didn't say how we resolve disputes in this context?
2014.13-684,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,715.771,731.715,"Well, I think that the -- the answer to that is that Congress expected that this unilateral right of rescission was going to be exercised in a simple way through the written notification and that what has happened is--"
2014.13-684,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,731.715,739.486,"But Congress couldn't have thought that every time there was a notification, the -- the lender was going to agree with the borrower that it was appropriate."
2014.13-684,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,751.111,754.396,"--It is a puzzling feature, Justice Kagan, and I can't deny that."
2014.13-684,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,853.01,855.877,You're reading an awful lot into that section.
2014.13-684,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,866.416,867.199,That's right.
2014.13-684,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,904.388,914.846,"Mr. Frederick, does your argument depend on us agreeing with the proposition that the rescission is completed at the time the notice is set?"
2014.13-684,0,20869,david_c_frederick,,914.846,921.599,"I think that it -- no, but it does depend on accepting the idea that rescission is just cancellation."
2014.13-684,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,931.205,932.141,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-684,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,944.882,947.834,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-684,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,995.982,996.782,Or the statute of limitations.
2014.13-684,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,996.782,1001.901,"--Or a statute of limitations as this Court has already decided in Beach, that was one of the holdings of Beach."
2014.13-684,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1067.861,1071.982,Suppose the bank -- suppose the bank thinks that the notice of rescission is just completely baseless.
2014.13-684,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1075.184,1075.517,--No.
2014.13-684,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1075.517,1078.136,It can -- it can just sit there and wait and be sued.
2014.13-684,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1078.136,1078.919,"That's right, Your Honor."
2014.13-684,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1098.215,1100.199,"Excuse me, (b), boy?"
2014.13-684,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1100.199,1100.917,"--(B), boy, yes."
2014.13-684,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1121.231,1138.524,"How would that apply in this case where I take it the -- the lender's position is we're being charged with not providing a second copy, and we did provide a second copy; therefore, this is a baseless claim."
2014.13-684,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1138.524,1148.398,"At that point, I think the lender is making -- going to have to make a judgment in this case and in other cases about whether it thinks the notice is valid."
2014.13-684,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1189.475,1201.867,"What would you do if you were the lender or the lender's attorney and you had a situation where just before the 3 years expire, the borrower sends a letter and they say: We didn't get two copies?"
2014.13-684,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1222.196,1224.882,I think what you would do would depend on the circumstances.
2014.13-684,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1224.882,1226.132,Those are the circumstances.
2014.13-684,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1228.567,1229.034,Right.
2014.13-684,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1320.174,1326.697,Mr. Frederick just said that what has happened in a lot of these cases is like mini-bankruptcy proceedings in State court.
2014.13-684,1,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1327.697,1340.204,"Well, I think what's happened under Section 1635(b) is that courts have taken that last sentence of Section 1635(b) as essentially the power to do equity in a particular case."
2014.13-684,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1467.301,1469.136,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1480.611,1484.146,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2014.13-684,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1530.625,1548.253,"Mr. Waxman, please review what you just said because, as I understand it, the lender has to give the borrower a notice of opportunity to rescind which says, the borrower may cancel."
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1568.85,1571.186,That's correct.
2014.13-684,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1672.067,1675.771,But that's not the position that the government has.
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1692.731,1710.859,"Well, that is our position, and when my friend, Mr. Frederick says, you know, we've never found any case of a windfall under (b), the answer isn't because in an amendment in 1995 Congress said that -- in the last sentence of (b) -- that a court can modify this."
2014.13-684,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1721.816,1723.752,But it happens in the law all the time.
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1738.945,1740.262,That's correct.
2014.13-684,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1741.13,1743.097,But you don't get the right to rescission.
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1759.008,1780.605,"--That is not our position, and I don't think the other side has ever cited a case in which -- we can debate whether this is called a statute of repose, but let's just accept what this Court said in Beach, which is after 3 years the substantive right for which the remedy of rescission is available expires."
2014.13-684,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1780.605,1784.241,But in Beach there was no notice within the 3 years.
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1784.241,1796.298,"Justice Ginsburg, I don't think anybody is disagreeing that everything that the Court said in Beach was not -- that we're each relying on, is dicta because there was no notice."
2014.13-684,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1850.351,1851.418,This isn't at common law.
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1860.69,1869.98,And there is -- nobody is arguing that Congress didn't tinker with the common law procedure either in law or equity.
2014.13-684,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1881.537,1903.217,"That's a very -- that's a very -- you're putting an awful lot of weight on a tiny, one-sentence provision in (g) that's called “ additional relief ” that -- I think it would be very odd if that's where Congress decided to place the provision that tells you what happened -- what happens when there's exercise of the right to rescind."
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1903.217,1908.605,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think one needs to understand the context in which that provision was enacted."
2014.13-684,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1936.272,1942.259,"Well, that seems right, Mr. Waxman, that people understood that there would be litigation and (g) is an acknowledgment of that."
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1980.884,2022.796,"Justice Kagan, the -- (g) was intended -- and we know this very clearly and I think it's pretty obvious from the language -- what had happened in litigation before 1995 was that borrowers -- where a lender said, nope that's not valid, I'm not rescinding, I'm not going to go through the unwinding process of (b), the borrowers had a choice of filing a suit for damages under 1640, which has a 1-year statute of limitations, or pursuing in an action for rescission, for a court award of rescission."
2014.13-684,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2080.316,2081.499,"For rescission, you mean?"
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2081.499,2082.851,"--For rescission, I'm sorry."
2014.13-684,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2109.502,2115.156,It hasn't spoken directly when it sets out a specific procedure for the parties to follow?
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2115.156,2116.24,--It sets out a--
2014.13-684,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2116.24,2119.624,It spells out -- tells the borrower: Put the notice.
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2129.665,2161.97,"--Spoken utterly clearly about all of those things and it also said what happens in the mine run of these late notification cases that -- I mean between 3 days and 3 years of the consummation of the transaction, that if the borrower -- if the lender says your notice is invalid, no rescission -- by any definition rescission has not taken place and the borrower's recourse is a suit for an award of rescission as it would have been under common law."
2014.13-684,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2164.755,2175.794,Am I correct the government says rescission has taken place if the borrower is right and it has not taken place if the borrower is wrong?
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2175.794,2180.432,--I'm not exactly sure what the government's position is.
2014.13-684,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2188.104,2189.838,"No, no, no, no."
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2200.845,2224.211,"Well, our -- I don't know what the government's position is on that, but I know what our position is, which is if the lender receives the notice and says, yep, this is timely, subsection (b) very specifically -- you know, with respect to the common law -- explains the steps that have to occur to achieve rescission."
2014.13-684,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2250.011,2253.396,"Well, I take it they do have to occur or there are going to be damages at least."
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2273.81,2276.36,"--So here's what happens, if the bank--"
2014.13-684,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2276.36,2277.029,There is a rescission.
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2277.029,2291.938,--There is a rescission -- I think there are two very different things here that address -- in 1635(g) and 1640 and this Court's decision in Beach underscores just exactly how much those two things are different.
2014.13-684,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2408.496,2412.284,"Let's talk about (g), about the rescission occurring or not."
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2415.15,2415.802,--Yes.
2014.13-684,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2416.202,2421.723,But the exercise of the right doesn't mean that the act will have come about.
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2421.723,2422.823,--Of course.
2014.13-684,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2422.823,2428.81,You -- you answered me earlier that a court doesn't have to finish within the three years.
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2437.483,2438.466,"No, no--"
2014.13-684,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2438.466,2440.618,Why is that so illogical?
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2444.086,2445.088,--The right--
2014.13-684,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2445.088,2448.707,An exercise of a right is in accordance with the terms of the contract.
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2448.707,2458.846,"--The question -- I mean, the right of rescission means in (a), as it says, the timely -- I mean, it doesn't define what the right of rescission is."
2014.13-684,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2495.871,2502.192,You just gave -- you just gave your case away when you said the exercise of the right is when you sent the notice.
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2502.192,2504.377,"No, but the -- but the problem -- no, no."
2014.13-684,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2532.894,2536.179,The question is whether that's the exercise of the right within three years.
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2536.179,2555.677,"--And the answer is no, because where the -- where the lender says I'm not -- I don't agree and we are not going to accomplish rescission in (b), the statute says, very commonsensically, the party that wants this extraordinary remedy can sue for an award of rescission."
2014.13-684,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2569.486,2570.669,Where does it say all that?
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2595.701,2596.951,No argument.
2014.13-684,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2596.951,2597.487,That's the end of it.
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2616.312,2618.48,"You are -- yes, Justice Breyer."
2014.13-684,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2618.48,2619.999,"Now -- now, how -- how do you get out of that?"
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2624.218,2625.484,"Justice Breyer, the “ it ”--"
2014.13-684,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2625.484,2625.986,--What?
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2625.986,2626.72,--when you say “ doing it ”--
2014.13-684,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2626.72,2627.286,Yes.
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2627.286,2630.705,--the “ it ” that you're required doing is sending the notice.
2014.13-684,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2634.257,2635.859,"No, that's not what it says at the beginning."
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2642.346,2644.382,"Yes, exactly."
2014.13-684,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2645.115,2648.849,So it doesn't say that's notice by notifying the creditor.
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2662.009,2663.642,--Let me -- let -- I don't think so.
2014.13-684,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2665.794,2666.261,I know you don't.
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2666.694,2680.72,"--You have to view the statute as a whole, and you have to view it in the context of how rescission -- what rescission meant at common law, what rescission means today, and how the rescissionary process -- what constitutes rescission."
2014.13-684,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2739.675,2741.611,Could I -- could I interrupt before you get to that?
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2759.655,2760.522,Yes.
2014.13-684,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2760.522,2771.646,"That -- that the notice is simply an exercise of your right to rescind, but rescission does not occur until there's the exchange that the common law?"
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2771.646,2771.996,Yes.
2014.13-684,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2781.852,2787.656,"But, Mr. Waxman, if that's right, so exercising the right to rescind is by notice."
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2806.969,2809.086,"--No, I think it's not."
2014.13-684,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2809.788,2817.942,"But it just says right there it's the right to rescission shall expire, and you agree that exercising the right of rescission is done by notice."
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2817.942,2820.044,--The -- as the -- no.
2014.13-684,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2905.58,2913.417,"By that, if you say the rescission doesn't -- the right to rescission has to be -- it just expires after three years."
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2917.705,2918.971,Well--
2014.13-684,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2918.971,2921.257,So -- so he -- we're just as much in the dark.
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2927.426,2928.193,--Deliberative.
2014.13-684,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2928.943,2933.997,"And -- and ten years later, there it is, sitting on his docket and -- and nobody knows."
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2940.834,2953.811,"Justice -- Justice Breyer, no one is contending in this -- in this case that a statute of repose, that is, a statute provides that an underlying right expires after some date certain."
2014.13-684,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2961.815,2962.198,Of course not.
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2962.198,2962.749,Of course not.
2014.13-684,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2962.749,2963.233,Of course not.
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2969.237,2969.67,Because--
2014.13-684,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2969.67,2975.422,--Since the -- the filing of the lawsuit no more determines the validity of the notice than it was determined three days before.
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2975.422,3006.626,"--Because -- because 1635(f) refers to the obligor's right of rescission and where the obligor has not obtained the rescission that he or she claims he has a right to, he can go to a court for an award of rescission and the statute tells him, you have to have a live underlying right of rescission before you invoke the court's jurisdiction to do it, which is exactly what happened at the common law in these circumstances."
2014.13-684,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3091.546,3092.232,What about the Board?
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3094.665,3097.967,There's nothing to say about Chevron in this case.
2014.13-684,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3270.031,3273.649,"Well, they'd have to do that anyway to foreclose."
2014.13-684,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3284.107,3303.352,"In most -- most foreclosure -- first of all, foreclosures may or may not occur, depending on whether the bank wants it and many, many, if not most, foreclosures are nonjudicial; so there's no judicial proceeding and a sale at foreclosure will, by everybody's understanding, vitiate the underlying right."
2014.13-684,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3303.885,3304.669,"Thank you, counsel."
2014.13-684,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3306.204,3308.989,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2014.13-684,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3393.058,3394.408,Why are two of these?
2014.13-684,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3394.408,3394.841,--I'm sorry?
2014.13-684,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3394.841,3396.176,Why are two of these?
2014.13-684,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3406.332,3407.449,And let me explain that.
2014.13-684,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3487.351,3497.908,"It -- it's always -- you know, I've signed two loans in I don't know how many years, two homes, but I thought at closing, I signed something acknowledging--"
2014.13-684,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3497.908,3498.441,Yes.
2014.13-684,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3499.075,3502.11,"--the bank kept one and presumably, it gave me another."
2014.13-684,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3503.245,3505.314,"--No, it's actually you get two."
2014.13-684,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3506.514,3510.299,I don't remember sending it back to the bank saying--
2014.13-684,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3510.299,3513.335,"--No, because you probably didn't cancel yours, Justice Sotomayor."
2014.13-684,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3513.335,3513.868,--Ah.
2014.13-684,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3513.868,3514.403,You keep the two--
2014.13-684,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3514.987,3518.639,But it -- but it's not too late.
2014.13-684,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3519.805,3522.274,It already is.
2014.13-684,3,20869,david_c_frederick,,3524.293,3526.659,Well -- but I -- but I do want to make one -- I do want to make one point.
2014.13-684,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3602.059,3603.075,"Thank you, counsel."
