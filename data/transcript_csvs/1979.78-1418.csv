1979.78-1418,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,74.633,We will hear arguments next in Bloomer against Liberty Mutual.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,80.809,83.68,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,182.107,200.083,"Of course, that argument is--that argument rejects the notion that the stevedore, the employer was intended to be, by Congress, to be completely free of any kind of liability in connection with third-party actions."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,200.083,201.718,"I don't think so, Your Honor, if I may --"
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,201.718,202.896,"Well, I know you don't think so."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,213.896,214.1,"Yes, but--"
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,214.1,215.542,In connection with third-party actions.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,215.542,223.357,"Yes, Your Honor, but this doesn't really expose the employer, the stevedore, to a new liability."
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,263.306,274.258,"By the way, is there something in the statute that says that the employer is entitled to get back his --"
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,274.258,274.825,No.
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,274.825,277.327,-- statutory -- his payment?
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,277.327,279.208,"No, Your Honor."
1979.78-1418,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,279.208,290.611,"Isn't that--I think that's very strange that the--after going through this whole process again in '72, they left the lien to just judicial decision."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,290.611,291.886,Well--
1979.78-1418,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,291.886,294.532,Isn't that the source of the lien?
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,294.532,297.01,Judicial decisions are the source of the lien.
1979.78-1418,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,301.745,306.258,Let me ask you this hypothetical question How much net would this man get now?
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,313.366,314.431,That's correct.
1979.78-1418,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,314.431,322.025,"And 23 net after the lawsuit was over, is that right?"
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,323.663,325.479,"Well, no, Your Honor --"
1979.78-1418,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,325.479,326.603,He started with --
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,326.603,327.72,"Oh, I see what you mean, Your Honor."
1979.78-1418,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,330.291,330.92,Yes.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,330.92,331.138,Yes.
1979.78-1418,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,331.138,336.961,He got 17 in installments while he was litigating and getting well in the hospital.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,336.961,338.108,"That's correct, sir."
1979.78-1418,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,338.108,341.167,And then he got 23 net after he finished his lawsuit.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,341.167,341.823,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1418,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,341.823,349.008,"Suppose there'd been no statute at all, and he was just suing on common law negligence."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,356.18,358.472,"He would still recover $40,000."
1979.78-1418,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,358.472,362.668,That would -- he's exactly in the same position as he would have been without any --
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,362.668,364.937,"Yes, that is correct."
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,376.294,378.184,"Well, he got the 17 one way or another, didn't he?"
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,378.184,379.561,I follow; I follow.
1979.78-1418,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,394.314,395.047,That's one way of putting it.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,403.671,408.1,"He winds up precisely with $40,000 in his pocket, yet."
1979.78-1418,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,416.529,426.3,"But as Justice White just pointed out, there's nothing in the compensation statute that tells us that this cost should be --"
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,426.3,426.832,Yes.
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,426.832,428.624,-- taken off.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,428.624,429.432,That is correct.
1979.78-1418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,432.576,441.698,"But most compensation statutes are enacted as substitutes for an ordinary negligence action, are they not?"
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,441.698,443.167,"You say as substitutes, Your Honor?"
1979.78-1418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,443.167,444.289,Yes.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,444.289,450.868,"Well, I'm not exactly sure that the compensation statute was meant as a substitute for it."
1979.78-1418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,452.853,455.257,"I mean, against the man's own employer."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,475.017,476.052,That is correct.
1979.78-1418,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,480.542,487.327,"And he gets these medical benefits, and installments, monthly or weekly installments, right away, doesn't he?"
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,487.327,488.25,"Yes, he does, Your Honor."
1979.78-1418,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,488.25,491.637,So that he doesn't have to go out and borrow money or --
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,491.637,492.912,That is correct.
1979.78-1418,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,562.667,564.515,"Yes, but he's paid out the money."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,564.515,565.359,"Excuse me, sir?"
1979.78-1418,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,565.359,566.934,He's paid out the money.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,566.934,567.881,"Yes, he has."
1979.78-1418,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,575.961,578.662,"Well, that helps solve your case by saying that."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,578.662,580.465,"Well, somebody has to sue --"
1979.78-1418,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,580.465,585.997,It isn't gone at all if there's going to be a third-party recovery.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,585.997,588.55,"If there's going to be a third-party recovery, yes."
1979.78-1418,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,609.068,618.558,"But if the longshoreman doesn't sue, but the employer does, then the statute does determine -- then it does have provision for it."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,618.558,620.244,Yes.
1979.78-1418,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,620.244,627.627,"And the employer is going to recover out of the -- what he recovers from the third party, he's going to recover his attorney's fee."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,627.627,628.763,"Yes, he will."
1979.78-1418,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,628.763,632.189,So recovery's going to be cost -- free to him.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,632.189,633.37,"Yes, it will."
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,652.133,653.291,And his attorney's fee.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,653.291,654.848,And he gets the attorney's fee.
1979.78-1418,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,654.848,655.777,And?
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,655.777,657.275,And one-fifth of the balance.
1979.78-1418,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,657.275,662.527,So he comes out--he comes out not only cost-free but a little ahead of the game.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,662.527,663.611,That's correct.
1979.78-1418,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,676.623,678.311,Which he otherwise might not have?
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,678.311,678.926,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,678.926,680.762,Which he otherwise might not have?
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,680.762,692.827,"Which he otherwise would not have, because there are very few instances in the law that I know about where someone who sues gets his attorney's fees in addition to the proceeds of the lawsuit."
1979.78-1418,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,694.961,701.569,"Well, I know, but even if he didn't get his attorney's fee back, he might want to sue, because he's paid out a lot of money."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,701.569,702.435,If he did --
1979.78-1418,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,702.435,702.696,And he sues to get it back.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,702.696,704.627,If he did --
1979.78-1418,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,704.627,709.794,It's cheaper to get back 10 than nothing at all.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,716.808,718.325,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,720.571,724.453,"If the stevedore sues, he's suing his customer."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,724.453,728.319,"Yes, and they don't often do that, as a practical matter."
1979.78-1418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,811.14,814.012,"Well, isn't there an element of expressio unius in there."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,814.012,814.872,"I'm sorry, Your Honor?"
1979.78-1418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,814.872,818.9,Isn't there an element of expressio unius in there.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,818.9,820.457,I don't understand what you mean.
1979.78-1418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,820.457,838.898,"Well, the statute has made very specific provision for what shall happen when a stevedore sues, and all of the consequences which you have described; and it has made none for the apportionment of attorney's fees when the longshoreman sues."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,838.898,844.443,"That is a--Your Honor is correct, there's a void in the statute."
1979.78-1418,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,940.706,957.318,"Well, Congress certainly didn't expressly, or even impliedly -- well, I'll say expressly -- did not attempt to overturn or to reject the no-allocation approach that the cases on the books indicated."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,957.318,958.251,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1979.78-1418,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,958.251,965.519,"Well, there were cases, as you say, in 1972 there were cases on the books that said, no allocation of the attorney's fees."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,965.519,966.192,Yes.
1979.78-1418,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,966.192,968.879,And Congress made no effort to reject that approach.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,972.578,973.739,Yes.
1979.78-1418,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1061.973,1069.058,"Well, but the figures -- the hypothetical figures I gave you, he's much much better off than that."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1070.817,1071.268,I -- I'm --
1979.78-1418,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1071.268,1074.361,"He's got $40,000 on the hypothetical that I gave you."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1074.361,1075.844,"Yes, he got $40,000 and --"
1979.78-1418,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1075.844,1077.104,With or without this act.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1077.104,1078.15,Right.
1979.78-1418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1114.009,1129.568,"Mr. Rassner, what if the longshoreman has a medical policy of his own, so that a good deal of hospital costs and that sort of thing are -- come from a collateral source?"
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1144.092,1158.08,"Most of the time, Your Honor, a private insurance policy is not subrogated to the rights of the injured person, because the injured person is paying a premium for the policy."
1979.78-1418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1158.08,1161.437,That depends on whether a state follows a collateral source doctrine.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1161.437,1163.609,That's correct; that's correct.
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1285.671,1294.636,"Well, he may have to -- may have to make some kind of a judgment about whether to sue at all like most people do, whether it's worthwhile to sue."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1300.972,1301.762,"I'm sorry, I didn't --"
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1301.762,1304.513,He may just decide to leave it to his employer.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1304.513,1304.877,"Well, he may."
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1304.877,1305.987,It's going to be subject to --
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1305.987,1307.09,If he does --
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1307.09,1308.658,"Is it $10,000?"
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1317.136,1321.282,"If he does leave it to the employer, and the employer sues, fine."
1979.78-1418,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1323.045,1324.466,The employer may never sue.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1324.466,1326.029,The employer may never sue.
1979.78-1418,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1337.224,1350.589,"But if he goes to a lawyer and the lawyer says, ""Gee, I don't think you could ever recover more than $5,000, and frankly, mister, my fee would never warrant the time it would take."""
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1352.462,1353.816,"That's correct, sir."
1979.78-1418,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1368.283,1370.358,"Of course, that's just the issue, I suppose."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1371.522,1372.359,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1979.78-1418,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1372.359,1373.868,I guess that's really the issue?
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1373.868,1374.79,"Yes, it is the issue."
1979.78-1418,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1376.617,1386.098,"Even in your example, where we just went through it with Mr. Justice White, of a $10,000 recovery and a $6,000 paid in advance, and maybe $4,000 go for expenses and litigation."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1390.61,1390.714,There would --
1979.78-1418,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1390.714,1394.6,Maybe that's a pretty good idea; we just don't have incentives for lawsuits that aren't very valuable.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1394.6,1399.253,"There would not be an incentive -- there would be less of an incentive to bring a lawsuit, certainly."
1979.78-1418,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1400.123,1401.554,Under the Second Circuit rule.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1401.554,1403.228,"Under the Second Circuit rule, yes."
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1415.545,1422.2,"Well, the right is there, but you don't particularly want to encourage lawsuits that are not going to benefit the economy as a whole."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1426.423,1426.536,Well --
1979.78-1418,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1426.536,1428.326,"He's going to get the $4,000."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1428.326,1430.086,"Not really, Your Honor."
1979.78-1418,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1445.664,1453.962,"Well, in our hypothetical, there won't be anything after the lawyer is paid and the $6,000 is reimbursed to the stevedore, or the stevedore's insurance carrier."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1453.962,1458.974,"If the -- under the Second Circuit's opinion, the longshoreman would get nothing under that hypothetical, that's correct."
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1474.977,1488.965,"But it's still true in your hypothetical that using the example the Chief Justice put to you, the longshoreman would come out about the same as if there'd never been any compensation statute; the $10,000, he'd get a net of about $6,000 out of the recovery."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1488.965,1489.863,Yes.
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1513.057,1514.291,And he gets the benefit of them.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1514.291,1514.878,He gets the benefit.
1979.78-1418,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1518.37,1528.052,"Could I ask, we keep talking about the stevedore, but isn't it his insurance carrier that's on the hook?"
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1528.052,1530.164,The insurance carrier is the real party of interest.
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1532.465,1541.336,And I suppose the -- I suppose the result of this case may affect the employer's insurance rate.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1541.336,1542.545,I don't know.
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1543.014,1557.238,"Well, I would suppose the employer's insurance company is getting back full recovery by one rule, and wouldn't be getting back full recovery in another."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1557.238,1557.416,True.
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1557.416,1560.549,"In which event, his doing business costs him more."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1560.549,1561.787,"It might very well cost him more, Your Honor."
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1561.787,1563.718,And what about a state system?
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1563.718,1563.953,Excuse me?
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1563.953,1565.892,Aren't there some state systems?
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1570.265,1571.825,"So far as I know, it's private."
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1574.715,1575.471,"Well, I know but --"
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1575.471,1576.79,And they have their own insurance.
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1576.79,1579.654,They never operate through any state insurance firms?
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1579.654,1585.044,"Well, they do; I believe they do sometimes finance their insurance through -- in New York through the State Insurance Fund."
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1585.044,1585.571,All right.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1594.571,1600.137,"Under my rule, they will have to pay a reasonable fee for making their recovery."
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1600.137,1603.941,So your rule would tend to deplete the state funds.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1603.941,1604.478,Well --
1979.78-1418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1604.478,1607.08,"Well, it would not only tend, it would."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1607.08,1608.086,All right.
1979.78-1418,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1608.086,1609.015,To that extent.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1609.015,1610.318,"To that extent, right."
1979.78-1418,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1616.318,1624.315,"Well, in your $10,000 case, you're talking about two-thirds of the attorney's fee."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1624.315,1626.627,"Well, I'm talking about -- well, yes."
1979.78-1418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1663.039,1667.593,But can't you extend that statement you just made still further?
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1696.688,1698.695,I'm not really sure I understand your Honor's question; I apologize.
1979.78-1418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1698.695,1711.053,"Well, it's perfectly possible that you could have a system of workmen's compensation which authorized no third-party actions whatever; there wouldn't be any lawsuits."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1711.053,1712.866,There wouldn't be any lawsuits.
1979.78-1418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1736.402,1741.014,But most of them prohibit an employee from suing his own employer.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1741.014,1744.222,They all prohibit an employee from suing his own employer.
1979.78-1418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1746.038,1747.777,To substitute for a lawsuit.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1747.777,1750.784,A substitute for a lawsuit against the employer.
1979.78-1418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1754.273,1764.745,"But is there any reason, as suggested by my brother Stevens, to encourage in any way additional litigation in this area?"
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1764.745,1770.237,"I don't think it's a question of encouraging litigation, if I may say so respectfully."
1979.78-1418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1793.492,1793.568,Well --
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1793.568,1794.971,It was meant --
1979.78-1418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1794.971,1799.722,"Under common law, he has the right to sue his own employer for negligence."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1799.722,1799.957,Yes.
1979.78-1418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1799.957,1802.557,And the compensation law removed that.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1802.557,1803.998,"Yes, that is correct."
1979.78-1418,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1822.975,1827.364,"Better for both, and probably better for society as a whole."
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1827.364,1829.488,That is better for society as a whole.
1979.78-1418,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1857.764,1858.809,Your time has expired.
1979.78-1418,0,16790,alan_c_rassner,,1858.809,1859.479,"I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1979.78-1418,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1859.855,1865.565,That's all right.
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,1865.565,1866.633,Mr. Chief Justice --
1979.78-1418,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1866.633,1868.789,Mr. Wagner.
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,1868.789,1870.174,"Boeckmann, Your Honor."
1979.78-1418,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1870.174,1872.885,"Oh, excuse me, Mr. Boeckmann."
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,1872.885,1877.453,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1418,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2182.843,2184.992,"You're speaking now of the $17,000?"
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2184.992,2187.229,"Yes, I am, Mr. Chief Justice."
1979.78-1418,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2187.229,2190.086,It took no lawyer to produce that fund?
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2190.086,2194.65,"Yes, it is there; like a mortgage on a house, in the sale of the house."
1979.78-1418,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2217.592,2226.101,Is there provision in the Act for the payment of an attorney's fee by the employer to the employee if the employee must sue for his compensation?
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2226.101,2228.967,There is no such provision.
1979.78-1418,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2228.967,2231.993,Is it payable?
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2246.131,2253.19,"Then, when there is a contest between employer and employee within the context of the compensation --"
1979.78-1418,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2253.19,2254.291,Yes?
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2254.291,2257.448,"-- then there is an attorney's fee allowed, yes."
1979.78-1418,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2257.448,2260.227,"Well, that's for the -- isn't that under the statute?"
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2260.227,2262.383,"Yes, but that is not -- has no reference to the third-party action."
1979.78-1418,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2262.383,2263.268,I understand that.
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2269.889,2271.224,"Yes, it does."
1979.78-1418,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2271.224,2273.113,And the Commissioner supervises that?
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2273.113,2275.349,"Yes, the Commissioner does supervise that."
1979.78-1418,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2299.68,2300.393,And also when the employee --
1979.78-1418,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2300.393,2302.024,Is that true in every case?
1979.78-1418,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2302.444,2304.079,Go ahead.
1979.78-1418,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2304.079,2305.575,Is that true in every case?
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2315.137,2319.851,I don't know what the actual practice -- day-to-day practice is before the Deputy Commissioner.
1979.78-1418,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2322.781,2325.564,Authorizes him to award attorney's fees to the claimant?
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2325.564,2326.382,"Yes, it does."
1979.78-1418,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2326.382,2337.617,"And when the employer sues the third party and recovers, and wants an attorney's fee, the Commissioner must approve that, too?"
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2337.617,2339.788,Yes.
1979.78-1418,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2342.503,2348.114,Well -- certainly I -- what was the -- will you tell us again what you just told my brother?
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2348.114,2352.346,The -- when the employer sues --
1979.78-1418,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2352.346,2353.943,The third party.
1979.78-1418,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2353.943,2354.34,Right.
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2354.34,2359.283,"The third party -- he is entitled to recover his lien, and he is entitled to an attorney's fee out of the recovery."
1979.78-1418,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2359.283,2361.706,"-- out of the award, under the statute?"
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2361.706,2361.894,Yes.
1979.78-1418,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2366.137,2371.337,"He not only has the authority, but the employer can't deduct it without getting that approval, can he?"
1979.78-1418,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2371.337,2372.102,He's required to.
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2372.102,2374.558,"I believe that's true, yes."
1979.78-1418,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2460.022,2465.593,"Well, I don't know -- all that requires is higher insurance premiums."
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2465.593,2466.651,"Yes, but fees --"
1979.78-1418,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2466.651,2473.367,The employee -- no other employee really's going to not get his compensation payments.
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2473.367,2473.394,But --
1979.78-1418,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2473.394,2475.66,Just that they're going to be more costly to the employer.
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2475.66,2476.405,Yes.
1979.78-1418,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2481.843,2482.564,Sure.
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2482.564,2490.82,"And if he's going to have to pay higher insurance premiums, he may have to shrink his business, or employ less employees."
1979.78-1418,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2492.943,2495.015,May lower wages?
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2495.015,2496.208,"Yes, yes."
1979.78-1418,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2496.208,2497.612,Or not increase them as much.
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2497.612,2512.515,"And it is -- it winds up being a tax on the economy, which we -- my contention is that Congress did not intend to occur in this case."
1979.78-1418,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2593.59,2599.038,I take it that the most frequent third party defendant is a shipowner?
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2599.038,2599.683,Yes.
1979.78-1418,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2599.683,2600.886,In these cases.
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2600.886,2601.045,Because normally the accident happens aboard ship.
1979.78-1418,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2601.045,2615.707,"And if you know, is it characteristic that the same insurance companies may be insuring shipowners as who insure stevedores, or do they specialize?"
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2615.707,2625.998,"Generally, it's my experience that shipowners are insured by P&I clubs, which are generally foreign insurance companies."
1979.78-1418,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2628.833,2637.574,So there is then -- there's a fight between a certain kind -- one kind of insurance company and another kind of insurance company in these cases?
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2637.574,2641.158,They are -- they are usually adversaries.
1979.78-1418,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2743.554,2747.168,Congress hasn't written anything in this area; I thought you both agreed to that.
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2747.168,2750.179,"Well, I agree with that."
1979.78-1418,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2759.821,2761.442,Which was No contribution.
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2761.442,2766.02,That's right; which was no pro rata allocation.
1979.78-1418,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2845.058,2852.979,You -- I take it you've found no trace in the legislative history of any attention being given to the lien?
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2852.979,2853.356,I have found --
1979.78-1418,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2853.356,2860.527,Or making any kind of a specific provision for a lien which just rests in the case?
1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2860.527,2866.599,"I have found--I would like to have found something, Mr. Justice White, but I have found not a word."

1979.78-1418,1,20616,douglas_a_boeckmann,,2955.886,2956.995,Yes.
1979.78-1418,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3091.557,3103.627,But you suggest a different rule might be applicable where the recovery did not reach the amount of the compensation award?
