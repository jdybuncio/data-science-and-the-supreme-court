1986.85-998,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.254,"We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 85-998, United States versus Dunn."
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,13.324,17.093,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-998,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,127.599,130.384,"Well, what is a pole barn, Mr. Englert?"
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,130.384,135.187,"Your Honor, it's a barn in which there are poles supporting the overhang."
1986.85-998,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,138.907,140.991,Are three sides closed and one open?
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,143.125,147.846,"One side is open, Your Honor."
1986.85-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,257.834,258.817,Any barn?
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,258.817,262.972,"--No, Your Honor, the typical barn is used for the opposite purposes."
1986.85-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,267.673,268.791,What about a stable?
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,271.158,272.077,"I should think not, Your Honor."
1986.85-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,272.077,273.443,Never?
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,273.443,276.962,"Unless it were converted, I can't imagine such a place, no."
1986.85-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,276.962,281.933,"Blackstone disagrees with you, and I think he knew more about curtilage than you do, probably."
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,281.933,304.632,"Your Honor, a property immediately adjacent to the home may be protected as curtilage without the necessity for its own use for intimate family activity, because its immediate adjacency to the home makes it part of the area that is protected."
1986.85-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,318.122,318.974,I agree with all of that.
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,340.305,342.774,"That's true, Your Honor."
1986.85-998,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,406.414,415.77,"Mr. Englert, even if we were to conclude that this barn was not in the curtilage, does that end the inquiry?"
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,427.328,440.17,"Your Honor, in a case in which the officers do not enter the building, but merely look into it from the open fields, we think a holding that it was not within the curtilage would end the inquiry."
1986.85-998,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,441.803,451.895,Can there be any area around a building in which there is an expectation of privacy which is also protected?
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,451.895,455.43,"--Your Honor, that is precisely what the curtilage doctrine is designed to do."
1986.85-998,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,455.43,469.606,"Well, for a commercial structure, for instance, a factory that is constructed out in a field, and it has security fences all around it."
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,479.128,494.722,"Well, Your Honor, there are suggestions in the Dow case, that with the extraordinary security measures that were taken to protect the ground around the buildings in that case, that there would be a legitimate expectation of privacy against ground level inspection."
1986.85-998,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,494.722,500.209,"Is that a kind of curtilage around a commercial property, or what is it?"
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,500.209,508.232,"Your Honor, I don't think it would be appropriate to call that a curtilage, because that is not what the curtilage concept is about."
1986.85-998,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,511.599,524.841,"Well, do you acknowledge that there can be an area around a commercial structure which is protected by the Fourth Amendment, by fences?"
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,524.841,531.245,"Your Honor, I think... if sufficient measures are taken to protect it, I think the Dow case indicates that there is such an area."
1986.85-998,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,531.245,534.965,"Well, there was a fence around this barn, was there?"
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,534.965,541.453,"Yes, Your Honor, there was a fence that could be entered around this barn, but--"
1986.85-998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,541.453,545.071,What in the world was the fence there for?
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,547.19,558.414,"--Your Honor, a fence in these circumstances would often be for the purpose of controlling animal movements."
1986.85-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,559.764,563.032,"Mr. Englert, before you go any further, what is this we have before us?"
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,581.696,595.02,"--Your Honor, if the Court were to hold that it were a question of fact, it should go along with the District Court's ruling, which did not suppress this evidence, and held that there was not an invasion of the curtilage."
1986.85-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,595.02,596.237,"Well, what do you think it is?"
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,598.272,608.061,"Your Honor, I think it could properly be termed a mixed question of fact involved, because the question of what is curtilage, of course, is a question of law."
1986.85-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,621.105,636.33,"The question whether a particular structure is a house or not a house, would you consider that to be a question of law, when it's contested whether there were people living in that place, and therefore, whether it was entitled to Fourth Amendment protection, would you consider that a question of... mixed question of law and fact?"
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,636.33,638.532,"--I think it very well might be, Your Honor."
1986.85-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,638.532,639.416,Really?
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,639.416,652.376,"Yes, it depends on what legal standards are to be applied to determine whether something is a house, as well as depending on whether those legal standards were met."
1986.85-998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,672.254,674.289,What is... what makes a curtilage?
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,679.693,680.543,"Your Honor, if somebody--"
1986.85-998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,680.543,686.697,"I mean, right in this, what is the difference between the curtilage and the barn, legally, for this case?"
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,689.932,695.136,"--Yes, Your Honor, but one is immediately adjacent to the home; one is an extension--"
1986.85-998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,695.136,698.405,"Well, what is the difference between a home and a barn?"
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,698.405,701.107,"--Your Honor, people live in homes and carry on family activity in homes."
1986.85-998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,701.107,703.492,"Well, doesn't it apply when they're not there?"
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,703.492,704.725,"Yes, it certainly does, Your Honor."
1986.85-998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,704.725,708.027,When it's absolutely vacant?
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,708.027,711.415,"Absolutely vacant in the sense of uninhabited, I'm not sure it does."
1986.85-998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,711.415,712.898,Wouldn't that still be a curtilage?
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,712.898,714.247,There's still a curtilage if the--
1986.85-998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,714.247,721.286,"If it was up for sale, and it had been sitting there for three years vacant, it still would be a curtilage."
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,729.376,734.328,"--Your Honor, if it were a barn where somebody was sleeping, it would be a different case."
1986.85-998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,750.206,758.376,"Well, would there be a difference of what's a curtilage in Maine and what is a curtilage in Texas?"
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,758.376,759.278,"There could be, Your Honor."
1986.85-998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,759.278,763.347,I'm thinking of the King Ranch.
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,766.982,768.934,"I'm not familiar with the King Ranch, Your Honor."
1986.85-998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,769.867,771.036,xxx from Texas?
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,771.036,772.453,--No.
1986.85-998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,790.248,795.984,"Well, wouldn't your idea of a curtilage be different from me in Harlem, New York?"
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,795.984,797.453,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-998,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,797.453,806.976,"Well, what I'm driving at, this is a local court that has twice said just what they thought a curtilage was."
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,809.411,820.802,"Well, Your Honor, this Court has said three times what it thought a curtilage was, once saying this Court's decision made it clear that this wasn't a curtilage, and then reversing course, and saying without explanation, that it was."
1986.85-998,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,914.479,942.081,"Well, Mr. Englert, I'm not really sure that your proposed bright line fence rule is one that would serve necessarily our purposes in rural areas, where it's typical, isn't it, that you might have a little fence around your immediate yard to keep the animals out of the flowers and the grass, but still have an outhouse or outbuilding that would be considered a part of the curtilage."
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,950.319,953.723,"Your Honor, I'm not sure why that outbuilding should be considered a part of the curtilage."
1986.85-998,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,967.364,979.004,"Well, it is to the extent that the outbuildings are, for example, outhouses used for personal purposes or for cooking; the very things you suggest normally are in the curtilage."
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,990.312,1001.287,"--Well, Your Honor, if the outbuilding is, in fact, used as an adjunct to the domestic economy, we would not urge the fence rule; that is not this case."
1986.85-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1008.024,1011.56,"Well, you're proposing a rule that covers much more than this case."
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1019.831,1020.598,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1020.598,1021.617,And that does cover more than this case.
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1035.59,1035.974,In the--
1986.85-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1035.974,1037.66,Just because animals can graze there?
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1044.881,1052.403,"--In the exceptional case, where an outbuilding is truly used as an adjunct to the domestic economy, it may be deemed within the curtilage."
1986.85-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1076.185,1079.12,How far was the barn from the main house here?
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1079.12,1085.191,"Sixty yards, Your Honor."
1986.85-998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1085.191,1098.633,"May I ask, do you think your fence rule should apply in precisely the same way in Texas, Iowa, and say, Potomac, Maryland, where you have big homes?"
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1104.152,1104.971,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1104.971,1105.837,--Same rule?
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1105.837,1119.781,"And we think that's one of the virtues of the rule, is that it enables the property owner to define that area that will be treated as a whole with the house, and not just--"
1986.85-998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1119.781,1125.018,Does your rule impose a maximum distance that the fence can be from the house?
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1125.018,1129.97,"--Your Honor, we have not attempted to set a specific maximum distance."
1986.85-998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1140.11,1142.477,But I gather you take it 60 yards would be too much?
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1142.477,1144.762,"Sixty yards we think would be too much, yes."
1986.85-998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1144.762,1149.05,And do you think there's any question about our power to draw such a line?
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1153.918,1156.22,"Your Honor, I think it's very difficult to define with that precision."
1986.85-998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1158.322,1160.941,"But if you don't have it precisely defined, what good does it do us?"
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1160.941,1166.928,"--Well, that is why we propose a precise fence rule, and not a precise distance rule--"
1986.85-998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1166.928,1167.645,I see.
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1167.645,1175.201,--which will resolve the many cases like this one where a rural property is surrounded by a... the house on a rural property is surrounded--
1986.85-998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1175.201,1180.819,"But you're satisfied this Court has that kind of rule-making authority, I guess."
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1180.819,1186.239,"--I'm satisfied that this Court has the power to give guidance to the lower courts in that fashion, yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1196.031,1203.518,"Yes, but you know... do you think the people in England had the same kinds of property to define that they do in Texas, for example?"
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1203.518,1212.807,"--No, Your Honor, but the purpose of a fence in England was much the same as the purpose of a fence in Texas in 1980."
1986.85-998,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1215.159,1218.111,"And to control the movement of animals, I suppose, too."
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1218.111,1219.896,"--That, also, Your Honor."
1986.85-998,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1238.608,1246.38,"Of course, your bright line test leaves us afloat on the nearest fence, whatever that is."
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1261.056,1270.679,"If it were a house that... I'm sorry, Your Honor, if it were a fence that also included the house, I think it would define the curtilage."
1986.85-998,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1279.618,1281.47,Where were the dogs in this case?
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1286.939,1294.111,"Well, Your Honor, perhaps because Mr. and Mrs. Dunn had not moved to this farm yet, they hadn't brought the dogs yet; I don't know."
1986.85-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1294.111,1295.778,How was this barn used?
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1301.515,1307.768,"It certainly could be, Your Honor, if it had been converted to family use."
1986.85-998,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1330.384,1334.32,What if it was used to make alcoholic beverages for home consumption?
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1336.272,1338.89,"I think not, Your Honor."
1986.85-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1343.827,1354.899,"Suppose there's no fence around the house, and you sneak up and shine your... officer sneaks up and shines his flashlight through the window, sees something--"
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1354.899,1361.839,"--Justice White, that's precisely what the curtilage doctrine was designed to protect against."
1986.85-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1367.326,1376.932,--But you seem to think... you seem to think that the officers had no business going inside the barn without a warrant; is that right?
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1376.932,1378.967,"--Your Honor, if that case were before the Court--"
1986.85-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1378.967,1380.634,"Well, is that right or not?"
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1380.634,1382.685,--we would defend the officers' action.
1986.85-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1382.685,1390.608,"So that... so they might just as well, instead of shining their flashlight, just enter the barn."
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1390.608,1394.643,"Your Honor, the fact that we would defend that action if we had to, doesn't mean that this isn't a much easier case."
1986.85-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1394.643,1397.845,"Well, let's assume that you needed a warrant to go into the barn."
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1397.845,1398.612,All right.
1986.85-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1398.612,1402.582,Why would you be permitted to shine your flashlight through the window--
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1402.582,1403.116,Because--
1986.85-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1403.116,1405.968,--to see something that you couldn't enter and see?
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1405.968,1408.653,--Because it could be seen from the outside.
1986.85-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1408.653,1410.453,But only with a flashlight.
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1410.453,1417.609,"Well, Your Honor, this Court held in the Lee case, and reiterated in Texas v. Brown, that the aid of a flashlight doesn't convert something into a search if it isn't already a search."
1986.85-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1417.609,1421.144,Unless you're shining it into a house?
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1421.144,1425.929,"Neither of those cases involved shining in a house, nor does this case involve shining in a house."
1986.85-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1431.166,1437.839,"Well, what about a searchlight... what about a searchlight from across the street, shining into a house?"
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1437.839,1440.105,--Into the house itself?
1986.85-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1440.105,1440.555,Yes.
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1440.555,1442.874,That would raise very different constitutional concerns from this case.
1986.85-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1442.874,1445.243,Why would it?
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1445.243,1450.48,Because this Court has said so many times that the whole--
1986.85-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1450.48,1461.62,"You can't look in a house with the aid of a light from outside the curtilage, but you can look in a barn that you need a warrant to get into?"
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1461.62,1467.089,"--Yes, Your Honor, because it's a barn and not a house."
1986.85-998,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1467.089,1469.274,That's the government's submission.
1986.85-998,0,39134,roy_t_englert,,1469.274,1479.682,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.85-998,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1483.701,1487.336,"Thank you, Mr. Englert."
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,1498.128,1518.124,"Mr. Chief, and may it please the court, Justice Katz provides a zone of privacy which grants inherent immunity to those properly within that zone of privacy against unreasonable searches and intrusions by government agents."
1986.85-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1569.89,1571.259,None of that's relevant.
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,1571.259,1571.959,Sir?
1986.85-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1571.959,1573.359,None of that's relevant.
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,1590.72,1592.089,"No, sir."
1986.85-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1592.089,1595.207,It wouldn't?
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,1595.207,1601.611,If you didn't have the house and the barn located in that area--
1986.85-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1601.611,1605.413,Let's assume the barn was way over on the other side of the ranch.
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,1638.57,1640.936,"--No, I'm not, Your Honor."
1986.85-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1640.936,1645.39,--Then what relevance does it have that there was a fence all around this--
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,1645.39,1655.996,"Well, this will show that Mr. Dunn took subjective steps to protect his privacy against intrusion by anyone."
1986.85-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1655.996,1658.632,--You could say the same thing about the King Ranch.
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,1665.887,1675.409,"Well, the barn is not part of the house as such, but the barn serves a function with the house."
1986.85-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1700.109,1700.894,"Well, that I understand."
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,1703.161,1704.446,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-998,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1727.009,1729.961,You think there's a separate curtilage around the barn?
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,1729.961,1730.33,"Yes, ma'am."
1986.85-998,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1730.33,1735.032,And have any of our cases recognized that?
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,1735.032,1749.724,"In Dow Chemical, there's a note about the Swart... United States v. Swart, which is a Seventh Court of Appeals opinion, and it refers to a business curtilage."
1986.85-998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1758.98,1763.051,Why would there be a business curtilage?
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,1763.051,1765.603,A business curtilage?
1986.85-998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1783.215,1800.24,"But does that really make sense, or is that accurate to say, in the light of our decisions, that a businessman such as your client, manufacturing amphetamines in the barn, has as much right as someone who wants to use their home, perhaps to manufacture amphetamines?"
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,1800.24,1804.211,"Yes, sir, we're looking at this after the fact."
1986.85-998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1809.163,1817.936,But it seems to me what you say neglects all of the emphasis in our cases about the peculiar sanctity of the home.
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,1817.936,1820.638,There is a sanctity of the home.
1986.85-998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1832.961,1835.063,"Yes, the cases certainly establish that."
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,1849.907,1865.517,"--Well, sir, a business has a right to protect... they have a right to put a fence up, as counsel for the government has said, to protect their grounds, to provide security."
1986.85-998,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1892.067,1897.321,"Well, the question here is whether you could sneak up to the barn and look through the window."
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,1899.34,1900.34,Yes.
1986.85-998,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1900.34,1907.196,"And you couldn't do that with a house, I take it?"
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,1907.196,1907.629,That's correct.
1986.85-998,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1907.629,1908.979,And you say the same rule should apply?
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,1908.979,1911.147,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-998,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1911.147,1913.949,But there are no cases like this?
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,1918.801,1929.375,"I'm not proposing something new, because the Seventh Court of Appeals has already said, in the Swart case, that there was something like... there was a business curtilage."
1986.85-998,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1929.375,1935.263,"But just the fact that it's a trespass doesn't make the difference, does it?"
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,1935.263,1943.952,"No, sir, it's whether the officer has a right to be there to look in the window, whether it's the home or the barn."
1986.85-998,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1943.952,1945.821,"Well, technically, he's a trespasser."
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,1952.907,1957.276,"No, sir, it has not as far as Oliver goes."
1986.85-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2009.144,2011.946,"Well, that's sort of a conclusion."
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2014.548,2015.015,"--Yes, sir."
1986.85-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2015.015,2017.75,That it's one society is prepared to approve.
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2023.654,2024.037,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2024.037,2026.439,But how do you know whether society approves it or not?
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2060.26,2061.879,"Because it's an enclosed structure, Your Honor."
1986.85-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2073.353,2074.253,You could say the same about--
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2074.253,2076.121,And you broke the curtilage and went in and looked.
1986.85-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2076.121,2081.239,"--You could say the same about the woods on an open... on an open tract, privately owned tract."
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2081.239,2082.942,"But the woods, you could look down and see from the air."
1986.85-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2082.942,2087.429,Not in the summer.
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2089.612,2090.146,Sir?
1986.85-998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2090.146,2092.181,It's the structure that makes the difference?
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2092.181,2096.119,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-998,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2101.287,2106.391,"Well, wasn't this barn open on one side?"
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2106.391,2107.191,"--Yes, ma'am."
1986.85-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2122.567,2126.554,So the policeman could have looked into the barn from a greater distance.
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2138.529,2142.898,"I wouldn't say it would be all right, but it probably would pass."
1986.85-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2142.898,2147.635,"But crossing the fence, they violate the sanctity of the barn somehow?"
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2147.635,2154.639,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-998,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2154.639,2159.942,"Counsel, you cited a Seventh Circuit case, but I don't think you cited it in your brief, and I don't have the name of it."
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2160.392,2163.225,It's United States v. Swart.
1986.85-998,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2163.225,2164.86,--Warth?
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2166.296,2169.914,"It's 697, I believe."
1986.85-998,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2176.318,2178.604,And was that a barn case?
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2178.604,2192.511,"--No, sir, it was an automobile business where officers went after the business had closed and stood near the cars to determine if they had what's called a chop shop."
1986.85-998,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2210.741,2221.014,"And so that goes to the original question presented by the government rather than the revised question, not whether it's in the curtilage, but whether you can look in the hole in the barn?"
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2221.014,2230.286,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2312.072,2323.98,"And yet you agree that that would not preclude observation of various places on the ranch within that fence, under Oliver?"
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2323.98,2332.901,"No, sir, they even flew... in Dunn, they flew over and took pictures of the ranch that afternoon; they took aerial photographs."
1986.85-998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2332.901,2337.739,So what is the materiality of this exterior fence?
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2337.739,2343.959,"Well, it tells me as an individual I can't go onto that man's land without his permission."
1986.85-998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2348.697,2353.249,But Oliver said it doesn't say the same thing to the law enforcement people.
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2353.249,2362.706,"Well, that's why we're saying that the Court should consider what the state courts have held, that this is a matter of privacy."
1986.85-998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2372.812,2377.197,"Well, but that isn't what... the Fifth Circuit didn't rely on that in its judgment."
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2377.197,2378.299,"No, it didn't."
1986.85-998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2378.299,2382.251,Are you asking us to change Oliver?
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2382.251,2383.87,"If I could, yes, sir."
1986.85-998,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2383.87,2385.336,"Well, you're always free to ask."
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2385.336,2385.836,"Yes, I am."
1986.85-998,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2395.042,2399.827,"But I take it you don't think that's critical to your case, to have to overrule Oliver?"
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2399.827,2401.779,"No, sir, I do not."
1986.85-998,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2540.086,2542.704,"Well, that's a risk the sheriff takes, I guess."
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2542.704,2549.192,"Yes, sir, it is."
1986.85-998,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2549.192,2550.058,Do you know--
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2562.702,2565.82,There's one case dealing with the similarity.
1986.85-998,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2583.531,2586.317,xxx fields?
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2586.317,2591.452,"Yes, sir, in the Kantu case."
1986.85-998,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2591.452,2592.637,Do you have that citation?
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2592.637,2595.006,"Yes, sir, I have."
1986.85-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2636.433,2641.452,Are these cases burglary cases or are they suppression of evidence cases?
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2641.452,2650.891,"The Kantu case is a marijuana suppression case, Your Honor."
1986.85-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2653.192,2659.579,"The earlier ones you referred to, are they burglary... they're probably... if they're that old, they're probably burglary cases."
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2659.579,2664.667,"--Could be moonshine, Your Honor."
1986.85-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2718.202,2719.82,xxx depend on how the barn's being used?
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2739.448,2740.5,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2740.5,2743.269,But I live 100 yards away in my ranch house.
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2749.173,2751.541,"Not while it's open to the public, Your Honor."
1986.85-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2751.541,2752.891,"No, I mean, at night."
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2754.743,2758.362,I think the barn would have its own curtilage in that event.
1986.85-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2758.362,2759.045,"Well, never mind that."
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2761.414,2762.981,Sir?
1986.85-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2762.981,2765.833,"Maybe it has its own, but is it part of the curtilage of the house?"
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2765.833,2767.268,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2780.894,2782.777,So it really does depend a lot on the use of the barn.
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2794.868,2796.82,"--Yes, sir."
1986.85-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2810.062,2816.317,"Well, let's assume it was being used to manufacture lawful substances."
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2818.883,2820.852,"I'm sorry, I did not hear the last part."
1986.85-998,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2820.852,2823.554,Would you still consider it part of the curtilage of the house?
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2834.112,2835.679,"Yes, sir."
1986.85-998,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2919.718,2931.443,"The Federal Government is suggesting a similar bright line rule here, the first fence rule."
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2931.443,2935.56,"You're referring to the 25 miles and the fence, Your Honor?"
1986.85-998,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2935.56,2937.846,Yes.
1986.85-998,1,34335,louis_dugas_jr,,2937.846,2943.416,"I suppose they are, but--"
