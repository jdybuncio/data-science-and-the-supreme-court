1979.78-1870,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,57.821,"We will hear arguments next in 78-1870, Whirlpool Corporation against the Secretary of Labor."
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,61.011,63.627,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1979.78-1870,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,147.229,159.418,"Mr. Mann, the act does give the Secretary the authority to promulgate and enforce standards to eliminate hazards, does it not?"
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,159.418,162.125,"Yes, sir."
1979.78-1870,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,162.125,169.115,Was there any rulemaking notice and comment in connection with this interpretative regulation?
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,169.115,170.144,"No, there was not, Your Honor."
1979.78-1870,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,174.828,177.834,So it's a Swift against Wickham-type inquiry?
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,177.834,181.709,"I believe so; yes, Your Honor."
1979.78-1870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,279.593,280.324,Mr. Mann --
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,280.324,280.685,Excuse me.
1979.78-1870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,280.685,283.543,-- in what respect was there a mechanical failure?
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,283.543,299.461,"As the administrative hearing developed later, Your Honor, it appeared two bolts, holding together portions of the screen, failed, and caused the screen to separate at one point; and the employee stepped through the separation."
1979.78-1870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,303.452,305.09,It doesn't sound very mechanical to me.
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,316.516,319.196,"Well, that's true, Your Honor."
1979.78-1870,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,328.817,346.141,"Whatever the facts, counsel, isn't the central question in this case whether this action must be taken by the Secretary through traditional rulemaking, or whether it can be done by regulations promulgated by the Secretary?"
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,349.452,353.774,"That is not -- that question has not been the central question in the litigation, Your Honor."
1979.78-1870,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,366.914,369.699,The Secretary's intent in doing what?
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,369.699,383.655,In the interpretation of the act to provide protections for employees who refuse work assignments.
1979.78-1870,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,383.655,394.492,"You would agree, wouldn't you, that the Secretary could perhaps go further, had he promulgated regulations as the statute authorizes him to do?"
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,394.492,412.394,"Well, the Secretary's authorization to promulgate regulations under the statute exists with respect to the promulgation of standards, uniform standards, of course; and also, under Section 8(g), publication of regulations governing his own responsibilities under the act."
1979.78-1870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,613.62,619.373,This was on the theory it was a strike-with-pay approach?
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,619.373,631.923,"I believe the district court's view was that it was tantamount to a strike-with-pay approach; it was a type of approach that had been rejected by Congress, both in connection with the strike-with-pay issue and in connection with the administrative-shutdown issue."
1979.78-1870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,631.923,639.877,"The district court found, did it not, that these employees had a genuine fear of death or physical injury?"
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,639.877,641.901,"The court did find that, Your Honor; yes, he did."
1979.78-1870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,641.901,643.658,And that the danger was real?
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,643.658,645.876,He found that the danger was real.
1979.78-1870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,645.876,647.873,And that they lacked any alternative?
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,647.873,658.634,"He did not find that they lacked any alternative, in the sense that they were precluded from using the normal enforcement procedures of the act, or the extraordinary enforcement procedures of the act under Section 13."
1979.78-1870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,664.281,681.407,"Well, I take it your position is that even if they had utilized these alternative procedures, they were supposed to work on the job while these procedures were being employed?"
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,681.407,683.286,"No, Your Honor, that is not our position."
1979.78-1870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,704.797,706.312,"You mean, he can keep his job?"
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,710.346,728.824,"Well, the question of his job security and pay, we feel that Congress intended to leave for regulation to other statutes; except in a case, perhaps, where the employee would leave his job for the purpose of invoking the procedures available under OSHA."
1979.78-1870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,728.824,732.429,"Well, then, OSHA covers that, I suppose?"
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,732.429,734.076,"If -- yes, I think Section 11 --"
1979.78-1870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,734.076,735.694,"Well, what is your position, then?"
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,755.859,759.069,"Your Honor, the facts of this case don't present that situation."
1979.78-1870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,772.233,782.362,"Well, let's assume that it's perfectly clear that he's -- he's called them on the phone, or written them a letter, or something, and OSHA says, we'll be out day after tomorrow."
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,793.724,801.519,"I think that under -- he could be fired, if the reason for the firing was not based upon his having filed a complaint."
1979.78-1870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,801.519,802.068,"Well, I know."
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,802.068,805.543,If the reason --
1979.78-1870,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,805.543,819.246,"Let's assume the employer says, look, I'm not firing you for filing the complaint at all; I'm firing you for refusing to work while -- during the period that -- while you're waiting for OSHA to come."
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,820.077,822.891,"All right, it's our view, yes, sir, that would be -- that would be --"
1979.78-1870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,822.891,823.264,And --
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,823.264,824.915,-- not protected under OSHA.
1979.78-1870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,827.69,835.88,"Well, then I take it your position -- why do you think the Solicitor General mischaracterizes your position, then, in their brief?"
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,846.444,850.656,It's our view that he is free not to work.
1979.78-1870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,850.656,852.638,"Well, he's free not to work; you mean there is no slavery?"
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,852.638,853.603,Right.
1979.78-1870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,855.103,855.254,But --
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,855.254,862.581,"The question of whether or not he retains his job security during that period of time, we feel Congress did not intend to regulate under this act."
1979.78-1870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,862.581,867.933,"So you don't have to -- you don't have to keep him as an employee, nor do you have to pay him while he's waiting for OSHA?"
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,867.933,870.364,"That's our view; yes, sir."
1979.78-1870,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,870.364,877.541,"Mr. Mann, you made reference to perhaps other protections, which I assume refers to the Labor-Management Relations Act."
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,877.541,877.841,That's the one --
1979.78-1870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,877.841,895.141,"And I assume it would be true, would it not, under that case involving a place of work that was too cold, that if three or four of these people got together and said, ""None of us will work, because we all want you to remedy the situation..."" in some way, that would be protected under the Labor Act."
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,895.141,897.092,"I believe it would under the facts you quote, yes, sir."
1979.78-1870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,897.092,904.361,"So the only issue really here, as I understand it, is whether one employee acting independently can refuse to work."
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,914.667,930.178,"Well, I believe there have been some recent decisions under -- by the National Labor Relations Board under the NLRA holding that a single employee's withdrawal may constitute protected activity under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act if it's a safety-related situation."
1979.78-1870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,930.178,930.589,So if it's even --
1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,930.589,932.631,And the result is what?
1979.78-1870,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,932.631,933.836,He doesn't get paid.
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,933.836,934.918,"He doesn't get paid, and he's on strike, but he --"
1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,934.918,936.381,And he cannot be disciplined; is that the idea?
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,936.381,938.549,"He cannot be disciplined, but he doesn't get paid."
1979.78-1870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,938.549,947.043,"So isn't the only question here is whether there -- there are two ways to -- I mean, whether he has an additional protection for the same right that the Labor Act already protects?"
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,947.043,947.578,That's correct.
1979.78-1870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,958.205,959.328,"Well, he disclaims that."
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,975.581,979.054,"Well, I, certainly I would hope --"
1979.78-1870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,979.054,980.879,"Well, you didn't try to fire him, did you?"
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,980.879,982.127,"No, we gave him a warning."
1979.78-1870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,982.127,985.8,"You just put a citation in his file, and you didn't give him another thing to do during that --"
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,985.8,986.852,That's right.
1979.78-1870,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,986.852,995.089,"If all we said was, take the citation out of his file, and you don't have to pay him, then there isn't much of a fight here as I see it."
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,995.089,998.731,"Well, I think there may be a fight, Your Honor, in this sense."
1979.78-1870,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1036.108,1038.707,"Yeah, but they give up there -- they don't get paid when they do it."
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1040.961,1041.583,Well --
1979.78-1870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1041.583,1049.908,And that you -- you've told us that at least under some Federal decisions that individual employee has a -- the freedom to do under the National Labor Relations Act.
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1049.908,1052.582,He has the freedom to withdraw from work.
1979.78-1870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1052.582,1058.332,Because of dangerous or intolerable conditions of some other kind.
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1058.332,1059.553,That's correct.
1979.78-1870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1059.553,1060.619,But he doesn't get paid?
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1060.619,1060.972,He doesn't get paid.
1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1060.972,1061.482,No.
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1068.638,1078.252,"The Secretary takes the view in his brief, and I would point this out, that the employee's right is to be given alternate work."
1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1078.252,1079.225,If available.
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1079.225,1079.887,If available.
1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1089.703,1092.885,"Well, wouldn't you have the same duty under the Labor Act?"
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1092.885,1094.251,Not if an employee goes on strike.
1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1094.251,1095.498,No.
1979.78-1870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1095.498,1098.559,"Well, he just says, ""I won't work because it's too cold or dangerous,"" or something?"
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1098.559,1100.251,He's out of the plant; he's on strike.
1979.78-1870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1100.251,1101.297,Right.
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1101.297,1104.096,There's no requirement under the Labor Act to provide him some alternate--
1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1104.096,1111.921,How do you read Judge Damon Keith's opinion for the Court of Appeals as requiring the employer to do what?
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1114.555,1120.509,I believe that Judge Keith's decision implies an obligation to pay the employee.
1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1120.509,1121.806,That's the way I read it too.
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1122.978,1124.72,During that period of time --
1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1124.72,1126.153,And certainly not to discipline them.
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1126.153,1126.861,That's right.
1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1126.861,1128.429,And to pay them?
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1128.429,1131.123,"And to pay them, or find alternate work for them."
1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1131.123,1133.277,"Well, he doesn't spell it out, does he?"
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1133.277,1138.668,"He doesn't spell that out, but he upholds the regulation which has that -- has that connotation to it, yes sir."
1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1138.668,1139.464,Does it?
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1141.411,1149.712,The Secretary in his brief repeatedly refers to the obligation to find alternate work if available.
1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1149.712,1150.769,"Well, that's not --"
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1150.769,1151.651,I think he draws that --
1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1151.651,1153.804,You mean alternate work at the same pay?
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1153.804,1156.77,Alternate work at some pay; perhaps not the same pay.
1979.78-1870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1156.77,1156.782,"Well, that's --"
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1156.782,1159.61,He doesn't elaborate that.
1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1159.61,1165.109,"I read these briefs pretty carefully, and I came away with a good many unanswered questions in my mind."
1979.78-1870,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1165.109,1165.75,I did too.
1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1165.75,1170.558,And that's the reason I'm asking you some of those questions.
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1191.018,1191.34,Well --
1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1191.34,1192.118,"Because that's not clear, is it?"
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1192.118,1197.903,-- if he's not -- I believe what the Court of Appeals said is that the employer cannot discriminate against the employee.
1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1197.903,1199.269,What's that mean?
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1199.269,1200.366,Under the Secretary's --
1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1200.366,1206.003,"I mean, under the Labor Act, that simply means you can't fire him, because that's a protected union activity."
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1206.003,1217.71,"But under Section 1977.12 of the Secretary's regulations, he defines discrimination in the broadest possible sense the deprivation of any perquisite of employment, or words to that effect."
1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1217.71,1219.376,Does that mean pay for not work?

1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1233.613,1234.315,That could be argued.
1979.78-1870,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1234.315,1234.408,Sure.

1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1478.944,1481.34,You'd have a statutory obligation not to discipline.
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1481.34,1482.659,We have a statutory obligation not to discipline him.

1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1486.62,1489.16,Why is it discipline in this case?
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1489.16,1497.513,"The reason that it's not discipline is that he is not presenting himself for work, and he is merely exercising a right that he has under the statute."

1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1517.964,1521.819,It's the disciplinary action that triggers the pay.
1979.78-1870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1521.819,1538.049,"No, no, now I -- in answer to Justice Stevens, you said that instead of coming to work and reporting in at the beginning of his shift, this employee had gone to the OSHA office in Marion, Ohio, to file a complaint, that under the statute, clearly you couldn't discipline him for that."
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1538.049,1538.924,That's correct.
1979.78-1870,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1538.924,1543.672,But you further said that there's no requirement under the statute that you pay him for work not done.
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1543.672,1544.763,That's correct.
1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1544.763,1548.445,"Well, now, what's the difference in this case?"
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1548.445,1551.643,Because the employee is being discipline.
1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1554.958,1559.765,"No, but if the Solicitor General is right, all you had to do differently was just not put that piece of paper in his file."

1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1560.787,1562.59,Just don't pay him.
1979.78-1870,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1565.641,1565.807,That's right.
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1565.807,1574.467,"Well, the Solicitor has taken the position in this case that we had an--an additional obligation not only not to put the paper in his file, but find him an alternate work assignment."

1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1578.413,1580.278,Where it was clearly under the statute.
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1583.665,1585.254,That's right.
1979.78-1870,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1585.254,1588.924,Then why would he have greater rights when the statutory is considerably more ambiguous?
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1591.089,1597.438,"Well, the obligation of the employer is not to discriminate against him, including imposition of discipline."

1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1608.616,1612.385,That could be construed as discipline; that could be construed as discriminatory action.
1979.78-1870,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1612.385,1612.864,That's what I mean.

1979.78-1870,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1630.78,1633.903,"Number one, you couldn't pay him for not working."
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1633.903,1635.177,That's right.
1979.78-1870,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1635.177,1638.83,But you do pay him when he's on sick leave.
1979.78-1870,0,39981,robert_e_mann,,1638.83,1639.811,That may be the policy.

1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1857.089,1860.759,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1888.259,1903.559,"Well, now before you go off -- I had thought that that wasn't the issue at all; that the issue was, whether or not the Secretary had any power at all to issue 1977.12(b)(2)."
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1903.559,1903.855,"Well, that may --"
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1903.855,1906.364,Or whether or not that was contrary to the statute.
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1906.364,1909.258,"If the Court please, that may be another way of expressing the same thought."
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1909.258,1911.422,"Well, it may be; may be."
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1911.422,1915.775,"Clearly, this is an interpretative regulation; it's not a legislative regulation."
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1915.775,1916.978,And the question is --
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1916.978,1917.449,"And the question is, does the statute --"
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1917.449,1920.238,-- is it an authorized interpretative regulation.
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1920.238,1921.257,Precisely.
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2006.179,2009.149,"Now, what do you think that means, protects him from discrimination?"
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2017.137,2018.993,I think that's clear.
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2018.993,2027.727,"But does it mean that he's entitled to be paid for time that he doesn't work, when he goes off, unlike a striker?"
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2027.727,2040.581,"No, I do not believe it entitles him to pay unless, in an almost equivalent situation, another employee would be entitled to pay."
1979.78-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2045.313,2046.782,Because of what he does.
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2046.782,2049.456,--in an almost similar situation would be following.
1979.78-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2049.456,2049.768,"Well, what's a similar situation?"
1979.78-1870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2049.768,2051.71,"Well, why would another employee ever do that?"
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2051.71,2066.341,"Well, for example, suppose he agreed -- suppose an employee recognized an situation as presenting an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm, and objectively it existed --"
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2066.341,2066.884,And all these conditions existed.
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2066.884,2068.208,"--and he believed it in good faith, and so forth."
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2085.695,2087.694,But only under that sort of --
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2087.694,2089.19,Under that kind of situation.
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2089.19,2093.272,Only -- you can't be treated other than other similarly situated employees are treated.
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2093.272,2097.047,"And I said, almost similarly situated, because there is this one minor --"
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2097.047,2097.779,Yes.
1979.78-1870,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2097.779,2106.782,"But your similarity is limited to OSHA-type situations, when you're talking about discriminating."
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2106.782,2107.034,Yes.
1979.78-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2117.066,2123.671,May I probe a little bit about what kind of similarity we're talking about?
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2169.04,2174.157,"No, I would think the company reserves its right to make a distinction between situations."
1979.78-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2174.157,2174.671,All right.
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2174.671,2179.566,And the test would be this If a company refused to pay on your second day situation --
1979.78-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2179.566,2180.616,Yes.
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2180.616,2186.331,-- then the employee under the statute would have to ask the Secretary --
1979.78-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2186.331,2186.769,Right.
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2186.769,2195.595,"-- to bring an action for him to relieve him of the consequences of the discrimination, if it was discrimination."
1979.78-1870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2195.595,2199.192,And it would be discrimination if they paid the man on the night shift but not the man on the day shift --
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2199.192,2199.661,That's right.
1979.78-1870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2199.661,2200.374,-- or something like that.
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2200.374,2207.355,"We would hope the Secretary would make -- would discriminate, too, and would look carefully and decide whether to bring this."
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2283.444,2289.408,"Well, actually, that's not -- I'm not criticizing you for making that argument."
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2301.133,2303.241,"Well, it's not explicit."
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2312.42,2313.198,"That is, 10(c)(1)."
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2313.198,2315.769,-- it's a necessary part of the statute.
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2315.769,2318.593,29 USC 660 (c)(1)?
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2318.593,2319.41,That's correct.
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2319.41,2322.365,"That's what's specifically involved, isn't it?"
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2322.365,2323.574,"That's correct, sir."
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2398.265,2406.453,"Of course, as you say, Mr. Solicitor General, your brother says that the Secretary has gone even beyond his own regulation in this particular case."
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2408.815,2409.454,Yes.
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2411.471,2413.053,But you're just telling us that you disagree with that?
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2413.053,2414.423,-- that he's gone beyond it.
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2417.622,2420.974,"Well, I thought I understood what he was saying."
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2420.974,2426.65,"And -- well, I read his brief as saying the same thing, but I don't know in what respect he does."
1979.78-1870,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2479.962,2491.777,"Mr. Solicitor General, one thing -- back up a minute -- in a case just like this where the man says, ""Look, one or two or three people have fallen through there, and I'm not going up there."""
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2505.321,2511.072,"Well, I would think -- I would think we'd have to work out some rule of reason."
1979.78-1870,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2514.638,2516.142,That's my point.
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2516.142,2520.677,"Again, I say, we'd have to see what would happen if the foreman had agreed with him."
1979.78-1870,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2538.85,2542.063,But there are some plants where you couldn't find alternative work.
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2544.051,2548.81,"Well, if he -- if the plant -- another analogy suggests itself."
1979.78-1870,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2550.793,2551.142,Right.
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2551.142,2552.534,Nobody could work.
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2578.787,2589.854,"Mr. Solicitor General, on that suggestion, supposing -- I'd like to ask you the same question I asked Mr. Mann -- if he had been concerned, and in the morning got up and went to the OSHA office."
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2602.108,2606.462,"I think he might, because this is -- and he might."
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2609.119,2610.9,What's the discrimination?
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2613.836,2615.57,"Well, but the statute here --"
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2615.57,2616.455,There's no discipline.
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2633.317,2638.191,"Well, because this is an express right that's given him under the act."
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2638.191,2641.912,It's a right to be paid -- to be paid for making a complaint?
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2641.912,2653.292,"Well, in other words, it's a right to file complaints and to initiate the statutory machinery for investigation and remedying --"
1979.78-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2653.292,2663.723,"But it seems to me that if you take that position, that he's entitled to be paid that day, and you also say he has a right just not to work for a day because it's too dangerous, equally he ought to be paid for that day."
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2667.261,2668.986,"Well, I really don't think so."
1979.78-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2679.905,2683.26,"There's a statutory right to do that, but you're arguing there's a statutory right to sit down, too."
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2683.26,2684.461,All right.
1979.78-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2690.903,2691.556,Right.
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2691.556,2694.803,He doesn't have to remain all day to get down off that mesh.
1979.78-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2694.803,2696.271,If there's no alternate work?
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2696.271,2705.65,"And once he's down from that mesh, and he's no longer in a place of peril, then he's subject to the orders of the foreman at the workplace."
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2800.146,2813.421,"Well, I just don't see how that -- that really answers my problem about why, if there's the same statutory right in both of the hypothetical cases, in one case you say he gets pay and the other one, you say he doesn't."
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2813.421,2822.687,"Well, because -- because the exercise of the right will take longer in one case than it will in the other."
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2825.951,2829.61,But what he's protected against is discipline or discrimination.
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2837.134,2838.323,I know I'm repeating myself --
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2838.323,2838.513,"Yes, I guess I am, too."
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2838.513,2846.637,"-- but my best answer is, that he's protected while he does what the statute gives him permission to do."
1979.78-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2850.53,2851.206,"Well, I agree, he's protected in both cases."
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2851.206,2852.551,"-- made the report, he has to come back."
1979.78-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2852.551,2859.565,"The question is whether the -- when the employer doesn't pay, why is it discrimination in one case and not the other?"
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2859.565,2859.855,Well --
1979.78-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2859.855,2860.933,He's protected in both?
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2860.933,2873.998,"-- I suppose a further answer is, in order to vindicate the right to be free from discrimination, he's going to have to ask the Secretary to bring an action for him."
1979.78-1870,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2885.083,2899.226,"Well, General McCree, would you go so far as to say that not only in his trip to the OSHA office, but perhaps in the two or three days he spends testifying in the district court in Toledo, he's also entitled to be paid?"
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2899.226,2902.815,"Well, I'm not prepared to say he may not be."
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2913.531,2927.01,"Well, if the employer's policy with respect to employees is to pay them only if they work, then somebody who goes to the OSHA office or goes to Toledo to testify is not entitled to pay, is he?"
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2927.01,2927.246,That may not --
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2927.246,2932.685,"Because it's not discrimination against him for exercising his rights under the act, his conceded rights under the act."
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2932.685,2936.826,That may very well be the resolution that a court would make.
1979.78-1870,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2937.816,2943.009,"Well, isn't that the logical resolution for any court to make?"
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2943.009,2943.038,I say --
1979.78-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2943.038,2948.143,"A single, even-handed policy of the employer is simply not to pay people if they don't work."
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2948.143,2952.573,"I would say, it is a logical--a logical distinction."
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2952.87,2953.715,"I mean, subject to vacation and sick pay and all the rest of it."
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2953.715,2959.967,"--into another area, we speak about citizens performing their civic duty."
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2961.571,2962.103,"Yes, but it's a statute."
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2962.103,2963.827,--that require payment--
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2963.827,2964.555,For jury duty.
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2964.555,2965.484,--for jury duty.
1979.78-1870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2965.484,2967.115,"I know, but it's a matter of statute."
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2967.896,2971.683,"Well, this statute may, by implication, do that."
1979.78-1870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2975.766,2977.611,"Well, it really is, in many ways."
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2977.611,2977.736,In a sense.
1979.78-1870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2977.736,2984.263,Because it seems to me that you and your brother argue about something that now you say is not before us.
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,2988.303,2990.717,Keith; Judge Keith.
1979.78-1870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2990.717,2996.027,"-- yes, Damon Keith's opinion for the Sixth Circuit implied that this person was entitled to be paid."
1979.78-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2996.027,3001.171,That's the way I understood the -- I though that was one of the issues between you.
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3001.171,3008.003,"Well, I'm not certain -- and I would like to look at his opinion more carefully."
1979.78-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3008.003,3046.381,"Well, Mr. Solicitor General, do you think now, having listened to your colleague and having said what you're said, that you are in agreement on pay, at least with respect to non-waiting time in OSHA office?"
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3048.722,3052.478,"On that, I agree, he is not entitled to pay."
1979.78-1870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3052.478,3054.959,So that is -- you're together on that.
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3054.959,3056.769,I think so; I think we are.
1979.78-1870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3064.047,3064.301,I understand.
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3064.301,3074.331,"But I have to say, I'm not certain that that would be so if he exercised one of the rights expressly given him under the statute."
1979.78-1870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3084.968,3094.106,"Is it your position, Mr. Solicitor General, to say -- you are arguing that the unexpressed, implicit right is just as important as the expressed right."
1979.78-1870,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3094.106,3094.375,Right.
1979.78-1870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3094.375,3102.913,And yet you are suggesting that the remedy for violating the express right is more stern than the remedy for violating the unexpressed right.
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3102.913,3102.962,Well --
1979.78-1870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3102.962,3107.481,It doesn't seem to me the statute -- that makes the statute very consistent.
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3107.481,3111.735,I have failed to communicate a distinction that appears valid to me.
1979.78-1870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3123.886,3124.735,Yes.
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3124.735,3128.554,-- is exercised in a short period of time.
1979.78-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3133.65,3143.011,"And as soon as he reaches the floor, then, he has removed himself from the danger of harm."
1979.78-1870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3143.011,3143.473,And then the question --
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3143.473,3150.375,"And he is subject then to the foreman's instruction ""Well, all right, get a broom, you're a maintenance person, and sweep the floor."""
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3153.059,3156.499,"Or the foreman might say, ""This was your job on the shift; go home."""
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3156.499,3156.942,Yes.
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3156.942,3157.51,If you don't want to do this job --
1979.78-1870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3157.51,3164.592,"Or he says, ""All the other maintenance people are doing all the other jobs, so there's nothing more for you today to do today."""
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3164.592,3165.599,"Well, that's --"
1979.78-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3165.599,3171.845,And then doesn't he get in exactly the same position as the man who went to the OSHA office and had to kill the day because it took the whole day?
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3171.845,3179.371,"Well, I would analogize him more to the person whose machine broke down."
1979.78-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3188.226,3196.622,"Yes, but in one case, the employee doesn't work because the employer doesn't have work that, in effect, was promised to him; he promises him a machine to work on."
1979.78-1870,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3196.622,3196.891,Right.
1979.78-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3196.891,3205.451,In the other two cases -- both the office case and the dangerous case -- the employee isn't working because he's exercising what you describe as a statutory right.
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3213.697,3218.378,"Well, perhaps --"
1979.78-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3218.378,3219.132,You may be right.
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3224.806,3225.349,Yes.
1979.78-1870,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3249.574,3249.695,Mr. Solicitor General?
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3249.695,3255.524,"-- should the consequences be because his employer didn't recognize it, is another matter."
1979.78-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3258.245,3266.702,"See, it all goes back to the question of how much weight we are to give to the Congressional -- a very strong evidence of Congressional intent on the strike-with-pay provision."
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3266.702,3268.136,Yes.
1979.78-1870,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3268.136,3277.891,"And as I understood Judge Keith -- and I may have misread him, because I think parts of it are hard to understand -- he, in effect, was saying, all of that is inapplicable, because there's no requirement of pay here."
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3299.171,3303.211,"Well, I think I must conclude that it's always easier to state a proposition than to apply it."
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3310.233,3313.531,"Well, if you're correct in your basic position."
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3313.531,3314.543,That's right.
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3487.146,3490.008,"Well, it could disrupt the whole plant, depending on the nature of his job."
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3490.008,3490.752,It could.
1979.78-1870,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3492.611,3497.891,"I mean, if it were a matter of opening the door so the employees could come in, and he's afraid the ceiling would fall on him."
1979.78-1870,1,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3497.891,3504.076,"And we think, of course, the two cases are distinguished -- I see my time is expired."
1979.78-1870,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3505.851,3506.531,Thank you gentlemen.
