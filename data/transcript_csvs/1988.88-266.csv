1988.88-266,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.754,"We'll hear argument now in Number 88-266, Oklahoma Tax Commission versus Jan Graham."
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,11.239,14.058,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-266,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,211.086,227.982,"I don't think... if this Court were to conclude that the case had been improperly removed from the state trial court to the Federal District Court, we wouldn't then get to the... the question of the sovereignty, would we?"
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,227.982,235.735,"You would not get to that question, and the state would have to decide if that was a proper defense to the state's actions."
1988.88-266,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,256.298,258.916,"Well, the state court might have to make that decision."
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,258.916,264.238,"The state court may have to make that decision, but the state court has already made that decision."
1988.88-266,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,288.503,293.64,And the tribe would have a right to appeal again through the state courts and eventually to this court--
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,293.64,294.19,That--
1988.88-266,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,294.19,294.69,--on that point?
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,294.69,296.126,--That is correct.
1988.88-266,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,359.949,361.001,May I interrupt you?
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,365.353,365.653,Yes.
1988.88-266,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,365.653,370.924,"And the record in the case consists just of the complaint, doesn't it?"
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,370.924,371.524,That is correct.
1988.88-266,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,371.524,380.613,"And does the complaint allege that the... that the... this Murray... whatever it is... Sulphur, Oklahoma, is... is or is not within the reservation?"
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,382.982,383.398,No.
1988.88-266,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,390.904,397.141,"But what I mean is we cannot tell from the record whether the hotel is on the reservation or off the reservation, can we?"
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,397.141,401.628,"No, you cannot because... because that wasn't developed."
1988.88-266,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,403.428,406.247,Not... no allegation even one way or the other?
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,408.932,411.067,That alleges that taxes are owed.
1988.88-266,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,411.067,411.367,--Yeah.
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,411.367,411.984,Yes.
1988.88-266,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,411.984,414.036,Is there a reservation?
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,414.036,434.014,"No, there's no reservations in Oklahoma, so... I believe that was... that has been briefed throughout the case because many times it is necessary to--"
1988.88-266,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,434.014,437.2,"This is one of the assimilated tribes, is it?"
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,437.2,438.834,--Yes.
1988.88-266,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,448.857,452.411,"But isn't there any trust property, Indian trust property in Oklahoma?"
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,452.411,452.811,Yes.
1988.88-266,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,453.611,460.998,"Well, is this... is this... is this establishment on Indian trust property or not?"
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,460.998,478.492,"--It... well, it is not on an allotment as defined in Title 18 United States Code 1151(c) because the Indian title to this particular piece of land was extinguished, and it did go into non-Indian ownership."
1988.88-266,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,568.452,576.439,"Let me ask you, counsel, do the tribes have the authority to waive their immunity from suit?"
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,576.439,581.177,I believe they do have authority to waive immunity from suit.
1988.88-266,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,581.177,588.866,Have we so helm or is there a case that establishes that?
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,588.866,597.453,"I am not aware of a case that establishes their ability to waive, but they have not made a waiver in this case."
1988.88-266,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,597.453,598.369,Was there a disposition at that time?
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,598.703,608.392,"However, I don't think the waiver is necessary because their sovereignty does not extend that far, does not extend over the state's lawsuit."
1988.88-266,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,608.392,614.628,"Well, I recognize you claim, of courser they don't have immunity anyway, but they claim they do."
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,614.628,615.247,Yes.
1988.88-266,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,615.247,620.882,But you also take a position that it can be waived if they do have it?
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,620.882,624.02,I... I'm assuming that it can be waive.
1988.88-266,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,706.674,718.565,"Counsel, does the new Indian gaming Regulatory Act complete foreclose future efforts by Oklahoma to tax Indian bingo games?"
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,718.565,719.865,I believe it does.
1988.88-266,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,733.241,737.043,"But it's not retroactive, I take it?"
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,737.043,738.309,--That it is not retroactive?
1988.88-266,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,738.309,740.328,This new act?
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,744.713,745.882,"Well, this is a motel."
1988.88-266,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,761.075,764.361,--The state isn't trying to tax any of the bingo operation?
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,764.361,766.213,"No, not at this point."
1988.88-266,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,769.415,771.281,I thought that was part of the complaint.
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,771.281,785.274,"That was part of the complaint and now that is foreclosed, so when we do reach the merits of this case, bingo sales will not be a part of the effort to tax in this case."
1988.88-266,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,785.274,788.059,Why is that?
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,788.059,791.911,Because of the new Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.
1988.88-266,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,791.911,795.498,"Does that say that it's retroactive, that it applies retroactively?"
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,795.498,815.793,"Not it doesn't, but we have not collected any taxes from the bingo operations thus far, and the Tenth Circuit in the Creek Nation... Oklahoma Tax Commission versus the Creek Nation... held that we could not tax bingo sales."
1988.88-266,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,816.461,822.132,"We have a line of decision that says you decide the case on the basis of current law, and that's the current law."
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,833.188,844.813,"--Well, I... I suppose I am interpreting the current law as it stands in that now we will not be able to assert that cause."
1988.88-266,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,844.813,845.646,You're not asserting.
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,847.465,848.398,Yes.
1988.88-266,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1020.524,1025.909,"Well, that's not the issue before us, is it, the merits of whether--"
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1025.909,1048.092,"--No, the merits... but the merits are bound up in the... the... the sovereign immunity of tribe, and I feel that if the state has its right... has a right, it must also have the ability to enforce that right against the tribe."
1988.88-266,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1048.092,1052.811,--I just don't see why we have to address that at all.
1988.88-266,0,21180,david_allen_miley,,1052.811,1071.924,"Well, you wouldn't have to address it if... if the defense of sovereign immunity is not a valid defense, because it would have to go back down for trial at that point."
1988.88-266,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1164.317,1165.0,"Thank you, Mr. Miley."
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,1170.721,1173.34,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1988.88-266,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1205.21,1206.46,Nor that it can't.
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,1206.46,1209.496,Nor that it can't.
1988.88-266,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1217.785,1245.221,"Well, some of the cases are ones in which the tribe brings suit, and it's usually a concomitant of bringing suit that waivers implied to that extent, but if we assume that tribal immunity can be waived, then that issue is particularly speculative at this time, and it would seem to me to more like defense than an element of the complaint."
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,1245.221,1249.773,"Well, we don't view it in that light."
1988.88-266,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1277.406,1289.4,"Well, what if the suit... there were a state brought against a state anti the state wanted to assert 11th Amendment immunity?"
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,1310.479,1325.989,I think that the... I think that it would be incumbent upon the plaintiff in that case to allege... when you have a state as a party defendant--
1988.88-266,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1325.989,1326.389,Right.
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,1326.389,1330.025,--to allege the authority to... and that's happening in this case.
1988.88-266,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1330.025,1332.643,"There's no case for that proposition that, I know of."
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,1334.345,1336.714,"No, Your Honor."
1988.88-266,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1336.714,1344.117,The general rule surely is under the well pleaded complaint doctrine that the plaintiff sets forth its basis for recovery.
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,1350.621,1352.306,That is one test.
1988.88-266,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1352.306,1354.508,"Well, what other test is there?"
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,1354.508,1376.589,"Well, in the case of Gulley versus First National Bank, the Court, Justice Cardoza, said that there were other criteria, standards for removal of Jurisdiction that you look to, such as the probable course of the trial, the real substance of the case."
1988.88-266,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1398.019,1412.779,"Well, Gulley was decided in 1936, and in cases as recently as our Caterpillar, which are maybe one or two years old, certainly we've talked and talked only really about the well pleaded complaint doctrine."
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,1412.779,1420.468,"That assumes that the state can create a cause of action against an Indian tribe, and we don't think that they can."
1988.88-266,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1422.402,1430.306,"Well, but the... under the well pleaded complaint doctrine, you don't decide on how good a cause of action a complaint states."
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,1455.354,1476.434,"--If the well pleaded complaint rule governs and... and the well pleaded complaint does not raise or present substantial federal questions, and I believe that's what he Court said in Franchise Tax Board and Caterpillar versus Williams."
1988.88-266,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1476.434,1482.921,"Well, are you saying that the state's complaint here rested on federal law?"
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,1482.921,1484.023,Yes.
1988.88-266,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1494.396,1496.831,And what federal law is that?
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,1496.831,1498.2,Federal common law.
1988.88-266,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1498.2,1501.152,But what is the substance of the federal law?
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,1503.768,1506.037,"Well, in Oneida in the--"
1988.88-266,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1506.037,1511.007,I mean tell me just what the summarize what the federal law say that you're talking about.
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,1511.007,1524.933,"--Well, the power of Congress with regard to... with regard to whether or not an Indian tribe may be sued in the first instance is plenary."
1988.88-266,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1524.933,1548.014,"Well, the power of Congress to legislate in that area undoubtedly is plenary, but this doesn't mean that whenever... whenever someone sues an Indian tribe in the state court and simply sets forth a state ground of action, the Oklahoma tax law that says you're liable for sales tax, it... it becomes removable to federal court."
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,1548.014,1568.36,"Well, if the well pleaded complaint rule were to... were to apply in this particular case, we still submit that the case is completely preempted by... by federal law and the areas that are raised by... inherently in the complaint are completely preempted by federal law."
1988.88-266,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1579.299,1579.816,The problem is--
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,1579.816,1580.601,--as I recall--
1988.88-266,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1580.601,1586.338,--The problem is that it... that it isn't just the areas raised in the complaint that have to be preempted.
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,1633.718,1656.465,"--We think that when you name an Indian tribe a federally recognized and protected Indian tribe and a state asserts the right to apply its... its laws and to... to assert coercive state civil jurisdiction over it, that the complaint inherently presents federal questions, substantial federal questions."
1988.88-266,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2068.449,2074.119,"Counsel, there is no reservation today, is there?"
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,2074.119,2084.494,"We take the position that the reservation boundaries in Oklahoma have, with the exception of two Indian tribes that we know of, have never been abolished by Congress."
1988.88-266,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2297.847,2308.071,"Well, presumably the Oklahoma courts are competent to deal with that question, at least initially, and subject to ultimately being reviewed here?"
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,2308.071,2314.225,"Yes, and if this case was improperly removed and it is remanded back to the state court, the state court would get that opportunity."
1988.88-266,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2356.818,2363.372,Presumably the federal statute that's been enacted speaks to that question.
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,2363.372,2378.965,--The Court also held in that case that the tribe did not have sovereign immunity from suit in spite of the fact that there was nothing in the record that indicated that the tribe had waived sovereign immunity or that Congress has waived the tribe's sovereign immunity from suit.
1988.88-266,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2389.539,2391.308,Was there any appeal from that?
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,2391.308,2396.427,"That case, I believe, is on appeal to the Tenth Circuit at this time."
1988.88-266,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2396.427,2412.055,"Well, I can understand why you wanted to be out of the Oklahoma state courts, but just because you see an opinion of the Oklahoma state courts that you don't like and you figure well, it's useless litigating... useless litigating here, that doesn't necessarily give you a right to go into federal court."
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,2412.605,2415.174,"No, I'm not... I'm not contending that."
1988.88-266,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2431.283,2433.385,"--It's a federal claim, is that what you're contending--"
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,2433.385,2433.818,Yes.
1988.88-266,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2433.818,2437.27,"--that it is a federal claim, not the issues presented, but it is a federal claim that--"
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,2437.27,2438.372,"That the right, the--"
1988.88-266,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2438.372,2446.793,--Oklahoma was asserting a federal claim when it sought to collect state taxes is what you're telling us.
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,2446.793,2456.082,--It's asserting a federal claim to to assert its tax laws against the tribe is what I'm saying.
1988.88-266,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2456.082,2471.208,"I mean, what we said in Onelda, which... which you quote to us, is that it was a federal claim that was being asserted, and that's what you have to establish here, it seems to me, that the attempt to collect state taxes is a federal claim."
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,2472.974,2493.454,"In Onelda, I believe the Court found that the complaint only alleged a state law cause of action in ejectment, but that the underlying right to assert that... that cause of action had its origins in federal law."
1988.88-266,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2493.454,2502.727,I think what we said is that enough has been said to indicate that the complaint in this case asserts a present right to possession under federal law.
1988.88-266,1,17977,bob_rabon,,2508.047,2534.448,"Perhaps... perhaps I've misinterpreted what the Court has said there, but the way I interpreted that decision was that in that case, in spite of the fact that the complaint only alleged a state law cause of action... and that's what the Court said there, that it only alleged a state law cause of action in ejectment... the underlying right to assert that was based on federal law."
