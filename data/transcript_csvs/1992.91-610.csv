1992.91-610,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,12.759,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 91-610, Local 144 Nursing Home Pension Fund v. Nicholas Demisay."
1992.91-610,0,27907,henry_rose,,14.171,21.374,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-610,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,263.603,271.948,"Mr. Rose, if they had done so, would there have been a remedy against them under 302... under 302(e)?"
1992.91-610,0,27907,henry_rose,,271.948,274.639,If the trustees had transferred assets?
1992.91-610,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,274.639,274.969,Yes.
1992.91-610,0,27907,henry_rose,,279.955,281.825,To a union official--
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,1568.144,1576.469,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1992.91-610,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1647.429,1652.043,But all of the Southern Employees didn't in one sense.
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,1657.839,1658.908,"Yes, they did."
1992.91-610,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1659.389,1664.772,"So I don't see how, in light of that, your syllogism works."
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,1664.772,1679.241,"--Those employees have withdrawn from the plans, but they are entitled to benefit payments that have been earned by them prior to the date of their withdrawal."
1992.91-610,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1722.33,1734.289,"But the point is, is that under the statute... under the statute as you read it, these are still employees of the withdrawing employer."
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,1734.289,1752.42,"They are employees of the withdrawing employer, but as we read the statute, all of the contributions that go into these funds must be used for the benefit of the contributing employer either alone or jointly with."
1992.91-610,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1753.952,1766.161,"Well, if that's the way you interpret it, then it seems to me that the extension of your argument is that even if some employees of a particular employer leave, the result would still be to transfer the assets."
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,1766.161,1778.727,"--No, I... we think that's a different case, because if some of the employees remain in the fund, they will be earning on the pension side benefit credit."
1992.91-610,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1862.022,1875.172,"Mr. Richman, doesn't your theory overlook the fact that subsection (5) is couched in terms of money or other thing of value paid to a trust fund established for these purposes?"
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,1894.904,1898.957,"If... no, we don't believe so."
1992.91-610,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1925.476,1930.349,"Well, how does 302(c)(5) help you if the union official runs away with the money in any case?"
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,1961.427,1968.143,"We don't believe so, and this Court has recognized differently."
1992.91-610,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1983.053,1985.735,"In other words, it will enforce the terms of the trust--"
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,1985.735,1987.608,"--No, I think the--"
1992.91-610,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1987.608,1991.138,--But you want to do something other than enforce the terms of the trust.
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,1991.138,1991.809,--That's correct.
1992.91-610,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1999.385,2021.668,"But those standards simply refer to money paid in trust, meeting certain requirements set out in subsection (5), and if the money is in fact paid in accordance with those terms, how does subsection (5) provide any other standard by which a court is supposed to do anything?"
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,2021.668,2039.409,"--If that is the interpretation given to subsection (5), then at least a couple of the structural safeguards don't make any sense, because one of the structural safeguards is that the money be held in trust."
1992.91-610,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2050.288,2052.759,"Well, I mean, I'm not seeing your point."
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,2069.851,2084.96,"--Because, as I understand your suggestion, once the money is paid in, the trustees no longer have an obligation to follow any of the safeguards of 302(c)(5)."
1992.91-610,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2084.96,2086.31,"Well, the trustees have got an obligation to honor the terms of the trust."
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,2087.722,2092.356,But they could change the terms of the trust immediately after receipt--
1992.91-610,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2092.356,2096.338,"How could they do... I mean, how am I suggesting that the trustees can change the terms of the trust?"
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,2096.338,2108.336,"--Well, the trustees in multiemployer plans generally have the right to, and do, change the terms of the trust all the time."
1992.91-610,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2108.336,2110.938,In calculating benefits and so on.
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,2110.938,2113.208,"Well, no, that would be the terms of a plan."
1992.91-610,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2125.887,2130.979,Do they have any authority to change the terms with respect to the identification of beneficiaries?
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,2130.979,2135.344,--Yes.
1992.91-610,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2138.105,2148.323,"They could say... are you suggesting that they could say well, the employees of the X Corporation will no longer get benefits, even though we received funds expressly for that purpose?"
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,2148.323,2148.694,--No.
1992.91-610,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2148.694,2149.405,They couldn't do that.
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,2149.405,2151.087,"No, they couldn't do that, but they--"
1992.91-610,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2151.087,2153.95,"That's the kind of change that's at issue here, isn't it?"
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,2153.95,2168.228,"--But they could, for example, add a category of employees to receive benefits as long as that is done within the jointly with language."
1992.91-610,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2207.114,2217.011,"But Mr. Richman, (a) and (b) establish... of 302 establish the criminal violations."
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,2267.247,2295.157,"It is significant, except that when we get to subsection (c), and particularly (c)(5), which is an exception to the general rule, the statute does more than just say that the contributions need to be paid in."
1992.91-610,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2295.157,2299.658,But (c) is an exception from what has been criminalized in (a) and (b).
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,2320.404,2331.982,"If that were the case, then the protective value of all of the provisions in (c), really, they would be eliminated completely."
1992.91-610,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2331.982,2333.004,No.
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,2357.161,2362.495,"No, it... the... 302(e), however--"
1992.91-610,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2362.495,2363.727,(e).
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,2363.727,2380.027,"--Enables the district courts... it provides the district courts with jurisdiction to, in the parlance that's been used by at least five or six of the circuit courts, correct structural defects."
1992.91-610,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2380.027,2387.173,"Well, it says to restrain violations, but it's no violation of this section to break a trust agreement."
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,2391.567,2457.087,"Well, in coming back to this Court's statement in Robinson, when the Court said that compliance with the specific standards in administration... and we believe that that statement was about the specific structural standards in 302(c)(5)... is enforceable under 302(e), and in fact the Robinson case itself, a unanimous decision by this Court, in that case, if the interpretation of the statute had been that the limitations apply only upon receipt of contributions, the Court, instead of being concerned about whether 302(c)(5) created a reasonableness standard to judge whether certain benefits violated 302(c)(5) or not, would have easily said, we don't have to do that because 302(c)(5) only replies to the receipt of money."
1992.91-610,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2457.087,2460.52,"Once again, (c)(5) is... (c) is entitled, Exceptions."
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,2492.743,2522.061,"If that were the case, this law was passed more than 25 years prior to ERISA, and we believe that Congress thought that it was creating some safeguards not only with the receipt of money, but that the money would go into these funds, and then it also would be used for the benefit of the employees for whom those contributions were made."
1992.91-610,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2563.03,2567.682,"Criminal statutes... I mean, normally we interpret criminal statutes strictly, don't we?"
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,2567.682,2576.618,"--Yes, you do, but this is not being applied in a criminal context, this is applied in a civil context under 302(e)."
1992.91-610,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2576.618,2579.45,Is it one way for civil purposes and another way for criminal purposes?
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,2581.511,2603.986,"No, I... we believe that under 302(e), the Second Circuit correctly remedied this structural defect by ordering a transfer of the fair surplus in the Greater Funds."
1992.91-610,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2603.986,2612.702,"What, again, is the precise language in (c) that confers the authority on the courts to remedy a structural defect?"
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,2612.702,2616.533,That appears in 302(e).
1992.91-610,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2616.533,2622.937,"Well, all it says is jurisdiction of courts--"
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,2622.937,2624.249,To restrain--
1992.91-610,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2624.249,2625.429,--To restrain violations--
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,2625.429,2625.579,--Violations.
1992.91-610,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2625.579,2626.67,--Of this section.
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,2631.024,2643.881,"A structural defect that is a violation of one of the specific standards in 302(c)(5), in our case the standard requiring--"
1992.91-610,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2643.881,2651.297,But I would think a violation of this section would mean something contrary to (a) or (b).
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,2674.342,2709.485,"--Except that, and again getting back to, really, the same issue that I was talking about a moment ago, if that is the case, then these structural safeguards which we believe that Congress thought it was adopting not only for the receipt of contributions but for the actual administration of the plan and the distribution benefits would be eliminated completely."
1992.91-610,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2709.485,2728.768,"Well, but really, it would be... it's quite extraordinary, isn't it, to say that Congress put all of the things that you want to see, or you say should be put to this use, not in a more general statute regulating these sort of agreements, but in an exception to a criminal provision, a rather narrow criminal provision?"
1992.91-610,1,40302,ronald_e_richman,,2728.768,2737.892,I don't understand the concern with the language.
1992.91-610,2,27907,henry_rose,,3292.794,3297.448,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1992.91-610,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3313.39,3315.673,What if there was?
1992.91-610,2,27907,henry_rose,,3315.673,3318.334,"I don't think it would make any difference, Justice White."
1992.91-610,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3321.157,3327.02,"He's not your adversary, Mr. Rose He's your friend."
1992.91-610,2,27907,henry_rose,,3332.506,3336.346,--Not these clients.
1992.91-610,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3395.406,3398.396,"I didn't say there was no answer to the argument, Mr. Rose."
1992.91-610,2,27907,henry_rose,,3404.63,3408.674,"It's a difficult hurdle to get over, but that won't do it."
1992.91-610,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3408.674,3419.13,"Mr. Rose, in response to questions by Justice O'Connor earlier today, she suggested that maybe all we have to do is decide there's... 302(c)(5) doesn't justify the result below."
1992.91-610,2,27907,henry_rose,,3429.989,3437.983,"Clearly, that ERISA does not require a transfer of assets such as being sought in this case."
1992.91-610,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3439.916,3440.984,Because it's the same union.
1992.91-610,2,27907,henry_rose,,3440.984,3443.996,--For... there are a number of provisions.
1992.91-610,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3453.272,3454.564,"Well, we don't have to say it's a prohibited transaction."
1992.91-610,2,27907,henry_rose,,3457.917,3458.798,--That is correct.
1992.91-610,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3467.136,3477.814,"We surely don't have to decide that, because if we say 302(c)(5) doesn't justify it, and it's not prohibited by ERISA, why do we have to go on and say what might or might not be mandated?"
1992.91-610,2,27907,henry_rose,,3477.814,3480.075,"You're quite right, you don't have to."
1992.91-610,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3496.778,3498.611,"Mr. Rose, excellent."
1992.91-610,2,27907,henry_rose,,3501.233,3511.749,"--That the legislative history somehow did talk about the use of the money in the plan, and I would question that that is so."
1992.91-610,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3562.591,3564.294,"Thank you, Mr. Rose."
