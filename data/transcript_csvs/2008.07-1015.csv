2008.07-1015,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.32,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case 07-1015, Ashcroft versus Iqbal."
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,7.57,24.298,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns the qualified immunity of high-ranking government officials, like the Attorney General of the United States and Director of the FBI, and supervisory liability claims under Bivens based on the alleged wrongdoing of much lower level officials."
2008.07-1015,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,56.62,60.955,"General Garre, will you clarify one point?"
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,76.198,77.583,--It is a 12(b)(6) motion.
2008.07-1015,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,77.583,80.868,And so that tests just the pleading.
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,109.221,111.571,"No, for two reasons, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.07-1015,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,170.093,176.264,"Well, Mr. Garre, isn't there more involved here than simply derivative liability for the acts of others?"
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,203.481,205.266,"Well, I think that that's fair, Justice Souter."
2008.07-1015,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,240.772,242.872,"Well, why don't -- may I just interrupt you there?"
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,271.724,275.41,"I think if you look at the complaint, that -- that interpretation doesn't hold up."
2008.07-1015,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,333.032,341.221,"You don't -- you don't dispute that, whatever the policy was, that it was approved and condoned by the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI?"
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,341.221,355.028,"We've accepted that at some level that this complaint maintains, and it's in paragraph 69, that there was a policy of holding suspects until they -- the suspects were determined to be of interest by the FBI, until they were cleared by the FBI in connection with this investigation."
2008.07-1015,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,365.836,376.728,"Well, it may -- it may very well be, but isn't it, for purposes of a complaint, sufficient to raise a due process claim by saying what they say?"
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,402.859,409.865,"--Not with respect to the Petitioners here, the former Attorney General and the Director of the FBI, because -- and I think in evaluating--"
2008.07-1015,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,409.865,414.651,"Even -- even if, as the Chief Justice said, they knew and condoned the policy?"
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,414.651,417.084,"--Well, the question is which policy, what policy?"
2008.07-1015,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,429.727,431.794,"Well, you may be -- you -- I mean, you may be right."
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,446.253,447.205,--No.
2008.07-1015,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,475.789,478.891,"The difference, it -- and maybe this isn't a sufficient difference."
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,542.6,546.635,That's one of the reasons why I think it's important to distinguish between the different sets of claims.
2008.07-1015,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,567.965,588.629,"General Garre, I think that the Bell Atlantic case -- and -- and I'm sure that Justice Souter will correct me if I'm wrong about this, but most of it is about what it takes -- what are the essential elements of a Sherman section 1 charge."
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,633.786,637.138,"And we're not asking for a heightened pleading standard, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.07-1015,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,660.103,666.424,"That -- that sounds like an argument on the merits of the Bivens claim, rather than an argument going to qualified immunity."
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,666.424,676.048,"It -- it's not -- I mean, in -- in a similar way that this Court considered the scope of a Bivens cause of action in the Wilkie case recently and in the Hartman case recently."
2008.07-1015,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,714.839,718.041,How does -- how does this work in an ordinary case?
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,766.606,767.289,And I think it would be--
2008.07-1015,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,767.289,769.172,Where does it say that in the rules?
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,769.172,774.093,"--It -- it says that, as this Court interpreted it, in Rule 8 of the rules, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-1015,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,774.093,774.526,In Rule 8?
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,774.526,775.462,"Yes, because in Rule 8--"
2008.07-1015,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,775.462,778.062,I thought Rule 8 was move for a more definite statement.
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,778.062,778.497,--No.
2008.07-1015,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,791.104,793.339,He shows a plausible entitlement.
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,803.279,803.712,--It's--
2008.07-1015,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,803.712,808.933,So he wants to go to the judge and say: I've set out a claim here; I copied it right out of the rules.
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,814.087,816.22,"--Rule 8 does, as interpreted--"
2008.07-1015,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,816.22,816.872,Where?
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,816.872,821.091,"--in Bell Atlantic, because that is not a plausible entitlement of a claim to relief--"
2008.07-1015,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,821.091,832.379,"But, Mr. Garre, you are using the word ""plausible"" or you're taking the word ""plausible"" out of Bell Atlantic, I think, and you are using it to mean something that probably can be proven to be true."
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,843.754,844.956,--I certainly agree with you.
2008.07-1015,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,851.876,852.343,Okay.
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,904.745,911.581,"--Well, we certainly think -- I mean, in Bell Atlantic, the Court said common economic experience would -- would support its determination in that case."
2008.07-1015,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,924.741,930.312,"Well, I would agree, but this is about as far from common government operation as one can get."
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,930.312,942.786,"--The -- and I think that gets to one of the fundamental problems with the Second Circuit decision, is it held the extraordinary context of the 9/11 attacks and the aftermath of those attacks against the Petitioners in this case."
2008.07-1015,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,948.274,949.74,"Oh, I know, but the courts can't--"
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,949.74,950.157,--deal with something like that.
2008.07-1015,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,950.157,952.825,"--The courts can't ignore the extraordinary circumstances, either."
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,952.825,960.497,But it's problematic because you have to look at the reality of the job of the Attorney General of the United States and the Director of the FBI.
2008.07-1015,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,974.674,977.157,"I'm sorry, I just don't have the answer to my question."
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1008.311,1010.93,"--Well, Rule 26 governs discovery, Justice Breyer."
2008.07-1015,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1010.93,1011.53,"Well, I see that."
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1038.013,1043.334,"Well, the power to -- to govern discovery doesn't solve the problem for the same reason that it didn't in Bell Atlantic."
2008.07-1015,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1105.807,1114.847,"Well, what -- I mean, my basic question, which I really want to hear the answer to, is the Attorney General is very busy and what he does is very important."
2008.07-1015,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1143.766,1144.166,--How about--
2008.07-1015,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1144.166,1145.432,--I'll bet those people are being harassed--
2008.07-1015,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1145.432,1150.003,--How about Rule 11 to take care of Justice Breyer's problem?
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1162.828,1163.178,Sure.
2008.07-1015,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1165.23,1165.896,Reading the Riot--
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1165.896,1166.632,--And this Court--
2008.07-1015,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1166.632,1177.488,--Reading the Riot Act to the lawyer is protection against the Attorney General and the Director of the FBI after they're hauled in for discovery or subjected to depositions and the judge finds out--
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1177.488,1178.021,--We--
2008.07-1015,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1178.021,1179.356,"--I'm sorry, Mr. Garre."
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1188.378,1191.413,"--It's certainly not adequate protection, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-1015,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1191.413,1195.282,I was responding to Justice Breyer's Coca-Cola president.
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1199.353,1205.34,I would have thought that this Court's decision in Bell Atlantic put an end to those sorts of claims where the court--
2008.07-1015,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1205.34,1230.555,"Well, Mr. Garre, it seems to me you are really arguing -- I am very sympathetic to the argument -- that if there was no plausible claim in Bell Atlantic, in which there was a direct allegation of a conspiracy in violation of section 1, was rejected because the Court thought it implausible, a fortiori this claim is implausible because it's got exactly the same problems in that you don't want to subject these important people to all the inconvenience of discovery."
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1232.574,1234.274,"--Absolutely, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-1015,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1236.092,1245.965,"Of course, in both of the cases, the job of the district judge would have been made much easier if one of the defendants had filed an affidavit denying those allegations, but nobody has done that in either case."
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1245.965,1249.452,"--No one did it in either case, but in both cases the defendants are entitled to dismissal."
2008.07-1015,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1273.15,1276.769,I have two questions -- I have two questions that might be related.
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1287.827,1288.56,And--
2008.07-1015,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1288.56,1296.414,"And I wanted to reach the second, and I was wondering if the second would address this sub-question that I have."
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1306.538,1320.029,"--Well, let me answer both those questions: First, the second point I wanted to add is interrelated with the first, and that's that the court of appeals applied an overly expansive conception of the supervisory liabilities available under Bivens."
2008.07-1015,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1372.481,1378.901,I do have the same lingering doubts as Justice -- or concerns or questions as Justice Breyer.
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1387.673,1391.144,"--Well, we don't think you had to wait for Twombly to get rid of those claims."
2008.07-1015,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1424.198,1442.577,"General Garre, there was a reference, I think, in Judge Gleason's decision in the Eastern District to the Office of the Inspector General report on the detainees' treatment at the Metropolitan Detention Center."
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1448.814,1450.464,"We don't think so, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.07-1015,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1536.067,1538.202,"Mr. Garre, can I ask you a factual question because I really don't know?"
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1548.641,1553.176,"They are being defended by the Department of Justice, the -- the Attorney General and Director of the FBI."
2008.07-1015,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1553.176,1555.878,And that applies even if there would be a trial later on?
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1555.878,1559.997,"Yes, and that's a discretionary determination that has been made in this case."
2008.07-1015,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1559.997,1560.347,I see.
2008.07-1015,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1560.347,1567.519,"Is there other litigation, General Garre, pending with respect to the detentions?"
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1567.519,1569.47,"Yes, there are other claims."
2008.07-1015,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1613.231,1624.022,Is there -- is there a Tort Claims Act action pending or -- I don't know where I got that impression -- arising out of these detentions?
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1624.022,1631.628,"--There are tort claims, Federal Tort Claims Acts, asserted in this case, and there's other parallel litigation going on in the Second Circuit, Justice Ginsburg."
2008.07-1015,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1633.045,1633.528,"Thank you, General."
2008.07-1015,0,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1633.528,1634.247,Thank you.
2008.07-1015,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1634.247,1639.199,Mr. Reinert.
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,1639.199,1656.076,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think I should start with paragraph 69 of the complaint because I think Petitioners' treatment of paragraph 69 shows why they have no coherent theory of what a conclusory allegation is and what it's not."
2008.07-1015,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1711.544,1723.852,"Well, General Garre said there's no question that there was a policy, and that it was known by and approved by the Petitioners here, but that the policy is different from the policy that you allege."
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,1723.852,1724.618,"Well, Justice--"
2008.07-1015,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1724.618,1725.019,And that's the question.
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,1737.777,1743.681,"--Well, paragraph 96 specifically alleges knowledge, and Rule 9(b) says you can allege knowledge generally."
2008.07-1015,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1750.168,1771.914,"As to paragraphs 96 and 97, which did seem to be the most specific, are those based on any specific information that you have concerning Petitioners, or are they based on inferences that you think you can draw from your allegations about what happened and the nature of the responsibilities of the Petitioners?"
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,1771.914,1776.985,They are based in -- they are based in part on the Office of Inspector General's report about what happened after September 11th.
2008.07-1015,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1785.305,1786.772,I'm not sure that really answered my question.
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,1792.393,1792.693,--Yes.
2008.07-1015,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1811.705,1826.33,Are you suggesting General Garre's statement he just made to us -- he said there's nothing in the Office of the Inspector General's report that suggests that the Attorney General or the head of the FBI were engaged in any wrongdoing?
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,1826.33,1827.68,"--Oh, I don't think that's correct, Your Honor."
2008.07-1015,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1851.613,1856.933,"Well, that's a little bit different -- if I could interrupt you -- than saying, make the conditions of confinement as harsh as possible."
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,1871.591,1882.648,"Well -- and certainly, Your Honor, we have also -- I mean, we have -- this case is at a funny posture, right, because we have all this discovery that we have obtained since the complaint was filed which, we think, confirms the allegations in this complaint."
2008.07-1015,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1894.856,1902.045,"Well, you -- you could have said the same thing about the existence of a conspiracy in -- in the antitrust case."
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,1906.597,1907.282,"--Well, the difference--"
2008.07-1015,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1907.282,1916.138,"We say you need something more in order to go forward, something more than, you know, you prevented these people from talking to Johnny Cochran."
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,1917.421,1929.479,"--Well, but, Justice Scalia, the difference between this case and Bell Atlantic is exactly what Justice Souter alluded to in his colloquy with General Garre, which is that in -- in Bell Atlantic there were two possible -- there were two possibilities."
2008.07-1015,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1933.597,1935.466,"Well, there are two possibilities here."
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,1965.235,1967.252,"Well, Your Honor, we have two different theories, right."
2008.07-1015,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1989.315,2007.21,"Do you agree that -- to follow up on Justice Breyer's questioning of General Garre, do you believe that the same pleading standards apply in the action against the president of Coca-Cola as apply to the actions of the Attorney General and Director of the FBI on the evening of September 11, 2001?"
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2007.21,2009.829,"--Certainly, Your Honor, I think the same pleading standards apply."
2008.07-1015,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2009.829,2010.395,I'm sorry?
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2011.614,2013.697,"Certainly, Your Honor, I think the same pleading standards apply."
2008.07-1015,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2020.084,2024.022,"Well, why -- why isn't the protection -- I have the number of the rule I want."
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2052.271,2052.955,"Well, certainly--"
2008.07-1015,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2052.955,2054.123,Can he do that or not?
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2054.123,2056.659,"--No -- Justice Breyer, yes, a district court judge can do that."
2008.07-1015,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2056.659,2057.025,"Yes, he can."
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2057.025,2059.861,"In fact, the Second Circuit directed the district court to do that here."
2008.07-1015,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2074.12,2093.015,"Well, I mean, that's lovely, that -- that the -- the ability of the Attorney General and Director of the FBI to -- to do their jobs without having to litigate personal liability is dependent upon the discretionary decision of a single district judge."
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2099.836,2103.538,"Your -- Your Honor, it gives them quite a bit, Justice Scalia, and they got--"
2008.07-1015,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2103.538,2105.456,"It doesn't give them much, if that's all it gives them."
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2105.456,2115.812,"--Well, Justice Scalia, in this case what they were permitted to argue was that the law was not clearly established."
2008.07-1015,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2134.123,2137.141,So the pleading standard -- let's leave the president of Coca-Cola out of it.
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2152.317,2156.703,"Your Honor -- Mr. Chief Justice, the pleading standard isn't different."
2008.07-1015,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2164.625,2173.48,"But your -- your response then focuses solely on the merits of the underlying claim, not any requirement of -- of heightened pleading."
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2173.48,2178.016,"--That's correct, Your Honor, and we think that this Court has rejected heightened pleading at every instance."
2008.07-1015,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2183.003,2194.894,"Well I thought -- and others may know better in connection to Bell Atlantic, but I thought in Bell Atlantic what we said is that there's a standard, but it's an affected by the context in which the allegations are made."
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2224.263,2228.901,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there's no reference to that in the rules."
2008.07-1015,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2238.507,2249.98,Do you -- do you disagree with the notion that Bell Atlantic at least established that the level of pleading required depends on the context of the claim -- the context of the particular case?
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2249.98,2262.204,"I don't -- I don't understand Bell Atlantic to argue that the level of pleading requires -- depends on the context of the case, but that the substantive liability that is in the background of the case affects what you have to plead."
2008.07-1015,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2271.993,2275.678,But they pleaded a conspiracy -- they pleaded a conspiracy in Bell Atlantic.
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2283.417,2295.975,"--Well, what this Court -- Justice Scalia, what this Court said in Bell Atlantic, to the extent it disregarded the allegation about agreement -- it said the problem with the agreement was that it didn't allege what, it didn't allege who, it didn't allege when."
2008.07-1015,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2301.629,2302.079,When?
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2302.079,2302.812,--when it occurred--
2008.07-1015,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2302.812,2303.295,Does it say when?
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2304.081,2305.497,--In the weeks after September 11th.
2008.07-1015,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2305.497,2311.032,I don't know on what basis any of these allegations against the high-level officials are made.
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2311.032,2316.603,"Justice Scalia, they are made on the basis of the information that we garnered from the Office of Inspector General's report."
2008.07-1015,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2318.471,2320.507,"Well, we'll -- we'll check that."
2008.07-1015,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2320.507,2321.257,Mr. Reinert--
2008.07-1015,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2321.257,2322.89,The Solicitor General contests that.
2008.07-1015,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2322.89,2325.959,--I want to throw you a question.
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2400.042,2407.279,"--Well, I think that -- I think that is our -- our contention, Your Honor, because it's a -- it's an allegation about a policy."
2008.07-1015,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2407.279,2417.718,"So you would say, if -- to the Coke question you would say, yes, they've got to get more facts there, this is just -- this is just crazy to think that the president is putting mice in the bottles."
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2436.096,2440.5,"We certainly don't think it's absurd or bizarre, which is the argument that the Petitioners raised below--"
2008.07-1015,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2440.5,2441.033,But that's also not the--
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2441.033,2442.35,--I'm sorry.
2008.07-1015,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2442.35,2456.76,"--Absurd and bizarre is also not the pleading standard, and how are we -- to follow up on Justice Souter's question -- how are we supposed to judge whether we think it's more unlikely that the president of Coca-Cola would take certain actions as opposed to the Attorney General of the United States?"
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2456.76,2459.795,I think it is a problem posed by that interpretation of Bell Atlantic.
2008.07-1015,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2464.599,2478.708,"Of course, the problem with the president of the Coca-Cola is the allegation probably would be that the Coca-Cola Company has adopted sloppy procedures in its manufacturing lines, and the president is responsible for those procedures, and that's why the bottles are filled with rats."
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2478.708,2479.158,--Well--
2008.07-1015,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2479.158,2480.308,That's the way you would allege it.
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2481.993,2482.46,"--Well, Justice Stevens--"
2008.07-1015,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2482.46,2483.643,And then you would have a similar question.
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2483.643,2498.603,"--You probably wouldn't say he did it personally, and there might be a respondeat superior theory there, for liability, that we don't have access to in the Bivens arena, which we concede; we have to establish a link between the unconstitutional conduct and -- and the actions of the Petitioners."
2008.07-1015,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2507.443,2518.166,"No, this is a policy of being derelict in the sanitary conditions in the plant and so forth and so on; therefore, mice -- mice are getting into bottles with undue frequency, and the president is responsible for that."
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2521.218,2522.987,"It -- I -- I don't know that it is fanciful, Justice Stevens."
2008.07-1015,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2523.454,2525.439,I'm not suggesting that Coca-Cola really does that.
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2526.122,2527.089,"--No, certainly not."
2008.07-1015,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2527.956,2528.808,--But the standard theory is that--
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2528.808,2534.212,"I think -- I mean, the essential point in this case is that the Second Circuit was faced with a dilemma."
2008.07-1015,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2544.251,2546.52,"Well, they weren't ""all"" completely -- they were not--"
2008.07-1015,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2546.52,2565.064,"I was just going to say the -- the difficulty with wrestling with the case through the perspective of the hypothetical of the mice in the bottles is that it's -- it's by its nature particularly absurd, but what if the allegation is that the president of Coca Cola is individually involved in a particular price-fixing scheme?"
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2574.103,2577.638,"--Well, I guess I want to distinguish that allegation from the allegations here."
2008.07-1015,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2615.394,2615.844,But that's easy.
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2631.856,2632.206,--Yes.
2008.07-1015,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2632.206,2634.908,--based on ethnicity and country of origin.
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2634.908,2642.913,"And I think I was -- I was trying to get there, Mr. Chief Justice, and the way I would say it is this: We've alleged that they knew, in paragraph 96, that the policy was discriminatory."
2008.07-1015,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2675.467,2678.25,"No, but they didn't -- that isn't what 96 says."
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2785.521,2790.24,"Well, Justice Breyer, if those are the facts, then those are facts that have to be established through discovery."
2008.07-1015,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2803.9,2807.702,They'll -- they'll deny the facts; then you'll say there's a factual matter.
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2838.073,2847.429,"Well, the Second Circuit gives a clear path for defendants in that situation, Justice Breyer, and the answer is, if you want to make a Rule 12(e) motion, make it; it was referred to in Crawford-El."
2008.07-1015,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2852.314,2853.999,--May I just interrupt?
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2858.935,2859.57,--That's correct.
2008.07-1015,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2859.57,2865.557,So you do have discovery of maybe 25 to 30 officials who would have a lot of information about this case.
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2878.114,2883.268,"Well, as to postponing discovery, that's exactly what the Second Circuit directed the district court to do."
2008.07-1015,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2895.959,2898.142,What is the statute of limitations that would apply?
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2898.142,2899.744,"It's 3 years here, Your Honor."
2008.07-1015,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2905.397,2907.614,You have -- you have not had discovery from the Attorney General or--
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2907.614,2908.182,--Certainly not.
2008.07-1015,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2908.182,2908.616,--So--
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2908.616,2909.182,Certainly not.
2008.07-1015,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2909.182,2922.59,--So it's -- it's as though discovery with respect to those two defendants was stayed pending your discovery from the lower level defendants?
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2922.59,2924.275,"In fact, it has been formally stayed, Justice Ginsburg--"
2008.07-1015,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2924.275,2924.725,Has it?
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2924.725,2927.394,--And the Second Circuit's decision confirms that.
2008.07-1015,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2928.06,2934.88,"--Well, that may be what happened here, but if -- if the Second Circuit is affirmed, there may be other suits that are like this."
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2953.711,2954.844,"--Well, if this Court--"
2008.07-1015,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2954.844,2959.781,"It's a discretionary decision, interlocutory discretionary decision by the trial judge."
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,2959.781,2972.272,"--Well, if -- Justice Alito, if this Court in affirming the Second Circuit outlines and says the Second Circuit took the proper steps -- this is what the district court should do -- then if any district court disregards that, then there could be a petition for mandamus."
2008.07-1015,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3046.903,3048.536,--May I ask you this question?
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,3216.71,3222.78,"Well, Your Honor, Justice Souter, I do think that in this way the OIG report is very instructive."
2008.07-1015,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3233.702,3235.254,Did -- you'll have to help me out.
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,3236.921,3243.943,"--We alleged that many -- like many -- plaintiffs, like many detainees, were held for no reason."
2008.07-1015,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3243.943,3244.377,Okay.
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,3244.977,3245.777,That's what we alleged.
2008.07-1015,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3280.681,3295.524,"--Are you -- are you saying that the -- that the claim that there was no penological interest for certain decisions goes simply to the distinction between the decision whether to classify as ""of interest"" versus as ""of high interest""?"
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,3295.524,3304.899,"--No, Your Honor, I think it's -- I think it's very difficult for us to say in a complaint anything other than no -- no legitimate penological interest, because we couldn't go through the complaint proving all the negatives."
2008.07-1015,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3316.371,3319.575,Is -- is no penological interest enough?
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,3319.575,3320.858,--Oh--
2008.07-1015,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3320.858,3330.547,"I mean, is that the only basis -- after an attack on the country of the magnitude of 9/11, is that the only basis on which people could be held?"
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,3335.784,3336.868,--Well--
2008.07-1015,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3336.868,3341.17,"Surely for at least a period, you can hold people just -- just to investigate?"
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,3341.17,3346.49,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I don't think for a period it's constitutional to hold them solely based on their race, religion, and national origin."
2008.07-1015,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3346.924,3348.426,"Well, it wasn't solely on that."
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,3348.426,3349.759,"--Well, that is the allegation."
2008.07-1015,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3354.662,3362.185,"But the net was surely not cast wide enough if anybody with that race, religion was -- was swept in."
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,3362.185,3362.968,Well--
2008.07-1015,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3362.968,3367.137,"I mean, if it's solely for that reason, there would have been hundreds of thousands of others."
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,3367.137,3370.422,"--Justice Scalia, that is the allegation in the complaint, that as individuals were encountered--"
2008.07-1015,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3370.422,3372.772,--implausible.
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,3372.772,3375.457,"--We respectfully disagree with -- about that, Justice Scalia."
2008.07-1015,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3376.29,3386.098,Wasn't it limited to people who were already indicted on other charges?
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,3386.098,3386.682,--These were people--
2008.07-1015,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3386.682,3399.572,We're not dealing with the universe of men who are of a certain national origin; we are dealing with only ones who were incarcerated for an offense that has nothing to do with terrorism.
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,3399.572,3407.445,"--Justice Ginsburg, these were individuals who were swept up either in the immigration detention system or in the justice criminal detention system, and that's where the classification was made."
2008.07-1015,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3409.63,3411.23,I'm sorry -- swept up?
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,3417.903,3419.503,"--That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, that's correct."
2008.07-1015,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3465.8,3466.35,You can finish.
2008.07-1015,1,16838,alexander_a_reinert,,3466.35,3475.405,"The Petitioners were allowed to rely on the 9/11 context in making their argument about qualified immunity, about the objective reasonableness of their conduct, and about whether the law was clearly established."
2008.07-1015,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3477.441,3479.474,"Thank you, counsel."
2008.07-1015,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3481.393,3482.293,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2008.07-1015,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3496.519,3498.021,But it -- it did happen?
2008.07-1015,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3498.988,3509.477,"--To the grace of the district court, that's right, and I think Judge Cabranes emphasized the -- the concerns of potentially vexatious discovery in this context, and we certainly wholeheartedly agree with that."
2008.07-1015,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3553.573,3562.011,"Mr. Garre, I just wanted to -- would you say that the -- the Attorney General might be subject to taking a deposition, even if he's not a defendant?"
2008.07-1015,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3562.011,3563.713,Certainly we would -- we would oppose that.
2008.07-1015,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3565.999,3571.201,Is there any -- some standard rule of law that government officials don't have to testify at proceedings?
2008.07-1015,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3571.201,3573.153,"I don't know that there is that standard, Your Honor."
2008.07-1015,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3573.919,3577.021,I certainly didn't think there was when I wrote Clinton v. Jones.
2008.07-1015,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3578.973,3580.759,"--Fair enough, Your Honor."
2008.07-1015,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3589.163,3595.351,And the reason you can't make this argument under 26(b)(2)(C) is?
2008.07-1015,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3595.351,3599.72,"--Well, we are in the realm of discovery, and we are in the realm of relying on the district court--"
2008.07-1015,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3599.72,3604.005,The judge there is supposed to weigh burdens versus desirability of going forward.
2008.07-1015,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3609.209,3615.313,--For the reason this Court gave in Bell Atlantic: We don't rely on district court judges to weed out potentially meritless claims through discovery.
2008.07-1015,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3617.932,3621.919,"If you are right, you win assuming you get a district judge who is also right."
2008.07-1015,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3621.919,3622.686,Right.
2008.07-1015,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3622.686,3627.454,"And that's also true, I guess, of complaints, and every other legal question."
2008.07-1015,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3627.454,3630.506,"We think that Bell Atlantic answers that question correctly, Your Honor."
2008.07-1015,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3669.483,3670.2,"Thank you, General Garre--"
2008.07-1015,2,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3670.2,3670.7,Thank you.
2008.07-1015,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3670.7,3671.167,--Mr. Reinert.
