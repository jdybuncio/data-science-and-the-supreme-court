2019.19-7,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.24,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 19-7, Seila Law versus the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Mr. Shanmugam."
2019.19-7,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,8.24,15.24,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The structure of the CFPB is unprecedented and unconstitutional."
2019.19-7,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,134.04,142.8,"Mr. Shanmugam, this case has kind of an academic quality to it."
2019.19-7,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,211.48,244.68,"Justice Ginsburg, there is a live dispute between us and the government because we want the Civil Investigative Demand to be invalidated and the government seeks to enforce it. On this question of ratification, we don't believe that there is a live issue on ratification, not least because, when the government raised this issue below, it presented no evidence, no factual evidence, that the acting director, in fact, ratified the Civil Investigative Demand. But where we agree with the government is that, at most, that would be an issue that would be live on remand."
2019.19-7,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,281.24,282.16,But you would be --
2019.19-7,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,282.16,282.84,May I ask --
2019.19-7,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,282.84,289.16,-- you would be harmed in the very same way if the President had the full removal power.
2019.19-7,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,289.16,319.64,"If the President had the full removal power and then a properly appointed and removable director sought to enforce a Civil Investigative Demand against us, then, sure, we would no longer have the argument that we are making now. But this Court time and again has said that where an action has been taken by an unaccountable executive official, that creates a here-and-now injury and an injury that a private individual can vindicate."
2019.19-7,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,331.36,369.04,"My problem is more -- somewhat like Justice Ginsburg's, but you started by saying an unprecedented agency. Well, there is at least two others, the Office of Special Counsel and the Social Security Administration, which have single heads subject to some limitations on removal. And I see the Social Security Administration being as powerful, if not more powerful, than this agency, because the Social Security Administration affects virtually every American."
2019.19-7,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,388.12,407.56,"I would differ with you, Justice Sotomayor, only in that I do think that the level of executive power wielded by the CFPB is unprecedented precisely because it takes enforcement action. The Social Security Administration unquestionably affects millions of Americans, but one thing it doesn't do is to take enforcement action."
2019.19-7,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,430.24,459.12,"Given that your client is not the President, it seems to me that the person who should be complaining is the President, not your client. Shouldn't we address the severability question and leave for another day the issue that would cause harm, i.e., shouldn't we address severability first? If we find this severable, then it's academic whether the person -- President has power."
2019.19-7,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,474.16,480.44,"This Court, in the modern era, has not required there to be a contested removal."
2019.19-7,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,495.6,497.76,That's not my point.
2019.19-7,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,501.0,501.4,No.
2019.19-7,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,562.4,575.16,"Well, speaking about modesty, this is a very modest restraint, inefficiency, malfeasance."
2019.19-7,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,633.24,635.96,"So two points in response to that, Justice Ginsburg."
2019.19-7,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,720.2,746.64,"I -- I think Justice Ginsburg's point included what the standard would be like, the inefficiency, malfeasance, whatever, and I don't think we've done this in prior cases, but wouldn't the normal principles of constitutional avoidance suggest that we might want to scrutinize a little bit how rigorous a limitation that is before we get to the point of striking down the statute? I mean, just take inefficiency."
2019.19-7,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,769.6,797.08,"Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that that term has ever been understood that broadly, and, of course, this Court has a long history of dealing with the inefficiency, neglect, and malfeasance standard dating back to Humphrey's Executor. And I would refer the Court to Judge Wilkinson's concurring opinion in the D.C. Circuit in PHH, which I think walks through each of the terms and explains why what those terms really require is something closer to outright incompetence."
2019.19-7,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,825.0,825.52,On severability --
2019.19-7,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,825.52,826.2,"So, for instance --"
2019.19-7,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,826.2,829.56,"And so, if we --"
2019.19-7,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,829.56,830.64,"No, go ahead."
2019.19-7,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,830.64,843.52,"On severability, what do you do with the text of the severability clause? You -- you mentioned we would be rewriting the Dodd-Frank Act. But wouldn't we be rewriting it by ignoring the text of the severability clause?"
2019.19-7,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,843.52,845.6,"I -- I -- I don't think so, Justice Kavanaugh."
2019.19-7,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,913.32,923.88,"But the Court said that back in an era when we didn't pay as much attention to the text of the statute, and the text of the statute here has a severability clause."
2019.19-7,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,923.88,934.16,"This Court has never treated severability clauses as dispositive, and I think that that is because of the nature of the severability inquiry, which is a hypothetical inquiry."
2019.19-7,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,974.52,975.52,Mr. Shanmugam --
2019.19-7,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,975.52,977.48,-- of the Dodd-Frank Act wanted.
2019.19-7,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,977.48,1015.28,"-- your argument rests mostly on this distinction between multi-member and single-member agencies. And I think most people who have been in these agencies or have studied these agencies, have observed these agencies, might say to that distinction that it's -- it's kind of simplistic, that it all depends, that there are so many contingencies involved as to which kind of agency a President might have more effective influence over that one simply can't make a general statement of that kind. You know, there are voting rules. There are rules about whether there's a weak chair or a strong chair."
2019.19-7,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1033.2,1035.8,"Yeah, please, spend a couple of sentences."
2019.19-7,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1035.8,1036.68,Great.
2019.19-7,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1040.52,1054.72,"On Humphrey's Executor, which is really the primary case on which amicus relies, I think we're all here trying to make sense of Humphrey's Executor, knowing that, in Morrison, this Court essentially disemboweled the reasoning of that case."
2019.19-7,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1094.56,1095.08,Thank --
2019.19-7,0,33978,kannon_k_shanmugam,,1095.08,1108.16,But we don't believe that the Court needs to reach that question.
2019.19-7,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1108.16,1112.56,"Thank you, counsel. General Francisco."
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1112.56,1121.76,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As a general rule, the President has the unrestricted authority to remove principal officers."
2019.19-7,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1182.72,1184.0,Before --
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1184.0,1184.76,-- because you --
2019.19-7,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1184.76,1206.68,"-- before you do that, may I ask, isn't it uncommon for the Department of Justice not to defend a statute passed by Congress? How often has the SG declined to defend legislation adopted by Congress?"
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1206.68,1217.2,"Your Honor, I don't have the precise number, but the general rule is that we defend the acts of Congress unless it infringes upon the President's own executive power."
2019.19-7,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1222.92,1232.68,"Has that been the position of the Department of Justice, or is this a new position?"
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1232.68,1247.12,"I believe that that is the long-standing position of the Department of Justice, that the general presumption that we will defend acts of Congress has an exception built in when the act of Congress infringes upon the President's own executive power."
2019.19-7,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1249.24,1254.76,"I mean in this particular context, in the -- in the context of a restriction on the President's removal power."
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1254.76,1257.56,"Your Honor, I -- I don't know the exact answer to that question."
2019.19-7,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1284.28,1295.36,"General, isn't it true that the Department of Justice has refused to defend the constitutionality of other federal statutes even when the President's removal power is not at issue?"
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1295.36,1296.76,"Yes, Your Honor. I am simply --"
2019.19-7,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1296.76,1299.8,"For example, the Defense of Marriage Act?"
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1299.8,1309.28,All I'm simply saying is that our general rule is that there is a presumption that we will defend acts of Congress when arguments can reasonably be made in their -- in their defense.
2019.19-7,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1363.12,1398.16,"The -- what I've always thought -- and I don't -- I would like a -- what I've always thought -- and these cases are hard to put in boxes, but, look, the reason Taft could -- could remove the postmaster is because, at that time, a postmaster was a political plum and the President is a politician and, therefore, there is no good reason to stop him from controlling political plums. The reason they couldn't in Humphrey's Executor is because this is meant to be an independent board."
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1441.32,1463.84,"Well, I -- I'd offer you two responses to that, Your Honor. First of all, I think you can leave Humphrey's Executor exactly where it is, applying to multi-member commissions, and you don't call into question any of the current multi-member commissions. But the second and more critical point is, once you make that leap away from multi-member commissions, there's no real clear limiting principle since there's no --"
2019.19-7,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1463.84,1475.36,"But why -- why is it -- why should it make a difference? It seems the President is hemmed in even more if, for every one of those people, he can't remove them at whim."
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1486.44,1490.56,"Right, and for -- for two reasons, Your Honor."
2019.19-7,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1510.72,1524.88,"Well, maybe cabinet officials are different from the -- from an agency that Congress tries to make independent both of itself and of the President to some extent. I mean, cabinet members are loyal to the President."
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1536.88,1537.0,Uh-huh.
2019.19-7,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1537.0,1539.68,-- branches of government.
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1539.68,1543.28,"And, Your Honor, that goes to my second point."
2019.19-7,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1555.12,1562.68,"Well, actually, I mean, I don't know that you can say anything additionally, but it's a very basic question. You have a document, and the document has to work."
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1566.32,1566.84,Uh-huh.
2019.19-7,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1566.84,1581.84,"But the approach of -- of workability in terms of what Congress wanted and the other provisions does not lead you to a clear standard. You are offering a clear standard, but my problem is, why that one? I mean --"
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1581.84,1582.56,Sure.
2019.19-7,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1582.56,1592.08,"-- how long will that last? And -- and -- and it's -- I don't know if there's anything you can add, but you see -- you see where I'm coming from?"
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1592.08,1596.28,"Well, I would like to add something, Your Honor --"
2019.19-7,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1596.28,1596.56,Yeah.
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1596.56,1607.48,"-- because I do think that we're offering a very clear standard, and at the same time, I would like to finish responding to Justice Ginsburg's point, because the cabinet is nowhere defined."
2019.19-7,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1642.24,1642.84,I -- I'm not sure --
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1642.84,1644.84,-- with his predecessor's head of the CFPB.
2019.19-7,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1644.84,1675.72,"I'm not sure, General, that you responded to the part of Justice Ginsburg's question which, again, focused on -- on this principal argument that you're making, which is the multi-member versus the single-member. And I think she was saying that even if you could make a generalization, which I think that there are problems with, but even if you can make a generalization, it cuts the other way, that a multi-member commission, just because it diffuses power, is much dif -- much more difficult to influence."
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1676.12,1676.44,Right.
2019.19-7,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1676.44,1685.84,"-- if a President can get one person on the phone, that's a lot easier than if he has to worry about seven people who are all doing their own thing."
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1699.4,1700.8,Sure.
2019.19-7,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1824.36,1848.0,"So what strikes me about a lot of these arguments in the brief and here, you're saying, you know, this is the better way to promote liberty, to protect liberty. I mean, traditionally, there's been a long history of saying that it's actually the political branch's decision as to which is the best way to promote liberty, that there -- this is a constitution that does not say anything about removal."
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1891.56,1893.12,"For a couple of reasons, Your Honor."
2019.19-7,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1965.48,1983.76,"Is your argument stronger or weaker when you look at the budgetary constraints? I mean, does the independence of the agency from the budgetary process further weaken the democratic accountability through the President, or does it give him at least some say in the agency's functioning?"
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1983.76,2000.44,"Well, Your Honor, respectfully, I think that that gives the President less control, but that's not the focus of our argument. Ultimately, it's the President's duty to oversee the Executive Branch through the removal power, not Congress's duty to oversee the Executive Branch through the appropriations power."
2019.19-7,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2005.12,2005.72,How much --
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2005.72,2007.28,-- on that here.
2019.19-7,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2007.28,2039.12,"-- how much does it matter that the tenure of the single director continues into the next President's term? Because I think that's when the problem really reveals itself, that the next President is going to have to deal for his or her whole term, potentially, with a CFPB director appointed by this President and will not be able to supervise or direct that person, even if that President has a wildly different conception of consumer financial protection?"
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2039.12,2039.56,Right.
2019.19-7,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2057.68,2058.04,The current --
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2058.04,2058.8,-- exacerbates the problem.
2019.19-7,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2058.8,2062.08,"-- the current director will go to the end of 2023, correct?"
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2062.08,2062.56,Right.
2019.19-7,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2062.56,2064.8,So the first three years of the next term.
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2064.8,2069.04,"I think that illustrates the nature of the problem, Your Honor."
2019.19-7,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2072.64,2073.2,"But, I mean, Justice --"
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2073.2,2074.12,-- would be unconstitutional.
2019.19-7,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2074.12,2079.6,"-- Kavanaugh raises a -- a really interesting point here because the Court has been so focused, all our cases, on removal."
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2132.12,2167.8,"Because, respectfully, Your Honor, I would very much disagree with the entire premise of your point. And I point you to this Court's decision in Bowsher, where the Court wrote that once an officer is appointed, it is only the authority that can remove him and not the authority that appointed him that he must fear and in the performance of his duties obey. And as this Court made clear in the Free Enterprise Fund case, the removal power is the principal power that the President uses not only to supervise the Executive Branch but to ultimately be held accountable to the people, which is, after all, the whole point. I would like to address the severability issue, which is very important to the government."
2019.19-7,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2215.88,2226.52,"Well, Mr. Shanmugam said to look at all the provisions of the statute, and those reveal an intent that is distinct from the severability clause. So can you respond to his point on that?"
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2226.52,2227.0,Yes.
2019.19-7,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2265.2,2282.32,"Well, I -- I take your point about the severability clause, but if what you say is true, then what would be the justification for this Court's statements in other cases that a severability clause like this is not necessarily dispositive?"
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2282.32,2286.72,"Well, Your Honor, first of all, I point to what Justice Kavanaugh was alluding to."
2019.19-7,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2319.84,2320.84,One more.
2019.19-7,1,37093,noel_j_francisco,,2320.84,2327.36,"And by severing the for-cause removal restriction, you leave fully intact that concentrated enforcement mechanism."
2019.19-7,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2327.36,2336.96,"Thank you, General. Mr. Clement."
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2336.96,2349.4,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Text, first principles, and precedent all support the validity of the removal provision at issue here."
2019.19-7,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2498.2,2498.72,Mr. Clement --
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2498.72,2499.72,-- whether to Congress --
2019.19-7,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2499.72,2505.88,-- I -- I -- I understand your point about ratification.
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2525.52,2529.24,"I would say, Justice Gorsuch, that might be a reason to dismiss this case as improvidently --"
2019.19-7,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2529.24,2532.2,So you're arguing -- you're really arguing that we should DIG the case?
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2532.2,2535.44,"I -- I -- I'd say, if the choices are DIG the case --"
2019.19-7,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2535.44,2536.36,That's your first argument?
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2536.36,2540.12,"-- or decide -- well, it's -- it's not strictly a DIG argument."
2019.19-7,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2571.96,2576.08,"So I think the answer to the question is yes, right? You'd DIG the case?"
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2576.08,2576.24,No.
2019.19-7,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2576.6,2582.16,"That's your first choice, the prudential -- mother of all prudential reasons not to decide it, I would take that to mean we should DIG it, no?"
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2582.16,2592.6,"No, Mr. Justice Gorsuch, I think you should write a fine opinion that vindicates much of the reasoning of the dissenters in Windsor but -- but reconciles it with the majority."
2019.19-7,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2608.28,2611.12,"Boy -- boy, that sounds a lot like a DIG, but, okay, fine. (Laughter.)"
2019.19-7,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2611.12,2640.2,"Let -- on -- on the merits, what do we do with the fact -- and I'm sure you've given this great thought -- that if we were to approve single-member agencies without any presidential removal power -- let's just suppose that -- we would run into questions about the cabinet, for example, which are just agencies, right? So what -- how would you have the Court write an opinion to distinguish this case from that?"
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2640.2,2645.92,"So I -- I -- I want to be responsive, but I want to point out that I don't think --"
2019.19-7,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2645.92,2646.24,Great.
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2646.24,2651.72,"But -- but just to point out for starters, you don't avoid drawing a line by adopting the Solicitor General's position."
2019.19-7,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2651.72,2652.68,I understand that.
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2652.68,2652.96,Okay.
2019.19-7,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2654.12,2656.08,But now if you could answer my question.
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2656.08,2656.36,Sure.
2019.19-7,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2666.2,2667.8,"That's not my question, Mr. Clement."
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2670.04,2670.48,I -- I am -- with all due --
2019.19-7,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2670.48,2674.8,"My question is, what if Congress tomorrow revived the Tenure of Office Act, all right --"
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2674.8,2675.08,Well --
2019.19-7,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2675.08,2688.08,"-- and said presidents can't remove without a whole bunch of conditions, not Senate approval, okay, but something else that looks a lot like that. Wouldn't that be a problem with the Constitution?"
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2688.08,2688.84,Absolutely.
2019.19-7,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2688.84,2689.44,Okay.
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2691.96,2698.08,"So I think there's two -- I offer you two limiting principles, which I think is two more than the Solicitor General's offered you."
2019.19-7,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2699.72,2703.76,"If we could avoid disparaging our colleagues and just answer my question, I would be grateful."
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2703.76,2706.92,"First, there is a structural limitation."
2019.19-7,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2736.0,2736.24,How about the --
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2736.24,2737.88,And I didn't mean to disparage my colleague.
2019.19-7,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2742.96,2746.8,How about the EPA or Homeland Security?
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2746.8,2754.4,So I -- I think EPA is something that they probably could make subject to for-cause removal.
2019.19-7,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2776.28,2778.96,"Well, what is your definition of a cabinet secretary?"
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2778.96,2784.2,"I would take the definition, for these purposes, directly from 5 U.S.C. 101."
2019.19-7,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2792.92,2794.72,"Those -- those change from time to time, right?"
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2794.72,2796.0,Relatively rarely.
2019.19-7,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2799.64,2800.0,Right.
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2800.0,2804.96,And -- and -- and my point is a structural one that works with a constitutional backstop.
2019.19-7,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2821.84,2828.64,"Well, I -- I -- that's when you -- you began by saying that was a narrow exception that the Solicitor General adopts."
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2842.8,2846.4,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the Solicitor General described it as a narrow exception."
2019.19-7,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2910.72,2933.4,"But -- but Congress has always established these as multi-member commissions or agencies, and as the Free Enterprise Fund decision said, and as Noel Canning said in a different context, recess appointments, Justice Breyer's opinion, that historical practice at some point becomes an important aspect of how we define or draw the line."
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2935.64,2952.16,"Well, I -- I think what you do is you take the historical practice as a given, so you don't overrule Humphrey's Executor, despite the invitation to do so, but then you think: Okay, now we confront something that's different, not completely unprecedented, we've had four of them spanning about 30 years, but you confront something new."
2019.19-7,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2956.64,2995.64,"And here's -- on the different in kind, just how this will play out if you were to win, it's really the next President who's going to face the issue, because a -- the head of this agency will go at least three or four years into the next President's term, and the next President might have a completely different conception of consumer financial regulatory issues yet will be able to do nothing about it. And this director -- and that's different from the FCC and the FTC and the NLRB and you name the rest, because the chair is redesignated by the new President when the President comes in."
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3006.6,3009.4,"So two points, Justice Kavanaugh."
2019.19-7,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3066.16,3066.48,But if we --
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3066.48,3067.88,-- other side act as if this --
2019.19-7,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3067.88,3084.96,"I'm sorry to interrupt, but if we -- if we water down the standard, as you're suggesting, of what it takes to remove an independent agency head, that would apply across the board and actually would be a broad hold -- holding that would make the FCC, the FTC, NLRB less independent."
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3084.96,3086.68,I -- I -- I think it depends.
2019.19-7,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3100.52,3100.72,Well --
2019.19-7,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3100.72,3102.12,What about --
2019.19-7,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3102.12,3104.12,What about the -- (Laughter.)
2019.19-7,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3104.12,3125.04,"What about the -- what about the budgetary consequences? I mean, your -- your friend on the other side refers to this individual, the head, as sort of like, you know, the effective President over the significant swath of the economy. But, with the budgetary things, it's actually more powerful than that."
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3134.76,3157.88,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I think that actually cuts in our favor because that means that the officer is less responsive to Congress and, therefore, however responsive they would otherwise be to the President, they don't have to dilute that by trying to worry about what they're going to say to the appropriators when they go up and talk to the appropriators. And I think that the Solicitor General referred to the Bowsher opinion."
2019.19-7,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3195.68,3211.4,"On your -- on your definition of how we should apply the standard or water it down, is what I said, would it be enough for the President to say: I don't feel that your mind and my mind go along together on the policies or administering of the agency?"
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3211.4,3230.08,"I -- I don't know that that would be enough, Your Honor, but I do think if a President said, look, I think it's an important priority for consumer finance protection that we deal with, let's just say, pay day lenders or some problem that's out there and the director said absolutely not, I think you could, especially if you're trying --"
2019.19-7,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3230.08,3232.32,That's what -- that's what President Roosevelt said to Humphrey.
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3232.32,3234.4,"No, no, what -- what you said is what --"
2019.19-7,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3234.4,3234.56,"Yeah, I know --"
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3234.56,3235.0,-- he said to Humphrey.
2019.19-7,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3235.0,3236.12,-- but what you're saying is --
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3236.12,3236.36,No --
2019.19-7,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3236.36,3237.24,-- really the same thing.
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3237.24,3239.68,-- I -- I -- I don't think it is what he said.
2019.19-7,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3246.24,3246.56,Yes.
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3257.04,3258.0,"Well, two things, Your Honor."
2019.19-7,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3270.12,3270.48,Yes.
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3276.24,3281.96,"With due -- all -- all due respect, I think that there's -- it's still a difference, whatever the standard is."
2019.19-7,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3289.56,3290.08,A broad-standing --
2019.19-7,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3290.08,3290.48,But that's --
2019.19-7,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3290.48,3294.2,"-- policy disagreement versus a policy disagreement in a particular case? I'm sorry, Chief."
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3296.48,3299.12,"Well, one is I want you to go after pay day lending."
2019.19-7,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3302.8,3316.8,"Well, but that's worse than -- that's worse than Humphrey because what's going to happen is that there will be litigation over whether or not the standard has been met or not met. I mean, we begin with the idea of a serious conflict between the President and the agency director."
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3326.24,3343.6,"Well, I -- I -- I -- no, I think it would -- first of all, I don't think it would be the worst of all possible worlds because it would be a concrete live dispute. And, of course, as you suggested, you could provide a degree of deference. But I do think it's important there would still be a big difference between a restriction that applied however you interpret it and at will, because at will --"
2019.19-7,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3343.6,3345.28,"Well, let me ask this in concrete terms."
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3364.64,3375.32,"I -- I -- I don't know for sure because I don't have a concrete controversy here, and that's maybe just yet another reason to not decide this case in its current artificial posture."
2019.19-7,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3376.8,3387.76,"Well, that's exactly -- that's all we -- that's all we know about it. There's just a policy disagreement about the way interests are balanced. Would that be sufficient to just -- to remove that person?"
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3387.76,3399.4,"If the only alternative is to strike the statute down, I would say that's sufficient. Now I will confess I don't think that's what Congress had in mind when it put those words in this particular statute."
2019.19-7,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3412.48,3412.64,Mister --
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3412.64,3413.92,-- just so we can strike it down.
2019.19-7,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3413.92,3430.88,"-- Mr. Clement, can you say or explain what your counter is to the buck stops here argument? There seems to be an overriding assumption that somehow the President needs unfettered discretion to execute the laws."
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3433.76,3453.12,"So I don't think that that's true as a constitutional matter with respect to every power the President exercises. I think Congress has the power to say there are certain things where we want the President to have a role, but we also want it somewhat insulated from politics. So take the Fed, for example."
2019.19-7,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3536.08,3537.32,But the buck stops --
2019.19-7,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3537.32,3537.8,So more insulated --
2019.19-7,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3537.8,3542.2,-- the buck stops here quote was quoted in our recent decision in Free Enterprise.
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3550.44,3552.88,May I answer? (Laughter.)
2019.19-7,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3552.88,3554.56,No.
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3557.12,3569.44,"Mr. Chief Justice, we think Free Enterprise Fund helps us in two ways. One, it made crystal-clear that the defect there is that the removal power was taken away from the President."
2019.19-7,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3599.08,3599.84,"Thank you, counsel."
2019.19-7,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3599.84,3606.92,May I -- may I just ask one question? Mr. Shanmugam said there was no proof of ratification.
2019.19-7,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3606.92,3609.72,"Well, I -- I don't know what he means by that."
2019.19-7,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3634.12,3636.44,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Letter."
2019.19-7,3,21108,douglas_n_letter,,3636.44,3680.04,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me begin just by saying the Speaker of the House thanks the Court for its courtesy in agreeing to let the House be heard here today. I'd like to start out, if I could, by responding to Justice Gorsuch's question to my friend, Mr. Clement, about do we want the Court to DIG the case."
2019.19-7,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3771.24,3785.56,"Mr. -- Mr. Letter, are you quite concerned about the agency taking away your client's authority over the budget with respect to this very significant part of the economy?"
2019.19-7,3,21108,douglas_n_letter,,3785.56,3805.8,"We are not, Your Honor, because this is something that Congress has done with several agencies in the financial regulatory sectors, for example, the -- the Fed, in particular, the National Credit Union Administration. So this is a -- a function that -- oh, I'm sorry, the FDIC."
2019.19-7,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3907.4,3932.48,"Well, what do you have -- do you want to add anything on what I think is quite basic, and people disagree? On the one hand, you have people -- good walls make good neighbors, let's look for a line, multi versus single or some other line. The other is the approach there's something about me that doesn't like a wall, and before I want to have a wall, I want to know what I'm walling in and walling out."
2019.19-7,3,21108,douglas_n_letter,,3956.48,3990.48,"Yes, Your Honor, and -- and you're absolutely right, this is a basic difference here. The -- the point is that we -- we do not agree -- I do not agree with Mr. Clement's argument that we should water down the standard. But we definitely agree, the House believes -- and notice the House has not tried to have cabinet members be anything other than at will. And I think my friend, Mr. Clement, hit on a very key provision."
2019.19-7,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4010.44,4010.48,So where --
2019.19-7,3,21108,douglas_n_letter,,4010.48,4010.72,I'm sorry.
2019.19-7,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4010.72,4014.92,"-- would you draw the line, Mr. Letter, then? If -- I guess I have two questions for you."
2019.19-7,3,21108,douglas_n_letter,,4036.16,4039.48,"Your Honor, I'm going to start with the second one."
2019.19-7,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4044.96,4048.28,Isn't that a pretty vital question for us to be able to answer to decide this case?
2019.19-7,3,21108,douglas_n_letter,,4048.28,4067.52,"I don't think so, Your Honor, because you have decided in Humphrey's Executor, Wiener, Buckley, Free Enterprise, Morrison versus Olson, you've decided all of those cases and you've said that removal protections are constitutional without answering that question. I -- I searched in vain."
2019.19-7,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4070.04,4076.52,"No, fair enough. But you're at the podium, so take a shot at it. (Laughter.)"
2019.19-7,3,21108,douglas_n_letter,,4076.52,4082.36,"They -- I'm going to pick up on a word that -- that I believe this Court has used, which is they should be modest."
2019.19-7,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4113.84,4116.28,What -- what do you do about --
2019.19-7,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4116.28,4117.16,Well -- I -- I -- I'm sorry.
2019.19-7,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4117.16,4117.6,Go ahead.
2019.19-7,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4117.88,4118.16,I'm sorry.
2019.19-7,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4120.32,4120.76,"No, go ahead."
2019.19-7,3,21108,douglas_n_letter,,4121.24,4123.76,"Justice Gorsuch, would you mind repeating your first question? I apologize."
2019.19-7,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4123.76,4124.2,Sure.
2019.19-7,3,21108,douglas_n_letter,,4129.36,4134.48,"Your Honor -- and, again, I'm going to agree with Mr. Clement insofar as this."
2019.19-7,3,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,4146.6,4147.64,Your client wrote it.
2019.19-7,3,21108,douglas_n_letter,,4155.88,4158.84,I -- I disagree with Mr. Clement about watering it down.
2019.19-7,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4164.52,4168.48,I don't think Mr. Clement said that either.
2019.19-7,3,21108,douglas_n_letter,,4168.48,4169.88,"Oh, I -- I apologize."
2019.19-7,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4201.6,4208.04,So what if the President just says we don't agree on policy? Would that be permitted?
2019.19-7,3,21108,douglas_n_letter,,4208.04,4215.2,"I don't believe -- I think in Free Enterprise, I believe you said no. So -- so I think you've already answered that. If --"
2019.19-7,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4215.2,4223.16,"So -- so we don't always think about the future implications of these things, but that's one of the things I've tried to think about."
2019.19-7,3,21108,douglas_n_letter,,4223.16,4223.44,Yes.
2019.19-7,3,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,4223.44,4248.36,The next President in 2021 or 2025 or whenever will have to deal with a CFPB director appointed by the prior President potentially for his or her whole term without being able -- given your answer to Justice Alito -- being able to do anything about that difference in policy.
