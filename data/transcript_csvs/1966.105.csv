1966.105,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,38.401,"Number 105, Harry Keyishian et al., appellants versus Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York."
1966.105,0,39786,richard_lipsitz,,39.784,42.823,"May it please the Court, Your Honors."
1966.105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,292.746,295.351,Does that make the issue here different than it was in Adler?
1966.105,0,39786,richard_lipsitz,,295.351,297.339,We say that it makes a different issue.
1966.105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,310.495,319.751,"Yes, but I gather this what you've just said would be the predicate of an argument which you don't have to overrule Adler defined for you as to college --"
1966.105,0,39786,richard_lipsitz,,319.751,320.879,That is -- that is correct.
1966.105,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,597.103,598.733,Do they have to do that?
1966.105,0,39786,richard_lipsitz,,598.733,600.008,As a matter of law.
1966.105,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,600.182,601.268,Do they have any findings?
1966.105,0,39786,richard_lipsitz,,601.268,602.018,"No, sir."
1966.105,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,647.739,658.462,I suppose you tell us by university students are less subject to submersion and children.
1966.105,0,39786,richard_lipsitz,,658.462,665.756,"If you're suggesting -- if I understand Your Honor, Judge Warren -- Justice Warren, you're asking me to explain it now or you're saying later on?"
1966.105,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,665.756,667.614,"Oh, you may take it from due course."
1966.105,0,39786,richard_lipsitz,,667.614,667.851,No.
1966.105,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,874.37,874.504,Did he give --
1966.105,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,874.504,877.754,What's the ground of his refusal to answer that question?
1966.105,0,39786,richard_lipsitz,,877.754,886.218,He stated that he felt it was an infringement upon his conscience and that it was unconstitutional requiring him to answer it.
1966.105,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,887.643,889.481,Unconstitutional under what division?
1966.105,0,39786,richard_lipsitz,,889.481,892.806,"Well Your Honor, I think his answer is in the record."
1966.105,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,892.806,894.136,"Well, I just --"
1966.105,0,39786,richard_lipsitz,,894.136,897.59,He gives his own statements which he appended to the answers.
1966.105,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,897.59,899.151,Wasn't that in the Fifth Amendment?
1966.105,0,39786,richard_lipsitz,,899.151,901.228,"No, sir."
1966.105,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,915.088,917.864,And what was the question?
1966.105,0,39786,richard_lipsitz,,917.864,934.913,"Have you ever advised or taught or were you ever a member of any society of group of persons who taught or advocated the doctrine of the Government of the United States should be overthrown by the course of violence or other unlawful means, and his objections I can point out to you in a minute after we check the record."
1966.105,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,936.357,940.11,Did he make any request for a hearing on this refusal?
1966.105,0,39786,richard_lipsitz,,940.11,942.666,He made a request for a hearing.
1966.105,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1056.086,1056.848,"Well, is there not?"
1966.105,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1056.848,1066.494,Perhaps if you -- do you have a record reference on the Feinberg certificate that you have used everytime --
1966.105,0,39786,richard_lipsitz,,1066.494,1067.985,"You mean where it's set forth, Your Honor?"
1966.105,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1067.985,1070.426,"Yes, what the certificate says."
1966.105,0,39786,richard_lipsitz,,1070.426,1075.304,"It says that at 122 and 123 of the brief, also Your Honor, we reproduced in the appendix."
1966.105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1075.304,1079.095,"Well, what issues refer this to 212 or it's fully at 125?"
1966.105,0,39786,richard_lipsitz,,1080.409,1080.692,No.
1966.105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1084.901,1085.8,The other one where --
1966.105,0,39786,richard_lipsitz,,1085.8,1090.379,It's in our brief which I happened to have the references to page 122 and 123.
1966.105,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1090.379,1090.389,And?
1966.105,0,39786,richard_lipsitz,,1090.389,1095.128,You will also find in the record that the identical documents that you find in 122 and 123.
1966.105,1,39579,ruth_v_iles,,2115.508,2117.333,May it please the Court.
1966.105,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2448.372,2450.808,"Ms. Iles, excuse me."
1966.105,1,39579,ruth_v_iles,,2460.51,2463.845,I contend that it's not relevant.
1966.105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2568.644,2577.574,What about membership -- what about membership in an organization which gave this advocacy?
1966.105,1,39579,ruth_v_iles,,2577.574,2596.651,"In the Adler case, in construing this section of the law which I might add as exactly the same as it was at the time of the Adler case, this Court said they would rely upon the construction placed upon that section by the courts of the State of New York."
1966.105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2620.402,2627.292,You mean mere membership is not enough or mere knowing a membership is not enough.
1966.105,1,39579,ruth_v_iles,,2627.292,2627.75,No.
1966.105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2634.697,2637.294,"Now, let's say -- assume you know the aims of it, is that enough?"
1966.105,1,39579,ruth_v_iles,,2637.294,2650.255,"Then there is a hearing to see -- under the Adler case it said, he would then be given an opportunity to explain whether he had ever been a member, whether he was now a member."
1966.105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2650.255,2653.859,"What if he comes in and says, “Well yes, I know exactly the aims of the party."
1966.105,1,39579,ruth_v_iles,,2655.802,2664.696,"Well, implicit in Section 12-a and I believe in the Feinberg Law is that they advocate."
1966.105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2669.702,2678.334,Do you think -- do you think that New York courts construed this to mean that person not only must know the aims but he agrees with them and furthers them.
1966.105,1,39579,ruth_v_iles,,2678.334,2698.228,"Yes, and they say there is a presumption when a person joins an organization knowing of its aims that he subscribes to its aims and this is something the school authorities would then pursuit further once they determine that he was a member of the organization."
1966.105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2896.398,2905.641,"Did you -- what state court opinions do you rely on for the construction of these laws to the effect that you stated awhile ago, is it Adler?"
1966.105,1,39579,ruth_v_iles,,2905.641,2922.669,"There was -- Adler case and the Thompson against Wallin, and Lederman and Lamado which were the Court of Appeals decisions which were affirmed in Adler case so construed the statute."
1966.105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2935.436,2938.425,Is in your brief?
1966.105,1,39579,ruth_v_iles,,2938.425,2943.353,I don't believe that citation is.
1966.105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2947.158,2948.832,6th New York --
1966.105,1,39579,ruth_v_iles,,2948.832,2957.168,127 but the Commissioner of Education sent it back to the Board of Higher Education.
1966.105,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2957.168,2958.869,Is that 2nd or –-
1966.105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2958.869,2959.315,6th New York 2nd --
1966.105,1,39579,ruth_v_iles,,2959.315,2963.977,6th New York 127.
1966.105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2963.977,2970.81,Do you think the three-judge court agreed with you assuming --
1966.105,1,39579,ruth_v_iles,,2970.81,2973.035,On the revision of this section?
1966.105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2973.035,2976.984,On the construction of these sections by the state boards.
1966.105,1,39579,ruth_v_iles,,2976.984,2989.505,That the three-judge court went further than I believe they had to go because they went into the merits of the controversy and they discussed subdivision 3 of Section 105.
1966.105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2990.82,3007.157,"As I read the three-judge court opinion, it seemed to me that the court thought that the New York law would justify discharge for mere knowing memberships and you say that is not so."
1966.105,1,39579,ruth_v_iles,,3007.157,3010.244,I say that is not what the Adler case said.
1966.105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3010.244,3010.578,How about the --
1966.105,1,39579,ruth_v_iles,,3010.578,3010.742,But --
1966.105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3010.742,3016.035,-- but what do you mean -- we were talking about the New York law though.
1966.105,1,39579,ruth_v_iles,,3016.035,3032.494,"Well, the Adler case said that they were bound by the construction placed on the New York by the Court of Appeals and in this case, it has been in the federal courts all along and there has been no construction of that by any of the state courts in this case and this Court has said we are bound by the construction --"
1966.105,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3032.494,3047.654,Now but this not the three-judge court here say that the reach of the decisions of the New York courts was to commit the charge for mere knowing members.
1966.105,1,39579,ruth_v_iles,,3047.654,3050.647,I believe they did -- I do believe they went that far.
1966.105,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3050.647,3056.096,"Well, then they don't agree with your interpretation of what the decisions of New York court --"
1966.105,1,39579,ruth_v_iles,,3056.096,3056.674,I would say that's experimental.
1966.105,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3056.674,3060.287,"-- are, is that it?"
1966.105,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3060.287,3064.57,Mr. Crary.
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,3064.57,3066.328,May it please the Court.
1966.105,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3081.122,3082.029,I'm confused now.
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,3083.833,3092.477,The Board of Regents is the governing board of the University of the State of New York.
1966.105,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3407.256,3412.076,"Well, let me see if I understand it."
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,3422.02,3424.078,The finding not made by my university but by the Board of Regents.
1966.105,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3424.078,3428.164,"That's the finding that's been made under the Civil Service Law, is that it?"
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,3428.164,3428.643,Yes.
1966.105,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3428.643,3436.257,"And then under the Civil Service Law, a disqualification -- this general disqualification not only for teaching but for all employees."
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,3436.257,3438.433,For all public employees.
1966.105,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3438.433,3445.504,Is only of those persons who personally advocate knowing overthrow.
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,3445.504,3449.095,"Knowingly, deliberately the unlawful overthrow of the government."
1966.105,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3449.095,3454.007,And I take you have such persons even though they are not members of these or the other two organizations.
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,3454.007,3455.184,"Of course, Your Honor."
1966.105,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3455.184,3467.653,"And then you go on and say under 105 that if one -- there is a presumption that if one is a member of a particular of one of the two organizations, is it?"
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,3467.653,3471.918,"Knowing of its objectives, he presumptively supports those objections."
1966.105,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3471.918,3483.073,So this -- so you arrived at the conclusion that he is an individual who advocates violent overthrow on the basis of a presumption from his membership in one of the two organizations.
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,3483.073,3507.438,"Yes, and because this is a presumption and only a presumption, it's susceptible of being overcome and in the Thompson against Wallin case which was one of those affirmed in Adler, the Court of Appeals of New York specifically said, because it's only prima facie, this imports the hearing at which the countervailing evidence can be given."
1966.105,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3511.989,3528.915,"But if you -- but if in the proceeding for a discharge or removal, you presented evidence of membership, knowing membership and arrested and he presented no evidence, he would be discharged."
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,3528.915,3531.333,I think the presumption then would prevail.
1966.105,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3532.11,3550.103,But if he came in and explain to the -- or explained in a way that somebody were to believe that he did not engage in advocacy personally why he would not be discharged.
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,3550.103,3596.246,"If there were affirmative evidence on his part to that effect, then I think Thompson against Wallin says he has overcome the presumption and the presumption disappeared but then if he is still declared ineligible to be appointed or is then held to the -- is then discharged because of this, the burden he is then entitled to a hearing under Section 105 of the Civil Service Law which is expressly provided for him by that statute in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in which the burden is on the removing officer to show that he is disqualified and I think that to show that he was disqualified would require showing that he did those things which you proscribe by 105 --"
1966.105,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3596.246,3597.783,You mean you couldn't rely on the presumptions --
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,3597.783,3624.719,"Namely person -- what if -- as I read Thompson against Wallin, this Court of Appeals has said, the presumption arises once it appears that he is a knowing member of the organization and when it arises, it imports -- one is relying on the statutory hearing under 105, it imports a right to a hearing at which he may produce evidence to overcome the presumption."
1966.105,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3624.719,3625.195,But if --
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,3625.195,3628.299,If he does so and if he is still discharged --
1966.105,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3628.299,3629.77,That's because he doesn't do so?
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,3633.043,3634.653,Then I think -- then I think --
1966.105,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3634.653,3636.689,Then 105 does him no good.
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,3636.689,3653.076,"-- that the New York statute with its presumption which presumes the fact, which disqualifies him and he doesn't overcome it and because this Court has I submit said the presumption is valid, he may permissibly be discharged."
1966.105,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3743.426,3749.845,But what must not -- must that not that that procedure is a practical matter in the situation that Justice White pointed out.
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,3755.313,3775.631,"Well, he would have -- the thing I think I am trying to make clear here is that those faculty employees who had tenure either term or continues would have a hearing and before a university body in which if they chose to refuse to reply and they could explain --"
1966.105,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3775.631,3776.634,That's when they'd be --
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,3776.634,3777.026,-- they could explain it.
1966.105,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3777.026,3779.514,"-- I thought, yes."
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,3779.514,3790.58,I think if Your Honor please the only other thing that I would wish to add is that the university having adopted this procedure in 1956.
1966.105,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3828.154,3833.053,The sanction of one action from the people.
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,3833.053,3833.606,Yes.
1966.105,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3857.183,3861.535,But there's no criminal penalty for cancelling purpose.
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,3861.535,3869.817,"I do not believe it would just to two persons under the New York statute but if he lied, I think this would be misconduct of the time which warrant is removed."
1966.105,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3869.817,3872.442,You take it --
1966.105,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3872.442,3876.076,I just like to ask one question Mr. Crary.
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,3938.393,3946.181,I just like to think that the university officials would ever be arbitrary but let's assume actually that Your Honor's question that they were.
1966.105,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3967.261,3967.632,Without a --
1966.105,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3967.632,3968.371,Yes.
1966.105,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3968.371,3969.3,(Inaudible)
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,3969.3,3970.86,Without a --
1966.105,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3970.86,3976.492,And they have reason that the perfect evidence as to personal --
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,3976.492,3981.283,Assuming that he has before the university brought forth countervailing proof.
1966.105,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3981.283,3990.839,I don't understand that the kind of presumption that he's claiming here is that any evidence that you get --
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,3990.839,3994.822,It must be evidence in some proof Your Honor and not any.
1966.105,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3994.822,4004.164,"Well, I don't think that you understand there and in saying or what did you do, I just when -- maybe what's the --"
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,4004.164,4006.441,Of course the state of his mind is only he knows but --
1966.105,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4006.441,4019.164,"Or in the course of situation where he has to, where he takes the stand that he said “I am a member of the Communist Party, I don't deny it but I do not agree with its policy of overthrowing the Government.”"
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,4019.164,4019.488,I think he --
1966.105,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4019.488,4024.001,But I agree with the social security and all the other objectives.
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,4026.171,4031.649,He might be subject to some probing of the validity of that statement but ones that stood under it --
1966.105,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4031.649,4033.162,Of whichever is subject to --
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,4033.162,4033.722,I think it would.
1966.105,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4033.722,4034.436,(Inaudible)
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,4034.436,4037.328,I think it would.
1966.105,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4037.328,4055.167,"Suppose he goes before the Civil Service Commission, what -- and has this hearing, what do you reply upon to say that the state no longer can use the presumption against him but must prove its case affirmatively."
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,4055.167,4056.717,"Well, here of course Your Honor, I'm --"
1966.105,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4056.717,4057.553,I beg your pardon.
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,4057.553,4088.824,"-- I'm bound by what the Court of Appeals said in Thompson against Wallin and what it seems to me to say and again, I point out that the Attorney General is here taking the position that he takes in support of this statute but I read Thompson against Wallin that say that the prima facie nature of the assumption imports a hearing in which proof can be brought forth and that when any proof is brought forth to overcome that presumption that disappeared."
1966.105,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4099.788,4102.51,Is that the position the Attorney General takes?
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,4102.51,4105.219,With that I prefer to let the Attorney General speak for it.
1966.105,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4105.219,4107.049,I understood your argument.
1966.105,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4107.049,4115.225,When you finish I would like to ask Ms. Iles if that is the position of the Attorney General.
1966.105,2,29609,john_c_crary,,4117.872,4119.299,"I would submit that the judgment should be affirmed, Your Honor."
1966.105,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4119.299,4123.413,Very well.
1966.105,3,39579,ruth_v_iles,,4123.413,4143.377,I think the position of the Attorney General is that once the person being hired comes in and testifies that he doesn't subscribe to those parts of the philosophy of the Communist Party which advocate the overthrow of the government by force but just subscribes to it as a doctrine.
1966.105,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4179.63,4182.434,Do you -- do you think they agree with him?
1966.105,3,39579,ruth_v_iles,,4182.434,4184.22,Right.
1966.105,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4200.593,4203.403,"Now, I would like to ask -- thank you Ms. Iles."
1966.105,4,39786,richard_lipsitz,,4215.273,4216.5,"My answer is very clear, Your Honor."
1966.105,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4240.593,4243.171,Is that the same case --
1966.105,4,39786,richard_lipsitz,,4243.171,4243.612,Yes.
1966.105,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4243.612,4245.332,With the other side of law?
1966.105,4,39786,richard_lipsitz,,4245.332,4247.865,"I don't know upon what they rely, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1966.105,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4247.865,4248.634,You get t hide.
1966.105,4,39786,richard_lipsitz,,4248.634,4249.121,That's yes.
1966.105,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4250.91,4251.997,"Now, if that suppose to --"
1966.105,4,39786,richard_lipsitz,,4251.997,4254.832,It's one of the three that's there involved in the Adler case.
1966.105,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4254.832,4256.197,Is this another case that we have to decide on?
1966.105,4,39786,richard_lipsitz,,4256.197,4256.766,"No, sir."
1966.105,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4256.766,4258.811,You have a quite few (Inaudible).
1966.105,4,39786,richard_lipsitz,,4258.811,4268.45,"I don't think you have to decide what it meant, Your Honors, because it says so in black and white in their decision and it's also stated at Thompson against Wallin."
1966.105,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4281.807,4282.511,Leatherman?
1966.105,4,39786,richard_lipsitz,,4282.511,4286.18,"Lederman, L-E-D-E-R-M-A-N v. Board of Education, Your Honor."
1966.105,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4322.395,4326.115,The Lederman case was one of those cases which was affirmed in Adler.
1966.105,4,39786,richard_lipsitz,,4326.115,4327.22,"Yes, sir."
1966.105,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4327.22,4328.717,And the case of Thompson --
1966.105,4,39786,richard_lipsitz,,4328.717,4330.93,Thompson against Wallin also.
1966.105,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4330.93,4331.28,I beg your pardon.
1966.105,4,39786,richard_lipsitz,,4331.28,4333.704,Thompson against Wallin also.
1966.105,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4333.704,4335.51,So they were contemporary.
1966.105,4,39786,richard_lipsitz,,4335.51,4339.123,They were the two -- the three of them constituted to name otherwise the Adler case.
1966.105,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4339.123,4340.357,The Adler case.
1966.105,4,39786,richard_lipsitz,,4347.142,4348.243,And Lederman.
1966.105,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4348.792,4351.614,I know that she mentioned as I understood it not --
1966.105,4,39786,richard_lipsitz,,4351.614,4359.06,"Yes, she mentioned Thompson against Wallin but they also will tell you that they rely upon Lederman because Lederman is one of the three cases in which the Court of Appeals have stated in the --"
1966.105,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4359.06,4362.02,I want to know what -- how they were decided chronologically.
1966.105,4,39786,richard_lipsitz,,4362.02,4369.425,"Oh, they are decided the same day and in fact you can find them in the New York reports one page after another."
1966.105,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4369.425,4370.072,The same day.
1966.105,4,39786,richard_lipsitz,,4370.072,4372.154,"Yes, sir."
1966.105,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4376.148,4378.826,We'll adjourn now.
