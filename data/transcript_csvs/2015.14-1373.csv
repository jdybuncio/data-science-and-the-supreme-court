2015.14-1373,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.43,"We'll hear argument next in Case 14-1373, Utah v. Strieff. Mr. Green."
2015.14-1373,0,62666,tyler_r_green,,8.43,17.615,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Courts typically apply the exclusionary rule to suppress unlawfully-seized evidence."
2015.14-1373,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,44.5,47.04,Tell me what was objectively reasonable about it.
2015.14-1373,0,62666,tyler_r_green,,47.04,47.6,"Well, Your Honor --"
2015.14-1373,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,47.6,54.405,"I mean, the police officer admits that the person he saw coming out of the house in question wasn't doing anything."
2015.14-1373,0,62666,tyler_r_green,,70.475,75.535,"Justice Sotomayor, we've admitted that this was a miscalculation, but it was a close call."
2015.14-1373,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,107.67,113.235,It would be interesting if he waited to see whether this was also a short-stay visitor.
2015.14-1373,0,62666,tyler_r_green,,113.235,114.665,I think he would have --
2015.14-1373,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,114.665,119.315,I don't see how this is any different than stopping the first person you see.
2015.14-1373,0,62666,tyler_r_green,,119.315,131.5,"I think, Your Honor, as -- as we've admitted, I think if he had seen it and it were short stay, I think we may well beat the reasonable suspicion, and I think that's why the prosecutor here conceded that it wasn't. But it was a close call based on everything that he had seen to that point."
2015.14-1373,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,137.88,154.465,"What's going to stop police officers -- if we announce your rule, and your rule seems to be, once we have your name, if there's a warrant out on you, that's an attenuating circumstance under every circumstance."
2015.14-1373,0,62666,tyler_r_green,,169.115,172.705,"I think -- Justice Sotomayor, I think there are two answers to that question."
2015.14-1373,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,184.06,201.945,"If you have a town like Ferguson, where 80 percent of the residents have minor traffic warrants out, there may be a very good incentive for just standing on the street corner in Ferguson and asking every citizen, give me your ID; let me see your name."
2015.14-1373,0,62666,tyler_r_green,,206.995,207.95,"I understand, Your Honor."
2015.14-1373,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,222.92,235.755,"But I assume, Mr. Green, that there are a variety of circumstances in which police officers would really like to talk to somebody and really like to search them but don't have reasonable suspicion."
2015.14-1373,0,62666,tyler_r_green,,265.1,268.03,"What -- Justice Kagan, I don't think so."
2015.14-1373,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,280.56,283.0,"Well, but this is an officer who -- you say this is a close call."
2015.14-1373,0,62666,tyler_r_green,,316.33,318.23,"Justice Kagan, I think, with respect, it doesn't."
2015.14-1373,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,327.24,329.725,That's the only way they can be absolutely sure.
2015.14-1373,0,62666,tyler_r_green,,365.735,371.21,"Well, I think, Your Honor, in those circumstances, that's where the flagrancy inquiry actually does the work of deterrence."
2015.14-1373,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,384.925,396.775,"Don't you think it's enough of a deterrent to say to a police officer in this situation, you should have reasonable suspicion? You know the Fourth Amendment requires it."
2015.14-1373,0,62666,tyler_r_green,,423.64,427.73,"Well, Your Honor, I think that's what the -- the existing rule on the exclusionary rule does."
2015.14-1373,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,430.62,432.99,We're begrudging them now from doing that.
2015.14-1373,0,62666,tyler_r_green,,445.47,445.69,No.
2015.14-1373,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,478.47,493.12,"Mr. Green, you make a point that a person's name is not suppressible, and evidence derived from just knowing the name is not suppressible."
2015.14-1373,0,62666,tyler_r_green,,524.85,532.64,"Well, Your Honor, it is, of course, that's one of the purposes of a Terry stop, of an investigatory stop, is to try to find a person's name."
2015.14-1373,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,532.64,534.655,I thought you needed reasonable suspicion.
2015.14-1373,0,62666,tyler_r_green,,534.655,535.485,That's correct.
2015.14-1373,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,536.0,542.58,"This is a case where you're telling us reasonable suspicion or not, the name, a person's name, is not suppressible."
2015.14-1373,0,62666,tyler_r_green,,542.58,543.56,"That's right, Your Honor."
2015.14-1373,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,558.22,562.805,"So what is an intervening circumstance, in your view? What is your test for what it is?"
2015.14-1373,0,62666,tyler_r_green,,562.805,567.21,"Your Honor, I -- we think under it's -- it's -- it flows naturally from this Court's teaching in Wong Sun."
2015.14-1373,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,577.32,577.55,Okay.
2015.14-1373,0,62666,tyler_r_green,,599.0,599.935,"That's the inquiry, Your Honor, yes."
2015.14-1373,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,599.935,602.59,"And I -- so I guess, then, I'm back to my question."
2015.14-1373,0,62666,tyler_r_green,,648.0,655.615,"Your Honor -- again, I think, Justice Kagan, the answer to that is the inquiry here in attenuation is not just is there an intervening circumstance."
2015.14-1373,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,666.37,666.83,"Well, Mr. Green --"
2015.14-1373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,666.83,674.0,"Do you think that something else includes a subjective component, whether there was a purpose to see if there was a warrant?"
2015.14-1373,0,62666,tyler_r_green,,674.0,674.73,"We don't, Your Honor."
2015.14-1373,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,680.43,681.78,So isn't flagrancy --
2015.14-1373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,681.78,695.685,"Is it that -- it's true that that would be a step maybe beyond our -- our -- our cases. On the -- on the other hand, if the inquiry is one of flagrancy, then maybe that's necessary."
2015.14-1373,0,62666,tyler_r_green,,717.875,719.06,"Well, I think, Your Honor --"
2015.14-1373,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,719.06,731.14,"So it seems to me that the subjective-purpose component might serve an important purpose here, so that a police officer can't just say, I'm going to see if there's a warrant for this fellow. I'm -- that's the reason I'm going to stop."
2015.14-1373,0,62666,tyler_r_green,,733.685,746.155,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I think the answer to that question is -- is that in the cases upon which Respondent relies, citing the -- the -- the subjective-purpose requirement, those have all been cases involving arrests without probable cause."
2015.14-1373,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,788.9,800.295,"This is a non sequitur. When you talk about an intervening circumstances as we've looked at it in the case law, it's always been something different than the actual stop."
2015.14-1373,0,62666,tyler_r_green,,828.11,828.46,Well --
2015.14-1373,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,828.46,831.725,It would never have happened except for the stop.
2015.14-1373,0,62666,tyler_r_green,,831.725,833.8,"Your Honor, we agree that there is but-for cause here."
2015.14-1373,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,845.47,861.53,"Mr. -- you know something? Finding the baggie of cocaine gives the officer reasonable -- probable cause to arrest, but we don't let that cocaine come into evidence merely because it was a ground for the arrest."
2015.14-1373,0,62666,tyler_r_green,,886.97,906.605,"Justice Sotomayor, we agree with you that if the bag of cocaine -- if an officer had found a bag of cocaine during an unlawful stop, that's the precise situation where the exclusionary rule would usually apply. What's different here is that the search in which the -- in which the drugs and the other evidence was found occurred while the suspect was in lawful custody. Respondent has admitted that the arrest warrant was lawful."
2015.14-1373,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,917.32,936.919,"Mr. Green, you made a statement in reply brief that says, ""The Fourth Amendment does not require officers to have reasonable suspicion before they check for warrants."" If you mean that, then any officer can say, what's your name, I'll check you for a warrant."
2015.14-1373,0,62666,tyler_r_green,,936.919,939.075,"An officer could do that, Your Honor."
2015.14-1373,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,947.83,949.915,But you say they didn't need reasons for suspicion.
2015.14-1373,0,62666,tyler_r_green,,961.955,972.385,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, they don't have to have reasonable suspicion to check for warrants, but that's different from making the initial stop where, of course, they do need reasonable suspicion. If there are no further questions, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time."
2015.14-1373,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,972.385,981.15,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bash."
2015.14-1373,1,29118,john_f_bash,,981.15,1004.46,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to start with the concern that Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan have both raised about these communities where there are a lot of outstanding warrants. As a preface, there is a lot of communities where there is not a lot of outstanding warrants, and the rule that Respondent wants you to establish would exclude evidence of serious guilt and serious offenses nationwide. But focusing on communities like Ferguson with a lot of outstanding warrants --"
2015.14-1373,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1004.46,1004.975,I'm sorry.
2015.14-1373,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1034.0,1037.63,"Well, what's being excluded is evidence of the crime that was --"
2015.14-1373,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1037.63,1040.72,Of another crime that the police would never have found.
2015.14-1373,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1042.185,1055.93,"Well -- well, they might have found it during a separate valid execution of -- a separate execution of the warrant without a preceding Terry stop, but the evidence found on a person, for example, a firearm, can be very serious crimes that are also of significant danger to these communities."
2015.14-1373,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1055.93,1057.75,But that's true of all evidence we suppress.
2015.14-1373,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1074.275,1074.74,Of course.
2015.14-1373,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1081.24,1091.885,So what's our rule now? Now you don't need reasonable suspicion to stop someone. You only need questionable reasonable suspicion to stop someone. (Laughter.)
2015.14-1373,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1091.885,1092.505,Well --
2015.14-1373,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1092.505,1115.125,"And now -- so we've now lessened the standard -- the Terry stop standard, which is fairly intrusive to stop someone. I -- I suspect, and I don't know whose brief it was, yours or your -- or Petitioner's, but someone said the public will stop this if they don't like police stopping you with no cause."
2015.14-1373,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1121.315,1124.15,"Well, Justice Sotomayor, we're not talking about all Terry cases."
2015.14-1373,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1138.29,1138.4,No.
2015.14-1373,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1138.92,1140.94,"You're not talking about the statistics, Mr. Bash."
2015.14-1373,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1150.47,1151.76,We don't know globally.
2015.14-1373,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1184.94,1185.11,Yeah.
2015.14-1373,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1191.2,1215.62,"Well, it's -- it's important to know that Respondent's rule does nothing to solve the problem that the -- the Department of Justice in its March report -- March 2015 report on Ferguson identified. What was going on in Ferguson is that the municipal court, in conjunction with the police, were using arrest warrants as a revenue-raising measure. They were issuing warrants for very minor offenses and failure to appear, and then police officers on the scene had the incentive to arrest people to bring them in to pay the fine."
2015.14-1373,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1234.15,1237.34,"But I guess -- I -- I take the point, Mr. Bash, but I guess I just don't understand."
2015.14-1373,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1277.145,1301.37,"Justice Kagan, I don't think the empirics show that the numbers are so great that even in high-crime neighborhoods, at least outside of the Ferguson circumstance where you have this odd revenue-raising scheme, that the -- the chance of both finding a warrant and then finding contraband in the search ensuing to arrest is so high that it's incentivizing officers to conduct illegal stops solely for the purpose of finding a warrant."
2015.14-1373,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1301.37,1306.84,So that was my point about the importance or the likely importance of purpose in this analysis.
2015.14-1373,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1306.84,1353.55,"And -- and I was actually just going to turn to that, Justice Kennedy. I think when this Court has mentioned flagrancy in cases, not only those cases listing the Brown factors, but also classes like Leon and Herring, what it has been concerned about in part is the notion that once you establish an attenuation principle, what I would say is a common-sense principle here that generally an arrest warrant should be a superseding cause of the discovery of the evidence, you might have an officer exploiting though rule precisely in order to get evidence in searches incident to arrests. So I think the way you could think about flagrancy is: Did this officer have the purpose -- and it could be -- either be a purpose objectively understood from all of the facts or it could be a subjective purpose -- to exploit this attenuation exception precisely in order to search incident to arrest. I don't think the facts here remotely get there."
2015.14-1373,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1377.405,1389.01,"But does that mean that we're going to have to, in every single case, explore the officer's subjective motivations? Because that sounds like the kind of inquiry that we've tried to stay away from in the past."
2015.14-1373,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1389.01,1391.73,"Justice Kagan, Justice Kennedy suggested subjective motivations."
2015.14-1373,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1442.79,1450.14,"Now, we've gotten to the point where we no longer have reasonable suspicion at all, because you keep defending this stop."
2015.14-1373,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1479.055,1483.185,"Justice Sotomayor, respectfully, I think this -- I think this was a close case and I'll -- I'll just lay out why."
2015.14-1373,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1519.06,1519.18,Yes.
2015.14-1373,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1531.605,1533.88,"As the case comes to the Court, that is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2015.14-1373,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1541.09,1553.575,"Is that -- would you -- the reason that this case comes to us is because the Utah Supreme Court says, no, this is three kings and flagrant; this is all very confusing."
2015.14-1373,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1574.86,1578.54,"Well, I don't think the three-prong way is a bad way to look at it."
2015.14-1373,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1585.66,1587.175,"Finish your sentence, sir."
2015.14-1373,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1587.175,1603.245,"We think it's a fine way to think about this case, in the sense of the Court could hold superseding legal authority by a neutral magistrate is an intervening event of significance for the attenuation analysis, and suppression would be appropriate only if the stop was flagrant, either objectively or subjectively understood."
2015.14-1373,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1603.245,1608.98,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Watt."
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,1608.98,1630.92,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Utah's proposed rule would open the door to abuse. It would create a powerful incentive for police officer -- officers to detain citizens without concern for the Fourth Amendment, knowing that finding a warrant would wipe the slate clean and render the constitutional violation irrelevant."
2015.14-1373,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1654.99,1666.755,"Well, would that be true if, let's say, one-half of 1 percent of the residents of South Salt Lake or Salt Lake City have outstanding warrants?"
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,1666.755,1672.56,"The statistics are important to our argument, but not necessary."
2015.14-1373,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1698.32,1699.73,"Well, that's true, there's a downside."
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,1735.25,1738.08,"Well, it's still precisely why the officer would be doing it."
2015.14-1373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1765.145,1771.695,Could -- could you -- is it permissible to do a warrant check as part of a lawful Terry stop?
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,1771.695,1773.33,A lawful Terry stop?
2015.14-1373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1773.33,1773.835,Yes.
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,1773.835,1781.97,"We -- in our brief, we referred to Rodriguez, and -- and this Court has certainly said that, at least in the context of -- of automobile stops, yes."
2015.14-1373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1781.97,1797.05,"Well, in -- in -- in this case, the State, as I understand it -- please correct me if I'm wrong -- has conceded that the stop was unlawful. It has not conceded that it was flagrantly unlawful; isn't -- isn't that correct?"
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,1797.05,1798.28,"Well, that's right."
2015.14-1373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1803.41,1809.205,So we take the case as one in which there was no -- there was no flagrant conduct?
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,1809.205,1813.98,The -- so the test under Brown for flagrancy really has two elements.
2015.14-1373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1856.9,1873.93,"What -- what's the number? What percentage of people have to have warrants before you can imply that whenever an officer stops someone, it is to, you know, illegally search them because they're very likely to have an arrest warrant?"
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,1873.93,1879.41,"Well, I think that the proper focus -- I mean, I -- I don't think breaking it down to numbers is the way to go."
2015.14-1373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1883.73,1884.9,"Well, I suppose that's related."
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,1898.065,1898.63,If you had --
2015.14-1373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1898.63,1905.31,"And some of these numbers -- obviously, you have, in particular communities, high numbers, but some of them didn't strike me -- I was surprised how low they were."
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,1909.93,1918.08,So -- so the officers run warrants because -- warrants checks because they're likely to turn up warrants.
2015.14-1373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1920.58,1933.96,"Why is that? You mean every time a police officer pulls somebody over and runs a warrant check, it's because he thinks it's likely there's a warrant? Might it -- might it be to protect him when he walks up to the car? He'd like to know that the person is wanted for murder, right?"
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,1933.96,1937.865,So running the warrants check tells him that.
2015.14-1373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1955.505,1968.665,"But I guess -- I mean, you do require us to determine whether or not he ran the warrant check to ensure his safety in -- in this interaction, or as an investigative matter."
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,1970.805,1987.49,"In -- he -- it makes a difference in the sense that when there is a stop that is -- is made, that the warrants check is inherent in that stop. So I guess my answer is no, it doesn't make a difference, because when warrants check is --"
2015.14-1373,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1987.49,1991.98,"Why wouldn't it? Why wouldn't it? Now, look at our case, Rodriguez case."
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,1997.33,1998.52,That's right.
2015.14-1373,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1998.52,1999.05,All right.
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,1999.05,1999.465,Right.
2015.14-1373,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1999.465,2012.955,"If the stop here is purely investigatory, isn't that different? Can you have an investigatory stop based on no suspicion? You were right when you said he stopped to check for the warrant."
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2018.82,2021.685,Can -- can you have an investigative stop --
2015.14-1373,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2021.685,2022.27,Yes.
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2022.27,2025.78,-- to check for a warrant without reasonable suspicion or with?
2015.14-1373,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2025.78,2026.715,Without.
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2026.715,2028.225,"Without, you cannot."
2015.14-1373,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2034.305,2039.755,"As I understand your position, you don't argue that the arrest was unlawful; is that right?"
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2039.755,2040.38,We don't.
2015.14-1373,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2041.1,2054.105,"So the arrest was lawful. And when the officer is making the arrest, it's permissible for safety purposes for the officer to frisk the person who is being arrested."
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2054.97,2055.825,Yes.
2015.14-1373,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2055.825,2060.305,"So it's a -- so it's a lawful search, correct."
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2060.305,2062.525,We've never challenged the search.
2015.14-1373,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2062.525,2074.395,Isn't it -- can you -- can you give me one other example of a situation in which this Court has held that the fruit of a lawful search must be suppressed?
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2074.395,2077.975,I don't have another case in this precise circumstance.
2015.14-1373,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2079.13,2080.79,"Well, in any circumstance."
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2080.79,2083.635,So -- so this case has not come before the Court.
2015.14-1373,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2109.39,2124.295,"I'm just pointing it out that that's a curiosity, isn't it, to have a law -- to suppress the fruit of a lawful search? And maybe you need strong circumstances to justify such an unusual and unprecedented result."
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2124.295,2133.9,"Well, our position is these are strong circumstances because part of deterrence -- the value of deterrence is found in the strength of the incentive to violate the Constitution."
2015.14-1373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2133.9,2134.14,Could you --
2015.14-1373,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2134.14,2136.07,"Well, I thought that -- you said --"
2015.14-1373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2136.07,2137.435,Go ahead.
2015.14-1373,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2137.435,2150.2,"You said you don't question at all the arrest, and you don't question, once there is an arrest, to pat down for drugs -- I mean, the pat-down for guns."
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2171.25,2195.09,"Well, our position is that anything that's found is the fruit of that, of that illegal detention, not of the arrest, because the -- the arrest and -- and ultimate -- and subsequent search are -- are a fruit, but -- but they're not suppressible. They're not something that we have fought against because, again, we have the warrant and authorization."
2015.14-1373,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2195.09,2216.72,"Well, if the individual is going to be arrested and put in jail, isn't it standard procedure and lawful procedure for the authorities to search that person thoroughly? They couldn't have a person bring drugs into -- into the jail or things that the person might use to hurt himself or other people?"
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2216.72,2217.94,It would still be a fruit.
2015.14-1373,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2217.94,2227.765,"So it would -- well, what does that mean? It's -- but it's not -- it -- that doesn't -- that's lawful conduct on their part, right?"
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2227.765,2228.37,Right.
2015.14-1373,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2228.37,2228.95,Okay.
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2233.985,2241.53,What we're asking for is the suppression based on the unlawful detention that began the encounter.
2015.14-1373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2312.02,2314.465,"You're arguing something that the State's conceded, right?"
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2314.465,2323.005,"Well, I think it's important because the State has taken the position that -- that this was just a fact or two shy of -- of what was needed."
2015.14-1373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2330.42,2333.244,But you still have to say that it's flagrant.
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2333.244,2343.935,"Well, my position is -- is twofold; one, that -- that flagrancy has two aspects. One aspect is just the deliberate aspect."
2015.14-1373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2373.66,2379.815,You -- you said that the -- that the stop was made for the purpose of running for the arrest warrants.
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2401.015,2407.63,"No, because what -- we know that that's precisely what -- what was done in this case, what is done in some other cases."
2015.14-1373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2414.89,2421.04,But he immediately runs the arrest -- warrants check when he makes the stop because he wants to know who he's dealing with.
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2433.76,2438.485,The way he finds out who he's dealing with is if there's a warrant.
2015.14-1373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2443.775,2444.47,"No, I understand that."
2015.14-1373,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2444.47,2445.27,In order to run the warrant --
2015.14-1373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2445.27,2450.27,You're implying -- I'm still trying to get at how you decide what the purpose was.
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2457.06,2475.6,Because it was immediate; it was inherent in what he did; because he stated that his purpose in -- in stopping my client was to find out about my -- find out about the house; and that it was normal for him to run a warrants check and normal for him to know -- want to know who he's dealing with so.
2015.14-1373,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2475.6,2476.015,You're --
2015.14-1373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2476.015,2480.735,Let's say that the warrant check is something he does when he arrests people.
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2486.54,2505.57,"So the intended consequence of running a warrants check is to find a warrant, No. 1. And No. 2, our statistics show that -- that in -- in a sizable number -- it's -- officers are likely to find warrants. The other concern is if he thought --"
2015.14-1373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2505.57,2518.65,"You're asking us to say that, as a matter of law, you want us to hold that the purpose of this stop was to run the warrants check? I thought the purpose of the stop was to find out what was going -- what was going on in the house."
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2518.65,2521.275,I -- I think that when -- when an --
2015.14-1373,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2521.275,2524.645,The record just doesn't support the first proposition that I made.
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2524.645,2535.66,"When an officer detains someone as part of a fishing expedition in the hope that something will turn up, that is -- that is the purpose that is a problem."
2015.14-1373,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2535.66,2537.505,There was no suspicion here.
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2540.48,2541.44,I'm sorry.
2015.14-1373,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2542.135,2542.92,No.
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2555.85,2556.12,No.
2015.14-1373,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2556.12,2556.755,Correct?
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2556.755,2557.235,Correct.
2015.14-1373,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2557.235,2570.675,"So the purpose, as I understand what you're trying to say is, he is now routinely checking every single person that he stops, whether with or without reasonable suspicion."
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2574.735,2575.815,But that's --
2015.14-1373,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2575.815,2594.18,"So part of the stop may be to investigate, but the other part of the stop is he's doing this routinely, with no reasonable suspicion, with no articulable fear of his -- for his own safety. He's demanding peoples' names, and he's running a warrant to do what? You're saying to find the warrant."
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2594.18,2595.1,Find the warrant.
2015.14-1373,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2595.1,2596.11,Exactly.
2015.14-1373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2596.11,2603.97,"How often are -- are cars -- people stopped driving, an officer walks up to the car and they're shot? Has that happened a fair amount of times?"
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2603.97,2604.64,It does happen.
2015.14-1373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2604.64,2605.36,It does happen.
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2613.35,2613.61,So --
2015.14-1373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2613.61,2616.295,It seems to me not wanting to get shot's a pretty good reason.
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2616.295,2619.82,But this presents a completely different scenario.
2015.14-1373,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2638.075,2647.705,"Well, we really don't know very much about exactly what happened here, which is unfortunate."
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2697.085,2703.91,So -- so a really important part of the officer's testimony was that he didn't remember what that answer was.
2015.14-1373,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2803.44,2809.465,"Well, all he did was go from the house to a convenience store, not in a car but walking."
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2809.465,2810.335,Right.
2015.14-1373,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2810.335,2816.02,"He walks to a convenience store, he's stopped in the parking garage but without a car."
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2823.405,2824.455,Right.
2015.14-1373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2825.51,2828.26,Would your rule apply in that situation?
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2828.26,2831.83,"Well, when an -- when an officer makes a stop --"
2015.14-1373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2831.83,2845.96,"Would your rule apply in a situation where the officer approaches the car for a purpose that is later found to be insufficient under Terry? You would suppress whatever evidence is find -- found in that situation too, right?"
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2845.96,2849.685,If the -- if the officer did not have a reasonable suspicion for the stop.
2015.14-1373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2849.685,2850.655,Okay.
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2854.465,2855.08,It would.
2015.14-1373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2855.62,2856.095,Okay.
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2856.095,2864.0,"But again, in these cases, if there is a warrant, we haven't argued about the warrant itself."
2015.14-1373,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2900.06,2909.5,In -- in your brief you took the position that -- that an event is intervening only if it is unforeseeable.
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,2909.5,2939.455,"Well, our position is that an intervening circumstance needs to be independent, and it -- it needs to be a break in the -- the causal chain. And that when -- when a warrant is run -- and it needs to be something that is not directly related to the officer's conduct. And so because the warrants check is an inherent part of -- of the detention, it's not an intervening circumstance."
2015.14-1373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3055.725,3060.155,You -- you disagree with Judge Friendly's analysis in the Friedland case?
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,3060.155,3063.18,That -- in -- in what respect?
2015.14-1373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3063.18,3064.99,"Well, with -- with his analysis."
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,3071.88,3082.02,"I guess I don't, no. So -- so our position is that that this falls squarely within the -- the Court's settled case law."
2015.14-1373,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3087.43,3098.215,You agree that attenuation is based on -- on deterrence; that the attenuation determination is based on a calculation of the deterrent effect of the ruling.
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,3098.215,3098.75,I do.
2015.14-1373,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3147.86,3151.805,And -- and your deterrence argument doesn't depend at all on statistics?
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,3151.805,3164.115,"With -- even without the statistics, our deterrence argument works because the point is a reasonably well-trained officer would -- should know what the parameters of Terry are."
2015.14-1373,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3165.735,3170.43,"So if one in a thousand people has an outstanding warrant, that's enough?"
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,3170.43,3171.095,So --
2015.14-1373,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3171.095,3175.26,That statistic would -- that statistic wouldn't upset your argument?
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,3175.26,3181.94,It wouldn't upset my argument because we -- we run -- officers run warrants checks because they're likely to find them --
2015.14-1373,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3181.94,3184.585,"One -- one in 10,000, would that upset your argument?"
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,3184.585,3185.51,I -- I suppose --
2015.14-1373,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3185.51,3187.68,I've got to get to a number where you're going to say --
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,3187.68,3188.37,Yes. (Laughter.)
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,3188.37,3197.475,"In those communities, then you're going to see much less of this behavior, you know, much less of the running of warrants checks in order to find a warrant."
2015.14-1373,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3229.68,3234.07,But what was it? We know -- was it a -- a ticket? Do we know --
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,3234.07,3235.74,It's not in the record.
2015.14-1373,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3235.74,3237.19,It's not in the record.
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,3237.19,3237.31,Yeah.
2015.14-1373,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3240.02,3249.61,Do you think the judges in the traffic -- in the traffic courts are going to start issuing lots of warrants because they want to provide a basis for -- for randomly stopping people?
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,3249.61,3255.97,My point is only that it -- it creates an incentive to not be as careful.
2015.14-1373,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3256.81,3261.15,I'm very surprised that Justice Alito doesn't know that most of these warrants are automatic.
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,3268.57,3268.98,Right.
2015.14-1373,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3270.43,3275.17,"So it doesn't create an incentive of the kind you were arguing, you were worried about before."
2015.14-1373,2,62667,joan_c_watt,,3275.17,3275.995,I'm sorry.
