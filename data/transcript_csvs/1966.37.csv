1966.37,0,45998,william_p_rogers,,67.073,71.659,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2130.148,2131.532,"Yes, sir."
1966.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2171.373,2172.092,May I ask you a --
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2172.092,2173.171,And if I make some suggestions --
1966.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2173.171,2175.186,"May I ask you, sir, that hasn't anything to do with this case?"
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2175.186,2175.886,"Sir, it does."
1966.37,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2222.113,2223.395,Is that really the claim here?
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2223.395,2224.351,"Yes, sir."
1966.37,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2228.484,2234.472,"Well, they don't -- they don't say that the press may deliberately tell the Court to?"
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2234.472,2244.738,"That is the effect, sir, of the argument primarily of the amicus curiae and essentially of the Associated Press."
1966.37,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2249.869,2254.572,Do you think the New York -- the New York Times rule really in effect to protect this or they deliberately lie?
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2254.572,2255.132,"No, sir."
1966.37,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2255.947,2257.535,That's solely with the claims in the --
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2257.535,2263.316,Because the New York Times case did not involve the charge of crime.
1966.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2264.179,2264.418,Oh!
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2265.371,2265.994,Sir?
1966.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2265.994,2266.033,Garrison.
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2266.033,2269.829,Not as such as I get Garrison.
1966.37,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2392.695,2394.286,In what volume is that?
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2394.286,2394.754,Sir?
1966.37,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2394.754,2395.526,What volume is that?
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2395.526,2396.72,That is volume 3 --
1966.37,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2396.72,2397.184,Thank you.
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2399.187,2402.102,"Yes, sir, page 1229 of the record."
1966.37,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2490.971,2504.109,What -- on what basis do you say as I guess you must that this course of events was the -- was approximately caused by the Associated Press story?
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2504.109,2504.609,"Yes, sir."
1966.37,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2513.219,2515.445,You mean it followed the release?
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2515.445,2525.727,"Immediately on the reporter, sir, who made the release, appeared on the Government's complaint as the witness furnishing the information upon which Walker is incarcerated."
1966.37,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2528.853,2532.679,Is that if -- where is the -- is the Government's complaint in the record?
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2532.679,2533.625,"Yes, sir."
1966.37,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2542.813,2543.645,What?
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2543.645,2546.462,It's page 7 of the appendix.
1966.37,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2546.462,2547.654,Of what?
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2547.654,2551.384,"Page 7, the amicus answer to amicus curiae brief --"
1966.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2551.384,2558.432,"Well, if I -- may I just ask you, what you are going to tell us is that part of the trial record?"
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2559.098,2563.311,"Sir, I don't remember whether that was specifically entered in the trial or not."
1966.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2563.311,2582.459,"Well, I'm just -- just interests me something like this if there's no effort at the trial to establish that there was a connection between the complaint filed -- this initial release, the author of that release and the author of that release has one of it supporting the Government's complaint?"
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2582.459,2584.18,"Well, those facts were all over the trial, sir."
1966.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2584.836,2586.46,Are they in -- if they are in the trial record?
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2586.46,2591.921,"If my recollection, I won't to be -- I want to recheck and answer Your Honor's question precisely."
1966.37,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2591.921,2593.347,You may check during the luncheon recess.
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2593.347,2593.885,"Alright, sir."
1966.37,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2625.979,2627.131,What did happen?
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2627.131,2629.789,"Sir, he was arrested."
1966.37,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2629.789,2630.414,Uh-hum.
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2630.414,2634.328,Given into the custody of the U.S. Marshal for confinement by court order in Mississippi.
1966.37,1,15083,tom_c_clark,scotus_justice,2662.865,2664.372,Is this a suit against the United States?
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2664.372,2664.657,"No, sir."
1966.37,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2667.914,2670.663,If you go to the quantum of the damages in this case I suppose?
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2670.663,2671.163,"Well, no, sir."
1966.37,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2675.037,2675.279,I see.
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2675.279,2676.189,-- and in the Texas case.
1966.37,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2676.189,2677.307,Yes.
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2677.307,2678.621,It was excluded.
1966.37,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2679.452,2680.109,I see.
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2680.109,2684.112,-- relationship with the acts of incidents between Walker and the Government of the Texas case.
1966.37,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2684.112,2686.358,You don't claim the Associate Press putting him in?
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2686.358,2693.551,"As claim, sir that the Associated Press triggered the course of events which resulted in this fantastic situation."
1966.37,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2718.406,2721.12,"Well, I didn't --"
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2721.12,2721.16,"Yes, sir."
1966.37,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2721.16,2725.956,-- quite understand your answer to my question I think that he was held there for 90-day or --
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2725.956,2726.291,"No, sir."
1966.37,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2733.763,2735.713,I don't understand this triggering thing here --
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2735.713,2735.868,But what I say --
1966.37,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2735.868,2743.321,-- because he had an obscenity case recently and there was one of the briefs showed that a man went on to see a movie called “The Ten Commandments”.
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2743.321,2743.411,"Yes, sir."
1966.37,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2743.411,2745.456,He came out and killed seven women.
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2745.456,2745.978,"Yes, sir."
1966.37,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2745.978,2747.868,That movie triggered that.
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2753.564,2754.951,"Well, what happened in this case, sir?"
1966.37,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2777.055,2779.423,But you always claim that -- you don't claim that as a quantum of --
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2779.423,2779.741,"No, sir."
1966.37,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2781.384,2782.6,I think it would be irrelevant here.
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2782.6,2783.039,"Yes, sir."
1966.37,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2802.998,2804.31,What was he charged with?
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2804.31,2804.683,Sir?
1966.37,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2804.683,2805.673,What was he charged with?
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2805.673,2812.098,"He was charged with sedition, assault of the U.S. office -- officers, insurrection and seditious conspiracy."
1966.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2818.696,2820.084,What happened to those cases?
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2820.084,2820.491,Sir?
1966.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2820.491,2821.318,What happened to those cases?
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2821.318,2824.567,The grand jury dismissed the charge.
1966.37,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2828.889,2829.861,Is that in Mississippi?
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2829.861,2831.138,"In Mississippi, yes, sir."
1966.37,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2863.143,2875.801,Might not some of the statements that General Walker's quoted as having made in the briefs says have triggered that just as much or more?
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2875.801,2879.663,"Sir, here by my concept of it, I -- those statements are enforced."
1966.37,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2879.663,2879.724,That's --
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2879.724,2883.871,"I regret them but I do not believe they could have triggered them, sir, because they were not a crime."
1966.37,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2883.871,2884.548,They were not what?
1966.37,1,20364,clyde_j_watts,,2884.548,2885.627,They were not a crime.
1966.37,2,45998,william_p_rogers,,5275.691,5278.823,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.37,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5282.091,5291.071,"Well, I hope Mr. Rogers you're going to tell us why you didn't ask for a -- specifically for a New York Times charge, you didn't?"
1966.37,2,45998,william_p_rogers,,5291.071,5299.941,"Well, Your Honor, the judge -- it was conceded to begin with in the trial that he was a public figure, that walk was a public figure."
1966.37,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5299.941,5303.56,"Well, I know but you did not ask expressly, did you, for New York Times charge that was given?"
1966.37,2,45998,william_p_rogers,,5303.56,5311.937,"No, because -- no, the Court ruled that the New York Times doctrine did not apply to a public figure like Walker, as he said in his opinion."
1966.37,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5311.937,5314.236,But he didn't say that lacks at the trial.
1966.37,2,45998,william_p_rogers,,5314.236,5317.696,"Well, we --I think we made the argument at the New York Times doctrine applied."
1966.37,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5320.013,5331.201,"Well, I don't see how you could have made the argument, frankly, Mr. Rogers without saying New York Times apply and we request an instruction which the Court with New York Times rule."
1966.37,2,45998,william_p_rogers,,5333.724,5349.089,"Well, as I say the -- I think that the reason trial counsel didn't is because there was a concession that Walker was a public figure and it was understood that the Court was not going to rule that the New York Times doctrine should be extended to people like General Walker."
1966.37,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5349.25,5356.226,But where did you get that impression from where -- when did the judge make that statement that he was not going to consider this --
1966.37,2,45998,william_p_rogers,,5356.226,5357.469,"Well, I'm not sure."
1966.37,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5359.36,5361.112,"Well, I know but during that trial judge --"
1966.37,2,45998,william_p_rogers,,5361.112,5362.062,I'm not sure about the timing of it --
1966.37,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5362.062,5370.436,-- where it would lead you to believe that it wasn't necessary for you to ask for or it is -- New York Times instruction.
1966.37,2,45998,william_p_rogers,,5370.436,5374.372,"Well, I suppose also that just to speak about counsel who tried the case."
1966.37,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5572.055,5577.617,"Mr. Rogers, was there a demand for retraction served on the Associated Press here?"
1966.37,2,45998,william_p_rogers,,5577.617,5578.715,"No, there was not, Your Honor."
1966.37,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5578.715,5579.843,In no time?
1966.37,2,45998,william_p_rogers,,5579.843,5580.748,"No, not to my knowledge."
1966.37,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5584.055,5610.426,"Was there -- do you draw any distinction between a situation in which the daily press has to report a story in hot blood so to speak in a situation in which like, let us say Time against Hill, there is an opportunity for investigation with respect, I have to ask you now the question that goes to theory at this?"
1966.37,2,45998,william_p_rogers,,5610.426,5617.918,"Yes, I think there is a real distinction and I think the press is under the gun in the situation like this."
1966.37,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5633.796,5635.158,I -- I don't know.
1966.37,2,45998,william_p_rogers,,5643.355,5644.08,Yes.
1966.37,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5644.08,5649.235,And I suppose that there's that kind of a subject development that may enter into this one?
1966.37,2,45998,william_p_rogers,,5649.235,5649.777,"Yes, sir."
1966.37,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5750.611,5758.613,"But Mr. Rogers, what is going to do with the Court of Appeals could -- that doesn't seem it -- it sustained trial judge."
1966.37,2,45998,william_p_rogers,,5767.777,5768.966,Uh hum.
1966.37,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5768.966,5777.227,I think that's in 1548?
1966.37,2,45998,william_p_rogers,,5777.227,5779.781,"I don't think it's -- Your Honor, I know this is quite as clear as the --"
1966.37,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5779.781,5785.048,"Well, what it says is that -- the Court of Appeals says is, in view of all the surrounding circumstances."
1966.37,2,45998,william_p_rogers,,5800.537,5806.525,"Well, Your Honor, I think that means as defined in the opinion of the Court and the opinion of the Court says, that he defined --"
1966.37,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5806.525,5816.336,"Well, the only definition in find -- in special verdict number 4, the trial judge read that out of the case and Court of Appeals doesn't seem put the fact in this case."
1966.37,2,45998,william_p_rogers,,5816.336,5817.595,Yes.
1966.37,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5827.367,5831.417,"In fact -- in fact, affirming setting -- taking out under the case?"
1966.37,2,45998,william_p_rogers,,5831.417,5835.905,Yes.
1966.37,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5836.222,5847.748,I noticed -- I notice the Court of Appeals cites two other cases and trial judge cited both the Texas cases cites a third Texas case because not cite New York Times.
1966.37,2,45998,william_p_rogers,,5847.748,5858.072,Like I think the appellate court supported the trial court and felt that the trial court had ruled that New York Times malice was not in the case and therefore had no reason to specifically refer to it.
1966.37,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5858.072,5861.682,This because he was not a public official?
1966.37,2,45998,william_p_rogers,,5861.682,5863.33,That's correct.
1966.37,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5863.33,5871.53,"General Rogers, did I understand you to say that General Walker was arrested the day before this article came out?"
1966.37,2,45998,william_p_rogers,,5871.53,5873.146,"That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice."
1966.37,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5873.146,5880.373,I wonder if you could -- you won't delay the case now but I wonder if you could give us that citation from the record for that's disclose --
1966.37,2,45998,william_p_rogers,,5880.373,5882.146,"That is -- that is in our reply brief, Your Honor."
1966.37,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5882.146,5883.668,Where is it is in your reply brief?
