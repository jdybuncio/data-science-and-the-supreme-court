2014.13-1314,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,10.075,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 1313-14, the Arizona State Legislature v. The Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission. Mr. Clement."
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,10.075,25.37,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Proposition 106 permanently divests the State legislature of its authority to prescribe congressional districts and redelegates that authority to an unelected and unaccountable commission."
2014.13-1314,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,45.34,48.13,But it's all right for the State redistricting.
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,59.1,65.37,"Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg. It only applies to the -- our argument only applies to the congressional redistricting."
2014.13-1314,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,87.2,92.495,"Mr. Clement, I just want to clarify your position."
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,101.855,104.96,"Oh, you certainly don't have to overturn Hildebrant and Smiley."
2014.13-1314,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,123.23,136.395,That's sort of hard to understand because we made it very clear in Smiley and in Hildebrant that we're defining legislature in this clause as meaning legislative process.
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,136.395,139.295,"With -- with all due respect, I disagree."
2014.13-1314,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,188.19,202.09,"I -- but -- but this makes no sense to me, because I think it's an either/or. If the legislature has the power, how can the governor veto it? How can a popular referendum veto it? Either they have the power or they don't."
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,202.09,203.11,I disagree --
2014.13-1314,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,203.11,212.83,"And if a State constitution says that the people hold the power and they can choose a commission or however else they want to do it, isn't that the legislative process?"
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,212.83,213.89,"No, it's not."
2014.13-1314,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,287.62,296.17,Could Congress -- could Congress do that? Could Congress substitute this commission for the State's legislature?
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,296.17,306.88,"I don't believe that Congress could say that at the State level, we're going to redelegate this authority from the State legislatures to the State commissions or to independent commissions."
2014.13-1314,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,316.85,326.355,But couldn't -- could Congress bless what Arizona has done by saying that's a matter in which Federal elections will be held?
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,326.355,345.08,"I don't think they could simply bless what Arizona has done because I think that would amount to revisiting the judgment that the framers made in the first subclause. I think that they could -- if they wanted to, Congress could say, we're going to actually take those commission districts and we're going to make them our own, and we're going to impose them."
2014.13-1314,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,345.98,353.66,"So you're saying it has to be a Federal commission or a State commission, but if it's the latter, it can be only the legislature."
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,353.66,360.18,"I -- I think that's right. Though, of course, it could be an advisory commission. What we object to is not just the idea that there is a commission."
2014.13-1314,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,364.28,378.685,"Suppose you had a -- a law that said that the reapportion commission has -- must submit its proposal to the legislature, and the legislature has 30 days and can overturn it only by a three-quarters vote."
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,378.685,382.485,"I think, Justice Kennedy, that would be a harder case."
2014.13-1314,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,423.16,434.545,"Your phrase ""completely cut out"" probably answers the question, what about voter ID laws, what about absentee ballots, and so forth that are provisions enacted by referendum?"
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,434.545,435.33,Right.
2014.13-1314,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,435.33,439.695,You would say those are okay because the legislature is not completely cut out?
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,439.695,441.77,I would say probably so.
2014.13-1314,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,441.77,441.87,Or you --
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,441.87,444.335,I think it might depend on the details a little bit.
2014.13-1314,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,444.335,450.12,"Well, Mr. Clement, how about that, because I thought that the legislature was completely cut out as to most of those things."
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,476.805,477.32,Yes.
2014.13-1314,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,507.68,510.07,"Well, they're not delegations or non-delegations."
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,514.44,514.925,Exactly.
2014.13-1314,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,514.925,516.54,Not through the legislature.
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,516.54,517.22,Exactly.
2014.13-1314,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,519.05,520.69,"No, but, I mean, my gosh."
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,535.32,537.89,"See, Justice Kagan, we distinguish two situations."
2014.13-1314,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,568.65,579.11,"Well, how do you -- how do you make that consistent with the text that you are -- the textual argument that you are making? The textual argument that you are making is legislature means legislature."
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,594.04,602.61,"Two things, Justice Kagan. See, our position is not the problem here is that somebody else got into the legislature's lane and purported to do something about elections."
2014.13-1314,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,646.41,658.035,"Well, I thought that the -- that generally in our separation of powers jurisprudence, abdication is just as consequential as aggrandizement. In other words, it doesn't matter what the legislature wants."
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,669.315,672.38,"Well, that's not the way the Court approached this issue in McPherson."
2014.13-1314,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,699.91,704.705,Suppose -- suppose the legislature proposed the initiative or the referendum -- the referendum.
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,704.705,711.02,"I don't think that would ultimately make a difference in my own view, but I think that would be a different case."
2014.13-1314,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,711.02,711.52,"Well, but that -- that --"
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,711.52,712.12,And you could argue --
2014.13-1314,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,712.12,716.16,"That's a case in which the legislature has, itself, made the decision."
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,716.16,716.695,Right.
2014.13-1314,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,727.105,750.54,"Well, it's not completely remote because the legislature in Arizona -- correct me if I'm wrong -- can seek to overturn what the commission does by putting its own referendum before the voters saying, please, voters, change this proposal for -- or change this districting plan and enact a different one. I suppose the legislature can do that."
2014.13-1314,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,758.36,760.21,I think I'm right about that.
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,760.21,763.11,I think they would have the power to do an initiative.
2014.13-1314,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,800.59,801.59,So please tell me --
2014.13-1314,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,801.59,808.575,Do I understand you to say that it would be okay if the legislature itself established this commission?
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,808.575,814.345,I would -- I would take the position that that is okay because that is a delegation of authority.
2014.13-1314,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,841.14,841.26,So --
2014.13-1314,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,841.26,852.45,"So tell me, Mr. Clement, there's -- the State sets up this independent commission and the independent commission has a veto power on the State's redistricting."
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,863.575,872.01,"Well, if -- I mean, I guess it depends a little bit on the details of how that works and whether -- who's got the ultimate last say in the matter."
2014.13-1314,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,872.01,872.96,They have the vote.
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,875.305,878.59,And is it a veto that can be overridden or is it just a permanent veto?
2014.13-1314,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,878.59,879.635,Does it matter?
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,879.635,882.31,I think it does or at least arguably it does.
2014.13-1314,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,901.87,904.64,"Well, kind of it doesn't, right, because there's a veto at the end of it."
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,904.64,908.91,"Kind of it doesn't, kind of it does, which is why it's a hard case that you can wait for another day to decide."
2014.13-1314,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,908.91,909.07,All right.
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,912.765,918.82,If -- if -- if you think it doesn't then you should decide that case in favor of the State legislature.
2014.13-1314,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,919.41,931.155,"But that's what -- so this is what we're going to have to do for every time that they set up some process in which there's some independent commission involvement, what we're going to have to ask is what exactly?"
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,931.155,935.28,Whether or not it's consistent with the Constitution and what the Constitution --
2014.13-1314,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,935.28,935.51,No.
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,952.145,958.85,"I don't think it's going to be that hard, Justice Kagan, and let's look at the commissions that exist in the real world, okay? You have some that are purely advisory."
2014.13-1314,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,976.38,983.09,"What if the commission says, We're going to give you two maps, the legislature has to pick one and only one?"
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,983.09,990.45,"I would think that that's probably unconstitutional, but I don't think that -- I mean, you know, obviously if --"
2014.13-1314,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,990.45,1005.27,"But why is that unconstitutional and an impasse in the legislature and leaving it then to a third-party who is not the legislature, why is that constitutional? That's what you just said, that's constitutional."
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1005.27,1015.82,"It is, and the reason I say that is because if the legislature has the primary authority and they can't get it done, then we know, as a matter of fact, that somebody else is going to provide that rule."
2014.13-1314,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1028.875,1032.78,So that bypasses 2a(c) altogether?
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1032.78,1043.59,"Well, sure, because everybody, I think, wants to bypass 2a(c) because everybody knows that at the end of that rainbow is an unconstitutional Federal default rule that violates one-person, one-vote principles."
2014.13-1314,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1043.59,1069.08,"Could I ask you this simple question? I know you're going to say it's a constitutional requirement, but if I read Hildebrant and Smiley differently, and I think there's plenty of language in there to suggest so, but if I read it differently to say that what the Election Clause means is the legislative process, isn't that just simple? We never have to worry about how the States experiment, what they do in their own self-governance."
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1071.855,1077.07,"Well, the Federal interest is because the framers thought long and hard about this issue and they decided --"
2014.13-1314,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1077.07,1078.06,"No, they didn't, actually."
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1088.405,1091.63,"Well, there actually is a tremendous amount on this particular clause."
2014.13-1314,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1121.4,1137.02,"I thought -- I thought -- Mr. Clement, I thought that the initiative and referendum came in later, that at the time of the founding, and the initiative and the referendum weren't used by State legislatures."
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1137.02,1148.355,"They weren't in -- the initiative and the referendum as we came to know them in the early -- early 20th century, late 19th century were not in used at frame- -- the time of the framing, but direct democracy was."
2014.13-1314,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1207.76,1223.51,"But you see, Mr. Clement, that suggests a very pure rule and -- and on occasion you said something like this, a legislature means a legislature, and that's what it means, and so a legislature has to do all those things. But you've made many, many exemptions to that over the course of the last 20 minutes."
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1258.78,1260.73,"I don't agree with that, Justice Kagan."
2014.13-1314,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1293.53,1310.605,"Suppose that legislative districting plan is challenged either on the one-person, one-vote rule or under the Voting Rights Act, and it goes to a State or Federal court, and it goes a year before the election."
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1323.985,1342.78,"As I read this Court's cases, Justice Kennedy, what they say is that the -- the court in that -- in that instance -- first of all, there should be a preference for the State courts over the Federal courts, and then the State court favors the legislative process so what they do is, if there's time for the legislature to go back and draw a new map, they give the State --"
2014.13-1314,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1342.78,1345.62,And you think that's constitutionally required?
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1345.62,1347.93,I do think ultimately it's constitutionally required.
2014.13-1314,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1358.83,1382.575,"Well, we're talking about -- we're talking about what's required, so if -- if we rule in your favor, we're going to have to tell every court that's involved in a redistricting litigation that it has to submit it to the legislature. Even if the court made its own plan for one election, I think it would have to submit it to the -- back to the legislature for the next 8 years --"
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1382.575,1383.24,"Well, I --"
2014.13-1314,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1383.24,1384.56,-- under reapportionment schemes.
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1384.56,1388.99,"Well, I think, for the most part, that's what this Court has already said."
2014.13-1314,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1397.25,1412.89,"Well, certainly -- you mean a redistricting plan, if approved by a court, has to have a fixed deadline? Of course the legislature can, I assume, pass a conforming plan, but the court's plan stays in place until it does."
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1416.49,1417.19,"Well, Justice --"
2014.13-1314,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1417.19,1419.03,"Not as much, but it is a displacement."
2014.13-1314,0,37772,paul_d_clement,,1419.03,1421.74,"Yeah, it is a displacement. It's not as much. I -- I may have been confusing things."
2014.13-1314,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1521.335,1540.035,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feigin."
2014.13-1314,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1540.035,1576.89,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to make one main point on standing before I turn to a couple points on the statutory Section 2a(c) issue. On standing, this is an extremely unusual and unprecedented Federal lawsuit in which a State legislature is asking a Federal court for assurance that if it passed a certain kind of law, which it hasn't even alleged that it's going to pass, the law would be enforced by a defendant State official who hasn't even denied that she would enforce it. We don't normally conceive of legislatures as having an interest, let alone an interest cognizable under Article III, in the enforcement of laws they might pass."
2014.13-1314,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1581.96,1595.6,"Mr. Feigin, isn't this a diminution of the power to legislate, not of a particular plan or of a particular law and plan? This is the removal of power from the legislature."
2014.13-1314,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1595.6,1625.04,"No, it isn't, Your Honor, because I don't think there's anything that actually, as a practical matter, prevents the legislature from passing a bill that would redistrict the State, which they believe, in good faith, that they can do under their view of the Elections Clause. The -- there are numerous cases, some of which are cited in our brief at page 13, in which the Arizona legislature has passed laws that conflict with a popular initiative or conflict with the Arizona Constitution; and the Arizona courts do treat them as laws."
2014.13-1314,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1635.04,1638.64,So you want the legislature to pass a law that's not enforceable --
2014.13-1314,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1638.64,1639.26,Well --
2014.13-1314,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1639.26,1647.375,-- and suggest they don't have standing to challenge what the referendum has done in this case until they go through that process?
2014.13-1314,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1647.375,1651.78,"Well, Your Honor, I do think, just as in Lujan, the plaintiff had to allege that --"
2014.13-1314,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1651.78,1652.635,Which Lujan?
2014.13-1314,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1652.635,1655.645,"Lujan against Defenders of Wildlife, the second one."
2014.13-1314,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1670.93,1679.76,"Well, don't they just have to, under that theory, just allege that they plan to exercise what had, up to this point, been their normal authority to engage in the redistricting?"
2014.13-1314,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1679.76,1680.32,"Well, Your Honor --"
2014.13-1314,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1680.32,1684.08,I suspect the fact that they're litigating it implies that they have some interest in doing that.
2014.13-1314,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1684.08,1686.94,"Well, I think that could be said of almost any litigation."
2014.13-1314,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1720.13,1723.235,They have an interest in the constitutional powers they have.
2014.13-1314,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1723.235,1751.735,"Well, Your Honor, let me give you an example that I think is fairly analogous to this case and really crystallizes the point. Let's suppose that Congress passed a law that preempted State regulation in some area, and let's further suppose there were colorable constitutional challenge to that law. Now, I don't think anyone would believe that the State legislature, acting in its own name, would be the proper party to bring that constitutional challenge on the theory that its police powers have been infringed by the preemptive Federal statute."
2014.13-1314,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1761.75,1762.05,Are you saying that --
2014.13-1314,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1762.05,1763.42,-- were given an interest in law enforcement.
2014.13-1314,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1763.42,1773.5,"-- there's no -- nobody would have standing, because it seems the legislature, if anyone, has standing, and they are, as an institution, affected."
2014.13-1314,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1773.5,1779.75,"I think there may be people who are much more directly affected, such as people who might be put into one district versus another."
2014.13-1314,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1785.47,1786.23,"Well, they have to --"
2014.13-1314,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1786.23,1801.49,"Is it part of our jurisprudence that if it's likely that another person is more directly affected, that that goes into the balance and we say, Well, the legislature doesn't have standing because there are other people out there that are more directly affected? Do we say this in our cases?"
2014.13-1314,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1801.49,1802.09,"No, Your Honor."
2014.13-1314,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1832.26,1834.91,But I don't understand how 2a(c) even applies.
2014.13-1314,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1844.985,1864.795,"Well, sir, Your Honor, I'd like to turn back to Hildebrant in a second; but just to take your question on, I think the operation of the prefatory clause here is best understood in context. A neighboring Federal statute, 2 U.S.C. 2c requires that, as a matter of Federal statutory law, states be divided into districts for the purpose of electing congressional representatives."
2014.13-1314,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1911.42,1913.555,"Well, I had the same thought as the Chief Justice."
2014.13-1314,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1950.255,1955.115,"Well, Your Honor, I do think it's quite important that Congress was legislating against the backdrop of Hildebrant."

2014.13-1314,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1971.575,1975.07,And then went on to say that Congress did have the power to do it.
2014.13-1314,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1975.07,1999.93,"I guess the bottom-line question is: Let's assume 2a(c) said something totally different, which is we removed redistricting from the legislature, and we require every State to pass it by -- redistricting by referendum. That would -- are you -- is your position that Congress has the power to override the Constitution?"
2014.13-1314,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1999.93,2003.77,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think that would exactly be overriding the Constitution."
2014.13-1314,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2033.395,2039.395,"No, no, no, not -- not if the same thing violates the Constitution."
2014.13-1314,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2046.9,2047.34,"Well, Your --"
2014.13-1314,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2047.34,2050.295,The objection here is a constitutional objection.
2014.13-1314,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2050.295,2053.28,"Well, Your Honor, I do think this is within the authority of Congress."
2014.13-1314,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2106.1,2111.08,Can the second clause be used to revise the first clause? That's what we're talking about here.
2014.13-1314,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2121.205,2134.07,"Well, I guess, Your Honor, one thing I would want to emphasize is that I do think the Court settled this issue in Hildebrant when it said that the predecessor to Section 2a(c) was simply doing something that the Constitution expressly gave the right to do."
2014.13-1314,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2147.985,2162.919,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Waxman."
2014.13-1314,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2162.919,2191.865,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The gravamen of Appellant's suit that the people ""usurped"" a power of a legislative body that they created both raises a claim that the framers would have been astonished to consider that Federal district courts have jurisdiction to adjudicate and more fundamentally, is simply misconceived."

2014.13-1314,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2284.465,2295.68,"Well, the one that most clearly has our meaning, which accords with understanding, is the one in -- that this Court has said in Hildebrant and in Smiley and --"

2014.13-1314,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2302.72,2320.555,"For -- until 1913, for close to a hundred years, many States wanted to have direct election of the senators and they had all sorts of proposals, they had primaries and not one State, not one State displaced the legislature."
2014.13-1314,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2323.705,2324.86,That's correct.

Hawk, which distinguished Hildebrant and the legislative power that is addressed in Article Section 1 from the election of senators in Article I, Section 3."
2014.13-1314,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2381.26,2381.46,Wait.
2014.13-1314,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2393.995,2394.665,Correct.
2014.13-1314,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2394.665,2401.73,-- choosing senators means something different than what it means in the following section in the same article.
2014.13-1314,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2401.73,2402.1,That's correct.

2014.13-1314,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2513.65,2513.8,It might.
2014.13-1314,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2515.065,2518.805,"Well, this Court has never said that it doesn't."
2014.13-1314,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2554.94,2592.595,"I'd like you to because as I read those two cases, they don't help you very much. I mean, Hildebrant is talking about a particular statute that was passed in 1911 and it helps the government with its statutory argument because a different statute uses similar words, but we don't know if it was with the same intent. Smiley talks about a sitting legislature and asks whether its exercise of map-drawing power is a legislative exercise or, say, more like an impeachment exercise."
2014.13-1314,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2627.34,2660.78,"Well, Justice Breyer, I think that both -- that Hildebrant, Smiley, Hawke, and also this Court's -- the -- a case that this Court decided a few months after Smiley, and that was block quoted in the Court's opinion last week in Yates, the Atlantic Cleaners and Dyers case, all strongly support the reading of the word -- the meaning of the word ""legislature"" that we advocate, and that was, in fact, the consensus definition of ""legislature."" And I agree with you that I'm --"

2014.13-1314,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2708.0,2708.06,Yeah.
2014.13-1314,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2708.06,2719.45,"-- respond to Justice Scalia's assertion. One thing is for sure: If there were any other Constitution -- if there were any other dictionary that had a different principal meaning, we would have seen it in the briefing in this case."
2014.13-1314,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2781.05,2781.18,Okay.
2014.13-1314,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2863.23,2864.44,"Well, any -- Justice --"
2014.13-1314,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2864.44,2865.0,Would that be okay?
2014.13-1314,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2865.0,2877.58,"Justice Scalia, any delegation question -- the issue in this case is: What does the word ""legislature"" mean? My friend concedes that whatever the legislature is, it can delegate its authority."

2014.13-1314,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2960.13,2960.99,Because --
2014.13-1314,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2960.99,2961.795,Because any way --

2014.13-1314,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2962.03,2962.745,I'm sorry.
2014.13-1314,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2962.745,2970.71,"Because as the Court explained in Smiley, what the framers wanted was it to be done by a legislation."
2014.13-1314,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2977.24,2983.78,"Well, but I would have thought -- I understood your argument to be that as long as it's an exercise of legislative power, that it's satisfied."
2014.13-1314,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3016.57,3020.53,It is up to the power in each State that makes the laws.
2014.13-1314,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3162.82,3170.475,"But as Mr. Clement points out, the legislature, in both Smiley and Hildebrant, remain the prime mover."

2014.13-1314,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3206.1,3210.28,But it's not -- it's not that -- I'm not -- I'm just quibbling in a sense about the case.
2014.13-1314,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3236.14,3237.08,It is acting --
2014.13-1314,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3237.08,3239.465,"That's correct, and that's the answer they give."
2014.13-1314,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3244.09,3244.82,That's right.
2014.13-1314,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3249.26,3249.76,"Yes, that's the question."
2014.13-1314,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3249.76,3257.725,"Are they the legislature as they themselves have chosen? And in Smiley, again, discussing Hildebrant, this is what the Court said."
2014.13-1314,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3273.95,3280.345,"""Legislative process"" there means the process in the legislature."
2014.13-1314,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3280.345,3280.74,It --
2014.13-1314,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3280.74,3284.02,What it takes for the legislature to enact a law.
2014.13-1314,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3284.02,3284.65,That was --

2014.13-1314,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3499.09,3499.71,With respect to --
2014.13-1314,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3499.71,3508.35,And that is: Is this the legislative power when you can proceed by referendum? And the reason I say Smiley might help is simply because it says be a little bit flexible about that.
2014.13-1314,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3508.35,3513.3,I think it says a little bit flexible about the lawmaking authority of the State legislature.

2014.13-1314,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3584.31,3591.955,I think what you have to show is respect for the way that the State says the State legislature can go about lawmaking.
2014.13-1314,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3658.29,3675.82,"But, of course, you can turn that around and say what that provision shows is really exactly what I just said, is that Congress was also on board with this idea that the Court had, that when you look at that clause, the Elections Clause, that a lot of respect, a lot of deference, has to be given to the State's own definition."
2014.13-1314,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3675.82,3677.87,"And if I may respond, Justice Kagan."
