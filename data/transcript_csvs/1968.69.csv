1968.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,36.684,"Number 69, Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen Et Al., petitioners versus Jacksonville Terminal Company."
1968.69,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,37.754,41.956,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,270.952,276.507,"Mr. Rutledge, if I may ask you to go back just a moment."
1968.69,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,285.788,286.059,That's correct.
1968.69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,286.059,292.526,"And was the sole ground for that decision, the Norris-LaGuardia Act, do I read that correctly or --"
1968.69,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,292.526,293.931,That's -- that's correct.
1968.69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,303.779,305.803,That was my recollection then I just had before.
1968.69,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,305.803,308.958,There were other contentions raised before the Court of Appeals.
1968.69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,308.958,309.59,Yes.
1968.69,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,309.59,321.282,Specifically the contention that we raised here that this is a case arguably subject to the National Labor Relations Act but the Court did not pass on that.
1968.69,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1013.888,1016.244,Was this case subject to removal?
1968.69,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1016.244,1024.232,It was removed Your Honor to the U.S. District Court where the federal case was pending and was remanded back to the state court.
1968.69,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1024.232,1025.492,On what basis?
1968.69,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1025.492,1030.039,On the basis of lack of jurisdiction.
1968.69,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1030.039,1032.021,You challenged that?
1968.69,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1032.021,1033.568,We had no way to challenge it Your Honor.
1968.69,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1034.724,1035.486,Oh I see.
1968.69,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1035.486,1041.464,And we did seek prohibition against the state court's proceedings and --
1968.69,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1041.464,1044.387,And what was the basis for holding no jurisdiction?
1968.69,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1044.387,1045.805,Excuse me?
1968.69,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1045.805,1050.545,What was the basis for there was lack of jurisdiction?
1968.69,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1050.545,1074.546,"The basis, the contention was that the state court suit was a suit purely to enforce local Florida law and that the federal court even though it had a case involving this identical conduct and in that case allegations concerning the local law were made except that there was no -- no jurisdiction."
1968.69,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1074.546,1081.477,So that federal court decided contrary to what you're urging here is to the applicable law.
1968.69,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1081.477,1086.232,"The -- no, I don't think that the Court necessarily reached the merits of it."
1968.69,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1092.364,1096.102,"So that wasn't a good federal question allegation, I guess you --"
1968.69,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1096.102,1097.414,Excuse me Your Honor?
1968.69,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1097.414,1100.34,It wasn't a good federal question allegation?
1968.69,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1100.34,1126.064,"Well, the complaint that was filed scrupulously stayed away from federal law and the judge McRae who remanded the case from the federal court back to state courts said he could not anticipate federal questions that might be raised in the outset and there is doctrine of cases to that effect which he relied upon."
1968.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1238.915,1248.82,Is there something specific Mr. Rutledge which you say evidences of congressional determination that they shall believe?
1968.69,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1248.82,1250.289,Yes Your Honor.
1968.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1312.457,1313.849,That's what I'm trying to get to.
1968.69,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1324.342,1325.834,"No, no Your Honor."
1968.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1469.412,1473.675,"I gather from what I read this morning, there are corresponding mergers on the union side."
1968.69,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1473.675,1482.875,"That's correct Your Honor, that's correct and as Mr. Justice Frankfurter stated in his descent in the Burley case."
1968.69,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1512.905,1535.3,"But I gather you argue that even if you fail in that argument that nevertheless, sufficiently federal law that Norris-LaGuardia's provision either explicit or the basic ones should be applied to deny state court's any power to issue injunctions in situations."
1968.69,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1535.3,1541.303,That's correct Your Honor.
1968.69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1609.943,1613.952,"Yes, suppose you were also picketing up the whole length of the line of the Florida East Coast --"
1968.69,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1613.952,1616.991,We were picketing South of Jacksonville sir.
1968.69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1616.991,1618.009,All the way along the line?
1968.69,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1618.009,1619.337,That's correct.
1968.69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1619.337,1622.531,And there has been no injunction of that activity?
1968.69,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1622.531,1640.629,"Yes Your Honor, we faced injunctions all up and down the line and we've had litigation which is cited in our brief in which the state courts down in Miami have accepted that this -- that they don't have any jurisdiction but the state court in Jacksonville refused to follow the (Inaudible) of their sister Court."
1968.69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1640.629,1645.512,But that was -- there was no claim of secondary work on --
1968.69,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1645.512,1646.45,"Yes, there was a claim."
1968.69,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1646.45,1647.314,There was?
1968.69,0,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,1647.314,1656.341,"That's in the brand, that's the case cited in our brief, its for Brower County Port Authority versus Order of Railway Telegraphers."
1968.69,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1679.843,1681.158,Mr. Lyons.
1968.69,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,1681.158,1684.377,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2246.333,2252.478,(Inaudible)
1968.69,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,2252.478,2269.191,I suspect not Your Honor but that was the -- we are faced also with the fact that there was no jurisdiction in the federal court as he viewed at that time and that the complaint was brought solely under state law which was the alternate basis.
1968.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2269.191,2277.669,"I thought what was here, what's in question here is the judgment here that we affirm findings of trial court."
1968.69,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,2277.669,2293.408,The judgment was the judgment of the Fifth Circuit to the effect that the preliminary injunction out of the federal court of the District Court had to be reversed because there is no jurisdiction in the federal courts by reason of Norris-LaGuardia.
1968.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2300.591,2301.632,Same facts?
1968.69,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,2301.632,2304.326,"On the same facts, yes Your Honor."
1968.69,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2617.915,2621.238,Has the state passed a law against picketing?
1968.69,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,2621.238,2626.365,There is no general Law against picketing in the state of Florida Your Honor.
1968.69,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2634.894,2639.228,"Well, have they passed one that says they can?"
1968.69,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,2639.228,2640.927,I don't under -- I believe that there's a little --
1968.69,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2640.927,2653.122,"And is there prior to law, I understand you're moving towards the court of the law, is the one which provides that railroads can picket or employees can picket?"
1968.69,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,2653.122,2666.712,There is a little Taft-Hartley Act or there is a State Labor Relations Act in Florida which gives workers the right to engage in concerted activities.
1968.69,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2666.712,2667.847,Picketing?
1968.69,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,2667.847,2669.984,"Yes, it would cover that."
1968.69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2694.628,2697.051,The -- what were the terms of the injunction?
1968.69,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,2700.923,2703.124,"No, there were exemptions."
1968.69,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2776.632,2783.164,Has one of the issues between you and your adversary whether this was secondary picketing?
1968.69,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,2783.164,2786.448,"I think that's an issue, I'm not sure it's a disputative issue."
1968.69,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2934.966,2936.484,What page is that?
1968.69,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,2937.618,2946.825,We quote that on our brief starting at page 45.
1968.69,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2946.825,2955.543,Thank you.
1968.69,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,2955.543,2968.553,"That's precisely at page 48, he said, “we saw no reason to change that situation” Mr. Senator Taft speaking, because there were no abuses which had a reason in connection with the operation of the Railway Labor Act."
1968.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2983.583,2986.702,Recess.
1968.69,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,2989.409,2991.471,Thank you Your Honor.
1968.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3132.598,3141.996,Is this the same as saying -- is it -- are you just saying here in addition that federal law doesn't control?
1968.69,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,3141.996,3152.02,"Yes, this is an additional basis on which it doesn't control the other statutes that the petitioners bring in with on somewhat basis."
1968.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3152.02,3164.89,But couldn't the -- if you maybe right in all those points you just made and the federal law can still control and you still have the question left to what the federal law is.
1968.69,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,3164.89,3165.715,"Well, you would."
1968.69,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3179.251,3191.302,"Well, would you say that -- would say that if the Court decided the federal law does govern in this case that you'd lost the case?"
1968.69,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,3191.302,3200.172,"I wouldn't so submit Your Honor because the -- that would then for one thing throw open this questions, these additional questions."
1968.69,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3232.929,3236.355,Under your third question would be what is the substantive federal law?
1968.69,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,3236.355,3258.449,"Yes, and that could very well be as we contended in the other case where we sought an injunction under the Railway Labor Act and the Interstate Commerce Act that those statutes which are aimed at minimizing the conflict on the railroads and trying to confine industrial disputes."
1968.69,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3519.037,3520.517,Mr. Rutledge.
1968.69,2,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,3520.517,3522.499,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1968.69,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3522.499,3531.657,Would you mind saying a word in response to this last point that counsel has made.
1968.69,2,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,3531.657,3533.601,To the point Your Honor that of the --
1968.69,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3533.601,3534.965,That would --
1968.69,2,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,3534.965,3535.852,That there is no authority --
1968.69,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3535.852,3540.399,-- no man's land with no regulation of any kind.
1968.69,2,37270,neal_p_rutledge,,3540.399,3563.999,"Your Honor, the -- our response to that is that what Congress has deliberately left free to competing economic forces, the states cannot move in an outlaw and as Senator Taft stated and quoted, “there have not been abuses in the railroad industry.”"
