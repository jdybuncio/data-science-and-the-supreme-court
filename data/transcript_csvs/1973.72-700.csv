1973.72-700,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,29.592,"We’ll hear arguments next in Hernandez against Veterans’ Administration, 72-700."
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,42.422,45.183,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.72-700,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,174.118,179.519,What’s the jurisdictional basis of the lawsuit?
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,179.519,199.84,"Well, there were two main jurisdictional bases, the mandamus 38 U.S.C. Section 1651 and excuse me -- and the $10,000 requirement under 1331, 28 U.S.C. 1361 and 1331."
1973.72-700,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,199.84,203.327,And those are both were cited on the line on the complaint?
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,203.327,207.602,"Yes, in both cases."
1973.72-700,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,209.167,212.109,And the relief requested was what?
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,212.109,223.807,"The relief requested was declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and affirmative relief, namely, that they received the benefits."
1973.72-700,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,223.807,224.37,A mandamus?
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,226.452,227.931,Yes.
1973.72-700,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,227.931,230.585,"Where does the complaint appear here in these papers, can you tell?"
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,230.585,241.811,The complaint appears as appendix -- it’s in the record but I am not exactly sure where it is.
1973.72-700,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,241.811,243.842,You don’t know where it is in the papers we have.
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,243.842,255.25,"No, I do not."
1973.72-700,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,487.196,490.478,The statute is that you claim as unconstitutional?
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,490.478,492.622,The Veterans’ Readjustment Benefits Act.
1973.72-700,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,492.622,493.772,Which says what?
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,493.772,503.653,"Which says, that veterans who served more than 180 days on active duty are entitled to veterans’ educational benefits."
1973.72-700,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,503.653,505.207,And you say that’s unconstitutional?
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,505.207,506.298,Yes?
1973.72-700,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,506.298,507.449,Why?
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,507.449,511.864,"Well, I would like to defer that to the Robison case."
1973.72-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,518.36,540.379,"Mr. Curtice, so suppose that your client had sought a benefit and the Veterans’ Administration was denied by the Administrator and then sought to challenge it in the District Court not on the grounds of unconstitutionality of the statute, but on the grounds that the Administrator had unconstitutionally discriminated against him as compared with other similarly situated applicants."
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,544.913,552.309,"Well, previous cases have held that it would not permit such a review and we do not have that question before us at this time."
1973.72-700,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,698.602,702.747,You mean they had a reasonable expectation? Is that the point you’re drawing on the Roth case?
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,702.747,712.426,"Well -- I am not, no not the reasonable expectation because under the statute, it’s clear that they didn’t have a reasonable expectation."
1973.72-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,754.6,758.557,"But that’s a substantive constitutional right you’re talking about there, isn’t it?"
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,758.557,758.712,Yes.
1973.72-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,758.712,763.338,The right to be free from denial of equal protection.
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,788.233,811.14,"I think that the Roth decision should be extended to the extent that covers claims for property interest which but for the constitutional, -- beyond constitutional statute, they would be entitled to receive those benefits."
1973.72-700,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,840.828,847.012,"But where, in your submission is there a right to a hearing, in the agency?"
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,847.012,857.117,"No, in this type of case, the only place where there’d be such a right when you’re challenging the constitutionality would be in federal courts."
1973.72-700,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,857.117,866.137,"That’s a -- in other words, your argument would cover this situation."
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,900.994,904.782,We still have standing to sue because we’re seeking the benefits in question.
1973.72-700,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,904.782,917.105,"Well, I’d be seeking the benefits that are given to mothers with dependent children on the proposition that the statute is unconstitutional because it doesn’t give it to me who is a father with independent children?"
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,917.105,921.909,Well that would get into the question of a legitimate claim of entitlement.
1973.72-700,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,921.909,927.488,"Well, that’s -- I would have a good faith claim."
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,932.051,936.973,I would submit that that is distinguishable.
1973.72-700,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,936.973,938.632,How and why?
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,938.632,944.066,"In our case, we have a legitimate claim of entitlement."
1973.72-700,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,945.425,948.783,"Well, it should be contention too in my lawsuit."
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,948.783,954.518,"Well, I would say then that it would come within that."
1973.72-700,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,955.563,962.679,"That the constitution itself confers jurisdiction upon a District Court and compels the District Court to give me a hearing on that question, is that it?"
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,962.679,964.724,"No, not the constitution."
1973.72-700,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,964.724,968.302,"Well, Roth was a constitutional decision, wasn’t it and you are relying on Roth."
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,968.302,969.533,I’m relying upon Roth but --
1973.72-700,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,969.533,970.912,"Not Roth against the United States, but Roth against the --"
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,970.912,974.904,I’m relying upon the statute itself.
1973.72-700,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,979.234,984.666,"Well, I’d be relying on the legislation that gives aid to mothers with dependent children."
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,984.666,1000.0,"Then under the writ of mandamus statute, we’re submitting that we are entitled to make the claim for benefits on the grounds that the statute is unconstitutional."
1973.72-700,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1000.0,1022.089,"Of course anybody is entitled to make a claim for anything but the question is whether or not there is a duty of the federal court to grant you a hearing on this claim, as against legislation of the Congress that seems on its face at least to say that the decisions of the Veterans’ Administration are unreviewable in these cases."
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,1022.089,1041.685,"Well, we submit in the case, for example, where again the example of the statute, which says that no black was to receive benefits that that would come under the Roth rational."
1973.72-700,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1051.634,1070.461,"Suppose counsel, that a young man had been in the Peace Corps and he made the same claim for educational benefits that your client is making here, and the Veterans’ Administration presumably would deny that claim administratively, wouldn’t they?"
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,1070.461,1070.923,Yes.
1973.72-700,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1070.923,1072.274,Because he’s not a veteran.
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,1072.274,1073.379,Yes.
1973.72-700,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1073.379,1082.643,"Now, isn’t the Veterans’ Administration administratively saying that they have denied this claim for substantially the same reason, that he is not a veteran?"
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,1082.643,1084.621,They have said that but we submit --
1973.72-700,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1084.621,1098.642,"Well but in that sense, procedurally, and set aside the substantive claim, procedurally, he is in the same posture as a Peace Corps -- a former Peace Corps man who wanted veterans’ benefit, isn’t he?"
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,1098.642,1100.68,Yes.
1973.72-700,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1101.925,1103.578,Fine.
1973.72-700,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1103.578,1112.033,"Well maybe, one question here, in your record, I find the complaint from some Peter Miller and Gary Lehn."
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,1112.033,1112.562,Yes.
1973.72-700,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1112.562,1114.156,What’s that done in this record?
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,1114.156,1116.925,There are two cases that were consolidated.
1973.72-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1126.304,1132.085,"Well, isn’t -- Mr. Curtice, isn’t your argument basically a kind of independent of your Roth contention that --"
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,1132.085,1132.627,Yes.
1973.72-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1132.627,1148.307,"-- 1331 confers federal-question jurisdiction, you alleged $10,000 in controversy, you alleged a substantive constitutional claim and that the statute in question deprived your client’s of the equal protection component of their Fifth Amendment due process?"
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,1148.307,1148.627,That’s correct.
1973.72-700,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1148.627,1153.898,"And therefore, the federal court has jurisdiction of the 1331 to at least hear your claim, quite apart from any Roth?"
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,1153.898,1154.593,That’s right.
1973.72-700,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1168.008,1171.599,That would be the same claim again going back to the Peace Corps case.
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,1171.599,1173.277,"Yes, it would."
1973.72-700,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1173.277,1181.131,"The Peace Corps, former Peace Corps man said this is denial of equal protection or otherwise raise a constitutional question."
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,1188.237,1190.261,Yes.
1973.72-700,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1190.261,1193.4,"And you claim -- excuse me, that this is the way I understand it."
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,1198.055,1198.7,That’s right.
1973.72-700,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1199.372,1205.795,"But that if you did construe the statute this way, it would deny you some sort of a constitutional right to a hearing?"
1973.72-700,0,34270,lawrence_l_curtice,,1205.795,1215.27,Right and Mr. Petranker will go into other constitutional problems.
1973.72-700,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1215.27,1222.582,"Mr. Petranker, we have detained your colleague a little longer and we will enlarge your time by three minutes to compensate for that."
1973.72-700,1,32339,jack_r_petranker,,1222.582,1228.456,"Thank you, Your Honor. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1973.72-700,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1302.344,1313.84,"And you say that any time you allege a constitutional claim, the court -- the Federal Court must hear it unless it’s determined that’s insubstantial."
1973.72-700,1,32339,jack_r_petranker,,1324.53,1325.167,That’s correct Your Honor.
1973.72-700,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1326.851,1333.564,And was your complaint also grounded on 28 United States Code Section 1331?
1973.72-700,1,32339,jack_r_petranker,,1333.564,1334.833,"Yes, 1331."
1973.72-700,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1346.693,1347.967,"What Section, declaratory judgment?"
1973.72-700,1,32339,jack_r_petranker,,1347.967,1356.943,"No, the Administrative Procedure Act, Your Honor, which specifies that a person aggrieved by agency action has the right to go into Federal Court to seek relief."
1973.72-700,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1356.943,1358.126,To review again?
1973.72-700,1,32339,jack_r_petranker,,1358.126,1358.314,Yes.
1973.72-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1358.314,1364.333,But doesn’t the Administrative Procedure Act exclude the case where review is precluded by statute?
1973.72-700,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1364.333,1365.489,By its term.
1973.72-700,1,32339,jack_r_petranker,,1365.489,1366.367,That’s correct.
1973.72-700,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1374.82,1384.365,"And on what basis did you under 1331 allege an amount of controversy of more than $10,000 excluding interest and cost?"
1973.72-700,1,32339,jack_r_petranker,,1384.365,1412.804,"Essentially, the value of an education to the individual plaintiffs involved, the benefits that they are seeking would enable them to obtain a college education or higher education, and without those benefits, they might very well not be able to commence or complete a college education and over the course of their lifetimes that certainly would result in an economic deprivation to them in excess of $10,000."
1973.72-700,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1414.853,1416.874,You were in the Hernandez case?
1973.72-700,1,32339,jack_r_petranker,,1416.874,1418.227,"Yes, that’s right."
1973.72-700,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1418.227,1423.306,"Representing Mr. Hernandez, and purportedly all those similarly situated?"
1973.72-700,1,32339,jack_r_petranker,,1423.306,1431.991,"Mr. Hernandez and Thomas Wolf were the two named plaintiffs, and in addition, it was a class action, yes."
1973.72-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1482.264,1487.79,"You say, do you think that’s true if the claim was less than $10,000?"
1973.72-700,1,32339,jack_r_petranker,,1487.79,1496.725,"If there were no other forum, judicial forum, in which that claim could be heard, then I think essentially the same problem would be raised here, yes."
1973.72-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1496.725,1499.676,But you wouldn’t say that it will have to be raisable in the federal court?
1973.72-700,1,32339,jack_r_petranker,,1499.676,1500.51,"No, Your Honor."
1973.72-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1501.598,1504.208,"Well, we have got here the Federal Court."
1973.72-700,1,32339,jack_r_petranker,,1504.208,1510.033,"But under the terms of Section 211 (a), Congress has apparently sought the cutoff review in every Court, Your Honor."
1973.72-700,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1519.118,1522.736,"I know, but a region or any court of the United States."
1973.72-700,1,32339,jack_r_petranker,,1522.736,1525.513,"Well, that term is ambiguous."
1973.72-700,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1540.641,1547.394,"I suppose that the Administrator were sued in state court he could remove to federal court, couldn’t he, under the removal statute?"
1973.72-700,1,32339,jack_r_petranker,,1547.394,1556.463,"There might be a problem there, Your Honor, and that the removal statute would seem to conflict with what the Government says Section 211 (a) is since they contend."
1973.72-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1556.463,1560.665,It wouldn’t be removal if federal court didn’t have jurisdiction in the first place?
1973.72-700,1,32339,jack_r_petranker,,1560.665,1561.595,That’s correct Your Honor.
1973.72-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1584.554,1613.366,"I take it your position is that if 211 said that the United States Courts shall not have jurisdiction of any action challenging the constitutionality of any provision of this statute that you would be arguing that statute is unconstitutional; that provision is unconstitutional itself, barring -- barring those sort of suits in the federal court."
1973.72-700,1,32339,jack_r_petranker,,1613.366,1617.1,"If the state courts were left open, I don’t think there’d be a constitutional problem."
1973.72-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1617.1,1627.699,"Well, then let’s assume that this present section is construable that way?"
1973.72-700,1,32339,jack_r_petranker,,1627.699,1630.56,Then I don’t think -- I suppose I misspoke myself to some extent.
1973.72-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1643.951,1647.365,"Well, one of the issues in the case is, how do you construe this section?"
1973.72-700,1,32339,jack_r_petranker,,1647.365,1647.532,Yes.
1973.72-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1647.532,1653.316,What did Congress intend to preclude litigation about in the federal court?
1973.72-700,1,32339,jack_r_petranker,,1670.888,1675.766,"On the assumption that, that exclusion was intended to apply in federal courts but not in state courts?"
1973.72-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1675.766,1686.9,"Well, it’s not -- it's hard to say about the state courts, but at least, let’s assume we’re clear about Congress’ intention with respect to the federal courts."
1973.72-700,1,32339,jack_r_petranker,,1690.469,1702.884,"Well, the term, Courts of the United States has been construed in other statutes to include courts of the states, so that that in itself, I don’t think is a sufficient indicator."
1973.72-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1849.673,1860.31,Plaintiff -- do you think there’s any difference between asking for a declaratory judgment and an order to an officer to payoff funds of the United States?
1973.72-700,1,32339,jack_r_petranker,,1860.31,1893.601,"Well, in asking for declaratory judgment, the Court does not impose an affirmative duty on Congress or an officer of the United States and it does give Congress the option in this particular Act, for example, if the Court declared that the Veterans’ Readjustment Benefits Act was unconstitutional, Congress would have the option of enacting a new law terminating the law or proceeding to include conscientious objectors within the terms of the Act, so that there is not as direct an interference."
1973.72-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1893.601,1909.445,"So again, I ask you, do you think that in terms of sovereign immunity that there is a difference between asking for an order for benefits as distinguished from the declaration that the statute is unconstitutional?"
1973.72-700,1,32339,jack_r_petranker,,1909.445,1913.505,I think there is that difference to which I just tried to address myself.
1973.72-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1913.505,1923.712,"Well, so do you think if you do ask for an order that actually for an order to pay money that you are barred by sovereign immunity?"
1973.72-700,1,32339,jack_r_petranker,,1923.712,1928.832,If that were the only kind of relief that could satisfy the claims of petitioner --
1973.72-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1928.832,1946.698,"But the veterans are asking in terms of the complaint in this case, to enter an injunction required to seize refusing to grant plaintiff’s benefits?"
1973.72-700,1,32339,jack_r_petranker,,1946.698,1951.399,"Well, I believe that the second paragraph of the prayer for relief does also request declaratory relief."
1973.72-700,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1951.399,1953.118,Is that?
1973.72-700,1,32339,jack_r_petranker,,1953.118,1975.406,"But focusing on the first, there was a suggestion in Larson versus Domestic & Foreign Finance Corporation that even in the case involving an allegation of unconstitutionality where affirmative relief would be required in order to effectuate an order of the Court, that sovereign immunity might operate as a bar."
1973.72-700,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2032.994,2037.788,Thank you Mr. Petranker.
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2050.4,2054.273,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1973.72-700,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2420.391,2422.264,What about -- go ahead.
1973.72-700,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2422.264,2431.216,"Is there anything in the legislative history that gave to the Veterans’ Administration the right to determine constitutional questions, finally?"
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2431.216,2433.707,There is not.
1973.72-700,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2434.718,2438.646,"Well, isn’t that this case?"
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2438.646,2445.526,I would not say that is this case because the -- well before we contend that the VA has decided the constitutional question --
1973.72-700,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2445.526,2453.467,"Well, suppose the VA decided that nobody who didn’t go overseas shouldn’t feel to like -- how would you touch that?"
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2453.467,2453.861,I am sorry.
1973.72-700,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2454.551,2462.31,"The VA says, you can’t get veterans’ benefits because you didn’t go overseas, you stayed and can’t meet."
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2463.491,2466.438,"Well, under the statute that makes that distinction or on --"
1973.72-700,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2466.438,2468.997,"No, no under this present statute."
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2468.997,2469.725,"Well, the --"
1973.72-700,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2469.725,2471.007,How would you get to that?
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2471.007,2490.866,"The cases construing the present statute in Roth against United States in the Ninth Circuit is an example, say that 211 precludes review of any decision even where it is claimed that the Administrator committed an error of law or if constitutional dimension in applying the statute."
1973.72-700,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2490.866,2493.709,Roth said constitutional dimension?
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2493.709,2507.836,It was claimed in the Roth case that the decision of the Administrator was based on either a lack of evidence or in which the claim was treated resulted in a denial of due process to the claimant.
1973.72-700,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2507.836,2513.34,"And because of the treatment of the evidence, the factual evidence?"
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2513.34,2514.703,"Well, that is the nature of that case."
1973.72-700,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2514.703,2516.758,"Well, that’s not a constitutional point."
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2516.758,2521.721,"Well, that was the allegation and the Court said even without allegation of the denial of the --"
1973.72-700,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2521.721,2532.246,"So in this case, if the Administrator just deliberately violates the Constitution of the United States, he is the only man in the Government who goes cut free?"
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2532.246,2551.245,There’s nothing in the terms of 211 that makes any exception for that situation and the observation of the Court in the Lynch case where they said that the similar statute eliminated review of an arbitrary decision by the Administrator would lead in that direction.
1973.72-700,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2551.245,2555.561,Lynch said it ain’t constitutional; it’s an arbitrary.
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2555.561,2572.431,"Well, I think you can enlarge measure or acquaint that to because of the way that the question of due process has developed to the often interchangeable with arbitrary action."
1973.72-700,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2606.972,2627.817,"Mr. Norton, what if the petitioners here instead of having presented a claim to the Administrator, had simply gone into the District Court under 1331 and 1361 and challenged the constitutionality of the statute, could the Government have asserted the provision of 211 (a) as a defense to that action?"
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,2627.817,2645.123,"Well, 211 (a) would not seem to apply on its face because it would not be -- if the Administrator have taken no action whatever on this issue, it would not seem that there would be a decision of the Administrator under review."
1973.72-700,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2997.309,3003.076,But what if there was no request for an injunction of any kind?
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3003.076,3008.812,"Well, in the Larson case, I assume you made just a declaratory judgment request?"
1973.72-700,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3008.812,3010.872,"Yes, against only the officials."
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3010.872,3022.923,"In the Larson case, the Court indicated that even if only declaratory relief had been sought, there would still be a sovereign immunity problem."
1973.72-700,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3042.054,3050.433,"This would be an interesting decision in the light of some of the welfare cases, wouldn’t it?"
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3050.433,3068.057,"Well, I would not attempt here to try to square those cases with all of the sovereign immunity doctrine which the Court has recognized as not an area of perfect logical symmetry."
1973.72-700,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3108.133,3114.766,"Well, that if we go with you on the sovereign immunity, we don’t need to bother with 211 then, do we?"
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3119.202,3121.315,If the Court will hold the sovereign immunity --
1973.72-700,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3121.315,3127.391,"If sovereign immunity is a good defense, you don’t need 211. So Congress has wasted its time."
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3127.391,3136.955,"Well, I wouldn’t say the Congress has wasted its time because there maybe suits that would be subject to 211 that would not necessary be subject to the sovereign immunity doctrine."
1973.72-700,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3221.623,3237.867,"Well, the ultimate question in this Ninth Circuit case, if we come to the merits at all, is not the constitutionality fell on the Act, but whether the question that’s constitutional is sufficiently substantial to warrant the convening of the three-judge court, isn’t it?"
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3237.867,3263.907,"Well, yes, that’s exactly my next point that the alternative or the second point decided by the District Court in Hernandez was that after holding that 211 barred jurisdiction, the Court also denied the request for a three-judge court holding that no substantial constitutional question had been raised."
1973.72-700,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3354.71,3367.299,I take it you agree with Mr. Curtice’s response to the hypothetical question I gave about the Peace Corps Veteran who came in and made the same claim that’s being made here.
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3376.866,3379.868,"Yes, I think that is precisely what happened in this case."
1973.72-700,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3379.868,3395.833,"Well, and you think that’s true here too, but that’s because you think both cases attend to equate to each other that is the Peace Corps Veteran and the petitioners here?"
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3395.833,3417.167,"That’s true, we would say that there is no greater constitutional question presented there than here, and in either case, the District Court could properly dismiss both for lack of jurisdiction and the lack of a need to convene a three-judge court because of the insubstantiality of the question presented."
1973.72-700,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3418.104,3425.482,"Well, that would, of course, the dismissal was squarely, as I understand it upon the basis of Section 211 (a), wasn’t it?"
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3425.482,3427.895,That’s correct.
1973.72-700,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3427.895,3448.697,"We have a footnote in the Court of Appeals’ Per Curiam affirmance that there might be something so egregiously unconstitutional that the constitutionality of 211 (a) itself might have to be reconsidered but this dismissal wasn’t on the basis that it was an insubstantial question, was it?"
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3448.697,3453.554,"Well, the District Judge denied a request for a three-judge court, but then --"
1973.72-700,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3453.554,3455.409,Right.
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3457.609,3461.686,"No, because you said there were no substantial constitutional questions presented."
1973.72-700,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3466.964,3488.773,"I have, as you know, there’s no appendix in this case and I have before me, except for the Page 16 of the petition for writ of certiorari the Court of Appeals characterization of what the District Court did saying the District Court dismissed the plaintiff’s complaint for lack of jurisdiction under 211 (a)."
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3488.773,3493.052,"Well, that is true, but the Court also denied the request for a three-judge Court."
1973.72-700,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3493.228,3497.744,"This can be any court that 211 (a) is valid, couldn’t it, could there?"
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3504.826,3520.462,"Well, that is true, and we’re not saying that he had to convene a three-judge court to determine whether he could dismiss under 211, he may have felt that it was appropriate to consider both of those issues in order to make his dismissal proper as a single judge."
1973.72-700,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3520.462,3529.171,"I take it, what you’re referring to is the 339 Fed. Supp. Xerox in the very back of the petition, which has Judge Carter’s opinion."
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3529.171,3531.841,That’s right.
1973.72-700,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3531.841,3534.542,"Well, conceivably to -- Excuse me."
1973.72-700,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3534.542,3536.893,Excuse me.
1973.72-700,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3536.893,3577.315,"Justice Marshall put a question to you or perhaps to one of your friends awhile ago, saying that if the Veterans’ Administration can find educational benefits to those veterans who had served overseas that that might conceivably raise a constitutional question and the three-judge court or a single district judge might conceivably, I take it, decided to call or convene a three-judge court for that purpose, you would not agree with it perhaps?"
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3607.284,3619.939,"Well, we say that 211 bars any review of a decision of the Administrator and on 211 alone, the District Court properly dismissed the case."
1973.72-700,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3642.241,3661.796,"Let’s take an extreme case then, that the Veterans’ Administration Administrator decides that because of the shortage of funds, rate inflation, and a lot of factors, he is not going to pay any education benefits to anyone."
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3672.352,3689.019,"Well, we believe that 211 supersedes whatever jurisdiction is otherwise available under one of the general jurisdictional statutes whether it be 1361 the mandamus statute or 1331 the General Federal Question Statute."
1973.72-700,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3689.019,3695.483,"I suppose you might also answer that the same for the Veterans’ Administration did that, he would be fired by the President throughout --"
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3695.483,3696.798,"Well, exactly there are --"
1973.72-700,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3696.798,3700.863,-- a follow up to Congress and the problem would solve itself politically.
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3700.863,3703.623,There are other remedies and restrains on --
1973.72-700,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3703.623,3707.545,But you’re saying that there is only a political remedy on that situation.
1973.72-700,2,25838,gerald_p_norton,,3707.545,3713.178,Under 211.
1973.72-700,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3713.178,3713.787,Thank you gentlemen.
