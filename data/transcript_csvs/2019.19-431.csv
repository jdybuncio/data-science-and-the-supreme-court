2019.19-431,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,13.28,"We will hear argument first this morning in Case Number 19-431, Little Sisters of the Poor versus Pennsylvania, and the consolidated case. General Francisco."
2019.19-431,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,13.28,28.76,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In 2011, the government required employers to provide insurance coverage for all FDA-approved contraception, including many religious employers who objected to the coverage, sparking years of litigation."
2019.19-431,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,137.44,138.84,"General, before you --"
2019.19-431,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,138.84,141.0,"And, here, HRSA --"
2019.19-431,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,141.0,145.36,"-- before you get to that, I'd like to ask you a question on your RFRA point."
2019.19-431,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,176.96,191.52,"I don't think so, Your Honor, for a couple of different reasons. First, RFRA itself, in its operative language, prohibits the government from imposing a substantial burden subject to a single exception."
2019.19-431,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,228.52,229.36,Thank you.
2019.19-431,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,229.36,229.96,"But, secondly, even if the --"
2019.19-431,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,229.96,249.2,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas."
2019.19-431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,254.32,322.4,"The glaring feature of what the government has done in expanding this exemption is to toss to the winds entirely Congress's instruction that women need and shall have seamless, no-cost, comprehensive coverage. Seamless, no-cost, comprehensive coverage. This leaves the women to hunt for other government programs that might cover them, and for those who are not covered by Medicaid or one of the other government programs, they can get contraceptive coverage only from paying out of their own pocket, which is exactly what Congress didn't want to happen. And in this area of religious freedom, the major trend is not to give everything to one side and nothing to the other side."
2019.19-431,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,460.2,465.88,"General Francisco, could you respond?"
2019.19-431,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,465.88,478.68,"Yes. Respectfully, Your Honor, I think I would disagree with the premise of your question because there's nothing in the ACA, as this Court recognized in Hobby Lobby, that requires contraceptive coverage."
2019.19-431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,502.8,503.56,The church itself --
2019.19-431,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,503.56,505.2,But even putting that --
2019.19-431,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,505.2,513.2,"-- the church itself has enjoyed traditionally an exception from the very first case, the McClure case in the Fifth -- Fifth Circuit."
2019.19-431,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,534.28,539.0,"Brief -- briefly, General Francisco?"
2019.19-431,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,539.0,545.76,"Yes, Your Honor. Respectfully, the church exemption and the effective exemption for self-insured church plans read much more broadly."
2019.19-431,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,565.72,568.84,Thank you. Justice Thomas? I think you're back.
2019.19-431,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,568.84,605.56,"General Francisco, a quick question about HRSA's broad authority. You seem to, as you did in your past -- your last answer, suggest that HCRA has almost unlimited authority to both create guidelines and exceptions from those guidelines. First, if you would give us just an idea of what standards are to guide that -- their discretion and -- and the services that are provided, as well as the exemptions that are offered by the guidelines."
2019.19-431,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,605.56,608.92,"Yes, Your Honor. I think there are three limitations that I would point to."
2019.19-431,0,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,673.32,677.12,At what point do you run into a non-delegation problem?
2019.19-431,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,677.12,682.6,"Your Honor, I don't think we have a non-delegation problem at all here for the reasons we've said."
2019.19-431,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,727.56,732.52,"Thank you, General. Justice Breyer?"
2019.19-431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,732.52,733.88,"Good morning, General."
2019.19-431,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,754.6,806.64,"Your Honor, the only thing I would add is that I think all of these limitations would fully make sure that any time that HRSA's exercising its discretion, it's doing so in a rational way. After all, this is the very same discretion that was used not just to adopt the church exemption but also the effective exemption for self-insured church plans, and, under Respondents' understanding of the accommodation, even the accommodation itself, since, in each one of those three instances, the employers' benefits plan is not providing the mandated coverage and, in two of them, nobody is providing the mandated coverage. And so, if you concluded that the agencies didn't have this discretion, that would undermine the validity of the church exemption, the effective exemption for self-insured church plans, and potentially the accommodation more broadly."
2019.19-431,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,806.64,806.8,Thank you.
2019.19-431,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,806.8,812.08,Justice Alito?
2019.19-431,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,812.08,834.24,"General, what factors, other than medical need, can HRSA or could HRSA take into account in deciding which preventive services and the degree to which preventive services would have to be covered by an insurance plan? For example, could it take cost into account?"
2019.19-431,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,834.24,853.92,"Well, Your Honor, if it took cost into account, I think that the question -- the first question would be whether the manner in which it took cost into account satisfied the arbitrary and capricious standard. And I certainly do think that they could take cost into account in deciding what types of preventative services to require."
2019.19-431,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,881.0,901.36,"This broad issue has been before this Court on a number of prior occasions, and until this case, I hadn't seen the argument that the Affordable Care Act did not allow HRSA to make any exceptions based on conscientious objection."
2019.19-431,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,905.44,910.04,"To my knowledge, Your Honor, it first surfaced in this litigation."
2019.19-431,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,952.64,954.16,Thank you.
2019.19-431,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,954.16,958.68,"Thank you, General. Justice Sotomayor?"
2019.19-431,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,958.68,977.64,"General, first of all, you keep calling it a small number of women who won't get coverage, but I understand the figure to be between -- somewhere between 75 -- 750,000 -- 75,000 and 125,000 women, correct?"
2019.19-431,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,977.64,1005.84,"Well, Your Honor, yes, that's the number that would be affected by the exemptions as compared to the original church exemption and effective exemptions that cover -- that affected around 30,000 women. But I would note that in this particular litigation, the Respondents haven't yet identified anyone who would actually lose access to contraception as a result of these rules, I think presumably because contraception -- access to contraception is widely available in this country through many other means --"
2019.19-431,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1005.84,1007.2,"Well, General, let's -- let's --"
2019.19-431,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1007.2,1008.08,-- besides forcing --
2019.19-431,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1008.08,1026.72,-- let's go there. HHS decided that contraceptives were a preventive service required under the Act. Now you say it has to take care to both promulgate the Act and accommodate religious objections.
2019.19-431,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1066.0,1067.84,"So, Your Honor, two points."
2019.19-431,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1117.84,1118.68,One last --
2019.19-431,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1118.68,1120.52,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Kagan?"
2019.19-431,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1120.52,1123.52,"Thank you. Good morning, General."
2019.19-431,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1125.2,1125.88,"Good morning, Your Honor."
2019.19-431,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1125.88,1132.6,"-- the Chief Justice's first question, which was about whether this rule sweeps too broadly."
2019.19-431,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1181.76,1184.68,"No, Your Honor, for two reasons."
2019.19-431,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1219.08,1220.84,"I mean, do you have --"
2019.19-431,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1220.84,1222.72,-- would add if there were --
2019.19-431,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1222.72,1245.84,"-- do you have any evidence that the current exemption is being taken -- availed -- that only employers of the Little Sister kind who have complicity objections are now taking advantage of the exemption? I would think that there would be a lot of employers who would say, you know, we don't have those complicity beliefs, but now that they're giving us an option, sure, we'll take it."
2019.19-431,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1245.84,1261.48,"Your Honor, I respectfully think that that would be irrational, given that employers would then be depriving their employees of a valuable benefit that doesn't cost them anything, because it doesn't cost any money to add contraceptive coverage to an insurance plan."
2019.19-431,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1264.0,1264.68,But why couldn't --
2019.19-431,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1264.68,1265.0,So the only --
2019.19-431,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1265.0,1279.0,"-- you just have -- why couldn't you just have written the rule to cover only those who have objections to the existing accommodation? In other words, those who have these complicity-based beliefs that the Little Sisters have?"
2019.19-431,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1279.0,1291.24,"Well, because, Your Honor, I think, here, there's no reason to think anybody would do what you're suggesting. And the original burden stems from the contraceptive mandate itself."
2019.19-431,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1306.52,1309.44,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Gorsuch?"
2019.19-431,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1309.44,1313.92,"General, if you just continue, I'd like to hear the rest of your answer."
2019.19-431,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1313.92,1314.44,Sure.
2019.19-431,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1382.36,1387.12,"Thank you, General."
2019.19-431,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1387.12,1389.48,Justice Kavanaugh?
2019.19-431,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1389.48,1392.36,"Thank you, Chief Justice. Good morning, General Francisco."
2019.19-431,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1392.36,1393.4,"Good morning, Your Honor."
2019.19-431,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1393.4,1414.72,"Your colleague on the other side says the text and structure of the ACA make plain that Congress delegated HRSA authority to oversee guidelines defining what preventive services for women must be covered, not who must cover them. Can you respond to that argument?"
2019.19-431,0,37093,noel_j_francisco,,1414.72,1418.8,"Yes, Your Honor. Respectfully, that is not what the ACA says."
2019.19-431,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1457.32,1460.88,"Thank you, General."
2019.19-431,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1460.88,1469.52,Mr. Clement?
2019.19-431,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1469.52,1494.88,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: From the very beginning, the government recognized that its contraceptive mandate implicated deeply-held religious beliefs, and so it exempted churches and some religious orders. And Congress recognized that the mandate was not some sort of categorical imperative that demanded universal compliance, and so it exempted tens of millions of employees under grandfathered plans."
2019.19-431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1610.44,1619.36,"Mr. Clement, your client, the Little Sisters, do not object to their employees having coverage for contraceptive services, right?"
2019.19-431,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1619.36,1627.32,"They -- no, the Little Sisters don't have any objection if their employees receive those services from some other means."
2019.19-431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1635.72,1672.52,"So, if you have a situation where the certification was not necessary, in other words, the government -- the government finds out that the employees do not have contraceptive coverage through some other means, and you do not have the hijacking problem that you referred to because the insurance coverer would not provide the services through the Little Sisters' plan but could provide them directly to the employees, then why isn't that sort of accommodation sufficient? I -- I didn't understand the problem at the time of Zubik, and I'm not sure I understand it now."
2019.19-431,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1672.52,1707.04,"Well, I don't think we would have an objection to simply objecting to the government and then, if the government has some way to provide the contraception services independently of us and our plans, we've never had an objection to that. But the government has insisted throughout this whole process that we not just be able to have an opt-out form, an objection form, but that that same form serve as a permission slip to allow the government to track down PPAs and others to provide services through our plans."
2019.19-431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1715.16,1719.96,"Well, the problem is that neither side in this debate wants the accommodation to work."
2019.19-431,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1736.24,1764.0,"I -- Mr. Chief Justice, in the wake of the Zubik remand order, there was a lot of back and forth between the religious objector -- objectors and the government, and I don't think that there really was a mechanism to find sort of some third way because the government has always insisted on seamless coverage, with seamless, essentially, being a synonym through -- for through the Little Sisters' plans."
2019.19-431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1764.0,1766.56,"Thank you, counsel."
2019.19-431,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1766.56,1768.84,And as long as they insisted on --
2019.19-431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1768.84,1769.16,Justice Thomas?
2019.19-431,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,1769.16,1790.24,"Thank you, Chief Justice. Mr. Clement, the -- the -- I'd like you to have an opportunity to comment on the questionable standing of the states in this case, as well as the proliferation of national -- nationwide injunctions, such as the one in this case."
2019.19-431,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1790.24,1791.92,"Certainly, Justice Thomas."
2019.19-431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1924.68,1927.92,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Ginsburg?"
2019.19-431,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1927.92,1932.96,I would ask Mr. Clement the same question I asked the government.
2019.19-431,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1996.08,2063.8,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I would -- I would say two things in response. First, I would echo what the Solicitor General said in pointing out that Congress itself did not even specify that contraceptions would be included in the preventative health mandate. And Congress went further and said with respect to grandfathered plans, that there were other mandates in the Affordable Care Act, like coverage for people up to age 26 and preexisting conditions, that they were going to impose even on grandfathered plans, but they didn't impose the preventative mandate. So Congress itself recognized that tens of millions of employees could be in the same position as employees of the Little Sisters of the Poor even though there's no religious objection there whatsoever. And I think the clear teaching of RFRA is that when you're going to give those kind of exceptions to people for secular reasons, then you need to give those kind of exceptions to religious believers."
2019.19-431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2064.88,2066.36,"Thank you, counsel. Justice -- Justice Breyer?"
2019.19-431,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2066.36,2087.44,"I have two reactions. One, of course, is that the point of the religious clauses is to try to work out accommodations, because they can be some of the most difficult to resolve disputes and they can substitute a kind of hostility for harmony. So, from that point of view, I really repeat, if there's anything you want to add, the Chief Justice's question."
2019.19-431,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2148.24,2155.56,"So, Justice Breyer, I think you're absolutely right that that is not the nature of the objection that's been raised by the other side."
2019.19-431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2210.8,2213.4,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Alito?"
2019.19-431,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2213.4,2227.56,"Mr. Clement, I certainly agree with my colleagues that our best tradition in this area is to accommodate diverse religious views."
2019.19-431,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2280.4,2290.0,"So, Justice Alito, on both questions, first, the Little Sisters believe that complying with this mandate is simply inconsistent with their faith."
2019.19-431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2400.0,2405.001,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Sotomayor?"
2019.19-431,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2405.001,2424.0,"Mr. Clement, assume that the government tomorrow passes a law that says every insurance company must reimburse every policyholder they have for COVID-19 vaccine."
2019.19-431,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2453.0,2458.0,"So, Justice Sotomayor, I think the answer is no, and if -- I'd like to explain kind of how I would work through that."
2019.19-431,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2458.0,2488.0,"Mr. Clement, exactly the same rules that apply here to contraceptives, meaning all they have to do is tell the government that they object to vaccines -- and, by the way, we both know there are religious objectors who object to vaccines -- and that they don't want their plans to be complicit in providing vaccines."
2019.19-431,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2488.0,2489.0,"So, Justice Sotomayor --"
2019.19-431,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2489.0,2494.0,Provided for --
2019.19-431,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2494.0,2499.0,"-- I -- I wanted to elaborate on my answer and kind of explain, you know, how the hypo is a little bit different than the way things work."
2019.19-431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2544.0,2547.0,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Kagan?"
2019.19-431,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2547.0,2549.0,"Good morning, Mr. Clement."
2019.19-431,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2591.0,2629.0,"So, Justice Kagan, I think it would depend on additional factors like whether the government enforced its requirement of an objection with the same massive penalties we have here. If they did, then I think the way to think about that particular sort of objection would be that if that objection is sort of for -- if an objection is forbidden by the person's religious beliefs, sincerely held, and the government enforces with a massive penalty, then there is a substantial burden. And then the analysis would shift to the compelling interest, least restrictive alternatives test."
2019.19-431,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2651.0,2652.0," Right, but that would suggest --"
2019.19-431,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2652.0,2653.0,-- exempt --
2019.19-431,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2653.0,2661.0,"-- that even in that case where objecting to objecting is the only thing, that you would think that the employer would prevail?"
2019.19-431,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2661.0,2662.0,I think the employer --
2019.19-431,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2662.0,2663.44,"You know, I guess that --"
2019.19-431,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2663.44,2664.0,44:23-- would have a --
2019.19-431,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2664.0,2676.0,"-- would make all the same arguments, right, you know, that women can get contraceptive coverage elsewhere and there are other exemptions to this scheme, so the employer would prevail even if it were only objecting to objecting?"
2019.19-431,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2676.0,2683.0,"I think that's right, Justice Kagan, but just to be clear, I think that has to do with the way that the government has operated this whole program."
2019.19-431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2695.0,2697.0,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Gorsuch?"
2019.19-431,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2697.0,2700.0,-- my client has never made that objection.
2019.19-431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2700.0,2703.0,Justice Gorsuch?
2019.19-431,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2703.0,2718.0,"Mr. Clement, a major feature of the opinion below and the arguments in the briefs at least was that the government had failed to comply with the procedural requirements of the APA. And I -- I -- I -- I didn't want that major component of the case to go unaddressed today."
2019.19-431,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2721.0,2722.0,"Thank you, Justice Gorsuch."
2019.19-431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2843.0,2844.0,"Thank you, counsel."
2019.19-431,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2844.0,2846.0,I could be --
2019.19-431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2846.0,2847.0,Justice -- Justice Kavanaugh?
2019.19-431,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2847.0,2850.0,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Good morning, Mr. Clement."
2019.19-431,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2882.0,2885.0,"I -- I -- I think, Justice Kavanaugh, that's exactly where it would be litigated."
2019.19-431,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2931.0,2932.0,Right.
2019.19-431,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,2955.0,2961.0,So I would identify all of the limits that General Francisco alluded to and one more.
2019.19-431,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3021.0,3030.0,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Fischer."
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,3030.0,3038.0,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The moral and religious exemption rules rest on three sweeping assertions of agency authority."
2019.19-431,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3173.0,3175.0,"Thank you, counsel."
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,3239.0,3240.0,"Yes, Your Honor."
2019.19-431,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3240.0,3243.0,-- what -- what's your answer do that?
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,3243.0,3249.0,"Mr. Chief Justice, our answer is that that is the only reasonable reading of the text of the Women's Health Amendment."
2019.19-431,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3328.0,3331.0,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas?"
2019.19-431,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3331.0,3338.0,"General, just a brief question that's a little different. I'm interested in your view on standing."
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,3387.0,3393.0,"Thank you, Your Honor. And to -- to be clear, we have to satisfy standing requirements just as any other litigant has to show standing."
2019.19-431,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3508.0,3509.0,Thank --
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,3509.0,3511.0,And --
2019.19-431,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3511.0,3512.0,-- you.
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,3522.0,3525.0,"I don't believe that's the case, Your Honor."
2019.19-431,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3568.0,3569.0,I don't mean to cut you off --
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,3569.0,3570.0,-- is what --
2019.19-431,2,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3570.0,3580.0,"-- but one -- I do want to get in one question about when the APA was adopted, do you think there were such things as nationwide injunctions, or were they handled on a case-by-case basis?"
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,3580.0,3585.0,"Your Honor, I believe there is a history, certainly, of relief going beyond -- beyond the parties to a case."
2019.19-431,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3647.0,3648.0,Thank you --
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,3648.0,3649.0,"So I think, here, the text --"
2019.19-431,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3649.0,3657.0,-- counsel. Justice Ginsburg?
2019.19-431,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3657.0,3659.0,Let's see.
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,3705.0,3706.0,"Your Honor, that is absolutely correct."
2019.19-431,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3771.0,3772.0,Where is the --
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,3772.0,3773.0,-- to publicly traded --
2019.19-431,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3773.0,3777.0,-- where is the moral -- where would the moral exemption come from? That doesn't seem to come from --
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,3777.0,3782.0,So it -- it does not -- they do not rely on RFRA for the moral exemption.
2019.19-431,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3851.0,3853.0,Justice Breyer?
2019.19-431,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3853.0,3856.0,Two related questions.
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,3957.0,3958.0,"So, Your Honor, I -- I don't disagree with any of that."
2019.19-431,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4083.0,4084.0,Thank you.
2019.19-431,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4087.0,4089.0,Justice Alito?
2019.19-431,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4089.0,4111.0,"Mr. Fischer, you say that the Affordable Care Act does not allow the government to make any exceptions to the contraceptive mandate to accommodate religious objections. Now, if that's true, the original exemption for churches, their auxiliaries, and conventions of churches, which was established by the prior administration, violated the Affordable Care Act."
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4167.0,4181.0,"Your Honor, we would not agree with that conclusion that individuals in entirely secular positions are exempt from all those requirements under the church autonomy doctrine. What we have argued is that --"
2019.19-431,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4181.0,4193.0,"I don't mean to interrupt you, but you do say that it would violate the First Amendment to require the church to provide contraceptive coverage for that woman?"
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4193.0,4209.0,"Your Honor, what we are arguing is that there is a basis in the First Amendment for exempting churches in some way, that, certainly, there is a core of church autonomy that -- that agencies in implementing federal law must protect."
2019.19-431,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4209.0,4214.0,"Well, in some way as to the provision of insurance coverage for contraceptives."
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4223.0,4226.0,"Certainly, as to -- as to ministers, certainly."
2019.19-431,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4226.0,4227.0,Pardon me? Do I -- I hadn't finished what I wanted --
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4227.0,4229.0,"As to ministers, certainly."
2019.19-431,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4238.0,4241.0,"Mr. Fischer, I'm not talking about the details."
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4263.0,4265.0,That is not our position.
2019.19-431,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4276.0,4277.0,All right.
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4294.0,4299.0,"Certainly, in a core -- in the core ministerial functions, it does."
2019.19-431,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4303.0,4304.0,I'm not talking about a minister.
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4307.0,4308.0,Exactly.
2019.19-431,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4354.0,4956.0,If I could ask one other question.
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4367.0,4368.0,So the --
2019.19-431,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4368.0,4382.0,"Hobby Lobby held that if a person sincerely believes that it is immoral to perform an act that has the effect of enabling another person to commit an immoral act, a federal court does not have the right to say that this person is wrong on the question of moral complicity."
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4395.0,4403.0,"So, in Hobby Lobby, the question was essentially the degree of attenuation between providing coverage and utilizing the contraceptive care."
2019.19-431,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4477.0,4478.0,But you're -- you're arguing that --
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4478.0,4479.0,-- because it was --
2019.19-431,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4479.0,4489.0,-- the Little Sisters didn't understand what the law required them to do or didn't understand the significance of what the law required them to do?
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4489.0,4490.0,Not at all.
2019.19-431,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4493.0,4498.0,Which of those -- which of those things is it? They didn't understand what the law required them to do?
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4498.0,4499.44,"No, we're not saying that at all."
2019.19-431,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4504.28,4510.44,You're saying they're wrong in their -- their understanding of moral complicity is wrong?
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4510.44,4511.48,"No, we're not saying that at all."
2019.19-431,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4534.84,4538.88,"Thank you, counsel. Justice Sotomayor?"
2019.19-431,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4538.88,4555.88,"Counsel, going back to the Chief Justice's example a second, clearly, we understand that there's inherent power to share the chores between the two children, correct? However --"
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4555.88,4557.6,"Yes, I think --"
2019.19-431,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4557.6,4569.48,"-- if the baby-sitter decides, ahh, I just disagree with the mom, I'm not going to have either of them do anything, would that be contrary to the instructions that the law gave?"
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4569.48,4571.68,"That -- that certainly would be, Your Honor."
2019.19-431,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4571.68,4572.32,All right.
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4572.32,4574.32,I would agree with that.
2019.19-431,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4574.32,4578.84,So let's talk about this situation.
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4614.68,4616.84,So that is correct as a general matter.
2019.19-431,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4642.56,4643.0,"Oh, oh --"
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4643.0,4645.16,-- them to provide coverage --
2019.19-431,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4645.16,4645.76,-- that -- that -- that's an interesting point.
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4650.64,4655.52,"Well, that is why we argued -- that's why we argued that they lacked appellate standing, and the Third Circuit agreed."
2019.19-431,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4655.52,4663.08,"They -- they lack appellate standing because they don't have to provide it; neither does their insurance carrier, correct?"
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4663.08,4665.28,"That's correct, yes. And as --"
2019.19-431,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4665.28,4665.52,And that --
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4665.52,4666.36,-- a result of the injunction.
2019.19-431,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4666.36,4673.36,"-- has nothing -- that has nothing to do with this case, as I understood it -- well, no, that has to do with the church exemption."
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4684.48,4694.6,"So where -- where the employer utilizes the accommodation, the government lacks a means of enforcing the requirements against church plans because they are exempt from ERISA."
2019.19-431,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4703.52,4703.88,All right.
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4713.92,4741.6,"So we -- we think the government's claims of authority for the exemptions were incorrect, but we -- we think that the most egregious parts of the rules are, first of all, the moral rule, which I -- I think is important to stress, that that's half of what's at issue in this case; the elimination of the accommodation as a mandatory requirement, including for companies that have no problem with it; the inclusion of publicly traded companies and large universities. And then two other points."
2019.19-431,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4809.68,4813.44,So if --
2019.19-431,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4813.44,4814.52,Thank you --
2019.19-431,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4814.52,4814.76,Sorry.
2019.19-431,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4814.76,4817.04,"Justice Sotomayor, proceed."
2019.19-431,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4817.04,4830.6,"I guess the question I have is, the exemption as structured permits the insurance carriers not to provide coverage?"
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4830.6,4831.0,Yes.
2019.19-431,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4849.2,4849.72,And that is --
2019.19-431,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4849.72,4857.96,"Thank you, counsel -- thank you, counsel. Justice Kagan?"
2019.19-431,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4857.96,4859.92,"Good morning, Mr. Fischer."
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4861.04,4861.4,"Good morning, Your Honor."
2019.19-431,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4861.4,4901.32,"-- a few questions about what many people will think of as the most boring part of your argument, which is APA notice and comment, because I'm not quite sure I understand the argument, so let me just start by saying what you're doing is you're hypothesizing that there should be some significant difference between what happens and how a court reviews what happens when an agency works off of an interim final rule as opposed to when an agency works off a notice of proposed rulemaking. And I -- I guess the question is, why should there be any real difference between those two?"
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4901.32,4910.4,"So, Your Honor, I want to stress one aspect of our argument, which is that our argument hinges on whether the first rules, the 2017 rules, were themselves procedurally valid."
2019.19-431,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4915.24,4915.68,Okay.
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4916.28,4916.64,So --
2019.19-431,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4916.64,4923.0,-- but let me just make sure I understand it. Suppose that there were good cause for issuing an interim final rule.
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4943.36,4949.88,"Your Honor, if the agency has good cause to issue the rule with immediate effect, then the provisions of Section 553 simply don't apply."
2019.19-431,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4949.88,4951.0,"No, that's not right."
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4951.0,4952.2,And they're actually not --
2019.19-431,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4952.2,4962.28,"I don't think that's right because the good cause can give you cause to act right now, but it -- it doesn't give you cause to act for 20 years without notice and comment."
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4976.28,4977.12,"That's certainly true, Your Honor."
2019.19-431,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4991.6,4992.04,Okay.
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,4996.64,4997.04,That's right.
2019.19-431,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4997.04,4999.04,-- good cause doesn't last forever.
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,5012.04,5012.32,"No, Your Honor."
2019.19-431,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,5016.32,5018.48,Okay.
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,5048.8,5049.36,It -- it does.
2019.19-431,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,5081.12,5082.52,And so --
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,5082.52,5083.56,-- and comment.
2019.19-431,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,5083.56,5084.04,Okay.
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,5092.0,5093.32,"Yes, absolutely."
2019.19-431,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,5093.32,5093.68,Okay.
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,5106.96,5110.2,So there are a number of rules that have been implemented dealing with this.
2019.19-431,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,5204.8,5208.84,"Thank you, counsel."
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,5208.84,5210.48,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2019.19-431,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5210.48,5211.72,Justice -- Justice Gorsuch?
2019.19-431,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,5211.72,5212.64,"Good morning, counsel."
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,5298.76,5317.12,"So, yes, Your Honor, I think, if -- if the delegation is read the way the agencies would like to read it, then it is remarkably broad and I think would, frankly, raise non-delegation problems. I think the delegation is cabined by the fact that -- two things."
2019.19-431,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,5340.96,5362.56,"Counsel, I -- I'm sorry to interrupt there, but -- and I -- I just want to understand how you read that because it does -- I -- I -- I heard that a few times, such additional preventive care and screenings, but then ... as provided for in these comprehensive guidelines. Can you explain how those two interact, I guess?"
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,5362.56,5363.28,Yes.

So, if you're asking the question, well, what additional preventive care and screenings must be provided, the answer is such -- so in the manner to be provided as provided for in the comprehensive guidelines. So all of that is answering the question of what additional preventive care and screenings are to be provided."
2019.19-431,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,5459.72,5478.2,"But is -- is -- is -- is not part of that a function -- I think the argument is, A, we can't specify which preventative care and screenings will be provided or under what conditions and that any -- any provision of care is necessarily going to be conditioned and subject to all sorts of exceptions."

2019.19-431,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,5510.8,5512.08,I understand that.
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,5512.08,5513.08,-- and challenged and --
2019.19-431,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,5513.08,5516.84,"Let -- let -- let's suppose, though -- let's suppose, though, that that was correct."
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,5522.48,5528.28,"So, if -- if that were correct, then the agencies would have some discretion to create exemptions."
2019.19-431,2,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,5545.48,5546.44,Okay.
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,5565.16,5566.16,"No, Your Honor, not at all."

2019.19-431,2,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,5585.16,5610.28,"I want to see your reaction to this way to think about the case, maybe picking up on Justice Breyer's question and -- and Justice Gorsuch's first question. As a number of my colleagues have pointed out, Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor, Alito, Breyer and others, there are very strong interests on both sides here, which is what makes the case difficult, obviously."
2019.19-431,2,63239,michael_j_fischer,,5727.6,5740.6,"Thank you, Your Honor. So, on -- on that last point, the reason this is not a reasonable way of balancing is that the rules go well beyond when RFRA even arguably would require."
