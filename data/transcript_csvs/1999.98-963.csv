1999.98-963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,14.85,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 98-963, Jeremiah Nixon, Attorney General of Missouri, v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, et al. General Nixon."
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,14.85,20.336,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,65.184,67.748,"Well, what about the inflation argument, General Nixon?"
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,86.21,99.54,"There may be times, Mr. Chief Justice, where the level does get too low, but in this case they've clearly not proven that it's different in kind, nor have they proven the ultimate burden, which is that the speech of candidates in campaigns has been impaired."
1999.98-963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,116.219,116.5,Excuse me.
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,143.067,154.376,"--It doesn't change their burden, however, Justice Scalia, and their burden is to show that the 1,000 dollars is different in kind, and that speech of a class of candidates has been dramatically impaired."
1999.98-963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,154.376,165.644,"Well, do you... is it not the case that the amount of time spent by candidates in the raising of money has radically increased?"
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,165.644,169.467,"Many candidates do have to spend more time, Your Honor."
1999.98-963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,169.467,173.308,An enormous amount of political campaigning consists of so-called fundraisers.
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,180.192,192.271,"If it is, Your Honor, the threat of having candidates on the phone talking to members of their constituency, asking for their help and support, pales in comparison to the risk that the perception of corruption with large contributions raises."
1999.98-963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,192.271,195.133,"Well, you say perception of corruption."
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,210.303,217.059,"Your Honor, we do not believe that it requires a quid pro quo under Buckley in order to have a perception of corruption."
1999.98-963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,217.059,221.389,"Well, but tell me what you mean by perception of corruption, that phrase."
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,221.389,227.143,"Well, corruption is dollars to influence action contrary to what the position of the elected or appointed official would be."
1999.98-963,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,236.98,239.532,Are you convinced that that perception has diminished since Buckley?
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,239.913,243.115,"--No, I'm not, Your Honor, but--"
1999.98-963,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,243.115,253.913,"Well, doesn't that make it very important for you to tell us precisely what interest is being served by the Missouri statute?"
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,269.645,273.428,"--Your Honor, in the ordinary case, there's a presumption of constitutionality of a statute."
1999.98-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,284.167,296.094,"Well, do you think that because of the holding in Buckley that it's no longer incumbent upon the State to establish the interest that the State has to support this?"
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,329.645,349.527,"Yes, Your Honor, it is, and in this case we've put forth powerful testimony, not only the affidavit of the chairman of the committee who held hearings throughout the State and in a bipartisan fashion passed the campaign finance measure that's at play here, but also the plebescite of the people of our State, in which 74 percent people strong voted for a limit, one-third the limit of what this limit is."
1999.98-963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,349.527,354.643,I think Justice O'Connor is talking about evidence of this specter of corruption.
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,357.254,359.835,"Evidence of corruption, Your Honor?"
1999.98-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,359.835,367.88,"Corruption or the appearance of corruption that would arise from allowing a person to give more than 1,000 dollars to a campaign."
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,367.88,368.621,"Your Honor, we would--"
1999.98-963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,368.621,376.735,"Do you seriously think there is a serious risk of corruption or the appearance of corruption if you allow somebody to give more than 1,000 dollars?"
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,376.735,378.608,"--Yes, Your Honor, I think that there is."
1999.98-963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,379.377,384.753,"And what evidence of that is there in the legislative proceedings, or in the election?"
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,386.692,396.3,"--The affidavit of Senator Goode, the chairman of the committee, that took the testimony that passed the measure specifically indicates that that is an important part of their difference."
1999.98-963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,396.3,402.133,Did he give instances of where this corruption or appearance of corruption raised its ugly head?
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,402.133,405.537,"He did not give specific instances in the affidavit, no, Your Honor."
1999.98-963,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,405.537,406.685,So you're relying--
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,410.288,430.902,"In that testimony and in that affidavit he said that corruption, as I indicated before, Chief Justice Rehnquist, is when the public sees a donor hand... you know, when a donor hands money to a politician, it is inherently likely to cause actual apparent corruption."
1999.98-963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,436.575,440.399,"Mailed to them, rather than handed to them."
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,443.601,447.081,--The perception would not change.
1999.98-963,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,447.081,453.415,"General Nixon, the inherent language you just quoted, that's straight out of Buckley v. Valeo."
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,463.252,469.157,"You are correct, Justice Rehnquist, in saying that the language is exactly out of Buckley."
1999.98-963,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,486.648,495.192,Is it corruption for an official to mirror his views to the electorate just so that he can be reelected?
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,495.192,495.372,--No.
1999.98-963,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,495.372,495.812,Is that corruption?
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,495.812,496.543,"No, it's not, Your Honor."
1999.98-963,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,496.543,500.678,"There's worse... that causes cynicism, I take it."
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,500.678,501.847,No.
1999.98-963,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,509.454,515.837,Is it corruption if he uses contributions as a proxy to assist him in making that determination?
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,515.837,516.458,"No, it is not."
1999.98-963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,534.16,535.663,Let me get this straight.
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,562.1,563.481,"No, it is not."
1999.98-963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,563.481,564.001,Ah.
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,564.001,566.032,"And to the amount above the 1,000 dollars--"
1999.98-963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,566.032,566.252,Wait.
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,592.368,595.152,"--It certainly lays out a perception of corruption, the dollars--"
1999.98-963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,595.152,600.315,"Well, but the first one doesn't, so it's a question of whether it's in kind or you're using money to buy it."
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,600.315,602.907,"--No, it's the question... excuse me, Your Honor, but the question would be--"
1999.98-963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,602.907,604.877,We're talking the same activity.
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,616.544,618.487,"--No, Your Honor."
1999.98-963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,627.813,630.786,"Justice Scalia's asking not about the laws, but about the perception of corruption."
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,633.189,634.689,"The Missouri legislature, as well as--"
1999.98-963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,634.689,644.517,"No, I don't... just your view as to why, when the union does it there's no perception of corruption, but when the business does it, there is a perception of corruption."
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,644.517,648.779,"--The amount of... Your Honor, it's not different if the actions are the same."
1999.98-963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,657.443,671.374,"But what... you say it's different if the services are actually in kind, with no exchange of cash, that we'll turn out our forces for you and we'll pay them rather than you have to pay them."
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,671.374,682.841,"The Missouri legislature, Justice Rehnquist, has not found that that particular problem warrants the level of control that the handing of money does."
1999.98-963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,687.616,691.399,"Oh, so it's up to them what's an appearance of corruption."
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,707.379,708.321,"Yes, they can, Your Honor."
1999.98-963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,708.321,709.11,In the First Amendment area?
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,709.11,709.901,"Yes, they can, Your Honor."
1999.98-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,709.901,710.152,Well--
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,710.152,713.475,"As Buckley said, they are uniquely positioned to ascertain--"
1999.98-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,713.475,718.029,"--Well, I think we... that brings us back to what is the test that we're going to apply."
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,721.201,722.041,"--Yes, Justice."
1999.98-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,722.041,725.904,And normally we apply strict scrutiny.
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,734.079,735.481,"Both, but--"
1999.98-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,735.481,736.122,What's at issue here?
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,736.122,740.466,"--Both, but the paramount interest is that of the candidate, and his or her ability to speak."
1999.98-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,749.853,758.337,Do you think the candidate is asserting a right to require the State to facilitate his fundraising in some way?
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,760.208,761.53,--I don't understand.
1999.98-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,761.53,764.401,How far does this go?
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,776.33,777.89,It could.
1999.98-963,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,781.132,784.154,"And what standard do we apply, then?"
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,784.154,787.277,I think the standards... the standard for expenditures is clearly strict scrutiny.
1999.98-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,799.264,801.013,"May I ask you a question, General Nixon?"
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,801.013,801.454,Yes.
1999.98-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,801.454,819.467,"If we look at the impact on the candidate's ability to communicate to the electorate, does the record tell us what the situation was before the statute was passed with respect to what portion of the money they raised was by contributions over 1,000 dollars, what portion was raised by contributions under 1,000 dollars?"
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,819.467,826.924,"The record indicates, Justice Stevens, that a very small percentage of the money, less than 2 percent of all candidates, was raised at levels above 1,000 dollars."
1999.98-963,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,827.962,833.696,So that would indicate that there's maybe a 2-percent diminution in the candidate's ability to speak?
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,834.377,836.288,"--Yes, Your Honor, as far as the number."
1999.98-963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,836.288,839.238,"That was 2 percent of all candidates, right?"
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,839.238,841.291,2 percent of the State-wide candidates involved in the--
1999.98-963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,841.291,843.333,Of all the State-wide candidates involved?
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,843.333,843.533,--Yes.
1999.98-963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,843.533,856.78,But it might have been the case that some candidates raised the vast proportion of their funds that way and would not have been able to run had they not had a few angels who came in and gave them enough money to run.
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,857.672,858.052,It might be the case in another State.
1999.98-963,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,860.313,870.2,"Now, as the argument is made here, and I suppose it's made everywhere, or could be made everywhere, that the kind of statute that you have is one which significantly favors incumbents."
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,871.522,873.994,"Your Honor, I believe it disfavors corruption."
1999.98-963,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,875.223,879.546,"Well, that's a good statement, but it isn't responsive to the question."
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,881.897,882.598,"--I... no, I don't--"
1999.98-963,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,882.598,907.004,"Isn't this a scheme... aren't incumbents more likely to have a developed broad base of contributors, a campaign network that has been built up in the past, and hence be able to go out and get lots of smaller contributions, whereas the new kid on the political block may very well have to depend on a smaller group and need more cash from each one?"
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,907.004,935.573,"--They may have more, Your Honor, but I would posit that the ability of someone who's in office to sell their vote, that vote is worth a lot more than a challenger, and consequently the level of corruption and potential corruption is dramatic, and consequently, as... you know, so I think there are a number of factors involved in the practicalities of politics and running races, and incumbents and challengers, but the system has been vibrant and alive with these limits across this country for 23 years."
1999.98-963,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,935.573,942.389,"General Nixon, the Buckley case has been criticized by some people for being imprecise in the standard."
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,954.52,959.174,"The formula, the standard of scrutiny would be a rigorous standard of review, somewhat less than strict scrutiny."
1999.98-963,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,959.174,960.975,Which means what?
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,973.473,980.937,"Well, clearly the level of proof of the burden to show the harm varies with the type of harm at issue here, and there's a significant and real harm."
1999.98-963,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,997.619,999.941,"What do you mean, it's stood the test of time?"
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,1020.423,1033.132,"Worked out much better than the alternatives, Your Honor, and quite frankly, walking away from Buckley at this particular point would consign the vast majority of the citizens of our country to a situation in which they believed, if there were no limits, that their Government was literally for sale."
1999.98-963,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1033.132,1037.865,Do you believe that the Buckley standard is tougher than O'Brien?
1999.98-963,0,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,1052.924,1055.177,"Our sense is yes, Your Honor, that it does."
1999.98-963,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1058.848,1059.63,"Very well, General Nixon."
1999.98-963,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1062.414,1068.947,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-963,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1108.514,1112.307,"General Waxman, whose First Amendment interests are being burdened?"
1999.98-963,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1112.307,1116.348,"There are two, Justice O'Connor, and there are three different interests."
1999.98-963,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1200.524,1203.725,"Burdick was a ballot access case, wasn't it?"
1999.98-963,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1203.725,1222.927,"--Yes, it was, and the Burdick standard has been... first of all, it was agreed upon as a standard I believe by all members of the Court in Burdick, both the majority and the dissent, and it was also affirmed by this Court in Timmons and in the American Constitutional Law Foundation last term."
1999.98-963,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1222.927,1226.009,"But this isn't, strictly speaking, ballot access."
1999.98-963,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1226.009,1226.73,"No, that's--"
1999.98-963,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1226.73,1228.482,Do we apply the same test?
1999.98-963,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1228.482,1240.381,"--I think you do, in... the Burdick standard has been applied not just in ballot access cases, but really in all election-related cases, cases like Timmons, for example."
1999.98-963,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1240.381,1242.332,"Well, election-related cases where the State has to manage the election."
1999.98-963,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1263.746,1264.998,That's precisely--
1999.98-963,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1264.998,1280.049,"It does not require the State to make one decision or another, and it's quite... with Buckley it was quite new that the State should intervene in what previously had been a matter of private First Amendment activity."
1999.98-963,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1280.049,1314.51,"--Yes, Justice Scalia, and that's why the Burdick standard, or what this Court referred to or what Justice O'Connor referred in her concurrence and dissent in American Constitutional Law Foundation as the variable standard also applies, as it did in the other Buckley case, in a nonballot access case where the Government is restricting what people have to do to get their message out, and in McIntyre, and in other campaign finance cases like California Medical Association and Massachusetts Citizens for Life."
1999.98-963,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1346.801,1361.821,"One of the parts of Buckley's reasoning, I think, was that you can have campaign limits of the kind, contribution limits that were upheld in Buckley, because alternate channels are available for the potential contributor."
1999.98-963,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1370.627,1401.148,"--It is, indeed, I think, Mr. Chief Justice, that it is even more true in Missouri than it is under Federal law, because, for example, candidate... individuals can make unlimited contributions to political party committees, that is, political parties can create committees and, unlike the Federal law, which limits how much one can give to a political party or to a PAC, Missouri doesn't apply any limits, and it permits independent expenditures, and volunteer--"
1999.98-963,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1401.148,1403.682,"Would that support a particular candidate, as opposed to a particular party?"
1999.98-963,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1409.225,1416.779,"--If you're a one-issue person, Justice Scalia, you have the same rights under Missouri law that the Court recognized under Federal law in Buckley and its progeny."
1999.98-963,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1427.026,1442.907,"Do you think that corruption is as defined by the Attorney General from Missouri that it's the chance that the official will change his mind based on the amount of contribution, is that the corruption that's involved?"
1999.98-963,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1442.907,1453.264,"I really think, Justice Kennedy, that the definition of corruption that this Court gave in NCPAC, which borrowed some of the language from Buckley, really applies."
1999.98-963,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1472.847,1480.483,"But if a contribution is speech, and we assume that it is, it's hard to say that speech is a subversion of the political process."
1999.98-963,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1480.483,1482.584,"Well, I... let me say two things in response to that."
1999.98-963,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1540.491,1544.374,That's a traditional principle of a rational basis scrutiny.
1999.98-963,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1553.329,1601.651,"--Well, I think if one looks at Buckley itself, what the Court did in Buckley, in looking at the First amendment interests involved and deeming them not to be substantial, it found with respect to the contributor... well, first of all, with respect to the candidate, that the candidate's interest was in having sufficient money, or sufficient fuel in order to make his message known, and the qualitative test this Court established, and this goes to the inflation questions that were asked, is whether the contribution restrictions have a severe impact on political dialogue such that they prevent candidates and political committees as a class from amassing the resources necessary for political advocacy."
1999.98-963,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1661.672,1662.671,"Thank you, General Waxman."
1999.98-963,1,42213,seth_p_waxman,,1662.671,1662.932,Thank you very much.
1999.98-963,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1662.932,1665.823,"Mr. La Pierre, we'll hear from you."
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,1665.823,1672.387,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.98-963,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1774.366,1782.49,"Well, if you first accept the proposition that you mentioned a moment ago that the appearance of corruption in effect is not really a serious argument here."
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,1793.847,1798.0,"Yes, Mr. Justice Souter, with I think one significant qualification."
1999.98-963,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1804.425,1812.12,"Well, I mean, is it difficult to estab... I mean, I assume a couple of things are meant by appearance of corruption, and you know, tell me if I'm wrong."
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,1854.188,1867.128,"--The political science literature, Mr. Justice Souter, would suggest that the general perception that those who give a lot of money in essence are buying votes, or obtaining some type of special favoritism, the political science literature suggests that that is not, in fact--"
1999.98-963,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1867.128,1887.2,"But I'm not sure... and I recognize that you've got that in the record, and I think that's important, but I'm not sure that it really goes to the justification here, because the justification here is, we need a political system in which there is some kind of a basic level of confidence on the part of the people governed in the integrity of the system."
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,1922.833,1955.314,"--Well, it would be difficult to argue, Mr. Justice Souter, that Government should never care about an appearance of corruption, but the Eighth Circuit tried to address that problem by insisting that the State have reasonably objective evidence of some appearance of corruption, so instead of running the risk that simple public cynicism, concern about the quality of our politicians, instead of letting ungeneralized fears about the conduct of Government overwhelm significant First Amendment interests, the Eighth Circuit tried to make sure that there was some real basis, something more than just--"
1999.98-963,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1955.314,1956.215,May I ask about... excuse me.
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2033.926,2039.81,"--The short answer is that we don't need any heavily empirical justification, and that's certainly not what the Eighth Circuit required."
1999.98-963,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2059.572,2060.443,May I interrupt you?
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2074.351,2084.197,"Absolutely not, because there would be no way of knowing whether this impression of the public, which may well be mistaken, should override important First Amendment interests in--"
1999.98-963,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2084.197,2090.213,"But the impression of the public, I thought you had conceded, was certainly itself an important datum."
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2090.213,2105.624,"--And I recognize that public impression is important, but it is the court's responsibility and the Eighth Circuit exercised that responsibility by attempting to make sure that vague impressions that there may be some problem were, in fact, more than just vague impressions."
1999.98-963,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2105.624,2106.075,But this Court--
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2129.071,2139.779,"Mr. Chief Justice, I believe you're correct, but the issue here is whether Missouri has any evidence whatsoever of a problem that it needs to address, absent some evidence of a real harm."
1999.98-963,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2139.779,2143.082,"Mr. La Pierre, the Buckley case says there was inherent--"
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2147.864,2149.086,I'll try and make my response brief.
1999.98-963,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2168.421,2171.732,"Now, will you... let... answer... Justice Ginsburg has a question."
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2171.732,2172.943,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.98-963,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2172.943,2173.284,Yes.
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2206.737,2220.956,"I believe the Eighth Circuit correctly recognized that in Buckley Congress had some evidence of real corruption, and when there's evidence of real corruption, one can say that a reasonable inference of an appearance of corruption arises."
1999.98-963,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2222.376,2225.368,"But that's not the point that Buckley made when it said, inherent."
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2228.41,2228.991,--Well--
1999.98-963,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2228.991,2234.094,"--that there will be this perception that if I give you a whole lot of money, you're going to be favorably disposed to me."
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2234.094,2251.835,"--I don't mean to quibble, and that's certainly one possible reading of Buckley, that an amorphous general concept of some appearance of corruption was sufficient to justify campaign contribution limits, but it's worth noting that there was in fact actual evidence of corruption in Buckley from which that appearance of corruption--"
1999.98-963,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2251.835,2255.308,"But is human nature any different in Missouri than it is in Washington, D.C.?"
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2260.262,2261.172,--I don't believe--
1999.98-963,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2261.172,2263.736,Other than we've seen that Buckley hasn't worked very well.
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2263.736,2268.507,"--Justice Kennedy, I don't believe that human nature is different in Missouri than in the rest of the Nation."
1999.98-963,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2268.507,2269.539,In Heartland America?
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2289.032,2299.96,"Justice Kennedy, I believe it would be a mistake to view Buckley as a grandfather governor of all 1,000 dollar campaign contributions, regardless of when, why, or how they were adopted."
1999.98-963,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2325.146,2335.323,"May I ask a question about, we're talking about corruption and appearance of corruption, and I'm not sure those are the... actually the words that capture what may be at issue in a case like this."
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2380.333,2392.611,"Allowing access or granting access to those who give a lot as opposed to those who give little or nothing would be entirely inappropriate, and there is, of course, no evidence on this record that anything like that occurs."
1999.98-963,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2392.611,2400.025,Is it not reasonable to assume that a person who's received a large contribution would be more willing to see the contributor than someone who did not contribute at all?
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2400.025,2403.057,"Yes, but there might well be a benign explanation."
1999.98-963,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2410.853,2428.384,"And you're willing to acknowledge that it's corruption, or the appearance of corruption, for a candidate to give more time to the people who contributed most to his campaign, whether they contributed most... you know, with sweat equity, or whether they did it with cash?"
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2428.384,2428.835,"No, I--"
1999.98-963,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2428.835,2429.745,Or is there a difference?
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2433.468,2439.432,--I'm not willing to make the concession that giving more time to those who have made contributions is corruption.
1999.98-963,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2439.432,2443.506,"Oh, I thought that's what your answer to Justice Stevens was."
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2443.506,2444.337,My concern--
1999.98-963,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2444.337,2448.849,I thought you said it would be inappropriate to give more time to those--
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2448.849,2453.962,--If it's given solely on the basis of having made the contribution or not having made the contribution.
1999.98-963,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2453.962,2469.972,"--You know, before we had the Hatch act, we had a spoils system at the Federal levels, and I think it still exists at some State levels, where once you get in, you can appoint people who supported you to the jobs that exist in the State."
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2473.886,2479.853,"Not in the sense that this Court has defined corruption, which is a financial quid pro quo, no."
1999.98-963,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2479.853,2481.072,"Well, let's try a thought experiment--"
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2486.636,2488.679,Not unless the Court changes the standard.
1999.98-963,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2488.679,2498.103,"You see, there are cases, I think, when people will give large contributions to candidates running against one another, because they want to be sure of having access regardless of who wins."
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2499.645,2500.206,Well--
1999.98-963,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2525.411,2536.52,"Well, could, say, the Missouri legislature, really wanting to clamp down on this access, say that no legislature should see any person for more than 15 minutes?"
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2537.86,2547.586,"That would seem to disrupt in very, very significant ways the legislator's responsibility to meet with constituents, learn their views, and make informed judgments."
1999.98-963,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2547.586,2565.839,"I suppose the most likely scenario for significant contribution would be the notion that I will give this money, and expect in return that if and when I ever call this particular official, if the official is elected, they'll pay attention to me."
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2582.042,2587.323,"No, because as I've tried to state earlier, there are a variety of reasons why access might be accorded."
1999.98-963,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2605.025,2606.665,But the first explanation would be bad.
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2624.47,2635.966,"It's not enough to justify limits on important First Amendment freedoms that some may think conduct is bad when, in fact, there is a very reasonable and important reason for that very same conduct."
1999.98-963,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2635.966,2638.006,"No, this is the reason for it."
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2652.228,2657.641,"I'm sure the individual would be seen, and there's nothing corrupt about the individual being seen."
1999.98-963,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2657.641,2661.605,Even if there isn't corruption... maybe that's the wrong word.
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2722.513,2731.65,Because in short order there is a much more limited response to the difficulty that may be posed by that exceptionally large 15 million dollar contribution.
1999.98-963,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2752.312,2761.259,"Yes, I thought your response was that even Ebenezer Scrooge has the right to participate as fully as he is able in the American political process."
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2761.259,2762.518,That would have been a better response.
1999.98-963,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2765.741,2785.436,"It would, because suppose the State of Missouri believes there is an important constitutional interest on the other side, the constitutional interest in giving everyone in Missouri a more equal chance to participate in this democratic system."
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2805.829,2807.161,The interest that you--
1999.98-963,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2807.161,2808.53,Or whatever the name was I made up.
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2808.53,2820.829,"--The interest that you've articulated would require a fundamental overruling of a point in Buckley, that Government should not limit the voice of some in order to ensure that the voices of others are amplified."
1999.98-963,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2822.839,2824.301,But don't we do that every day of the week?
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2844.066,2852.611,"--I believe in the circumstances that you're raising there is a scarcity... there's only a certain amount of time, 1 hour for oral argument, as opposed to potentially--"
1999.98-963,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2852.611,2856.772,Red light limited the voice of some so that others had a chance to speak.
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2856.772,2862.228,--In the context in which there's only so much time for all who would want to speak.
1999.98-963,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2862.228,2867.17,"And if, in fact, we decide that this big megaphone drowns out everybody else?"
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2867.17,2881.129,"Then we could try trusting the American public, which has shown a lot of good judgment in the past and seems ready to recognize when politicians take too much money from particular sources, and to hold that against the politicians who make those decisions."
1999.98-963,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2881.129,2894.719,"Maybe a better analogy where everybody has equal time to speak would be not limiting their time, but perhaps stuffing a sock in the mouth of the more eloquent speakers so that they will all speak with exactly the same effect."
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2894.719,2899.321,That analogy would be similar to limiting how many candidate contributions--
1999.98-963,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2899.321,2924.599,"It sounds as though you think the most important First Amendment interest in this case is not the interest of the candidate in amassing money, but the interest of Ebenezer Scrooge in getting his message across, and that was downplayed very severely in Buckley, because he can get his message across with a symbolic contribution of 10 dollars, and he can say anything he wants to on his own with his million and a half that he wants to give to the candidate to let the candidate decide what to do with it."
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,2928.69,2930.953,--And that is a correct perception.
1999.98-963,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2967.339,3000.188,"And is it not somewhat worrisome that for a full year after the announcement of the candidate, this candidate relied exclusively on that one PAC, and when he was subjected to the Missouri law, did appeal more generally to the electorate, and the idea of having one supporter alone, and then appealing to a broader segment of the population, as he eventually did, isn't there something disconcerting to say that I can rely on one large funder and forget the rest of the public?"
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,3000.188,3014.767,"I think, if you... if we look at the record there is passage of time from June and July 1997, until February 1998, and the committee was formed in June of 1997, the first contribution was made shortly thereafter."
1999.98-963,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3064.382,3073.178,"I suppose it's the law in Missouri, as it is elsewhere, that ultimately before you get elected you have to have the support of the majority of the people."
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,3073.178,3074.487,Yes.
1999.98-963,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3074.487,3075.128,Okay.
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,3104.706,3121.449,"It's correct that in National Treasury Employees Union the Court looked only for evidence of harm with respect to low-ranking Government employees and said, although it was not directly raised by the case, that there might be assumption of some problem if honoraria were offered to high-ranking Government officials."
1999.98-963,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3121.449,3126.562,But I'm asking you the hypothetical and how you would answer it on your show-me theory.
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,3141.611,3145.825,That would not be enough to justify the restriction.
1999.98-963,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3174.103,3186.892,"But you would say on that reasoning that the Federal judges, the ban on federal judges' honorariums would not be reasonably justified without actual evidence of corruption by a judge."
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,3198.442,3203.024,Actual evidence of wrongdoing is the best evidence of an appearance of a problem.
1999.98-963,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3203.024,3206.166,Is it necessary evidence in the cases of the judges' honoraria?
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,3206.166,3224.219,"I believe it would be necessary, because otherwise one could lose the services of a judge, or, in the context of our case, individuals could lose their right to both make contributions to advance their political views, and to receive contributions to advance their political views, on the basis of what might be no more than mistaken perceptions."
1999.98-963,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3224.219,3226.349,You have opened the prospect of great financial gain to me.
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,3261.965,3268.059,"It would be a beginning point to look at other Federal officials and draw conclusions, but not directly about Federal judges."
1999.98-963,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3268.059,3280.537,"Well, can't Congress, or hypothetically the State... impose conditions on the holding of a Federal office that it couldn't impose on just people who are not holding Federal office?"
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,3304.353,3312.247,"That's correct, the standard of scrutiny under the First Amendment is lower with respect to restrictions on public employees than it would be with respect to candidates and contributors."
1999.98-963,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3312.247,3333.162,"If we were to conclude that one of the collateral consequences of Buckley was that the system has become obsessed with raising money, that what was once a minor function of a Congressman or a Senator has now become his major activity, does that bear on our analysis?"
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,3333.162,3334.394,No.
1999.98-963,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3343.089,3346.051,I'm not sure you responded to my question.
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,3362.593,3364.483,"Yes, and it would suggest--"
1999.98-963,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3364.483,3364.824,And how?
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,3364.824,3371.799,"--that contribution limits be eliminated, because then candidates would not have to then spend so much time raising funds in small amounts."
1999.98-963,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3371.799,3379.236,"Well, does that show that the legislative remedy was not, in fact, tailored to the evil?"
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,3379.794,3380.916,It's difficult--
1999.98-963,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3380.916,3385.5,--What legal standard would my fact-finding address?
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,3385.5,3387.761,--Your legal... the standard should be strict scrutiny.
1999.98-963,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3414.429,3423.883,"Well, Buckley was, of course, very well-tailored, because it contained not just contribution limits, but expenditure limits as well, and that would work."
1999.98-963,2,21372,d_bruce_la_pierre,,3438.374,3449.981,"The assumption in our constitutional system is that limits on political speech are not the norm, and if it's a choice between striking expenditure limits or striking contribution limits, one should strike both."
1999.98-963,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3449.981,3451.762,"Thank you, Mr. La Pierre."
1999.98-963,3,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3488.848,3493.169,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe that it would."
1999.98-963,3,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3493.169,3493.609,Why not?
1999.98-963,3,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3496.971,3500.114,"Well, that would be speech, obviously, Your Honor, but that's--"
1999.98-963,3,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3500.114,3501.196,Whose speech?
1999.98-963,3,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3501.196,3501.496,--expenditure--
1999.98-963,3,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3501.496,3503.136,Whose speech?
1999.98-963,3,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3506.93,3509.491,"--Maybe I misunderstood you, Your Honor."
1999.98-963,3,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3510.843,3511.594,"Well, let me restate it."
1999.98-963,3,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3519.108,3519.489,--Yes.
1999.98-963,3,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3519.489,3535.529,"--on television, radio, newspapers, et cetera, that you think that that raising of money has the potential of corrupting the political process, an argument that you've made for limiting the contributions."
1999.98-963,3,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3535.529,3536.178,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.98-963,3,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3536.178,3558.344,"Can you now simply say that because money corrupts, we are going to limit the amount of money that can be charged by these organizations to run the political ads, not their editorials, not their news articles, but the amount they charge for the ads themselves?"
1999.98-963,3,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3558.344,3560.494,"No, I don't believe that you can."
1999.98-963,3,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3560.494,3561.215,Why?
1999.98-963,3,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3573.163,3576.395,"That it's much more direct speech, Your Honor."
1999.98-963,3,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3577.216,3577.697,Whose speech?
1999.98-963,3,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3577.697,3578.729,--It's much more direct.
1999.98-963,3,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3582.221,3583.701,It's my ad.
1999.98-963,3,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3583.701,3583.931,--expending.
1999.98-963,3,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3586.555,3587.054,Yes.
1999.98-963,3,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3587.054,3592.409,I thought you said the limit of the expenditure that can be spent--
1999.98-963,3,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3592.409,3595.111,Can be charged by the newspaper organizations.
1999.98-963,3,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3606.857,3612.881,"--Congress, or the Missouri legislature, might be so inclined at a later date."
1999.98-963,3,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3612.881,3618.497,"No, I'm asking, do you... using your rationale, would that pass First Amendment muster?"
1999.98-963,3,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3618.497,3627.962,"Yes, Your Honor, it could pass First Amendment muster based on the analysis of Buckley, but it is certainly not the case presented here."
1999.98-963,3,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,3627.962,3639.584,"I know it's not the case, but my question is, would it serve... if you can regulate the contributions, can you regulate the prices charged for running political ads?"
1999.98-963,3,32200,jeremiah_w_nixon,,3639.584,3643.138,"Your Honor, I do not believe that you can."
