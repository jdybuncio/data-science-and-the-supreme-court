2012.11-1025,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.635,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 11-1025, Clapper v. Amnesty International."
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,8.997,11.493,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1025,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,35.751,39.654,"General, is there anybody who has standing?"
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,51.431,53.385,"--Several points, Your Honor--"
2012.11-1025,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,53.385,68.472,"--would seem to say that the act -- if there were a violation; I'm not suggesting there is -- but that if there was a constitutional violation in the interception, that no one could ever stop it until they were charged with a crime, essentially."
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,68.472,75.842,"--Your Honor, under the statute, there are two clear examples of situations in which the individuals would have standing."
2012.11-1025,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,91.619,95.054,"General Verrilli, can you be specific on who that person would be?"
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,137.723,147.686,"Well, if the information were -- if anyone gets notice, including the client, then the lawyer would know, and the lawyer would be in a position at that point to act."
2012.11-1025,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,147.686,153.059,"So the client is somebody who is abroad and who acted abroad, and is not a U.S. citizen."
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,153.059,154.686,That's certainly true.
2012.11-1025,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,165.823,169.024,How likely is it that a service provider would object?
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,169.024,174.192,"Well, the service provider did object to the immediate statutory predecessor to the 2008 amendments."
2012.11-1025,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,182.33,183.176,And the litigation was unsuccessful.
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,183.176,184.72,"--Well, that's right."
2012.11-1025,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,219.176,226.561,"Well, using what you just mentioned, suppose -- just let's suppose that the Court should hold there is standing."
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,239.543,241.805,That is a possibility.
2012.11-1025,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,264.984,267.311,"General, I don't know that you've answered my question."
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,287.132,299.705,"--I don't think it's appropriate, Your Honor, to relax the Article III standing requirement of injury in fact based on the reality that the specific applications of this statute may involve classified information."
2012.11-1025,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,299.705,310.685,"Mr. Verrilli, we've had cases in the past where it is clear that nobody would have standing to challenge what is brought before this Court."
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,310.685,312.089,"That's exactly right, Justice Scalia."
2012.11-1025,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,312.089,318.508,"And we've said that that just proves that under our system of separated powers, it is none of our business."
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,318.508,323.039,That the Court's authority cannot be invoked in that circumstance.
2012.11-1025,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,332.191,345.185,Is the test that you propose that the injury -- I think your brief used the word imminent -- is another way of saying that -- is it unfair to characterize the government's position as saying that you're submitting that the injury must be certain?
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,345.185,345.906,No.
2012.11-1025,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,358.493,372.973,"Well, let's assume -- let's assume for the moment that the lawyer would be -- that the lawyer would be injured if his communication with the client were intercepted, or at least that he would have standing to prove injury."
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,390.715,396.634,The government conduct being challenged has to either have occurred or be certainly impending.
2012.11-1025,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,399.945,401.162,Certainly impending.
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,401.162,401.758,--Certainly impending.
2012.11-1025,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,418.702,424.997,"General Verrilli, but in this case the Complainant can never know."
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,442.926,451.498,"--Yes, that's not speculative, Justice Ginsburg, but what is speculative is the connection between the grant of authority and a claim of injury."
2012.11-1025,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,452.235,457.593,"Is it -- you were talking -- you wanted to say there's a cascade of inferences, I think was your phrase."
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,457.593,459.137,--There's a cascade of speculation--
2012.11-1025,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,459.137,467.93,"You want to tell us that in your view these -- all these inference that we're required to go through, if the Respondents' theory is adopted, you were going to tell us about--"
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,467.93,468.647,--I'd like very much to do that.
2012.11-1025,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,499.248,514.755,"--Is there much of a speculation involved in how -- I think it's only one time, and it was under the pre-amended statute, that the FISA court ever turned down an application."
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,514.755,520.285,"Yes, but that, Your Honor, is, I think, not a fair assessment of the process."
2012.11-1025,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,556.161,571.295,"Well, here is -- I assume that it is an injury for an American speaking in America to have his communication intercepted against his will by the American government."
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,572.765,573.935,"--It may be a harm, yes."
2012.11-1025,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,573.935,574.465,Okay.
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,577.308,584.697,"No, I think the question under this Court's cases, Your Honor, is whether the government is going to take an action that makes that certainly impending."
2012.11-1025,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,584.697,585.212,All right.
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,662.914,664.428,"Actually, Your Honor--"
2012.11-1025,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,664.428,665.882,And why doesn't that meet the test?
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,665.882,682.294,"--I think that gets to the last speculative inference that needs to be drawn in order for them to make out their chain of causation, and it's this: They have to speculate that whatever surveillance occurs will occur under this authority, as opposed to other forms of lawful authority that they do not challenge."
2012.11-1025,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,703.879,705.052,But why can't we get an answer to that question?
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,729.307,730.384,--But he's just--
2012.11-1025,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,730.384,731.432,Or it could say the contrary.
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,736.739,740.975,--I think you can't get there without establishing that there's a case of controversy.
2012.11-1025,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,742.145,752.314,"Well, there is if, in fact, the government is going to use this statute to continue to do some of the 10,000 or 20,000--"
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,752.314,753.952,"--But this case is at summary judgment now, and the--"
2012.11-1025,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,753.952,754.248,--Yes.
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,754.248,758.919,--Respondents moved for summary judgment based on the declarations that they submitted.
2012.11-1025,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,770.836,773.55,I don't see how that is pertinent.
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,784.797,800.542,"--I think it's -- I think the problem, Mr. Chief Justice, is redressability, in that the argument of the lawyers is that we have a duty to incur costs to avoid the surveillance, but that duty is triggered by, according to their expert affidavit--"
2012.11-1025,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,800.542,802.835,"Well, there again, it depends how you phrase their injury."
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,827.376,831.966,--But they still have to show a concrete application of the authority they're challenging.
2012.11-1025,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,833.591,835.778,Do -- do we parse injury that finely?
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,854.379,856.329,"--No, I don't."
2012.11-1025,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,861.36,862.015,General Verrilli--
2012.11-1025,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,862.015,863.079,"Well, the thing is they are going to be injured by being overheard."
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,874.949,876.088,--That's precisely what I'm saying.
2012.11-1025,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,876.088,880.385,"--But, General Verrilli, this statute greatly expands the government's surveillance power."
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,897.703,902.639,"Well, I think, as compared to -- let me make two points about that."
2012.11-1025,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,927.818,951.996,"Yes, but if you take the baseline position before this statute and the position after this statute, these lawyers and other people in their situation are going to understand that this is just true, that the government is intercepting more material, and that they have to take greater precautions in order to keep their conversations confidential, if that's what they want to do, which lawyers want to do."
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,961.584,964.583,"--I don't agree with that, Justice Kagan."
2012.11-1025,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,990.761,996.54,"Now we're back at the same circle we started with, which is the one that Justice Breyer started with."
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1019.449,1022.511,I think -- I think it is speculation.
2012.11-1025,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1033.18,1037.333,"I guess I don't see why, General Verrilli, this case is any different from Monsanto."
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1081.19,1090.14,I think the difference between this case and Monsanto illustrates our point.
2012.11-1025,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1104.837,1106.198,"I don't see that difference at all, General Verrilli--"
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1106.198,1106.572,--and then--
2012.11-1025,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1106.572,1118.037,"--because, in fact, what Monsanto did -- it's not Congress; it's an agency -- but the agency issued a rule saying that farmers could go plant genetically modified crops."
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1144.257,1147.805,"--There is at least two differences, Justice Kagan, with all due respect."
2012.11-1025,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1189.506,1190.317,"Well, is it really such speculation, General?"
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1218.367,1227.709,"--If I took precautions, it would be because of a belief that I had to comply with an ethics rule, and the ethics rule would be the cause of me taking those precautions."
2012.11-1025,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1229.082,1230.003,I don't even think it has to do with an ethics rule.
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1245.266,1253.229,"Your Honor, it seems to me that that hypothetical is a variant of exactly the argument that the Court rejected in Summers."
2012.11-1025,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1268.678,1269.348,"In Summers, the Court said--"
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1269.348,1270.534,--or controversy absent the exercise of the authority.
2012.11-1025,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1270.534,1270.846,--Excuse me.
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1293.386,1307.318,"Well, given the availability of traditional FISA surveillance, surveillance under Executive Order 12333, surveillance by foreign governments, I don't think it depends on this statute."
2012.11-1025,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1317.391,1318.561,You never know.
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1328.856,1342.676,"Well, I do think the problem here, Justice Ginsburg, really is -- the heart of the matter here really is that in a normal lawsuit a plaintiff would challenge the application of a statute, of the authority conferred under the statute."
2012.11-1025,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1353.968,1355.481,"Well, you think it's speculation."
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1396.497,1401.153,"--In a case like that, the lawyer -- the normal course would be for the lawyer to challenge the application of the statute."
2012.11-1025,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1403.45,1403.855,"--No, you can't."
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1428.859,1430.36,"--No, they don't."
2012.11-1025,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1441.996,1454.07,--But you're -- you are saying that the Government has obtained this extraordinarily wide-reaching power and we have extraordinary risks that face this country and the Government's not going to use it.
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1462.223,1463.175,--I'm not--
2012.11-1025,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1463.175,1464.204,--in order to protect this country.
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1470.499,1472.468,"--I -- I'm not saying that at all, Justice Kennedy."
2012.11-1025,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1486.307,1487.524,"Well, it's Justice Kagan's hypothetical."
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1500.614,1508.0,"And -- and I think it would be the ethics rule that caused the lawyer to take those steps, not the statute."
2012.11-1025,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1510.296,1511.232,But it's still the reality.
2012.11-1025,0,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1513.919,1519.261,"I would like to make one more point, if I could, Justice Kennedy, that I think goes to this and then I would like to reserve the balance of my time."
2012.11-1025,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1553.359,1554.013,"Thank you, General."
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,1561.618,1564.945,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-1025,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1599.771,1604.74,"Our cases, of course, say, do say “ certainly impending ”, not “ substantial risk ”."
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,1604.74,1615.144,"Well, Your Honor, I think that there is a -- a question even in cases that involve only a future injury, whether “ certainly impending ” is in fact the standard."
2012.11-1025,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1621.079,1622.421,"No, let's leave that aside."
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,1640.069,1643.91,"--Well, I don't think, Your Honor, that the Court has settled on certainly impending."
2012.11-1025,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1665.23,1679.302,"But both in Summers and Monsanto the Government tells us: We knew that the governmental act was occurring, and then once we knew that, the question was substantial risk."
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,1679.302,1691.64,"--Justice Kennedy, the -- the -- the cases that we rely on, Monsanto, Laidlaw, Meese v. Keene, these are cases in which the Court didn't look to the certainly impending standard at all."
2012.11-1025,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1739.012,1742.404,"It's not enough, of course, to know that the Government is using the statute."
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,1748.979,1750.243,I -- I agree with that.
2012.11-1025,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1758.256,1760.272,"Counsel, I have an issue--"
2012.11-1025,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1760.272,1760.833,"I'm sorry, do you want to finish?"
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,1763.099,1763.536,--Sure.
2012.11-1025,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1786.59,1800.721,Does that assessment take into account the fact that a court is going to pass upon the Government's ability to intercept these communications?
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,1800.721,1802.425,"It does, Justice Scalia."
2012.11-1025,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1810.002,1812.779,With the obligation to apply the Fourth Amendment.
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,1812.779,1814.358,I don't think it's that simple.
2012.11-1025,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1848.311,1853.622,"But if as you say those procedures violate the Fourth Amendment, it doesn't matter what the statute says."
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,1853.622,1854.718,"Well, the Court would have to--"
2012.11-1025,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1854.718,1860.419,"If those statutory provisions would produce a violation of the Fourth Amendment, they are null and void, right?"
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,1860.419,1862.151,"--Well, I think that's right."
2012.11-1025,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1862.494,1863.289,Okay.
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,1866.338,1872.554,"--Well, I think if that had happened over the last 4 years, the Government wouldn't be seeking reauthorization of the statute now."
2012.11-1025,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1873.912,1880.985,"Mr. Jaffer, could you be clear on the expanded authority under the FAA?"
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,1907.241,1909.443,"--That's absolutely right, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.11-1025,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1938.635,1939.477,--Could you address--
2012.11-1025,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1939.477,1957.693,"If we accept the -- if we assume for the sake of argument that “ certainly impending ” is the, the general standard, if we accepted your other argument, that the plaintiffs have standing because they took preventative measures, wouldn't that undermine completely the -- the “ certainly impending ” standard?"
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,1977.275,1983.929,"I don't think it would undermine the -- the future injuries standard, Your Honor, for a couple of different reasons."
2012.11-1025,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2009.076,2009.965,"Excuse me, before we go further."
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2016.04,2017.027,"--You are right, Justice Scalia."
2012.11-1025,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2019.886,2020.728,But that's his question.
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2022.132,2028.429,"And the only point I was trying to make is that if there is a distance between these two standards, it's a -- it's a pretty narrow distance."
2012.11-1025,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2071.004,2092.432,"Mr. Jaffer, it seems to me that your -- the government's strongest argument goes something like this -- and I don't think that they would say it in these words, but you have some clients where it actually does seem completely reasonable that they would take precautions, that they would not get on the phone, and that they would not use e-mail in the way that any old person would."
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2115.423,2116.001,Right.
2012.11-1025,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2116.001,2119.218,"--causation, but that seems to me the strongest of the government's arguments."
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2119.218,2131.868,"Well, Justice Kagan, this is something that the declarations address specifically, the distinction between the burden imposed by FISA, traditional FISA, and the burden imposed by the new statute."
2012.11-1025,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2183.442,2190.298,Do you have specifics in the affidavits of things that your clients would have done previously that they cannot do now?
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2190.298,2193.406,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-1025,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2219.037,2225.066,What other measures besides having to travel to have conversations?
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2225.066,2226.458,"I think it's a spectrum, Justice Ginsburg."
2012.11-1025,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2264.989,2270.503,"Well, the travel overseas I understand is the one thing that has a dollar amount attached to it."
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2270.503,2270.94,--Right.
2012.11-1025,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2270.94,2278.108,"But these other precautions, being more circumspect in their questions, talking in generalities--"
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2278.108,2280.966,"There is no dollar cost, Justice Ginsburg--"
2012.11-1025,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2280.966,2281.325,--Yes.
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2281.325,2282.405,--but there is a professional cost.
2012.11-1025,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2287.634,2290.117,--Can you go back to being a little bit more specific on this?
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2308.032,2309.158,"--That's right, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.11-1025,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2309.158,2310.25,--that were in effect before this act?
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2310.25,2310.687,That's right.
2012.11-1025,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2311.311,2314.782,Can you talk about what kinds of people those are?
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2316.982,2318.545,--Right.
2012.11-1025,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2362.629,2368.938,"Counsel, it seems to me that the concern you're talking about is present in every area of practice."
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2387.507,2393.802,"--I think that's -- that's right, Mr. Chief Justice, that, to some extent, this exists in every area of practice."
2012.11-1025,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2422.011,2431.974,"Could I go back to a question that Justice Breyer asked, where he used the analogy of a lawyer who is representing someone who is alleged to be an organized crime figure."
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2457.433,2458.869,--I think so.
2012.11-1025,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2476.268,2479.158,Do you know of any case that holds that?
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2479.158,2483.346,"Well, I think that -- I don't think it's a novel proposition."
2012.11-1025,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2499.775,2502.04,The Federal wiretapping statute has been around for 40 years.
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2506.037,2513.458,"No, but I think that that -- that there's a good reason for that, which is under Title III people who are monitored get notice."
2012.11-1025,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2520.906,2522.392,"Well, there is a notice provision under this statute."
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2522.392,2524.658,"Only for prosecutions, right?"
2012.11-1025,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2533.669,2553.377,"I think the -- which I think is difficult, because it makes this case somewhat unique, so that what you're worried about most is the definition of foreign intelligence information, which defines it to include information with respect to a foreign power or foreign territory that relates to the conduct of foreign affairs."
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2554.988,2556.002,--That--
2012.11-1025,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2556.002,2569.701,"And then, the Attorney General can, if he decides there are exigent circumstances, wiretap for a year, anyway, without going to any court, something that isn't true of the ordinary wiretapping."
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2623.054,2623.6,--Yes.
2012.11-1025,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2623.6,2625.194,--and that we're wrong when we think you're right?
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2625.194,2625.678,Yes.
2012.11-1025,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2626.13,2626.442,What?
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2626.442,2644.513,"If the government were to walk into court either today or after the remand that we are asking for, if the Government were to walk into court either in camera or not and say that plaintiffs will never be monitored under this statute, I think the case would be over."
2012.11-1025,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2654.371,2656.964,"Well, the plaintiffs aren't going to be monitored under the statute."
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2667.348,2670.175,"--Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I don't think that's exactly right."
2012.11-1025,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2683.575,2690.886,"Well, that's why I'm saying under your circumstances -- what you said is the Government could come in and say: We're not going to monitor these people."
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2698.65,2700.069,--Right.
2012.11-1025,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2737.508,2741.615,Isn't what you just suggested as a way of resolving this case rather bizarre?
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2769.621,2772.635,"--I -- I didn't mean to suggest something like that, Justice Alito."
2012.11-1025,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2797.576,2804.514,"--To that point, you're conceding the Government's position that -- on redressability?"
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2804.514,2806.417,"--No, not at all, Justice--"
2012.11-1025,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2806.417,2814.523,"That even if they promise you they weren't going to intercept you under this statute, that you would still take the same measures?"
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2814.523,2818.802,"--No, no, I wasn't talking about the other programs."
2012.11-1025,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2844.948,2848.352,"That's on that branch of your argument, which makes me more nervous than the other branch."
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2882.121,2887.214,So -- so maybe it's helpful to think of the -- the cases involving pre-enforcement challenges.
2012.11-1025,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2945.485,2988.843,"Mr. Jaffer, apart -- apart from the Government's power that you point out to conduct some of this surveillance without approval by the FISA court in an emergency situation for 1 year, leaving that aside, I don't see how the rest of your challenge or your challenge to the remainder of this statute can be characterized as a facial challenge, because it necessarily assumes that the FISA court will mistakenly say that there has been no Fourth Amendment violation, doesn't it?"
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,2988.843,2991.389,"I don't think that's so, Justice Scalia."
2012.11-1025,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3012.662,3015.816,"Well, it -- it can say it's unreasonable because you have unreasonably limited us."
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,3023.015,3023.456,I think in--
2012.11-1025,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3023.456,3024.376,We have to look into more.
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,3024.376,3024.797,--Right.
2012.11-1025,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3071.653,3073.263,I'm sorry.
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,3073.263,3088.71,"--In our view, they act entirely reasonably in taking the measures they're taking and they are effectively compelled in the same way that the plaintiffs in Monsanto, in Laidlaw in -- in -- in Meese <v@l> [= v.] Keene were effectively compelled to take the measures that they -- that they were taking."
2012.11-1025,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3088.71,3090.8,"Mr. Jaffer, you mentioned your journalist clients."
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,3108.134,3108.994,Right.
2012.11-1025,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3108.994,3116.443,"But if you assume that information is the lifeblood of journalism, that their sources and their information has dried up as a result of this statute."
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,3116.443,3117.819,"Yes, Justice Kagan."
2012.11-1025,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3219.48,3225.01,"But in Monsanto, suppose the challenge had been brought by a soybean farmer who said,"
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,3242.081,3245.486,I think that would be a much harder case than the one that they've brought.
2012.11-1025,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3293.668,3294.748,Maybe it's a difference in how we're using the word monitor.
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,3298.059,3298.699,--Been targeted.
2012.11-1025,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3298.699,3306.697,"What you don't -- well, others have been monitored abroad, right?"
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,3306.697,3307.726,I don't--
2012.11-1025,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3307.726,3313.738,"You're not monitored in the sense that this is the person's e-mail, and that's what we're going to collect information from, right?"
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,3313.738,3320.875,"--Well, what -- what happens is that the government identifies some category of targets abroad."
2012.11-1025,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3323.531,3323.921,Right.
2012.11-1025,1,31109,jameel_jaffer,,3323.921,3328.576,"--those targets' communications, they collect Americans' international communications."
2012.11-1025,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3368.312,3369.373,"Thank you, Counsel."
2012.11-1025,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3373.043,3375.367,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.11-1025,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3391.535,3392.253,"That's a fair point, General."
2012.11-1025,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3407.511,3409.636,I think you'd still have the problem of speculation there.
2012.11-1025,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3493.008,3495.819,"No, General Verrilli, this is not about the merits of the statute."
2012.11-1025,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3503.923,3518.915,"--But the whole point, Justice Kagan, the basic, most fundamental point about the case or controversy requirement and the injury-in-fact requirement that is embedded in it is to preserve the separation of powers."
2012.11-1025,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3536.753,3548.482,"Which they can never, never have, and that's what makes this -- if -- if there could be a person in this category who would know, but the person will never know."
2012.11-1025,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3565.397,3579.44,"--It's a little bit hard to talk about, Your Honor, because, to the extent we're talking about the process of acquiring foreign intelligence, that's a very sensitive intelligence method; and, to the extent minimization plays into that, it's -- it's not public information."
2012.11-1025,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3600.415,3605.305,"Are there restrictions on giving the information to other government agencies, in particular, the Justice Department?"
2012.11-1025,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3605.305,3610.192,"Well, that -- that -- again, Your Honor, there are procedures that govern those issues."
2012.11-1025,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3633.043,3633.683,"Thank you, counsel."
