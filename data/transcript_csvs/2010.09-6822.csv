2010.09-6822,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.651,"We will hear argument next this morning in Case 09-6822, Pepper v. United States."
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,6.762,10.619,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-6822,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,63.722,69.248,"Counsel, I think you -- I think you have got a difficult job navigating between your two issues."
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,89.896,92.49,They are like apples and oranges.
2010.09-6822,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,122.85,139.435,"If the law of the case -- if the law in the case is left to the district court, then the district court can say, well, the law of the case, that's what that other judge said, but it was a question of what's a reasonable time, and I'm -- I appraise it differently."
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,151.695,155.053,--The law of the case survives on a couple of basic principles.
2010.09-6822,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,182.962,198.895,"--Can a district judge say, later on in the process: I made a ruling earlier in the case; I have since done a lot of research, and I now think that that ruling was wrong?"
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,198.895,201.644,"Absolutely, they could do that."
2010.09-6822,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,243.342,243.747,Counsel--
2010.09-6822,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,243.747,245.76,"That's kind of a fortuitous situation, then."
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,259.631,267.519,"--Well, that's an excellent example -- bound by -- but have you had to look at the law of the case and make a decision whether or not new facts came in, there was a change in controlling law."
2010.09-6822,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,273.642,274.671,Even with the original judge?
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,274.671,276.78,--Even with the original judge.
2010.09-6822,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,277.965,280.434,Unless there are new facts or some -- some new--
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,280.434,283.557,"New facts, a change in controlling law, or other factors."
2010.09-6822,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,287.434,289.43,"--Counsel, I'm -- I'm a little confused."
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,289.43,289.727,--Sure.
2010.09-6822,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,289.727,307.626,I thought that the entire premise of Booker was that judges should have full discretion under 3553 to balance the factors that are required by the statute to be balanced and to come to what they believe is the appropriate sentence.
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,333.679,334.868,Absolutely.
2010.09-6822,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,361.575,364.496,So why isn't a new sentence just that: A new sentence?
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,378.004,382.051,"They can look at all of the facts, if there are new facts presented."
2010.09-6822,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,398.87,411.068,"--Yes, but one -- one of the new facts that -- that is before a judge on remand is that part of the basis for his decision has been eliminated."
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,438.684,449.287,"Well -- well, Justice Scalia, under the -- each that is presented to the court, if you mix the law of the case doctrine with the 3742 problem, it creates a problem in analysis."
2010.09-6822,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,499.926,505.936,What do you do with 3742(g)(2)?
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,505.936,506.766,You excise it.
2010.09-6822,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,558.196,592.106,"Would it be consistent with Booker for Congress to pass a statute that says the following: When a judge initially imposes a sentence, the judge must specify all of the factors that the judge thinks are relevant to that sentence, whether it's going to be a sentence within the guidelines or a sentence that is outside of the guidelines, and if there is then a remand, the judge may impose a sentence based on the factors that were listed at the initial sentencing but not based on any of the other factors?"
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,592.106,594.43,"Justice Alito, Congress could do that."
2010.09-6822,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,607.646,610.691,Isn't that exactly what 3742(g)(2) does?
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,610.691,611.705,It does not.
2010.09-6822,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,611.705,621.998,"It says under 3553(c), the sentencing judge is supposed to explain the factors that justify the sentence that is imposed."
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,642.88,644.954,"Well, Justice Alito, let me give you an example."
2010.09-6822,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,686.016,700.776,"Is the sentencing -- is the sentencing commission -- it still has that guideline that you can -- you can depart -- you can lower within the guidelines, but not beyond it?"
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,700.776,702.18,--Correct.
2010.09-6822,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,704.539,705.6,Yes.
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,705.6,713.989,"They have it as a policy bar, but the Kimbrough decision really indicates that the courts are not supposed to use that as only one factor."
2010.09-6822,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,717.065,729.216,"But as far as the sentencing commission itself is concerned, its position is still that post-conviction behavior does not warrant a below-the-guideline sentence?"
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,729.216,730.246,--Correct.
2010.09-6822,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,758.029,768.012,"Suppose that Mr. Pepper had an identical twin, and suppose that Mr. Pepper and his twin engaged in the same criminal conduct."
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,807.09,811.979,"Well, in that instance, the question is: Do guidelines accept the fact of some disparity?"
2010.09-6822,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,831.642,837.435,"His twin did everything that was expected of him, too, but he doesn't get any credit for the rehabilitation."
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,841.479,853.447,"--But our guidelines in our laws make situations where people who are unique and who, in fact, exceed, don't fall into a separate category of being unwarranted disparity."
2010.09-6822,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,884.838,890.835,"Well, it's -- it's warranted that the one get the benefit and it's unwarranted that the other does not."
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,898.786,905.155,"--Well, it would be on a variance and, as you know, under the Gall decision, Chief Justice Roberts, you can look at all of the other factors."
2010.09-6822,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,950.729,959.959,Is there a guideline that says that there cannot be a departure for rehabilitation after an initial sentencing that is set aside?
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,959.959,961.32,--It's not a guideline.
2010.09-6822,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,961.726,961.866,No.
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,979.812,982.152,"--And age, and factors like -- that's absolutely right."
2010.09-6822,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,982.152,982.308,--and age.
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,990.322,991.305,"And that's the grammar, variance."
2010.09-6822,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,991.851,994.101,--And that's still the law.
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,995.13,995.333,Correct.
2010.09-6822,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,996.02,998.956,So it's the circuits that have made this thing up?
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,998.956,1002.614,The Eighth Circuit created it out of whole cloth following the Sims case.
2010.09-6822,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1015.154,1018.122,"Well, what would the source of law be to make up such a thing?"
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1039.44,1040.973,--I would agree with you.
2010.09-6822,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1040.973,1042.673,And we would have the power to say that.
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1042.673,1043.597,Absolutely.
2010.09-6822,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1043.597,1045.813,What about 3742(g)(2)?
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1048.89,1053.916,"It is what we are arguing about, not about the policy, because they didn't even use that, Justice Scalia, in making their decision."
2010.09-6822,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1055.589,1056.416,"Thank you, Counsel."
2010.09-6822,0,16689,alfredo_parrish,,1056.416,1057.009,Thank you so much.
2010.09-6822,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1057.009,1064.13,Mr. McLeese.
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,1064.13,1066.536,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-6822,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1123.261,1124.135,Which guideline?
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,1125.351,1126.836,--5K2.19.
2010.09-6822,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1234.916,1251.473,"Well, isn't there a difference between evidence that -- evidence of conduct that occurred prior to the initial sentencing, but wasn't known at the time of the initial sentencing, and evidence of conduct that occurs between the initial sentencing and the resentencing?"
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,1251.473,1259.767,"There could be, but again -- maybe going too far with the example of the two twins, if the two twins, while they were serving -- let's say they got lenient sentences, but not probation."
2010.09-6822,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1271.325,1272.136,And what's your--
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,1272.136,1273.072,His brother gets a resentencing--
2010.09-6822,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1273.072,1274.371,Maybe it's all or nothing.
2010.09-6822,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1274.371,1274.543,--It is.
2010.09-6822,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1274.543,1291.69,"Maybe it works both ways, that the defendant doesn't get the credit for good conduct between sentencing and resentencing, but also doesn't get punished at resentencing for unproven conduct that occurs between the first sentence and the next -- and the second sentence."
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,1291.69,1295.861,"--That's a possible rule of law, but my point was that's not the rule of law we've ever had."
2010.09-6822,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1359.178,1360.273,Is that your fourth point?
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,1363.911,1364.488,--No.
2010.09-6822,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1376.047,1382.839,"If Congress reenacted 3742(g)(2) tomorrow, would it be valid?"
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,1382.839,1383.9,--It would be invalid.
2010.09-6822,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1395.021,1395.224,Why?
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,1498.121,1498.699,I do.
2010.09-6822,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1498.699,1500.98,And I would appreciate as much answer as can give me.
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,1500.98,1504.055,Take an example that is in the briefs.
2010.09-6822,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1557.596,1559.737,You think that violates Apprendi?
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,1559.737,1587.084,"Well, if the judge then says: I would like to vary from the guidelines; I am locked under the guidelines to a 121-month sentence, and I have -- I didn't -- it's true I didn't vary before on these grounds, but that's because the sentence didn't author -- didn't warrant -- because of relative lack of severity, did not warrant a variance, I think that the -- the logic of Apprendi and Booker would foreclose constraining resentencings in that way."
2010.09-6822,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1587.084,1587.364,I'm--
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,1587.364,1588.269,And I think that's an answer.
2010.09-6822,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1589.174,1589.689,--Yes.
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,1589.689,1613.652,"--I think that's an answer to the question that you asked earlier, which is, I think, if Congress enacted a statute which categorically said that whatever happens at the original sentencing, the judge has to list any reason that the judge is relying for a downward variance or departure, and then cabins the judge on a remand, that in certain contexts that would be inconsistent with this Court's line of cases from Apprendi through Booker."
2010.09-6822,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1613.652,1621.958,"Well, under 3553(c), the court is supposed to explain the reasons for the sentence, even if it is within the guidelines; isn't that right?"
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,1621.958,1623.101,Yes.
2010.09-6822,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1623.101,1630.564,"And so if the court is deciding whether the sentence should be 57 months or 63 months, whatever the figures were that you gave."
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,1684.011,1684.588,Well--
2010.09-6822,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1684.588,1685.902,It's just the notice provision.
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,1689.977,1709.346,"--To clarify, a judge is required to state in open court orally the reasons for a sentence inside the guideline range, only if the range is sufficiently large, and the written statement of reasons does not require -- the reasons for selecting a sentence within the guideline range are not required to be in the written statements of reasons."
2010.09-6822,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1772.975,1776.647,"The answer to this case is, I don't think, too hard."
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,1785.644,1786.253,And--
2010.09-6822,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1786.253,1800.746,"And then there has not been focus in the district court on what the district court would want to do, assuming he is free to apply the guidelines or not, on the remand decision that that judge has never made."
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,1800.746,1803.059,"--Yes, and to elaborate on that--"
2010.09-6822,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1803.059,1804.432,Is that right?
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,1804.432,1814.898,"--Just -- just by its terms, section 3742(g)(2) is inconsistent with the remedial rule announced in Booker, which was that the guidelines would be advisory rather than--"
2010.09-6822,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1814.898,1816.817,They didn't say -- forget that argument.
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,1818.364,1819.363,--But more specifically--
2010.09-6822,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1819.363,1822.456,"--I do have another point I would like to get out, as long as I have this opportunity."
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,1867.639,1869.059,--It's two points with respect to that.
2010.09-6822,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1879.461,1880.927,But it's just a policy statement.
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,1883.521,1884.035,--Correct.
2010.09-6822,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1900.89,1901.498,"Oh, I see."
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,1901.498,1909.496,"And, so, there still is litigation in a post mandatory guideline system about whether it is a correct application of the guidelines to on this basis."
2010.09-6822,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1909.496,1913.4,"Counsel, perhaps before your time is up, you would like to address the first question?"
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,1913.4,1915.228,Yes.
2010.09-6822,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1956.369,1960.039,But it has nothing -- but what if the appeal had nothing to do with the issue at all?
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,1976.249,1978.499,--And that is true in the civil setting.
2010.09-6822,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1993.164,1994.709,"These are not interconnected, are they?"
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,1994.709,2004.515,"--Well, the amount of substantial assistance that is given in a particular case can easily be connected to antecedent determinations, including what the guidelines level is."
2010.09-6822,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2005.388,2012.12,"No, my point is that the level of assistance is not in any way connected to the post-sentencing conduct."
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,2012.12,2018.976,"--These two issues are not interrelated, but I'm explaining the reason for of the doctrine in the sentencing setting."
2010.09-6822,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2043.137,2047.917,"Well, but why -- why does that matter when you are talking about two totally unrelated issues?"
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,2047.917,2050.526,--Because also--
2010.09-6822,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2050.526,2059.535,There is no reason to suppose that the court of appeals thinks there ought to be or any issue with respect to the question A when they focus solely on question B.
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,2059.535,2060.146,--I agree.
2010.09-6822,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2081.59,2087.026,"So, you are worried about the general rule, but you agree that none of these arguments make any sense in this case?"
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,2087.026,2099.504,I -- I agree that it would have been permissible for the court of appeals here to choose not direct a de novo resentencing that would have been a permissible way to resolve the issue as well--
2010.09-6822,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2099.504,2104.754,That would not interfere with the new judges or the judge's discretion across the board?
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,2104.754,2106.485,--I -- I--
2010.09-6822,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2106.485,2125.089,"I have never had to sentence someone, but it seems to me, particularly when you have a change in the judges, there is a very personal investment in what you do with the -- the defendant, and to say that, well, another judge looked at this factor, so your hands are tied in that respect is -- is a questionable result."
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,2125.089,2125.931,--I agree.
2010.09-6822,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2162.493,2170.085,"Is there reason to suppose when they say de novo resentencing, they are talking about the mistake that was made with respect to the issue B and not issue A?"
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,2170.085,2172.195,"--No, there is no reason to suppose that."
2010.09-6822,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2174.539,2191.763,"Do they -- is it their practice in some cases to say we are sending this back for de novo sentencing, but only with respect to the issue that we addressed, or do they just normally throw it out and say start over, without any supposition that the district court would take a look again at something that wasn't before the court of appeals at all?"
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,2191.763,2201.181,"--Different circuits approach that somewhat differently, but all circuits have -- understand that they have authority to make individualized case determinations and they do."
2010.09-6822,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2202.07,2210.146,"Could they -- are you aware of any case where the Eighth Circuit has said, we are sending this back for resentencing but only on the issue that we addressed on appeal?"
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,2210.146,2210.177,--Yes.
2010.09-6822,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2266.563,2267.796,Finish your sentence.
2010.09-6822,1,39837,roy_w_mcleese_iii,,2267.796,2281.179,"All I was going to say was in excising the appeal provisions that were excised in Booker, the Court identified four reasons why those should be excised, and each one of them applies equally or more so with respect to the provision at issue here."
2010.09-6822,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2281.179,2281.869,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-6822,2,15735,adam_g_ciongoli,,2285.757,2288.365,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2010.09-6822,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2302.236,2314.73,"And as far as you are concerned, Justice Alito's question about post -- post-sentencing criminal conduct couldn't be considered by a court, either?"
2010.09-6822,2,15735,adam_g_ciongoli,,2322.163,2323.773,"I -- I would, Justice Sotomayor."
2010.09-6822,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2323.773,2325.286,Is there any logic to that?
2010.09-6822,2,15735,adam_g_ciongoli,,2350.356,2354.416,"Well, I think one thing that would make sense of it is there's a different mechanism."
2010.09-6822,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2387.23,2414.031,"When this provision was passed, Congress was worried, I thought, about the situations where district court judges has -- were on appeal till -- you can't use this ground for departure, and often the court, because they thought the original sentence they gave was fair, would then articulate another ground for departure that they hadn't earlier."
2010.09-6822,2,15735,adam_g_ciongoli,,2438.833,2448.108,"Justice Sotomayor, I think the purpose of 3742(g) is to limit the ability of the district court to evade the mandate on remand in sentencing."
2010.09-6822,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2545.254,2548.156,But there are two explanations for your hypothetical.
2010.09-6822,2,15735,adam_g_ciongoli,,2559.371,2564.37,"--That's right, Justice Kennedy, and I think that both purposes are served by 3742(g)."
2010.09-6822,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2618.986,2623.518,How many of those statutes are left that the Court hasn't looked at?
2010.09-6822,2,15735,adam_g_ciongoli,,2623.518,2638.964,"Well, I can think of at least three problems that would result from the Court saying that any reference to a mandatory guidelines scheme creates -- creates essentially a facial invalidity if it's incapable of constitutional review."
2010.09-6822,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2638.964,2640.355,Which are the three?
2010.09-6822,2,15735,adam_g_ciongoli,,2640.355,2645.305,"Well, first of all, 3553(a) makes two references to 3742(g)."
2010.09-6822,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2669.984,2677.448,"But all those, what you tend to do is take the parts that refer to the other statute and say they don't do anything."
2010.09-6822,2,15735,adam_g_ciongoli,,2728.519,2745.232,"Justice Breyer, if you are referring to the solicitor general's hypothetical of a case in which they miscalculate the guidelines and they don't announce their reasons otherwise, I actually think there is a way to avoid the problem depending on whether the point arises before or after this case."
2010.09-6822,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2758.76,2773.035,Would that -- I mean -- we right now are receiving hundreds of petitions saying the court didn't sufficiently articulate its reasons.
2010.09-6822,2,15735,adam_g_ciongoli,,2782.391,2787.324,I think having a district court articulate it's reasons is a good thing.
2010.09-6822,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2797.525,2802.166,"They can check a box, they can check a box and unless they are going to depart."
2010.09-6822,2,15735,adam_g_ciongoli,,2839.429,2856.548,"I think in the context of 3742(g) that's one of the linguistic vestiges of the guidelines, which is that up until Irizarry the Court itself used the terms variance and departure interchangeably because a variance didn't exist prior to Booker."
2010.09-6822,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2900.015,2911.351,"It's true then that in all of the briefings in Booker, 3742(g) was not mentioned by anybody?"
2010.09-6822,2,15735,adam_g_ciongoli,,2911.351,2913.134,"That's correct, Justice Ginsburg."
2010.09-6822,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2913.134,2916.725,So it was a question of the Court overlooking it.
2010.09-6822,2,15735,adam_g_ciongoli,,2927.722,2933.157,"Justice Ginsburg, I think that obviously the Court is dealing very clearly with the constitutionality of it now."
2010.09-6822,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2948.931,2958.52,"The problem, to be very specific, is I think the following: The first sentencing, the judge applies the guideline."
2010.09-6822,2,15735,adam_g_ciongoli,,3037.146,3043.299,"Justice Breyer, I -- I think that in -- in certain applications of this statute there will be problems."
2010.09-6822,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3136.387,3136.98,How?
2010.09-6822,2,15735,adam_g_ciongoli,,3156.614,3162.0,Justice Scalia I think I said it would be problematic; I don't think I conceded that it would be unconstitutional.
2010.09-6822,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3162.0,3162.55,All right.
2010.09-6822,2,15735,adam_g_ciongoli,,3162.55,3177.528,"I think that -- I think that there are -- there are some circumstances where, by a strict read of -- of (g)(2), the court would be required to apply the guidelines, a guidelines range."
2010.09-6822,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3243.0,3259.963,"Well, but -- I mean, why wouldn't you read that simply to have been overcome by the holding of Booker, that you apply -- that every judge has to apply 3553 factors and decide the ultimate sentence on the basis of those factors?"
2010.09-6822,2,15735,adam_g_ciongoli,,3268.113,3277.11,"I -- I -- I certainly think the Court could take that approach, and -- and in fact I think to -- I think to -- I think it should."
2010.09-6822,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3293.808,3310.084,"But doesn't it conflict with 3553(a)(2), that is, the overriding provision that a sentence should be sufficient but not greater than necessary to deter criminal conduct."
2010.09-6822,2,15735,adam_g_ciongoli,,3345.881,3351.969,"Justice Ginsburg, I think you are pointing out that there is some tension which I have admitted."
2010.09-6822,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3407.743,3409.134,"Thank you, counsel."
2010.09-6822,3,16689,alfredo_parrish,,3533.598,3412.898,Thank you.
2010.09-6822,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3534.191,3535.346,"Thank you, counsel."
