2012.12-484,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,9.189,"Our last case of the year is 12-484, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar."
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,10.789,16.693,"Good morning, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-484,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,54.135,70.894,"In the -- in the AIDS discrimination context, there wouldn't be a difference between the discrimination claim itself and the retaliation."
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,82.016,82.266,Yeah.
2012.12-484,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,85.051,85.401,Yes.
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,85.401,88.17,"So for this purpose in the Age Act, everything is but-for, that's correct."
2012.12-484,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,88.17,102.779,"But your argument is that in Title VII, where it's very clear what the standard Congress wants to have for the discrimination claim, you're going to have a different standard for retaliation."
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,113.237,131.965,"Well, that -- I mean, to some extent within Title VII, that is the question in the case, but what we have here is an amendment within Title VII, it is first in Title VII where it's set forth discrimination based on class and discrimination based on retaliation as separate types of discrimination, and this provision treats them differently."
2012.12-484,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,132.732,145.958,"Well, I guess the question, Mr. Joseffer, is, is there any other discrimination statute in which one can say that there's a different standard for proving retaliation than there is for proving substantive discrimination?"
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,158.749,168.122,"--Well, I mean -- the reason I ask the question -- I would agree in the sense that if what we're talking about is but-for versus mixed motive, right?"
2012.12-484,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,176.192,176.692,I'll try again.
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,186.667,189.619,"No, because it's but-for everywhere except for this one amendment."
2012.12-484,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,189.619,193.82,"Well, is there -- I mean, it's but-for everywhere."
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,216.686,227.375,"Not -- I can't point to anything specific because what we had, right, was -- there was -- I can't point to anything specific on that."
2012.12-484,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,232.362,235.23,"All I'm saying, you know, Gross was a couple of years ago."
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,265.35,272.622,"--Well, I mean, yes and no, in the sense that if we're talking about but-for versus mixed, right, yes, that's a creature of this specific statute we're talking about."
2012.12-484,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,278.676,283.878,Did this court ever hold that a Price Waterhouse framework applied to retaliation claims?
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,283.878,284.663,No.
2012.12-484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,377.604,380.039,"I'm sorry, I somehow lost what you were saying."
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,393.866,398.251,"--Well, the reason -- well, what Jackson says of course and Title VII is vastly different."
2012.12-484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,398.8,406.506,"Well, different because it was the beginning of this sort of endeavor of creating a statute."
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,406.506,423.718,"--Well, the distinction that Jackson draws and also that Gomez-Perez draws expressly in distinguishing this type of situation is if -- if you have a broad general prohibition on discrimination or discrimination based on race, without more -- without more specificity, the Court will presume that that would include retaliation."
2012.12-484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,444.215,446.465,I'm -- I'm not sure what difference it makes.
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,446.465,448.183,"--Well, because otherwise, you are taking the--"
2012.12-484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,448.183,453.487,Other than in the outcome you want here.
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,453.487,489.494,"--As a matter -- well, as a matter of statutory interpretation, right, which then drives the outcome, the difference is that if -- if you treat a specific retaliation reference or provision as being subsumed within a more general one, a discrimination based on race, for example, you are treating the specific retaliation reference to be surplusage, to have no effect and to not need to be there, and you're treating the other statutory cross-references to it as also being surplusages, which is why, when Congress does speaks more directly this Court's never overridden, never said that it will take a specific retaliation provision and treat it like it's not there and toss it and -- based on race, for example."
2012.12-484,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,499.366,505.854,"Well, Mr. Joseffer, I mean, Title VII is written before any of these cases come along."
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,554.687,560.591,"There are a couple -- if you just look at 1991, there are a few reasons that we know from the '91 that doesn't work."
2012.12-484,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,602.333,615.991,"Well, it seems that the overall purpose of the '91 Act was to overrule decisions of this Court that Congress thought had not interpreted Title VII properly."
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,633.119,639.256,"--For -- for those cases that -- that the motivating factor provision governs, it's more plaintiff-friendly, yes."
2012.12-484,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,639.256,655.718,"So it's -- it's really odd to think that in wanting to go beyond what we did in Price Waterhouse, the Court meant to set up an entirely different standard for -- for retaliation."
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,655.718,668.359,"That was basically the same argument that this Court rejected in Gross, in -- in that Gross involved an absolutely identical statutory provision, that was lifted in fact, deliberately lifted verbatim, from Title VII to be put into the Age Act."
2012.12-484,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,682.683,684.699,Let's look at what they actually did.
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,701.645,702.928,--Yes.
2012.12-484,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,702.928,708.631,"""-- an unlawful employment practice is established. """
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,735.782,742.685,"Well, the -- under Title VII, there are basically three different ways to establish an unlawful employment practice."
2012.12-484,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,801.574,803.208,I can't understand you very well.
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,809.58,810.78,"--I apologize, Your Honor."
2012.12-484,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,832.66,835.51,--The EEOC didn't.
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,835.51,837.162,Right.
2012.12-484,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,885.809,893.499,"As of 1991 -- well, Gomez-Perez and Jackson came after 1991, right?"
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,893.499,895.565,"Yes, the other's before."
2012.12-484,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,895.565,912.793,"So as of 1991, was there any case, any decision of this Court other than Sullivan, that could have possibly led Congress to a conclusion that the general prohibition against discrimination included a prohibition of retaliation?"
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,912.793,915.662,I think you are right about the timing.
2012.12-484,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,922.649,935.825,"Well, but, Mr. Joseffer, in CBOCS, we said that because of Sullivan alone, just because of Sullivan, there was no need for Congress to exclude explicit language about retaliation."
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,952.37,953.77,Right.
2012.12-484,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,983.639,989.626,"I mean, here's what you're ask -- this goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question -- but here's what you're asking us to accept, Mr. Joseffer."
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,1043.428,1046.546,"Well, what -- Gross rejected a fair amount of that reasoning, right?"
2012.12-484,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1072.495,1075.463,"Well, Gross is talking about outside of Title VII."
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,1112.738,1115.357,"--Well, first off, it did."
2012.12-484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1183.233,1186.085,Where do you see that anywhere in the legislative history?
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,1186.085,1201.028,"--The only thing you'll find in the legislative history, the only thing you'll find that's specific to this, is that Congress was aware of retaliation, including aware of Title VII's retaliation provision, and it amended legislation to incorporate that provision when it wanted to."
2012.12-484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1203.963,1215.521,"Well, but it -- it calls it the same thing it calls the substantive discrimination charge, an un -- it's a -- an unfair employment practice."
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,1220.425,1220.992,"Well, the--"
2012.12-484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1220.992,1225.329,--from the fact that it calls it the same thing on both substantive.
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,1225.329,1227.745,"--No, my -- my point is this."
2012.12-484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1245.391,1249.777,"Calls it both identical things, an unlawful employment practice."
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,1249.777,1250.194,Yes.
2012.12-484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1384.297,1387.232,But that policy argument just says Jackson's wrong.
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,1387.232,1388.349,"No, not at all."
2012.12-484,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1388.349,1408.061,"It just doesn't make any -- much sense to me that in 1991, when they were thinking about Price Waterhouse burdens, that somehow they thought that it should now apply that burden differently to retaliation."
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,1408.061,1411.013,"It -- it was -- the same argument was rejected in Gross, right?"
2012.12-484,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1429.973,1433.008,Is -- is this a violation of Title VII?
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,1475.668,1480.322,"If I understand the hypo right, there's no question that the immediate supervisor and the employer--"
2012.12-484,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1480.322,1481.572,The immediate supervisor does.
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,1481.572,1482.422,"--But-for, but-for causation."
2012.12-484,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1482.422,1482.805,All right.
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,1483.272,1484.438,So it's just a supervisory hypo question?
2012.12-484,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1484.438,1484.854,"--Yes, yes, yes."
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,1567.342,1567.592,"No, no, no."
2012.12-484,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1592.938,1596.075,I would say you are better off keeping your time.
2012.12-484,0,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,1596.075,1615.453,"I was going to say under 2(m) though, I think the overriding point here is that if I have two thoughts in my head, a bad one, but then I go ahead and treat the person the same way I would have anyhow, then I have done what under Title VII, generally understood, I am supposed to do, which is I treat everyone equally regardless of the bad thought in my head."
2012.12-484,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1628.428,1629.213,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,1632.682,1633.732,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
2012.12-484,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1679.745,1683.53,Why did they -- why did they include it in a separate section?
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,1688.315,1693.403,"--Well, when Congress added e-2 in, Justice Scalia, it supplemented the Act."
2012.12-484,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1695.671,1696.171,I understand that.
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,1698.789,1716.75,"Well, they didn't have to amend e-3(a) because there were policy -- the Burlington Northern case, for example, where this Court held that retaliation is considerably broader, that provision, where the Court held that retaliation in Burlington actually went beyond conditions in the workplace."
2012.12-484,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1779.306,1794.233,I take you back to your opening statement that there is no reason why Congress might have wanted to have a different standard for substantive discrimination and retaliation.
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,1806.39,1810.758,"--Not at all, Your Honor, and this is the reason, and this Court needs to keep this in mind."
2012.12-484,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1821.3,1824.085,"Well, I know it's not going to go away."
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,1873.601,1884.956,"--Very easily, because in that situation the employer wouldn't even have to prove the affirmative defense because the employee wouldn't be able to prove a violation of the Act because it was a spurious claim."
2012.12-484,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1887.008,1887.508,Is that correct?
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,1893.495,1910.754,"--You cannot prevail on a retaliation claim under e-2(m) without proving first a violation of the Act, and that is the distinction Congress made in e-2(m) for Price Waterhouse, whereas Price Waterhouse held there was no violation as long as the affirmative defense was proven."
2012.12-484,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1919.626,1922.328,"No, I really don't understand -- I didn't understand the law to be that."
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,1950.046,1950.662,"No, no, no, I'm not saying that."
2012.12-484,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1951.196,1951.998,I thought that's what you were saying.
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,1955.8,1956.4,No.
2012.12-484,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1966.924,1968.574,"In his hypothetical, he did."
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,1990.206,1993.158,"Well, here's -- here's our position, Justice Scalia."
2012.12-484,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2014.921,2015.587,I don't understand that.
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,2016.337,2026.11,"--Substantive discrimination, the teeth of the Act, relies on employees being able to cooperate and be witnesses, that they have the guts to come forward."
2012.12-484,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2030.181,2031.181,"Well, no, I understand that."
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,2063.585,2067.854,There is nothing in the legislative history in 1991 that supports that.
2012.12-484,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2140.985,2142.604,Over a powerful dissent.
2012.12-484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2142.604,2156.012,"I would just like to get to what I think is one of their arguments and I'm having some -- the argument is purely linguistic, all right?"
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,2233.392,2235.844,"--Yes, sir, Your Honor."
2012.12-484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2250.519,2256.507,So you have to say retribution for race is race.
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,2256.507,2257.373,--Retribution?
2012.12-484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2257.373,2259.125,Yes.
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,2259.125,2259.542,Yes.
2012.12-484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2259.542,2272.016,"Now -- now, what I was looking for, perhaps without success, is some other example that has nothing to do with retribution, but where that's clearly so."
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,2329.119,2347.766,"If -- if I understand your question, what I would default to are the three or four cases that I mentioned: Sullivan, Jackson v. Birmingham, CBOCS v. Humphries, Gomez-Perez v. Potter, where this Court has consistently held that complaining about discrimination is intentional discrimination."
2012.12-484,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2349.282,2350.116,"Now, I have looked--"
2012.12-484,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2350.116,2350.901,But -- but not under this statute.
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,2394.93,2397.532,"--Justice Scalia, that's incorrect, and this is why."
2012.12-484,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2424.581,2426.497,"Sir, the statute says what it says."
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,2438.489,2439.757,That -- that--
2012.12-484,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2439.757,2440.241,Period.
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,2452.498,2469.526,"--Justice Scalia, respectfully, that argument is directly contrary to CBOCS v. Humphries, and it's directly contrary to Gomez-Perez, where this Court held that Congress is charged with knowing what this Court is deciding prior to acting."
2012.12-484,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2469.526,2470.359,But it would have been so easy.
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,2478.882,2481.917,Why would they leave 5(g)(2)(A) out?
2012.12-484,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2481.917,2482.784,Why would they leave
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,2486.702,2488.404,"Well, here's my response to that."
2012.12-484,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2488.404,2501.145,"I know your argument is well, look, the Court's already said well, that's -- that's included, but they've got two provisions fairly close to each other, and I don't know, if they're running through the usual list, why they wouldn't have just run through a list as it appeared in (g)(2)(A)."
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,2501.145,2502.93,"Well, this is really important."
2012.12-484,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2594.737,2616.085,"But your alternate argument would -- would involve two standards, the one that Congress provided for substantive discrimination, the -- the improvement on -- on Price Waterhouse, and then for retaliation, Price Waterhouse."
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,2616.085,2617.035,Just--
2012.12-484,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2617.035,2633.88,"And I started this -- this argument by asking, is there -- in the realm of anti-discrimination law, is there any example where you have the -- the substantive charge governed by one standard and retaliation by another?"
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,2633.88,2635.447,"--No, ma'am."
2012.12-484,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2649.907,2653.509,"It might be a good idea, though, and -- and if so, Congress can do it, right?"
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,2653.509,2654.31,"Well, that's--"
2012.12-484,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2654.31,2656.727,"I mean, the issue is whether this statute does it or not."
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,2660.781,2665.149,"--Well, I think the Court has to interpret the Act, but going back to Judge Ginsburg's--"
2012.12-484,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2665.149,2680.695,"Do -- do you agree with the Government's position that the limited affirmative defense provisions Congress enacted, that is to say, limited damages when there's multiple or mixed motives would also apply to retaliation cases?"
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,2680.695,2681.411,--Absolutely.
2012.12-484,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2715.499,2718.551,"Price Waterhouse is a little different from subsection (m) though, isn't it?"
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,2732.394,2735.83,I don't have -- I don't have an answer for that.
2012.12-484,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2789.697,2801.938,Isn't it the case that Justice O'Connor's opinion in Price Waterhouse required direct evidence and substantial evidence before there was a shift in the burden of proof.
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,2801.938,2815.281,"I think judge -- I think Justice O'Connor in her concurrence did say direct evidence under Price Waterhouse, albeit six judges agreed in 1989 that motivating factor causation applies."
2012.12-484,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2850.621,2851.404,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-484,1,17796,brian_p_lauten,,2851.404,2852.271,Sorry.
2012.12-484,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2853.004,2870.432,Ms. Sherry.
2012.12-484,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2870.432,2872.701,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.12-484,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2902.553,2918.163,"But I thought -- I thought the thrust of Justice Alito's question was that retaliation claims are -- are now quite common, and they can almost be used as a defensive mechanism, as a defense when you know you are about to be hired."
2012.12-484,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2922.717,2923.484,And on that--
2012.12-484,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2923.484,2926.602,And so -- so that -- that was the thrust of -- of his question.
2012.12-484,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2926.602,2929.704,--And -- and I want to address that because I don't think that's quite right.
2012.12-484,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2957.204,2959.073,Where are they -- where are they going to be weeded out?
2012.12-484,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2961.775,2962.808,--At summary judgment.
2012.12-484,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2980.453,2990.008,"That's -- that's a fair point, but it's, like, if we change it a little bit so that it's -- it's not frivolous, but it is clearly groundless once its examined, then you still have the problem."
2012.12-484,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,2990.008,2995.412,"--And then I don't think it's as severe of a problem as Your Honor is suggesting, for a couple of different reasons."
2012.12-484,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3011.089,3011.622,Excuse me.
2012.12-484,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3012.989,3017.909,In circumstances where the employer would have made the same decision--
2012.12-484,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3017.909,3018.409,Right.
2012.12-484,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3018.409,3019.626,--even without the improper motive--
2012.12-484,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3019.626,3020.111,Yes.
2012.12-484,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3020.111,3029.383,"--that is a defense under (g)(2)(B), and it's something that the employer could certainly raise under partial summary judgment that would severely limit the remedies available."
2012.12-484,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3051.197,3051.78,Just before you do that--
2012.12-484,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3051.78,3052.197,--Sure.
2012.12-484,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3052.197,3056.201,--because I understood we are talking about what possible reason there could be for drawing this distinction.
2012.12-484,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3087.553,3094.326,"And I don't think it is, for the reasons that this Court talked about in Burlington Northern and in Thompson and in Crawford."
2012.12-484,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3118.858,3123.762,"That -- I think that was my point, that they are linked together but they are at different levels."
2012.12-484,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3132.784,3134.751,--And I -- I agree with Your Honor.
2012.12-484,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3145.592,3146.242,The problem is--
2012.12-484,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3146.242,3147.211,And you have a--
2012.12-484,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3147.211,3161.887,"--The problem is this: It's one thing to say, and it's a good thing to say to employers: When you are making employment decisions, you take race out of your mind, take gender out of your mind, take national origin out of your mind."
2012.12-484,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3192.706,3211.634,"--I don't think it is and I think it's significant if we are talking about distinguishing between retaliation -- It's significant that Congress in a number of whistleblower statutes, so specifically retaliation statutes, has adopted a contributing factor, a motivating factor standard, and in fact has adopted a same-decision defense where you need clear and convincing evidence."
2012.12-484,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3217.522,3225.894,"You -- you talk about Congress as though it's a continuing body out there, the same people, and would the same people that did this do that."
2012.12-484,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3260.884,3261.751,"--And thank you, Justice Scalia."
2012.12-484,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3340.267,3353.225,"Well, but under -- under that analysis, you don't need the final clause on page 17a of your brief of 3, “ because he has opposed ”."
2012.12-484,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3355.843,3359.664,--I think that defines what the protected activity is.
2012.12-484,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3456.523,3461.86,But the maxim that you don't add words where you don't need them doesn't -- doesn't help your case.
2012.12-484,2,36607,melissa_arbus_sherry,,3479.989,3481.489,"--Your Honor, may I?"
2012.12-484,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3510.508,3511.241,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.12-484,3,21046,daryl_l_joseffer,,3517.145,3522.947,Thank you.
