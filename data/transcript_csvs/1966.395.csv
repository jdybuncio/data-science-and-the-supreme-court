1966.395,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,47.009,"Number 395, Richard Perry Loving, et al., Appellants, versus Virginia."
1966.395,0,17550,bernard_s_cohen,,54.515,56.416,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.395,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,65.262,72.069,Your motion is granted.
1966.395,1,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,74.588,78.175,Thank you Your Honor.
1966.395,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,212.837,215.306,How many states (Inaudible)?
1966.395,1,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,215.306,217.494,"There are 16 states, Your Honors that have these States."
1966.395,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,477.916,479.979,Would you mind telling me what case that was?
1966.395,1,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,479.979,481.712,"That's Kinney versus Commonwealth, Your Honor."
1966.395,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,481.712,482.392,Kinn --
1966.395,1,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,482.392,539.017,"Kinney, K-I-N-N-E-Y and then in 1924, in the period of great history in the United States, the historical period we're all familiar with, a period when the west was in arms over the yellow peril and western states were thinking about these laws or some (Inaudible), a period when the immigration laws were being passed to the United States because the north was worried about the great influx of Italian immigrants and Irish immigrants, a period when the Klan rode openly in the south and that's when they talked about bastardy of races, and miscegenation and amalgamation and race suicide became the watch word, and John Powell, a man we singled out in our brief, a noted pianist of his day, started taking up the Darwin Theory and perverting it through the theory of eugenics, the theory that applied to animals, to pigs, and hogs, and cattle."
1966.395,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,567.461,574.313,"How many states for the first time in that -- in the 20s passed these kinds of laws, do you recall?"
1966.395,1,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,574.313,578.047,"Your Honor, to the best of our knowledge, basically most States had them."
1966.395,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,587.889,597.58,But you were saying that the western states and the eastern states and others during the 1924 period passed these laws as I understood you.
1966.395,1,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,597.58,600.775,"Most -- No Your Honor, most of them actually had them on the books."
1966.395,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,600.775,601.895,"I see, alright."
1966.395,1,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,601.895,614.562,"They -- with summary codification, this one Virginia strove to do this to make a perfect model law and only Georgia thought it was expected from our reading of history that many other States would follow but they just let remain what they had."
1966.395,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,622.135,622.718,Yes.
1966.395,1,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,627.662,634.869,"Because some of the statutes we have were enacted then, all the registration statutes were enacted in 1924 Your Honor."
1966.395,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,648.778,651.071,I see.
1966.395,1,38014,philip_j_hirschkop,,651.071,662.733,"But the present bill, as it is on the books is that law from 1924 and it was entitled ""A Bill to Preserve the Integrity of the White Race"" when it was initially issued."
1966.395,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1257.76,1259.464,Mr. Cohen.
1966.395,2,17550,bernard_s_cohen,,1259.464,1266.333,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.395,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1376.708,1381.254,"Well, surely that's -- there's some limit on that."
1966.395,2,17550,bernard_s_cohen,,1388.145,1400.283,We have conceded that the State may properly regulate marriages and may regulate divorces and indeed they have done so and this Court has upheld certain regulations.
1966.395,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1414.397,1417.522,"No, but you're -- you're not arguing about any race question."
1966.395,2,17550,bernard_s_cohen,,1425.709,1433.049,"Well, I -- I have stated that the Due Process Clause has been subject to many articulations."
1966.395,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1499.893,1513.436,"But some -- some people might think it was reasonable that it's arbitrary and capricious to forbid first cousins to marry each other, state rights to live does have such a law prohibiting first cousins for marrying each other."
1966.395,2,17550,bernard_s_cohen,,1524.859,1535.688,I believe that we run into another step before we can reach that Your Honor and that is the burden of coming forth with the evidence.
1966.395,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1617.079,1621.336,Was there any effort to repeal the law in Virginia?
1966.395,2,17550,bernard_s_cohen,,1621.336,1638.249,"Your Honor, there have not been any efforts and I can tell you from a personal experience that candidates who run for office for the state legislature have told me that they would, under no circumstances, sacrifice their political lives by attempting to introduce such a bill."
1966.395,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1650.756,1668.75,May I ask you if you're arguing the due process question on the theory that even if the Court holds that violates the Equal Protection Clause it is necessary to go on and reach the broad expanses you mentioned?
1966.395,2,17550,bernard_s_cohen,,1668.75,1676.893,"Your Honor, we should be very pleased to have a decision from this Court that all of the statutes are unconstitutional based upon the Equal Protection Clause."
1966.395,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1705.954,1716.793,"I don't see how that would be possible if the Court held, according to the first argument, this is a plain violation of the Equal Protection Clause."
1966.395,2,17550,bernard_s_cohen,,1716.793,1732.515,"Well, I -- I quite agree Your Honor and I -- I do think that the equal protection argument is -- is the strongest argument, that is the correct argument and it is the basis upon which we strongly urge the Court to rule."
1966.395,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1749.216,1749.854,The what?
1966.395,2,17550,bernard_s_cohen,,1749.854,1761.013,"The racial composition certificate, Section 20-50 says that anybody in Virginia who applies to the State registrar vital statistics shall be given a certificate of racial composition."
1966.395,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1874.093,1889.553,"Could that -- could that possibly be fit through if the Court should decide to straight out that the State cannot prevent a marriage, the relationship of marriage between the whites and the blacks because of their color."
1966.395,2,17550,bernard_s_cohen,,1889.553,1890.495,Absolutely not.
1966.395,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1891.504,1892.767,"That would settle it, wouldn't it?"
1966.395,2,17550,bernard_s_cohen,,1892.767,1893.355,"Yes, I think it would."
1966.395,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1893.355,1895.768,That would settle it constitutionally.
1966.395,2,17550,bernard_s_cohen,,1895.768,1903.611,I believe it would.
1966.395,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2210.889,2220.815,What is the order -- have you agreed upon an order or -- or I would think Mr. Marutani would probably be next?
1966.395,2,17550,bernard_s_cohen,,2220.815,2222.797,Probably in my understanding Mr. Chief Justice?
1966.395,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2222.797,2223.15,Yes.
1966.395,3,45436,william_m_marutani,,2231.198,2236.309,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.395,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2894.506,2908.961,"Well, wouldn't you -- wouldn't you concede Mr. Marutani that if the law provided that the other races so-called must not intermarry that the law would be good?"
1966.395,3,45436,william_m_marutani,,2908.961,2910.898,"No, sir."
1966.395,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2943.155,2944.199,Yes.
1966.395,3,45436,william_m_marutani,,2958.661,2964.415,The -- I believe the thrust of that argument sir is that to expose this law for exactly what it is.
1966.395,3,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2969.11,2988.579,"May I ask you, it's not material perhaps in any way, but do you happen to know whether there are laws in Japan which prohibits the other marriage between Japanese and what you might call a Caucasian or white people?"
1966.395,3,45436,william_m_marutani,,2988.579,2996.242,"Well, Mr. Justice Black, I might answer that I do not know except by custom."
1966.395,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3027.188,3029.731,Age and I -- I suppose number of spouses.
1966.395,3,45436,william_m_marutani,,3029.731,3031.288,Yes.
1966.395,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3082.834,3088.048,Mr. McIlwaine.
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3088.048,3091.201,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3215.98,3243.804,"It falls on the question of equal protection, maybe your -- your section which allows anyone with one-sixteenth or less of Indian blood to -- to intermarry with the -- with whites would have some significance, would it not where -- where that this one says, anyone who has got a colored blood in them cannot marry with the white."
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3243.804,3258.976,That would only be significant Mr. Chief Justice with respect to that provision 20-54 which is not before the Court which says that a white person shall not marry any other save a white person or a person having no other admixture of blood and white and American-Indian.
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3280.244,3288.926,"But you do put a restrictions on North American-Indians if they have more than one-sixteenth of Indian blood in them, do you not?"
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3288.926,3289.714,"Yes, sir."
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3318.454,3320.577,You have no Indians in Virginia?
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3320.577,3325.419,"Well, we have Indians Your Honor, but this is the point that we make with respect to them."
1966.395,4,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3455.385,3469.764,Does Virginia have a statute under (Inaudible)?
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3469.764,3470.15,"No, sir."
1966.395,4,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3564.692,3570.234,(Inaudible)
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3570.234,3573.353,"Well, the -- it has been suggested that it would."
1966.395,4,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,3576.911,3577.782,That is beside the point?
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3577.782,3578.192,"Yes, sir."
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3742.103,3745.276,Do you get that from the debates on the Fourteenth Amendment?
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3745.276,3745.874,Yes Your Honor.
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3747.478,3750.637,Where did you -- where did you quote that in your brief?
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3750.637,3759.463,"We get it specifically Your Honor, from the debates leading to the Fourteenth Amendment, the debates on the Freedmen's Bureau Bill and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 --"
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3759.463,3761.511,"That is a little different though, isn't it?"
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,3761.511,3763.267,"Only to this extent, Your Honor."
1966.395,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4030.438,4035.707,"Mr. McIlwaine, what do you with this Court's decision in the McLaughlin against Florida?"
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,4040.433,4041.417,"No sir, we do not."
1966.395,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4059.627,4072.794,I -- I understand that but your adversaries can -- made deal of comfort in McLaughlin in theory and principle and with respect to the specific points you are making here.
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,4072.794,4080.516,"I do not think they take any comfort from McLaughlin with respect to the legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment, Your Honor."
1966.395,4,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,4099.457,4100.224,(Inaudible)
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,4100.224,4112.109,But it has nothing [Laughter] to do with the Fourth -- the legislative history of the Fourteenth Amendment nor do I understand it in McLaughlin that the Court considered this point.
1966.395,4,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,4112.109,4137.685,(Inaudible) narrower simply because the statute in that case is the statute in this case (Inaudible)
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,4137.685,4142.482,Yes sir but we could -- we do not put forward the proposition but the Pace case does justify the statute.
1966.395,4,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,4142.482,4143.158,"Well, I understand."
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,4143.158,4146.283,"I mean, so if they want to take comfort in that, that's --"
1966.395,4,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,4146.283,4146.689,They can be --
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,4146.689,4148.247,-- let them be our guests.
1966.395,4,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,4157.837,4171.554,"Your basic -- your basic position (Inaudible) the jurisdiction of this Court, given what you say is the -- the legislative history of (Voice Overlap) that is your basic --"
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,4171.554,4172.698,That is our basic position.
1966.395,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4173.895,4184.39,"But McLaughlin could not have been decided, perhaps McLaughlin could not have been decided as it was if the court had accepted that premise."
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,4184.39,4185.39,The legislative history?
1966.395,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4185.39,4187.398,Yes.
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,4187.398,4196.528,"Well, I don't know that the legislative history would support the proposition with respect to the statute of lewd and lascivious cohabitation and so forth."
1966.395,4,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,4201.936,4209.787,"The legislative history, it was raised (Inaudible)"
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,4209.787,4220.287,"Well, so far as this case is concerned, we would like to point out one fact which -- or one circumstance which we think is analogous."
1966.395,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4371.84,4387.563,What was the -- what was the basis for the people who spoke to the question or suggesting that the language of the statutes they were then debating did not cover interracial marriage?
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,4387.563,4394.854,"Well, the proponents in saying that he did not cover, the bases placed were two."
1966.395,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4429.475,4440.617,So whether are you -- you're arguing whether or not that first reason hasn't stood up in terms of Fourteenth Amendment adjudication --
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,4440.617,4443.518,"It has no effect on the intention of the Framers, the fact was it has not sustained --"
1966.395,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4443.518,4449.037,-- even if they were wrong -- even if they intended to exclude it for the wrong reason and nevertheless intended to exclude it.
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,4449.037,4449.995,That's correct Your Honor.
1966.395,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4499.271,4506.852,These debates didn't' -- or these statements didn't take place with respect to the Fourteenth Amendment itself that --
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,4506.852,4507.453,No Your Honor.
1966.395,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4511.117,4512.429,That they were contemporaneous?
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,4512.429,4513.722,Absolutely contemporaneous.
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4603.679,4604.602,"Mr. McIlwaine, you may --"
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,4604.602,4605.527,Mr. Chief Justice --
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4605.527,4607.345,-- continue your argument.
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,4607.345,4608.304,-- may it please the Court.
1966.395,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4654.328,4667.486,"Mr. McIlwaine, wouldn't it be pretty clear in the absence, in the absence of the specific legislative history which you refer us?"
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,4689.009,4690.237,"Yes sir, I think it does."
1966.395,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4700.617,4708.038,That is -- that was the very purpose of the Equal Protection Clause coming as it did after the -- in the light of the Civil War.
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,4708.038,4727.657,"That is correct, but it is clear that the Framers understood that in their intention, a law which equally forbade the members of one race to marry members of another race with same penal sanction on both did treat the individuals of both races equally."
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4887.685,4903.72,"There are people who have the same -- same feeling about and interreligious marriages, but because that maybe true, would you think that the State could prohibit people from having interreligious marriages?"
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,4903.72,4911.806,I think that the evidence in support of the prohibition of interracial marriage is stronger than that for the prohibition of interreligious marriage.
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4912.815,4914.474,How can you -- how can you say that?
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,4914.474,4915.689,"Well, we say that principally --"
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4915.689,4917.164,Because -- because you believe that?
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,4917.164,4917.531,"No, sir."
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4927.546,4928.564,Who wrote that?
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,4928.564,4945.392,"This is a book by Dr. Albert I. Gordon, Your Honor, which is characterized as the definitive book by Dr. Albert I.

I suppose one could be argued that one reason that marriages of this kind are sometimes unsuccessful as the existence of the kind of laws that are in issue here and the -- and the attitudes of laws reflect, is that correct?"
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,5172.016,5176.001,"I think it is more the latter, the attitudes that perhaps the laws reflect."
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5240.626,5252.681,Does Mr. Gordon take the position that there is a basic difference in the intelligence in the races?
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,5252.681,5254.542,"No, Sir, I don't understand that he does."
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5287.307,5306.89,I was wondering what you thought of the findings of this great committee of UNESCO where -- where about 20 of greatest anthropologists in the world joined unanimously in making some very cogent findings on -- on the races.
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,5314.336,5317.064,"No, Sir, we take two positions with respect to that."
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5396.112,5402.139,"I hardly think that -- I hardly think that the whole scientific community would agree with Mr. Gordon either, would they?"
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,5402.139,5410.299,"I guess that they would not, Your Honor, but I do not find that on the psycho-sociological aspects there is any disagreement with his work."
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5434.307,5444.358,It seemed to me that the last paragraph of UNESCO's report is rather definite.
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,5478.905,5479.31,And --
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5479.31,5480.856,-- is a definite finding it seems me.
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,5480.856,5506.568,"Yes, sir, but there is equally in the second publication of UNESCO, there is equally stringent criticism of that statement as being an attempt to close a system of knowledge and to state that there is no scientific evidence the other way when that is simply not the case, and the -- this material which we've set forth in our brief if some the second UNESCO's statement."
1966.395,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5598.916,5603.792,"I guess we would agree, wouldn't you, that you can't settle that controversy?"
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,5603.792,5605.005,I would Your Honor.
1966.395,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5639.33,5668.346,"May I ask you this question, aside from all questions from the genetics, psychology, psychiatry, sociology, and everything else aside from all of them, forgetting it for the moment, is there any doubt in your mind that the object of this statute, the basic premise on which they rest, is that the white people are superiors of the colored people and should not be permitted to marry?"
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,5668.346,5673.025,"On these -- the two statutes before Your Honor, I do think that that is not so."
1966.395,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5682.042,5683.392,I'm not talking about what they labeled it.
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,5685.923,5686.746,I think it was --
1966.395,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5686.746,5706.502,"Is there any possible basis, or is -- is not the basic premise on which they read white people are superior to the colored people and that they should not therefore be permitted to marry because it might pollute the white race."
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,5706.502,5709.876,Your Honor I think that there is.
1966.395,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5714.914,5720.146,"Well, do you -- do you would think there's a stronger justification that that is it?"
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,5720.146,5725.364,You mean -- I think historically that the -- that the legislatures that which enacted them had that thought in mind.
1966.395,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5725.364,5725.754,That's right.
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,5725.754,5727.405,"Yes, I think that -- that's clear."
1966.395,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5727.405,5729.178,Basic thing in which they rested.
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,5729.178,5731.512,That -- that's which the original enactments were rested.

1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,5759.012,5759.255,I think --

1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,5771.542,5774.484,"Well, the prohibition Your Honor works both ways."
1966.395,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5774.484,5775.182,Work what?
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,5775.182,5776.696,The prohibition works both ways.
1966.395,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5785.234,5794.912,(Voice Overlap) prohibition is the same but it's the common sense and pragmatic of it not as the result of the old slavery days.
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,5794.912,5795.705,The motivation --
1966.395,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5795.705,5805.038,"And the old feeling that the white man which a period to the colored, which was exactly was the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted to prevent."
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,5805.038,5851.791,"Your Honor, I think it is clear that the motivation of the earlier statutes, if you -- by motivation you undertake to analyze the feelings of the individual members of the legislature that were responsible for the adaption of the statutes, I think that is correct, but I do not see how that can affect the constitutional problem which is presented to this Court where an enactment of the general assembly of Virginia is on trial in which we submit was beyond the scope of Fourteenth Amendment as the first proposition and as a second proposition even if it wasn't beyond the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment and is subjected to due process and equal protection test it is a justifiable regulation in view of today's evidence on the point."
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5851.791,5858.06,"Well, I want to know Mr. McIlwaine if it does work equally as against both."
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,5879.648,5886.395,"We don't have any prohibition against anyone in Virginia, so far as these statutes are concerned marrying a Mongolian or Malay."

1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5899.67,5904.924,But how can you -- how can you -- what prohibits it under Virginia law?
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,5914.988,5917.847,There's nothing -- there's nothing that prohibits the whites either.
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5917.847,5918.373,I beg your pardon.
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,5918.373,5925.214,There's nothing that prohibits the whites either as I've undertaken to say Your Honor that Virginia statute deals with Virginia situation.

1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5974.735,5975.658,That's all what I'm concerned with.
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,5975.658,5989.206,That sort of racial composition Your Honor which constitutes less than one-fourth of 1% does not present the probability of sufficient interracial marriages and sufficient difficulty for the Legislature to be required to deal with.
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5991.692,5998.918,You mean the principle because there are only a few people of one race in Virginia that Virginia can say they have no rights?
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,5998.918,6000.844,"It isn't the amount of saying that they have no rights, Your Honor."

1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,6020.951,6021.714,That is correct.
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6022.411,6023.315,Well --
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,6023.315,6038.97,"And on that point, we have said that a -- this Court has clearly said that a statute is not unconstitutional simply because it does not reach every facet of the evil with which it might conceivably deal."
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6145.738,6148.879,"There's a lot of Indians in the south, aren't there?"

1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,6153.297,6156.092,Very -- very few in Virginia.
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6189.456,6204.436,"I suppose that either of this happened to be one of the 1750 Japanese who are in the state and you have a law of that kind, we would deal with – we would somewhat to mean, would we not?"
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,6204.436,6206.453,"I don't see how we would, Your Honor."
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6213.268,6217.036,It would be probably against Japanese marrying whites.
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,6217.036,6220.234,"No, Sir, not under this statute."
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6220.51,6223.951,I said counsel to think it was rather open question as to whether --

1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6239.52,6244.342,"Does your statute require -- apply only the colored people, Negroes?"

1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6246.371,6247.498,What about colored?
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,6247.498,6253.01,Colored people are defined in Virginia's statute the same way define by the United States Department of Census Your Honor.
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6261.786,6273.99,"Well, but it does -- it does apply, doesn't it, to American-Indians if they -- if anyone has more of the one-sixteenth Indian blood in them, it applies to him, doesn't it?"
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,6273.99,6275.844,"No, Sir, that's 20-54 again."

1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,6280.817,6293.639,"No, sir, because the two statutes, which you have involved in this case, Your Honor, were originally started as a prototype in 1691 and they have been on the Virginia books for more than two centuries."
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6313.372,6316.719,Have you ever declared it to be unconstitutional or --
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,6316.719,6317.089,"No, sir."
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6317.089,6318.142,-- or invalid?
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,6318.142,6324.159,"No, sir, the Virginia courts have not."
1966.395,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6324.159,6344.945,"It's one of the group of statutes, is it not, intended to make it intolerable or impossible or to be very burdensome for white and colored people to marry and for the Japanese and white people to marry and all these others."
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,6348.896,6359.204,"They can be separated Your Honor because the fact that historically and in their coverage and in the context of this case, they are different."
1966.395,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6359.875,6371.378,"Well, they are not all based on the premise of doing something to make it bad or hard or difficult or illegal for the two groups to marry?"
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,6371.378,6374.305,The statute before Your Honors is of that nature --
1966.395,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6374.305,6375.785,I thought not all of the group.
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,6375.785,6396.269,"-- the two groups, but the statute that which they refer which had not mentioned in the Virginia opinion, which has never been applied to them and which is not now applied to them and which this Court we respectfully submit cannot possibly reach is a statute which forbids a white person to marry any other than a white person."
1966.395,4,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6396.269,6400.181,What -- what effect that does have on a white person and a colored person --
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,6400.181,6401.179,It forbid --

1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,6463.552,6474.832,"No, sir because Virginia would not recognize the marriage as void and the offense there would probably be the same type of offense that this Court considered in McLaughlin against Florida and namely illicit cohabitation, a misdemeanor."

1966.395,4,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,7080.448,7082.446,Could I ask you a question before you sit down?
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,7104.621,7107.093,We rationalize a decision upholding this statute --
1966.395,4,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,7107.093,7112.235,"Upholding this statute, assuming now that your historical argument is rejected --"

1966.395,4,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,7113.16,7132.618,"And I'm expressing no view on that or intimating no view or whatever, but starting from that premise, how would you rationalize the decision of uphold in the statute with Brown against the Board?"
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,7132.618,7176.476,"Well, I would say that Brown against the Board of Education proceeded upon the premise that education was fundamental to good citizenship that it was a necessary requirement of good citizenship that all children were in the modern age required to be educated and that the right to be educated in this present today world was one of overriding importance and that right could not be infringed by statute which the court found made the educational opportunities inherently unequal --"
1966.395,4,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,7176.476,7183.068,Wouldn't now -- wouldn't you say the right of marry and to bear a children as equally important?
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,7183.068,7216.054,"I would say that the right to marry if I was rationalizing a decision upholding it would under the decision of this Court in Meyer against Nebraska and Pierce against Society of Sisters and Skinner against Oklahoma, but also say that the right to marry is a right but there is no requirement that people marry and therefore, a statute which forbids marriage is not the same as forbidding children to receive education."
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7356.247,7374.868,"Mr. McIlwaine, didn't -- didn't we in the segregation cases have also argued to us what was supposed to be scientific evidence to the -- to the effect the whites would be injured by having to go to school with the -- with the Negroes?"
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,7374.868,7375.561,"Your Honor, I --"
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7375.561,7379.932,Isn't that -- isn't the same argument you're making here?
1966.395,4,39906,r_d_mcilwaine_iii,,7379.932,7382.12,"Yes sir, it is."
1966.395,4,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7417.984,7420.554,I see.

1966.395,5,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7936.102,7950.264,"You're almost in the same dilemma yourself, aren't you, according the Virginia legislative history of Virginia statute, but finding that the legislative history of Fourteenth Amendment (Voice Overlap) report."
1966.395,5,17550,bernard_s_cohen,,7950.264,7953.507,"No, but I -- no, I don't feel that dilemma at all Your Honor."
