1971.70-32,0,37058,norton_j_come,,44.546,49.344,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-32,1,36597,mortimer_riemer,,1647.65,1657.855,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1971.70-32,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1735.962,1737.282,May I ask (Inaudible)
1971.70-32,1,36597,mortimer_riemer,,1737.282,1737.922,Yes sir.
1971.70-32,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1737.922,1742.226,The retirees remained Union members?
1971.70-32,1,36597,mortimer_riemer,,1742.226,1747.506,"They remained Your Honor, Mr. Justice Brennan, they remained honorary members."
1971.70-32,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1751.478,1752.486,No dues to pay?
1971.70-32,1,36597,mortimer_riemer,,1752.486,1756.54,They pay no dues.
1971.70-32,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1763.4,1765.611,"But not participate, not to vote?"
1971.70-32,1,36597,mortimer_riemer,,1765.611,1766.943,But not to vote.
1971.70-32,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1766.943,1775.991,"If the Union has something in the nature of club facilities as some of them do, are they permitted to use all those facilities generally?"
1971.70-32,1,36597,mortimer_riemer,,1775.991,1784.468,"Well, Your Honor, some years ago the Union was going to start such a program, but it was abandoned because of cost."
1971.70-32,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1798.778,1803.125,Was the plan A funded by the insurance?
1971.70-32,1,36597,mortimer_riemer,,1803.125,1804.709,"Yes, the insurance program?"
1971.70-32,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1811.345,1818.628,"Of course some unions do have a rather extensive recreational facilities and problems for retirees, do they not?"
1971.70-32,1,36597,mortimer_riemer,,1818.628,1822.042,"Yes indeed, they do, Your Honor."
1971.70-32,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2201.63,2210.038,"But you had a contractual right to keep the employer from canceling, from terminating unilaterally some contracts?"
1971.70-32,1,36597,mortimer_riemer,,2210.038,2212.017,Yes.
1971.70-32,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2228.164,2235.024,Was there any kind of a grievance arbitration provision in the said agreement?
1971.70-32,1,36597,mortimer_riemer,,2235.024,2236.56,Yes in the side agreement --
1971.70-32,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2236.56,2242.31,If there were disagreements that they would arbitrate or something?
1971.70-32,1,36597,mortimer_riemer,,2242.31,2244.419,There was a never any attempt to arbitrate.
1971.70-32,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2253.996,2270.67,"Is it normally an 8 (a) (5) type or 8 (a) (5) type violation if an employer refuses to follow the grievance procedure in a collective bargaining contract normally, isn’t it?"
1971.70-32,1,36597,mortimer_riemer,,2270.67,2275.583,"I should think it would be, but I do not think it is normally right."
1971.70-32,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2290.82,2302.369,(Inaudible) what interest of the active employee were affected by the post company provisions?
1971.70-32,1,36597,mortimer_riemer,,2302.369,2314.999,"Well, the interest to the act of the employees, Your Honor, Mr. Justice Brennan effected by this, it seems to me somewhat of manciple view."
1971.70-32,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2387.739,2388.135,Was this --
1971.70-32,1,36597,mortimer_riemer,,2388.135,2390.048,-- one generates another.
1971.70-32,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2390.048,2416.428,"Is this to suggest that when they arrive at age 65, the active employees were mandatorily retired and that these provisions would be applicable to them as retirees and that they may be less advantages, then were they able now to negotiate as they were bale to negotiate for their own condition after age 65?"
1971.70-32,1,36597,mortimer_riemer,,2416.428,2419.597,"I believe that is true, Your Honor."
1971.70-32,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2439.317,2440.937,"Yes, and hopefully more?"
1971.70-32,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2440.937,2448.711,Do you think this means the suggestion that the active membership of the Union might sell the retirees down the river sometime?
1971.70-32,1,36597,mortimer_riemer,,2448.711,2451.774,"Mr. Chief Justice, absolutely not."
1971.70-32,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2451.774,2460.573,I see you think it meets the suggestion and answers that there is no likelihood that the actives are going to sell all the retirees down the river?
1971.70-32,1,36597,mortimer_riemer,,2460.573,2475.634,"Mr. Chief Justice, I have complete confidence that the Union would not permit active employees to sell retired employees down river."
1971.70-32,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2480.14,2481.432,And if they did --
1971.70-32,1,36597,mortimer_riemer,,2481.432,2481.709,And if they did --
1971.70-32,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2481.709,2490.724,"-- there is some possibility if they did, at least if not a 301 action that would be an accountability as fiduciary, would it not?"
1971.70-32,1,36597,mortimer_riemer,,2490.724,2500.478,"There would be an accountability, legally and politically."
1971.70-32,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2500.478,2501.154,Mr. Farmer?
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,2501.154,2506.009,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please Court.
1971.70-32,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2606.134,2617.752,"I suppose also it is common now, is it not Mr. Farmer that retirement benefits for the present employees are a mandatory subject matter?"
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,2617.752,2619.208,No question in that.
1971.70-32,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2652.61,2660.669,"Mr. Framer as a practical matter when you are dealing with a large number of retired employees, this was fairly large number, 190 --"
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,2660.669,2661.261,190.
1971.70-32,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2661.261,2665.574,190.
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,2685.148,2686.786,"Well, Your Honor --"
1971.70-32,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2686.786,2691.047,"And if they did, could they require the employer to negotiate with?"
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,2691.047,2693.249,"Not in my opinion, Your Honor."
1971.70-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2733.047,2758.526,"Mr. Farmer, suppose the Union during negotiation can make a demand upon the company for a provision in the collective bargaining agreement that no changes should be made after retirement and the retirement benefits except in collective bargaining with the Union, would that demand be a mandatory subject to bargaining?"
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,2758.526,2759.855,I do not believe so.
1971.70-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2759.855,2761.251,Why not?
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,2761.251,2762.545,Because they have these --
1971.70-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2762.545,2764.293,They are bargaining now for the active employee?
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,2764.293,2771.414,They could bargain for the active employee that there would be no change made in their benefits after retirement --
1971.70-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2771.414,2773.177,Without collective bargaining with Union --
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,2773.177,2791.794,"Now that without collective bargain with the Union I think then an attempt to project the bargaining obligation into the retirement situation, I think they could even bargain that if the cost of living went up, the benefits would automatically escalate."
1971.70-32,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2791.794,2792.908,And some of them have done that?
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,2792.908,2806.198,"Yes and that again is perfectly valid bargaining, but the point is that once a bargain is made while the employees working as to what his benefits would be, now this is the part of this total compensation."
1971.70-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2922.983,2932.407,My Brennan (Inaudible) the provision in the contract that the retirement benefits shall not be changed under any circumstance.
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,2932.407,2933.1,Yes.
1971.70-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2933.1,2945.018,"And it is changed, why does the Union have a right to negotiate about that change because that change effects the present employees too."
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,2945.018,2947.172,I do not think the -- if the contract --
1971.70-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2947.172,2951.37,Don't you agree that it effects the present employees?
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,2951.37,2954.798,Change in the benefits of retired -- people already retired?
1971.70-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2954.798,2955.808,Yes.
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,2955.808,2957.37,I do not quite see -- on that.
1971.70-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2957.37,2960.005,"Well, if change is from two to three-dollars?"
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,2960.005,2960.711,Yes.
1971.70-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2960.711,2966.591,"And I am about to retire next week, I got an interest in that, haven't I?"
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,2966.591,2972.053,It depends on whether that change is to be applied to you or to someone who has already retired.
1971.70-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2979.407,2980.098,(Inaudible)
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,2980.098,2996.64,On time in which they have retired and if I as the company and the Union agree to go back to the 1960 retirees and give them an extra three dollars a month that would not automatically apply to you as an active employee unless the agreement so provides.
1971.70-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2996.64,3005.806,"But the Union has negotiated a binding contract, and something has broken it, right?"
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,3005.806,3007.221,I am sorry I did not quite get the valid point.
1971.70-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3007.221,3021.296,"Is it true that where the Union negotiates a binding contract concerning retirement benefits and the employer breaks it, the Union has nothing that it can do?"
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,3021.296,3023.146,No that is not true Mr. Justice Marshall.
1971.70-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3023.146,3025.025,What can the Union do?
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,3025.025,3028.71,It can sue for breach of the agreement under Section 301.
1971.70-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3028.71,3030.195,Contract Act?
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,3030.195,3030.995,Yes.
1971.70-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3030.995,3034.586,And I assume you say that the retiree can also?
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,3034.586,3035.292,Yes.
1971.70-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3035.292,3036.272,Go on contract?
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,3036.272,3037.181,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.70-32,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3037.181,3040.365,But not now?
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,3040.365,3051.694,Nothing else except possible arbitration that is provided for which could be provided and is provided in some cases.
1971.70-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3088.985,3097.11,But you would contend that the employer has the right either to increase or decrease the --
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,3097.11,3098.028,Oh I do not --
1971.70-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3098.028,3099.79,-- the benefits to a retired employees?
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,3099.79,3104.74,-- oh I do not -- I think he has the right to increase and if they accept the -- if they want to accept the benefits --
1971.70-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3104.74,3111.659,But what if they have (Inaudible) -- your premise is the Union in this side agreement?
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,3111.659,3113.49,You are talking about this particular --
1971.70-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3113.49,3117.621,"No, I mean the parties to the contract, to the Union and the company?"
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,3117.621,3124.403,Normally agree to pay four dollars a month as a contribution towards this medical insurance.
1971.70-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3124.403,3125.059,Alright.
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,3125.059,3127.21,And with the right to reduce it to two dollars.
1971.70-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3127.21,3127.902,Alright.
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,3127.902,3137.653,"The company did not -- the company started to or acted as ever talked as if they were going to change that agreement, but they did not."
1971.70-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3137.653,3148.4,Oh let's assume that the company comes along and just unilaterally increases its contributions for retired employees to five-dollars?
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,3148.4,3150.642,"Well, I think it definitely can do that."
1971.70-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3150.642,3153.49,Or the Union says that (Voice overlap)
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,3153.49,3155.062,Not if it hurt the Union.
1971.70-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3155.062,3160.381,"Well, that's taking -- there is less money available for active employees?"
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,3160.381,3166.381,"Well, that's a separate interest. Bargaining opens up a Pandora's box, that I can't see the into --"
1971.70-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3166.381,3168.068,I am not talking about the bargaining part.
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,3175.359,3181.8,"Well if the increase is a violation of that agreement, certainly they have a remedy."
1971.70-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3189.431,3202.952,"But if Union -- but if the Union is right that it has a substantial interest in presenting increases of which to retired employees which would take money away from actives, then it is a breach of a contract?"
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,3202.952,3212.503,"I agree, but I do not agree that the company had -- that the Union has much of an interest in controlling what happens to people that is doesn't represent."
1971.70-32,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3270.862,3290.699,If you read the Union's claim here on the Board’s position as permitting the Union to have a strike issue if the Union made a demand for an increase in pensions of retired employees and that is refuses.
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,3290.699,3291.912,No questions.
1971.70-32,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3291.912,3292.114,They can implement --
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,3292.114,3324.163,"If the Board decision is right, they could strike the force more benefits for retirees and even if they had no benefits, the people who retire without benefits of any kind presumably under this decisions of the Board the Union could demand that at the program of benefits be instituted for people who have retired since 1950 or whatever date and the company would have to negotiate that the Union did not like what the company did was willing to do they strike in all plants."
1971.70-32,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3324.163,3327.244,Mr. Farmer does this issue really go that far.
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,3338.112,3345.214,I do not believe if that is the Board's position and I would say that if that were the position that the it would be pretty close to being correct.
1971.70-32,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3400.245,3407.294,"I did not read it as that type of claim, but I will ask counsel in rebuttal to clarify that."
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,3433.204,3433.958,"Yes, Your Honor --"
1971.70-32,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3433.958,3435.953,"That'd be a very important distinction, wouldn't it?"
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,3435.953,3465.557,"Yes and I would like to hear the answer too because as I understand it if claim is brought on that, that the Union represents these people, just as it does the active employees and they can initiate negotiations for retirees same as -- and the active employees don't have to wait until the company does something or initiate something, that this becomes a part of the Union’s representation rights and a part of the employer's mandatory bargaining obligation."
1971.70-32,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3625.064,3631.668,Mr. Farmer you may continue.
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,3631.668,3634.162,Thank you and may it please the Court.
1971.70-32,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3832.277,3849.643,Mr. Farmer in your view would a Union honor a picket line consisting exclusively of the retired employees who were picketing for an increase in pensions?
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,3849.643,3852.033,I think they very well might.
1971.70-32,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4056.7,4064.97,Is the federal (Inaudible) consideration for their having a bargaining representative of some kind?
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,4064.97,4076.687,"Well I think if they ever have one that it ought to be one they select themselves and of course the Board hasn't answered that question, if they are a part of some bargaining set up."
1971.70-32,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4193.182,4217.646,"Suppose Mr. Farmer that these 190 employees had managed in some way to get together and engage a lawyer and designate him as their bargaining representative as does the group for an active union, the effective Union."
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,4225.523,4230.412,Yes I say it is not because they are not employees.
1971.70-32,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4304.298,4324.181,"If the employer arbitrarily cut the pension in half as the case, what in your view would be remedy if the employees would be limited to sue as third party beneficiaries of the contract previously made?"
1971.70-32,2,25276,guy_farmer,,4324.181,4336.347,I would say it would be limited to a suit for violation of the agreement which could be a class action or what we have here under Section 301.
1971.70-32,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4485.238,4489.093,Thank you Mr. Farmer.
1971.70-32,3,37058,norton_j_come,,4495.082,4534.052,"Yes Your Honor, I think might as well start with that precise holding of the Board in this case that at pages 46 and 47 of the appendix and the Board reading down toward the middle there says “accordingly we find that by unilaterally modifying its medical insurance plan for retired employees respondent violated Section 8 (a) (5) and one of the Act."
1971.70-32,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4534.052,4538.717,Excuse me Mr. Come I do not find the page 46 --
1971.70-32,3,37058,norton_j_come,,4538.717,4572.966,"46, the last sentence of the first paragraph accordingly and then at the bottom of the next paragraph the Board says we hold only on the record this case that the respondent violated statute by making unilateral changes and then finding three on page 47 by instituting unilateral adjustments in the health insurance plan for its retired employees."
1971.70-32,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4611.1,4623.144,"In other words, you mean everything is going along fine but suddenly the Union comes in and the employer says we would like now to bargain and reopen the matter of pensions."
1971.70-32,3,37058,norton_j_come,,4626.768,4626.999,Assuming --
1971.70-32,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4626.999,4634.339,The provision is that even in that case it'd be mandatory upon the company to sit down and bargain --?
1971.70-32,3,37058,norton_j_come,,4634.339,4638.635,I think that is the logic of the Board's holding here.
1971.70-32,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4659.517,4661.117,What does this mean?
1971.70-32,3,37058,norton_j_come,,4678.033,4686.425,"I think what does means is, Your Honor is that as I pointed out in my facts, the contract here had two years I believe to go."
1971.70-32,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4686.425,4687.498,You mean the collective bargaining?
1971.70-32,3,37058,norton_j_come,,4687.498,4689.401,The collective bargaining agreement.
1971.70-32,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4720.307,4724.34,But the emphasis in that sentence should be on the phrase trade mid-term?
1971.70-32,3,37058,norton_j_come,,4724.34,4725.4,That is correct.
1971.70-32,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4725.4,4738.719,"As you rightly say I think in answer to the basic question when the Board said that this is a violation of 8 (a) (5), it necessarily said that this is a subject of a mandatory collective bargaining."
1971.70-32,3,37058,norton_j_come,,4738.719,4740.25,That is correct and of course the way the.
1971.70-32,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4740.25,4742.154,(Voice Overlap) have been any unilateral change?
1971.70-32,3,37058,norton_j_come,,4742.154,4766.976,That is correct but of course the way that the problem is most likely to arise is judged by the experience in the area is going to be in the context of your having negotiated a health and welfare or pension plan that is going to cover active employees and retirees.
1971.70-32,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4823.264,4826.334,The legal principle here does not boils down that.
1971.70-32,3,37058,norton_j_come,,4847.587,4882.939,"But there is nothing to prevent him however from improving those adjustments and those provisions and the question is, is it healthier for collective bargaining relationship plus the impact, including the impact on the active employees for these improvements to be negotiated as a result of the same kind of bilateral negotiations that went into formulating them to begin with or to permit the employer to make these changes unilaterally."
1971.70-32,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4882.939,4895.836,"Now I do not like (Inaudible) your submission of the question, but I do not think it is a matter of policy decision about whether or not it's healthy or not and I do not think you really think so either, it's a matter that law provides."
1971.70-32,3,37058,norton_j_come,,4895.836,4899.297,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1971.70-32,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4899.297,4900.256,Mr. Come --
1971.70-32,3,37058,norton_j_come,,4900.256,4933.884,(Inaudible) Your Honor I just want to say without being overly argumentative that part of the reason in that governs whether you conclude that a subject is a mandatory subject of collective bargaining or not is whether or not it is likely to be a bone of contention between labor and management and that it makes for industrial peace rather than strike subjective to the collective bargaining processes of the Act and that is all that I meant by health Your Honor.
1971.70-32,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4933.884,4945.544,"Let me see if I can explore how far this logical extension I think is what you can call it, the logic of the Board's present position."
1971.70-32,3,37058,norton_j_come,,4992.544,4997.941,"In the Board's view Your Honor as I understand it, it could."
1971.70-32,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5000.81,5002.361,(Inaudible) the only concern with whether --
1971.70-32,3,37058,norton_j_come,,5002.361,5002.648,Yes.
1971.70-32,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5002.648,5012.657,"Whether they can at certain they opens up a whole new area of industrial strike, doesn't it?"
1971.70-32,3,37058,norton_j_come,,5012.657,5029.299,"Well, I think that the same argument could have been made and was made by the employers in 1947 when they were protesting the extension of the ex-bargaining requirements, the bargaining over pensions and health and welfare benefits."
1971.70-32,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5075.805,5088.433,"Mr. Come if the employer during the term of collective bargaining contract unilaterally lowers wages contrary to contract without bargaining, that certainly is a breach of contract, isn't it, an unfair labor practice?"
1971.70-32,3,37058,norton_j_come,,5088.433,5092.402,"Yes the Board would find that, that is a violation of 8 (d)."
1971.70-32,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5093.653,5094.313,8 (d)--?
1971.70-32,3,37058,norton_j_come,,5094.313,5099.045,8 (d) says that you cannot make a modification.
1971.70-32,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5099.045,5101.536,"Alright, but it is not an 8 (a) (5)?"
1971.70-32,3,37058,norton_j_come,,5101.536,5104.679,Well an 8 (a) (5) via 8 (d).
1971.70-32,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5104.679,5106.139,But now no other reason?
1971.70-32,3,37058,norton_j_come,,5106.139,5107.323,No other reason.
1971.70-32,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5107.323,5110.142,"And that is the remedy to restore it, isn't it?"
1971.70-32,3,37058,norton_j_come,,5110.142,5110.687,Yes and --
1971.70-32,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5110.687,5116.653,That is the only remedy plus do not do it again?
1971.70-32,3,37058,norton_j_come,,5116.653,5121.544,"I believe that is right on that aspect oft the issue, thank you."
1971.70-32,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5121.544,5123.49,Thank You Mr. Come.
