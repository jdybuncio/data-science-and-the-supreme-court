1972.71-708,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,66.882,"We'll hear arguments next in number 71-708, Trafficante against Metropolitan Life and others."
1972.71-708,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,70.173,73.934,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-708,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,416.413,427.758,"Would you suggest them that persons living in North-West Arkansas, where there is present on only one race are suffering deprivations of the kind you are suggesting?"
1972.71-708,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,427.758,431.04,I don't think I can answer them Mr. Justice in the abstract.
1972.71-708,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,481.159,497.397,"Well, I read your Doctor Expertâ€™s affidavit and it seemed to me it would be applicable to the Eskimo who lives only among Eskimos or someone living in the heart of Africa living only among blacks?"
1972.71-708,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,497.397,505.898,There are of course injuries which the constitution and the laws are simply powerless to readdress.
1972.71-708,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,533.298,542.802,"Now that I have already interrupted you, there is a companion cases that are not involved in those who allegedly were denied entrance to Parkmerced?"
1972.71-708,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,542.802,544.082,There is another case in which --
1972.71-708,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,544.082,545.527,What is the status of that case?
1972.71-708,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,545.527,551.088,"That case is now pending before the District Court, it is in the discovery phase of the litigation."
1972.71-708,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,551.088,553.422,They were not instituted simultaneously?
1972.71-708,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,553.422,556.79,"No, they were not instituted simultaneously at all."
1972.71-708,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,659.866,684.007,"Isn't that something that must be read with the other Section, provision of the statute that thrust of the statutory scheme is to see that all citizens will have the same right to inherit purchase, lease, sell, hold, convey property."
1972.71-708,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,693.462,697.293,"In other words, Mr. Chief Justice I take it you are referring us now to 1982 --"
1972.71-708,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,697.293,697.431,Right.
1972.71-708,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,697.431,699.704,-- as opposed to Title 8.
1972.71-708,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,724.558,727.942,You are speaking now of the petitioners who seek standing.
1972.71-708,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,743.353,745.098,"Mr. Chief Justice, I've meant to respond."
1972.71-708,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,912.502,919.69,"That's the question, isn't it, whether they suffered the kind of injury that's contemplated to give before them standing?"
1972.71-708,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,919.69,922.835,"Yes, I would agree with the Court, I think that is exactly the question."
1972.71-708,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,922.835,931.833,"But you say, that doesn't -- certainly the statute must mean something more than having a feeling, something of substance, isn't it?"
1972.71-708,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,931.833,953.835,"Well, I think we have come in terms of the analysis of standing in this country to note that there are injuries beyond economic ones, which merit judicial protection, aesthetic values, environmental values, spiritual values, all have been held properly justiciable or proper as a basis for finding injury to assert standing."
1972.71-708,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1057.358,1069.597,"Mr. Bomse, in a statutory piece like this, how much help do you think you can get from related adjudication as to standing under other statutes or perhaps on constitutional question."
1972.71-708,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1073.316,1084.674,"Well, I think that is of course true, but one must presume I think that Congress had in mind the interpretation that has been given to the term persons aggrieved."
1972.71-708,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1134.454,1150.985,"Well now those might be good reasons to urge upon Congress for specifically granting them standing, but do you suggest that the utterances of some of the prime authors support that view?"
1972.71-708,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1173.999,1181.946,"Yes, but the fact that is one thing that, that is one thing that is about does not in my view suggest that it is not about something else."
1972.71-708,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1212.361,1235.287,"But it didn't Senator Hart's language address itself directly to this point when he said that as these provisions now on stand, they reveal a congressional intent, a clear congressional intent to permit and even encourage litigation by those who cannot afford to redress specific wrong done to them because of the color of their skin."
1972.71-708,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1247.789,1249.735,I do not think so Mr. Chief Justice.
1972.71-708,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1264.889,1280.223,"Now this related litigation that you mentioned in response to a question, will that litigation -- is that litigation such in its scope that all of the relief sought here could be accomplished there?"
1972.71-708,0,40984,stephen_v_bomse,,1280.223,1281.593,We can't tell at this point.
1972.71-708,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1321.57,1328.637,Mr. Wallace.
1972.71-708,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1328.637,1332.795,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-708,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1439.503,1448.078,Mr. Wallace are the words to which you are referring any person who claims to have been injured on page two of your brief?
1972.71-708,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1448.078,1450.96,"That is correct, that is the standing provision."
1972.71-708,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1450.96,1453.12,Any person who claims to have been injured.
1972.71-708,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1453.12,1456.508,By a discriminatory housing practice within the meaning of the --
1972.71-708,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1456.508,1466.937,I suppose if we read those words literally as you suggest we should anyway that would give anybody standing because any person could claim to have been injured?
1972.71-708,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1466.937,1475.017,"Well, we don't suggest that the literal reading is the end all, but it's certainly is the beginning of the interpretation."
1972.71-708,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1475.017,1478.839,But you agree that literally those words would have been (Voice Overlap)
1972.71-708,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1478.839,1480.531,They would confer a standing.
1972.71-708,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1480.531,1484.461,(Voice Overlap) Not only come from a different city and claim to have been injured?
1972.71-708,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1484.461,1487.239,He could make that claim obviously.
1972.71-708,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1548.744,1561.805,"But could it, to pursue them Mr. Wallace, would they have -- would it be necessary that they be even residents of the same state, let alone the same city, if they claim the injury?"
1972.71-708,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1564.807,1568.809,"Under the literal terns of the provision, it would not be necessary."
1972.71-708,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1802.055,1823.425,"Mr. Wallace, if the Court were to grant to these plaintiffs standing, plaintiffs who are deprived of the right to live in an integrated community as I understand their language here, how can we define community in a way that will play some limits on the concept of standing?"
1972.71-708,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1823.425,1854.407,"Well, of course, the only issue before the Court in this case, involves complainants who themselves are living in the particular complex or development that they claim has been discriminating and where they have that close identification with the particular development or community such that I think there is a reasonable expectation that their reputations could be injured and the like."
1972.71-708,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1890.793,1910.917,"But we would have great trouble, wouldn't we, in trying to decide this case and say it does include a tenant that Parkmerced under the standing clause and try to give some principle reason for it without saying that it either does or does not include the man three blocks away?"
1972.71-708,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1910.917,1937.052,"Well, I think the thrust of this aspect of the legislative history is that Congress believed that whites and blacks are injured by being forced to live in artificially segregated neighborhoods and if someone comes forward and shows that injury, HUD officials have said to me that they believe that would be within the terms of their regulations to a person who has standing."
1972.71-708,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1952.76,1959.341,"Mr. Wallace, you have used the words 'particular complex.'"
1972.71-708,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1969.05,1974.706,If the complex across the street is discriminating within the meaning of the Act?
1972.71-708,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1974.706,1979.19,"Yes, but these plaintiffs have standing to complain about the complex across the street?"
1972.71-708,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1979.19,1984.013,"Well, that question is not in this case."
1972.71-708,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2036.891,2039.618,"Well, you can see, I am troubled as to the limitations of this."
1972.71-708,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2043.054,2051.271,"Mr. Wallace, do you rely on Section 1982 on the standing issue or do you address yourself only to Title 8?"
1972.71-708,1,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2051.271,2055.777,"In our brief, we discussed only the question under Title 8."
1972.71-708,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2112.379,2114.537,Thank you Mr. Wallace.
1972.71-708,2,39648,richard_j_kilmartin,,2116.029,2120.519,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-708,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2308.138,2311.969,Is there any question with they have standing?
1972.71-708,2,39648,richard_j_kilmartin,,2311.969,2312.936,"None, whatever, Your Honor."
1972.71-708,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2550.225,2551.142,Mr. Kilmartin.
1972.71-708,2,39648,richard_j_kilmartin,,2551.142,2551.697,"Yes, sir."
1972.71-708,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2551.697,2559.388,"Let me put this hypothetical to you, it's Mrs. Carr here, who is a member of the minority race, isn't she?"
1972.71-708,2,39648,richard_j_kilmartin,,2559.388,2559.975,"Yes, she is Sir."
1972.71-708,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2559.975,2575.847,Suppose that there were some vacant apartments and she had a dependent relative who she would like to have come in to the complex and the admission of that relative was refused.
1972.71-708,2,39648,richard_j_kilmartin,,2581.62,2591.938,"I would say as the statute stands now, yes it would, but certainly the dependent relative would have every right to assert his or her rights under the statute."
1972.71-708,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2609.522,2623.559,"(Inaudible) that Mrs. Carr even though these were her dependent and she could show it to be much more convenient, less expensive to have her at hand rather than across town?"
1972.71-708,2,39648,richard_j_kilmartin,,2623.559,2637.638,"I would say, Your Honor, that the statute would not extend to that situation, but once again I believe it would be academic because of the fact that the person himself or herself would have direct rights under the Act and could obtain the apartment."
1972.71-708,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2637.638,2653.536,"Well if Mrs. Carr in that illustration was so disposed, again coming down to the practical matter as you spoke up earlier, all would need to be done to assure a standing would be to join the dependent relatives as plaintiffs, isn't that so?"
1972.71-708,2,39648,richard_j_kilmartin,,2653.536,2653.663,That's correct.
1972.71-708,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2653.663,2663.084,"And then there being one plaintiff withstanding, there probably wouldn't be too much profit in people challenging, standing of other plaintiffs?"
1972.71-708,2,39648,richard_j_kilmartin,,2663.084,2683.745,"That's correct, Your Honor, or Mrs. Carr to take her dependent relative down to the office of HUD to initiate administrative proceedings under 810 of the Fair Housing Act and if that failed and then that relative could file an action either in Federal or State Court under section 812."
1972.71-708,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2984.028,2989.249,"Isn't that the Congress couldn't have conferred standing here, had it desired to do so?"
1972.71-708,2,39648,richard_j_kilmartin,,2989.249,2992.634,"No, no, Your Honor, I don't suggest that at all."
1972.71-708,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3014.451,3022.792,"Well, then would you state again just very briefly, summarize your case or controversy argument, I don't believe I fully apprehended what you meant by it?"
1972.71-708,2,39648,richard_j_kilmartin,,3022.792,3043.456,"Yes, in Data Processing and as well as other cases, but Data Processing zeros in on it, as I understand it, as I read it, the first inquiry is there a case or controversy and to find that there is a case or controversy, you have to have an injury, in fact, to the person complaining, that's the first inquiry."
1972.71-708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3073.551,3084.992,"Didn't I understand Mr. Wallace to suggest that the HUD entertains that -- complaints of this kind of entry, under this statute, am I wrong about that?"
1972.71-708,2,39648,richard_j_kilmartin,,3084.992,3087.116,HUD entertained these complaints?
1972.71-708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3087.116,3090.78,"HUD entertains complaints of this kind, didn't he tell us that?"
1972.71-708,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3090.78,3092.777,For administrative relief.
1972.71-708,2,39648,richard_j_kilmartin,,3092.777,3095.224,"Well, yes he did say that, Your Honor."
1972.71-708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3095.224,3105.836,At least -- that agency at least thinks that this kind of complaint of injury is an injury?
1972.71-708,2,39648,richard_j_kilmartin,,3105.836,3112.24,"Well, I think there is more committed to HUD under Title 8 than is committed to private plaintiffs, Your Honor."
1972.71-708,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3131.424,3145.501,"But one of their complaints is I got it is that Congress has not supplied HUD and the other establishments with enough manpower to do the job and that's why they want the aid of private attorneys general, isn't it?"
1972.71-708,2,39648,richard_j_kilmartin,,3145.501,3178.157,"I think that's the thrust of their argument, Your Honor, and that's what I mentioned at the outset of my remarks, but they will not be denied the aid of the private sector in my opinion, one with by denying standing to these plaintiffs because as demonstrated, the minute these plaintiffs fail there is always the Burbridge type of plaintiffs, who will be collected and will file a suit and in those cases, a case such as Burbridge, you have issues that are real, that are live, not just abstract contentions such as the petitioners play -- present here but you have real live issues."
1972.71-708,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3193.963,3217.731,"But supposing Mr. Kilmartin that the Burbridge plaintiffs sue to enjoin unlawful discrimination under the Act and it turns out that, in fact, there was no unlawful discrimination against them and yet these plaintiffs know of another refusal on the part of Parkmerced which was an unlawful discrimination."
1972.71-708,2,39648,richard_j_kilmartin,,3226.467,3228.885,"By these plaintiffs, you are referring to the Trafficante, Your Honor?"
1972.71-708,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3228.885,3231.264,Right.
1972.71-708,2,39648,richard_j_kilmartin,,3231.264,3240.953,"I would say, no, butt their redress would be to go and collect the plaintiffs who have been discriminated against and let them file an action on their own, in their own name."
1972.71-708,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3240.953,3257.775,"Well, but I mean if this type of lawsuit were allowed some actual incidence of discrimination would be redressed that might not be picked up in a Burbridge type suit because not every guy who is discriminated against is necessarily going to sue?"
1972.71-708,2,39648,richard_j_kilmartin,,3257.775,3261.038,"That's correct, that's correct."
1972.71-708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3344.042,3345.806,May I ask you something?
1972.71-708,2,39648,richard_j_kilmartin,,3351.39,3352.097,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3352.097,3368.969,"-- is talking about a person who could make to what, who may do what, who may file a complaint with the secretary and it's only in the event that the secretary is unable to do anything about it that then that person may commence a civil action."
1972.71-708,2,39648,richard_j_kilmartin,,3383.417,3383.734,"Well, Your Honor."
1972.71-708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3383.734,3395.425,"And if they are, then it [Attempt to Laughter] seems logically the statute means that they also have standing to bring suit when those things happen and the secretary has been able to attend involuntary compliance and so forth."
1972.71-708,2,39648,richard_j_kilmartin,,3395.425,3406.135,"Yes, I think so to put it in proper context, we would have to know exactly what HUD did with such complaints and what they intended to do with them or what they are trying to do."
1972.71-708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3409.965,3416.119,"Well that might be, but if you are right, if you are and the Court of Appeals below was right."
1972.71-708,2,39648,richard_j_kilmartin,,3426.289,3428.611,"Well, I -- that's (Voice Overlap)"
1972.71-708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3428.611,3432.027,"Am I not right, that is what (a) talks about filing complaints, isn't it?"
1972.71-708,2,39648,richard_j_kilmartin,,3432.027,3439.086,"That's right, but I think that HUD could accept -- to illustrate by exaggeration, HUD could accept it in informative context."
1972.71-708,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3439.086,3443.059,"Well, maybe they could but they wouldn't have to if the Court of Appeals is right, I suggest?"
1972.71-708,2,39648,richard_j_kilmartin,,3443.059,3446.585,"That is correct, I suggest that also."
1972.71-708,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3520.756,3522.972,Mr. Shea.
1972.71-708,3,40467,robert_m_shea,,3522.972,3526.134,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1972.71-708,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3640.616,3643.458,"Are you saying, let me interrupt you there."
1972.71-708,3,40467,robert_m_shea,,3655.481,3663.624,"Yes, sir.Mr. Chief Justice, the ability to sue in respect of a pattern or practice of discrimination is rested --"
1972.71-708,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3663.624,3665.469,"Affirmative to the Attorney General, isn't it?"
1972.71-708,3,40467,robert_m_shea,,3665.469,3676.192,"Indeed, and I am paraphrasing the statutory language, if he reasonably believes that there has been a pattern or practice of resistance to the full enjoyment of rights."
1972.71-708,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3811.6,3824.862,"Mr. Shea at that point, there is something in the record, perhaps in the pleadings that in 1970 of some 6,600 people in the complex, one-half or 1% were non-white."
1972.71-708,3,40467,robert_m_shea,,3824.862,3828.466,"I have no reason to question that statistic, sir."
1972.71-708,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3828.466,3832.69,Does the record show whether the situation is the same today?
1972.71-708,3,40467,robert_m_shea,,3834.649,3838.823,"There is no record other than the complaint and ancillary papers, Your Honor."
1972.71-708,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4038.865,4044.155,Mr. Shea is this a matter of the Trial Court and not this Court?
1972.71-708,3,40467,robert_m_shea,,4044.155,4051.278,"Sir, the essential question before the Court is the adequacy of the pleadings as against Parkmerced."
1972.71-708,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4056.408,4061.183,What pleadings are before us other than the complaint?
1972.71-708,3,40467,robert_m_shea,,4061.183,4061.739,"I beg your pardon, Sir?"
1972.71-708,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4061.739,4063.808,What pleadings do we have here?
1972.71-708,3,40467,robert_m_shea,,4063.808,4065.158,You have the complaint and also --
1972.71-708,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4065.158,4071.087,How else to pass on all of these factual points you have produced?
1972.71-708,3,40467,robert_m_shea,,4071.087,4073.228,"Sir the -- Your Honor, the question --"
1972.71-708,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4073.228,4080.143,Is there any thing in the record that shows anything about Metropolitan upon the property agent one way or the other?
1972.71-708,3,40467,robert_m_shea,,4080.143,4081.547,"Yes, indeed."
1972.71-708,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4081.547,4085.389,How is that there?
1972.71-708,3,40467,robert_m_shea,,4085.389,4093.419,The amended complaint against Parkmerced Corporation filed at the time we were joined as plaintiffs contains allegations.
1972.71-708,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4093.419,4096.428,And aren't they accepted as true at this posture?
1972.71-708,3,40467,robert_m_shea,,4096.428,4098.426,They are accepted as true.
1972.71-708,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4117.85,4128.228,"Well, how do you get those in the record if the case was dismissed on the basis of insufficiency of the complaint?"
1972.71-708,3,40467,robert_m_shea,,4128.228,4140.294,"Your Honor, the petitioners themselves secured the documents and they were submitted to the Trial Court as pertinent to the motion for a judgment to dismiss the case on the grounds of lack of standing."
1972.71-708,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4140.294,4143.062,So the Trial Court virtually treated this as a motion for summary judgment?
1972.71-708,3,40467,robert_m_shea,,4143.062,4144.848,It could be so regarded.
1972.71-708,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4228.533,4229.309,Thank you gentleman.
