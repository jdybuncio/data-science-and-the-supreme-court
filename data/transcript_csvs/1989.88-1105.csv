1989.88-1105,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.988,"We'll hear argument next in Number 88-1105, Curtis Guidry v. Sheet Metal Workers National Pension Fund."
1989.88-1105,0,23215,eldon_e_silverman,,14.753,21.074,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1989.88-1105,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,175.406,177.707,Why do you say at least?
1989.88-1105,0,23215,eldon_e_silverman,,177.707,181.31,Why do I say at least?
1989.88-1105,1,30539,joseph_m_goldhammer,,1346.946,1355.061,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1989.88-1105,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1382.659,1386.212,And... and you sought recovery under LMRDA?
1989.88-1105,1,30539,joseph_m_goldhammer,,1386.212,1387.203,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1989.88-1105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1466.585,1470.966,"xxx your judgment, you defend their opinion?"
1989.88-1105,1,30539,joseph_m_goldhammer,,1470.966,1475.181,"Well, I defend the... the result of their opinion."
1989.88-1105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1483.747,1487.746,"Well, I don't... you're not here defending that rationale?"
1989.88-1105,1,30539,joseph_m_goldhammer,,1487.746,1490.788,--I'm not really defending that rationale--
1989.88-1105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1490.788,1493.352,You're... you're presenting another ground for affirmance?
1989.88-1105,1,30539,joseph_m_goldhammer,,1493.352,1502.188,"--I am... I am presenting another, more persuasive ground for affirmance in... in some respects at least, in many respects at least."
1989.88-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1509.573,1510.564,May I just ask you a question--
1989.88-1105,1,30539,joseph_m_goldhammer,,1510.564,1511.263,Yes.
1989.88-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1511.263,1512.124,--about the LMRDA?
1989.88-1105,1,30539,joseph_m_goldhammer,,1516.217,1519.52,"There were actually... yes, that's true."
1989.88-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1528.647,1534.31,"And as to the two of which he was not a trustee, did you assert an LMRDA claim as to those?"
1989.88-1105,1,30539,joseph_m_goldhammer,,1534.31,1543.395,"Well, the LMRDA claim doesn't assert stealing in particular from pension funds."
1989.88-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1544.206,1545.128,It asserts a violation of his--
1989.88-1105,1,30539,joseph_m_goldhammer,,1545.128,1545.638,--stealing from unions.
1989.88-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1545.638,1550.561,"--a violation of his duties as a union officer, not as a fiduciary of the trust?"
1989.88-1105,1,30539,joseph_m_goldhammer,,1550.561,1551.383,Exactly.
1989.88-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1558.656,1559.898,I see.
1989.88-1105,1,30539,joseph_m_goldhammer,,1559.898,1560.679,And they--
1989.88-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1560.679,1572.487,"But you are not claiming, you are not in this argument at least, you are not relying on a claim that a breach of his fiduciary obligations as a trustee of two of the four funds is what justifies this relief?"
1989.88-1105,1,30539,joseph_m_goldhammer,,1572.487,1581.203,"--Well, we're in a sense relying on both; but primarily, primarily, we are relying on the fact that he breached his fiduciary duties to the union."
1989.88-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1581.203,1589.497,"And is it correct that insofar as you sought relief from the fund of which he was a trustee, whether it's one or two, that that claim has been satisfied?"
1989.88-1105,1,30539,joseph_m_goldhammer,,1589.497,1598.113,"No, that claim has... oh... ah, what happened here was that--"
1989.88-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1598.113,1600.103,It would be a lot easier for me if I got a yes or no.
1989.88-1105,1,30539,joseph_m_goldhammer,,1600.103,1601.085,"--Yeah, and--"
1989.88-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1601.085,1606.138,They seem... I got the impression from your--
1989.88-1105,1,30539,joseph_m_goldhammer,,1606.138,1607.439,--Insofar as... let me make sure--
1989.88-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1607.439,1610.531,"--I got the impression from your opponent that it had been satisfied, and I want to be sure I'm not misled."
1989.88-1105,1,30539,joseph_m_goldhammer,,1610.531,1611.661,--Okay.
1989.88-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1619.778,1620.667,"All right, thank you."
1989.88-1105,1,30539,joseph_m_goldhammer,,1620.667,1627.852,"And the facts of this case are very complicated, and the reason why they're complicated is because Mr. Guidry made them complicated."
1989.88-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1630.674,1642.562,"No, I understand, but the two things that are... do characterize the claims that, at least the main portion of what remain, is, one, he was an officer of the union, and the union was his employer."
1989.88-1105,1,30539,joseph_m_goldhammer,,1652.098,1656.19,The fact that he was an employee of the union makes no difference in this case.
1989.88-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1657.261,1657.822,You don't rely on that?
1989.88-1105,1,30539,joseph_m_goldhammer,,1657.822,1659.113,--imposes--
1989.88-1105,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1659.113,1672.822,"Well, I understand it doesn't for the LMRDA, but I'm talking about some of the other circuit court decisions have relied... have said in effect that embezzlement from an employer, when that happens, when you embezzle from an employer, you can get relief against the ERISA program--"
1989.88-1105,1,30539,joseph_m_goldhammer,,1672.822,1675.063,"--Right, and we don't rely on those cases either."
1989.88-1105,2,23215,eldon_e_silverman,,3185.4,3186.111,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1989.88-1105,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3186.111,3187.243,Do you have rebuttal?
1989.88-1105,2,23215,eldon_e_silverman,,3187.243,3188.292,I do.
1989.88-1105,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3194.226,3200.691,What if the money had been stolen from the pension fund itself?
1989.88-1105,2,23215,eldon_e_silverman,,3200.691,3202.023,That would have been a different case.
1989.88-1105,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3204.305,3204.855,Yes.
1989.88-1105,2,23215,eldon_e_silverman,,3204.855,3210.027,And it would be... I think there I can make an argument on either side.
1989.88-1105,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3283.365,3286.378,"I think you have answered the question, Mr. Silverman."
