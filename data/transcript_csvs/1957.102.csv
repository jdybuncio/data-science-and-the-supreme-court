1957.102,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,8.711,"Number 102, United States of America (Inaudible) C.M.Dow."
1957.102,0,38135,perry_w_morton,,13.629,18.788,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,3334.338,3340.579,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1957.102,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3753.639,3772.274,"Mr. Simmer, could you tell me whether the cases have arisen in which a State sought to tax the land that was taken between the physical -- possession by the United States in what you just tell was the vesting of the title?"
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,3772.274,3773.043,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1957.102,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3931.303,3942.487,"I should have known that case, (Inaudible)"
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,3942.487,3956.231,I think the question was asked something about the -- whether the Government would pay more or would pay less as a result of the decision below.
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4027.842,4033.738,"May I ask you, I don't -- you say that -- of course the Government, no more and no less?"
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4033.738,4035.155,"Yes, sir Your Honor that is what we said."
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4035.155,4036.8,Or the landowner gets no more and no less.
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4036.8,4038.916,Then landowner would get no more and no less than just compensation.
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4038.916,4041.381,In this case -- in this case?
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4041.381,4042.609,In this case.
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4042.609,4044.443,Or elsewhere.
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4056.009,4062.175,I think -- I think that is a fair statement but what do you mean in that context when you say taking?
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4062.175,4062.981,Well that's it.
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4064.618,4065.397,"Yes, well --"
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4065.397,4069.327,"But what -- what I'm asking you is, is it not true?"
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4100.843,4111.737,"Your Honor, to answer your question, the magic in the word ""taking"" is one -- something that is alluded to on the other side."
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4172.178,4174.95,"There's no delay of payment, was there?"
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4184.84,4194.543,"Well, Your Honor, the -- if -- I think that the question put by Judge Whittaker during the opening argument is itself the answer."
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4229.127,4241.859,"How can you get a -- how can -- what -- what bothers me then is, if the -- you'll figure this from the time of the possession or the other time, rather --"
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4241.859,4241.927,"Yes, sir."
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4241.927,4245.178,"Rather the possession at a later time, rather the possession."
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4273.775,4274.272,Not under Texas law --
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4274.272,4278.653,"-- from Dow, whether in man's land without violating the Anti-Assignment law."
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4278.653,4297.578,"Not under Texas law, regardless of the Anti-Assignment Act, the law of Texas provides that a claim for damages which is exactly what that would be if the Government did abandon ahead of the time when -- that Dow took title to the land."
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4297.578,4299.946,Why do you say that they claim for damages?
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4299.946,4301.681,For the use and possession where the --
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4301.681,4307.238,"Yes, but it's a claim for taking values and possess -- possession of their property during that time."
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4307.238,4310.27,"Oh, agreed, I certainly agreed -- certainly agree with that."
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4340.042,4343.306,"In this case -- in this case, that would be in Dow's predecessors of the title."
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4343.306,4344.801,"Yes, sir, it would and it would be something --"
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4344.801,4347.326,If -- if it begins from the date of possession.
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4347.326,4347.793,Right.
1957.102,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4358.242,4360.328,(Inaudible)
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4360.328,4362.524,It would not be pass by a deed.
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4567.434,4574.477,If -- if I asked the Government counsel because I don't quite understand the gist.
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4583.126,4583.485,"Yes, sir."
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4584.104,4602.765,"Well, if the taking here, that's when the Government here in this case filed a declaration or whatever it was, put in the money, if that's the time, how is Dow entitled to get anything for the use of the Government made to that property up to the time it was taken?"
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4602.765,4605.827,He is not entitled and he doesn't claim it.
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4605.827,4606.264,All right.
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4617.586,4627.595,"I think that any landowner and I'm perhaps repeating but any landowner has the right to expect from his Government, just compensation."
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4649.079,4654.034,The Government then -- the Government then -- the law that's passed wouldn't give them the right to hold possession.
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4657.867,4658.115,Well --
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4658.115,4662.155,He'll pay you under your contention -- if anybody.
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4662.155,4664.339,It depends on what they're taking.
1957.102,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4675.928,4677.074,That is when?
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4677.074,4682.411,And that is when the declaration of taking is filed under the very terms of the statute as it's stated.
1957.102,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4682.411,4688.378,(Inaudible)
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4688.378,4693.678,For purposes of the amount of the value of the property?
1957.102,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4696.929,4702.767,Including in that also interest from that bargaining from that date?
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4702.767,4708.084,The decision of the court below does not cover interest.
1957.102,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4708.084,4715.242,Or if the new interest was (Inaudible)
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4715.242,4717.937,Nor does the opinion cover that.
1957.102,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4776.947,4784.462,I gather that your -- your position then is that he would not be entitled to interest prior to the date of it's purchase?
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4784.462,4785.493,That is certainly correct.
1957.102,1,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,4786.172,4787.607,(Inaudible)
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4787.607,4792.917,"The respondent, Mr. Dow, is not entitled to interest before he acquire the property."
1957.102,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4792.917,4799.522,"As I understand you, Mr. Simmer, the more I hear of this case, the more interestingly confusing it becomes."
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4833.692,4834.199,"Yes, sir, Your Honor."
1957.102,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4834.199,4836.063,And why that?
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4836.063,4839.217,Let me just read from 3 Nichols at page 23.
1957.102,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4843.287,4844.453,In what in all these should be bothered?
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4855.093,4855.842,"Oh, no."
1957.102,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,4870.759,4871.186,Just a question.
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4871.186,4873.891,"At that time, Dow didn't own it."
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4880.356,4888.346,"Your Honor, respondent was the owner at the date that declaration of taking was filed but not at the date of valuation."
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4910.014,4917.397,"That wouldn't be true when it is the effect of the deed, gives the benefit of the assignment (Inaudible)"
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4917.397,4924.509,"Well, Your Honor, the title to the property under our Constitution passes when payment is made."
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4945.759,4952.284,"Do you agree that when the Government takes possession of a property, a suit could be filed under the Tucker Act at once?"
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4952.284,4952.721,"Yes, sir."
1957.102,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4963.356,4963.604,Mr. Simmer --
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,4963.604,4964.979,It doesn't (Inaudible) --
1957.102,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,4964.979,4968.103,I'd like to revert to my question.
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5007.052,5008.37,"Yes, sir, that is our position."
1957.102,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5008.37,5024.685,"I do not understand then why it shouldn't be also -- why it should be a constitutional rule but you jump back then to whatever the years are, six months, two years, three years or four years in order to ascertain the then value of the property --"
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5024.685,5024.915,Okay.
1957.102,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5024.915,5027.558,-- ascertaining the money damages.
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5038.643,5042.317,"Well, Your Honor, to answer your question, I'm sorry I interrupted your question."
1957.102,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5042.317,5043.912,You didn't interrupt me at all.
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5043.912,5075.872,"But the jump from the date of taking of title back to the date of possession is one which the -- which the highest courts of the first-pay States have been able to make on these equitable grounds that if there are variations in value, ups and downs, it's one that -- it sometime has to be fixed so the date when the petitioners filed or the date when physical possession is taken is as good as it was."
1957.102,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5075.872,5082.643,"They have taken the considerations of expediency and difficulties and they're on -- well, that's the fix on that, I that it?"
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5082.643,5084.837,"Yes, sir, Your Honor, that is it."
1957.102,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5085.593,5086.482,There's no doubt about that.
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5089.225,5089.343,Your --
1957.102,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5089.343,5090.399,I'll vow to it.
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5090.399,5092.872,There are great a many states which --
1957.102,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5092.872,5098.11,"It show -- just shows how mere logic isn't deciding this problem, is it?"
1957.102,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5098.11,5098.527,"Well, basically --"
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5098.527,5099.493,I would think no.
1957.102,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,5099.493,5099.603,No.
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5099.603,5100.439,I would think no.
1957.102,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5100.439,5102.196,"Mr. Simmer, may I test that this way?"
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5131.918,5133.014,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1957.102,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5133.014,5138.89,"And then there's something plus for the value or the possession taken in the intervening period, is that it?"
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5138.89,5139.269,"Yes, sir."
1957.102,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5139.848,5149.918,"And that satisfies the just compensation requirement even though the property in fact when Mr. Dow gets title is 150,000."
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5151.842,5157.311,I think that there is substantial ground for the equitable rule that --
1957.102,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5157.311,5158.765,"But that -- that is the result, is it?"
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5158.765,5160.539,"That is the result, there's no question."
1957.102,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5170.053,5173.736,And your position is that fully satisfies the Fifth Amendment requirement --
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5173.736,5173.764,"Yes, sir."
1957.102,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5173.764,5176.706,-- as well as the first pay provisions of the state constitution.
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5176.706,5177.864,"Yes, sir it does."
1957.102,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5198.824,5200.88,That is my other question.
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5221.244,5222.44,"Your Honor, I'm sure it is."
1957.102,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5231.131,5232.396,"Well, again, no, I'm assuming --"
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5232.396,5232.606,Yes.
1957.102,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5232.606,5234.872,"-- hypothetically that that value is $50,000."
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5234.872,5235.856,Then -- then that's what --
1957.102,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5235.856,5235.946,(Voice Overlap) --
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5235.946,5239.988,-- that is what the result to the vendors would be also.
1957.102,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5239.988,5245.569,"Now, if that's measured an interest, what's -- what's the rate?"
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5245.569,5257.766,"Well, in Texas there are statues governing interest after the Declaration of Taking Act becomes applicable."
1957.102,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5263.304,5265.749,"When you say amount, does that fix the rate?"
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5265.749,5265.777,Yes.
1957.102,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5265.777,5267.492,"I mean by the rates, 4% or something like that?"
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5267.492,5273.079,"6%, The Declaration of Taking act, I believe, provides also for 6%."
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5273.137,5278.135,"May I ask you, I don't see any cases cited by Judge Reed."
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5281.159,5286.137,"Your Honor, in the footnotes, there are a number of cases cited --"
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5286.137,5288.929,"On -- not -- well, do any of them I've looked at."
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5288.929,5289.977,Some of my favorites.
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5290.317,5301.61,So any of them hold that before this that the takings be measured as he said it was here rather the time the possession was taken?
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5306.079,5308.664,"I would have to say no, Your Honor --"
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5308.664,5308.931,He had --
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5308.931,5309.55,-- other than --
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5309.55,5311.836,He had raised that in a dissent previously.
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5311.836,5313.311,"Yes, in the (Inaudible) case."
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5313.311,5313.559,And --
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5313.559,5313.966,Now --
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5313.966,5315.264,-- he didn't get the majority?
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5315.264,5315.701,"No, sir."
1957.102,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5316.248,5319.033,And this time is the first time it's been here?
1957.102,1,35056,l_keith_simmer,,5319.033,5319.809,That is correct.
1957.102,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5432.851,5433.75,Mr. Morton.
1957.102,2,38135,perry_w_morton,,5433.75,5437.58,"May I ask, Mr. Chief Justice, how much time I have?"
1957.102,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5437.58,5439.946,(Inaudible) trifle at yourself.
1957.102,2,38135,perry_w_morton,,5439.946,5455.595,"Well, I think maybe about four minutes."
1957.102,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5472.842,5474.257,"I can't hear you, Mr. Morton."
1957.102,2,38135,perry_w_morton,,5474.257,5478.658,"Pardon me, my throat just won't let me talk."
1957.102,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5733.048,5738.824,"Well, tell me, Mr. Morton, what -- what would happen in the fact situation I put to Mr. Simmer."
1957.102,2,38135,perry_w_morton,,5745.765,5746.112,I suppose --
1957.102,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5746.112,5746.911,Under your theory.
1957.102,2,38135,perry_w_morton,,5746.911,5752.178,"I suppose that -- well, $50,000 I think wasn't even his answer."
1957.102,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5752.178,5752.837,His answer was --
1957.102,2,38135,perry_w_morton,,5752.837,5755.38,I think it was -- I think it was --
1957.102,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5755.38,5758.045,"He may have given his, is that also your answer?"
1957.102,2,38135,perry_w_morton,,5758.045,5769.087,"It would be my answer that if it is worth $50,000 in 1943 that is what the -- that is when the taking occurred and that is when the valuation is fixed."
1957.102,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5797.733,5810.275,"Well, under our Miller case, the increment of value, the reason that the Government's present area was not -- went to the valuation (Inaudible)."
1957.102,2,38135,perry_w_morton,,5810.275,5817.489,"I'm sorry, Mr. Justice, my throat condition has blocked up my ears as well."
1957.102,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5818.804,5822.247,"I just say under our old Miller case, I think where the opinion --"
1957.102,2,38135,perry_w_morton,,5822.247,5823.475,Miller case is a landmark.
1957.102,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5823.475,5825.501,-- written by Justice Roberts.
1957.102,2,38135,perry_w_morton,,5825.501,5825.579,Yes.
1957.102,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5825.579,5834.958,"An increment of value is a result of the Government's activity here, would not enter into the valuation of the property."
1957.102,2,38135,perry_w_morton,,5836.076,5840.118,"Well, Miller, is -- is authority for a great many things."
1957.102,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5840.118,5840.445,"Well, certainly --"
1957.102,2,38135,perry_w_morton,,5840.445,5841.463,And among them is --
1957.102,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5841.463,5842.272,Certainly one of them is --
1957.102,2,38135,perry_w_morton,,5842.272,5849.825,Among them is a description of the purposes of the Declaration of Taking Act as I have described them in my opening.
1957.102,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5853.556,5854.372,That's right.
1957.102,2,38135,perry_w_morton,,5854.372,5855.51,That's right.
1957.102,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5855.51,5856.279,So on the -- on this --
1957.102,2,38135,perry_w_morton,,5856.279,5857.604,That (Inaudible) as the bottom of the Miller case.
1957.102,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,5857.604,5863.112,"On the issue of valuation, you don't need to worry here about the difference between 50,000 and 150."
1957.102,2,38135,perry_w_morton,,5863.112,5882.399,"No that is why I think that my answer earlier to, I think it was Mr. Justice Whittaker, was just plainly that an affirmance here will place you in a position wholly inconsistent with Miller."
