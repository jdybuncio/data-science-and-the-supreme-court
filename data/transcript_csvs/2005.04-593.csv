2005.04-593,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.163,We'll hear argument next in Domino's Pizza v. McDonald.
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,6.297,9.025,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2005.04-593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,87.451,95.456,"Can... can you tell me, Ms. Mahoney, just in... in a case where the person is directly implicated... he was the one discriminated against."
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,103.769,110.099,"If... if he's... yes, you can get emotional distress under section 1981, and--"
2005.04-593,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,110.099,111.916,If... if you're contracting for yourself--
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,111.916,112.346,--That's correct.
2005.04-593,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,112.346,113.218,--in your own behalf.
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,113.218,113.869,Absolutely.
2005.04-593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,138.936,140.179,And what was the plaintiff's... it wasn't here.
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,142.937,161.111,"He is asking... it's... it's... the complaint is a little unclear, but he's asking for losses that arise out of the company's failure to have revenues that would have passed through the company to him in either his capacity as a shareholder or possibly as an employee."
2005.04-593,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,166.247,176.175,"Well, I thought they were... they were essentially, as I guess you said a moment ago, emotional distress kinds of injuries because otherwise he'd be claiming a double recovery."
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,181.371,182.082,"--$45,000, Your Honor."
2005.04-593,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,182.082,187.539,"So... so that the only thing he... he's not claiming an economic injury, as I understand it, or am I wrong?"
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,187.539,188.702,"I think you're wrong, Your Honor."
2005.04-593,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,202.543,204.22,But I... I guess that's where I went wrong.
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,209.274,210.908,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
2005.04-593,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,210.908,211.579,But you're... you're saying he wants the--
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,211.579,217.236,"But either way, the outcome should be the same because emotional distress is not a standalone claim."
2005.04-593,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,232.604,233.425,What if you have a--
2005.04-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,233.425,239.374,What... what he's saying is treat me as a sole proprietor.
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,258.581,261.74,"Your Honor, I think there's a couple of problems with that."
2005.04-593,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,320.167,329.564,"--Counsel, what if you have a case where a company says we are not going to deal with any companies that have an African American as the CEO?"
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,338.11,338.723,--Well--
2005.04-593,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,338.723,342.653,And shouldn't he then have a right to bring a claim under section 1981?
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,342.653,350.979,"--Your Honor, if his company fired him because he couldn't make contracts... in other words, they said, we... we don't want you to be our CEO."
2005.04-593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,403.788,411.761,Suppose that McDonald had had a contract with the corporation that he gets 80 percent of the gross from every contract.
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,412.645,413.716,"No, Your Honor."
2005.04-593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,449.115,450.859,"Well, but... but in this case, it's pretty obvious they didn't care about the corporation."
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,452.614,463.286,"Well, he may have been the reason for the discrimination, but the target, in terms of the direct victim of the conduct that is alleged, was clearly JWM."
2005.04-593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,665.092,665.533,Are there any--
2005.04-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,665.533,665.983,Did you say there is or--
2005.04-593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,665.983,670.648,--are there any cases where we pierced the corporate veil in order to help the shareholder?
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,670.648,672.353,"Not that I know of, Your Honor."
2005.04-593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,673.206,673.767,This is kind of an inverse--
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,673.767,676.315,"--Yes, inverse... reverse piercing."
2005.04-593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,676.315,677.146,--corporate veil piercing.
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,677.146,682.532,"Not that I know of, and I don't... and I... I think if you did that, would you do it for employees too?"
2005.04-593,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,745.774,748.48,"There are two separate arguments here, and I'm trying to separate them."
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,783.877,793.135,I think the language of the statute says that it's protecting the... the right of all... the same right to make and enforce--
2005.04-593,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,793.135,793.446,All right.
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,801.25,803.506,"--I think that's correct, Your Honor, but--"
2005.04-593,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,803.506,803.718,All right.
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,821.18,824.609,"--Not that I can think of, Your Honor."
2005.04-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,838.763,839.885,--Do corporations have a color?
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,839.885,856.916,"--No, they don't, Your Honor, but all of the courts of appeals have, in effect, imputed race to corporations under circumstances where their... their contractual rights have been violated because of the race of their shareholders or employees."
2005.04-593,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,860.018,861.482,So how do we deal with this?
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,879.275,882.593,"Well, Your Honor, I... I don't think you have to be an expert on contract law."
2005.04-593,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,935.724,941.861,"Well, maybe not... maybe not shareholders in general, but what if you have a situation, like here, where you're dealing with sole shareholders?"
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,949.425,950.689,"Well, the... for two reasons."
2005.04-593,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,970.307,977.49,There was nothing in these contracts requiring anything in the way of personal guarantees or anything of that sort?
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,977.49,978.774,"--I don't believe so, Your Honor."
2005.04-593,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1019.546,1021.27,"Well, but that's exactly what I'm asking."
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1044.972,1057.602,"--Well, I don't think we need to do that because there's been a concession in this case that Mr. McDonald is not a third party beneficiary under the normal rules and is asking, instead, that the Court create new rules, rights greater than third--"
2005.04-593,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1057.602,1061.331,"Well, what about the other part of it, which is the... the interference with the contract?"
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1078.541,1090.578,"--Your Honor, I... I... we would ask that this Court not do that for two reasons, that the alternative theory of tortious interference was never pled."
2005.04-593,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1123.726,1137.407,"Are you saying this is a matter of Federal contract law, common law, Federal common law, are... or are you saying you go State by State, in which case 1981 is some places it will be third party beneficiary, some it won't?"
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1137.407,1153.628,"--I... I think, Your Honor, that in... in the prior cases, in Patterson in particular, that the Court rejected the idea that it ought to be the State... the law of each State that governs the scope of the rights."
2005.04-593,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1183.845,1188.128,But is it State law today or State law back when section 1981 was passed?
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1188.128,1207.428,"--This Court has looked to both, but in Associated General... Associated General Contractors, for instance, this Court said that it's not bound by the terms of common law that existed at the time that the statute was adopted, and... but rather, that common law evolves, and so it's appropriate to... to look beyond that."
2005.04-593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1235.33,1243.907,"Well, in a... in a sense this is stronger than some tortious interference claims because here the target is this... this party."
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1243.907,1248.139,"That's always true in tortious interference claims, Your Honor, and--"
2005.04-593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1248.139,1250.527,You mean that... that the injured party has to be the target?
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1250.527,1251.067,--Absolutely.
2005.04-593,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1264.217,1265.973,To interfere but not necessarily to injure him.
2005.04-593,0,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,1265.973,1267.326,--And to injure.
2005.04-593,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1535.073,1536.397,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,1538.242,1548.081,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2005.04-593,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1635.936,1644.311,"Well, let's take that last one first, if you don't mind, since the argument is that you've waived that argument by not... not raising it below."
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,1644.311,1651.783,"Well, we believe that it has been sufficiently raised below."
2005.04-593,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1657.402,1661.604,Where in the complaint does it allege a tortious interference claim?
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,1661.604,1668.373,"--It doesn't allege a tortious interference claim, and this really isn't a tortious interference claim as petitioners suggest."
2005.04-593,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1688.584,1689.005,No.
2005.04-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1689.255,1690.239,Excuse me.
2005.04-593,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1690.239,1696.648,"--the allegation I'm looking for... and I... I guess you probably didn't... you didn't have to raise it below, given the state of the Ninth Circuit law I would suppose."
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,1707.22,1710.699,I don't think it does appear there specifically.
2005.04-593,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1721.965,1730.2,"But coming here, I would have thought our rules say that if you're going to rely on this as a ground for affirmance here, we should see it in the brief in opposition."
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,1730.2,1734.542,The brief in opposition at the Ninth Circuit you're referring to or--
2005.04-593,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1734.542,1735.023,Here.
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,1735.023,1735.856,--this brief?
2005.04-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1739.868,1743.409,Brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari.
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,1745.344,1746.889,--They did not raise that... that--
2005.04-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1746.889,1749.297,So... it's... it's brand new to us.
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,1751.451,1765.715,"--Well, again, I think that if the issue is whether it was raised below or should be, then perhaps a remand back to flesh out that particular argument would be the appropriate response."
2005.04-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1768.203,1769.627,It wouldn't just be an argument.
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,1773.308,1783.549,"--If the Court believes that it more specifically needs to be set out in the complaint, then clearly that would be one of the remedies."
2005.04-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1807.551,1809.164,Is targeted enough?
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,1882.583,1891.892,--I believe that the opportunity to raise that is part of the... the same argument.
2005.04-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1897.358,1898.532,You conceded that out.
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,1898.532,1903.265,--discrimination and this was claimed in terms of discrimination.
2005.04-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1922.504,1923.005,Because?
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,1923.005,1935.542,"--Because it still is responsive to the question presented, which is, is the privity issue one that precludes recovery for John McDonald?"
2005.04-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1957.026,1958.29,Excuse me.
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,1996.716,2004.418,"--Well, it's... the allegation of both... well, discrimination is a personal injury."
2005.04-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2015.854,2029.314,"Well, the question is... I mean, that begs the question, whether there has been a violation of section 1981, and the argument here is that there's no violation of section 1981 unless you're interfering with a contract of the plaintiff."
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2029.314,2044.22,--And the response of the... of the respondent is it is not simply your own contract or your contract with the defendant that is subject to 1981 protection.
2005.04-593,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2063.364,2066.335,"Are you referring to Runyon, for instance?"
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2075.371,2079.434,--I think in this particular case it isn't a stretch.
2005.04-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2087.418,2088.322,That might--
2005.04-593,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2088.322,2089.435,There's no doubt he's the target.
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2089.956,2098.201,"--But, I mean, the... Domino's itself viewed JWM as John McDonald."
2005.04-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2150.498,2152.303,Was there any overlap?
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2163.097,2173.277,It had... it could bring the... a suit for the damages of the lost revenue that it could have gotten from its contract.
2005.04-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2193.387,2207.582,"--Then the argument for sending it back, if I understand it, is this, that when you look at the question presented, no one could possibly file a lawsuit... and you didn't... on the theory, well, I'm hurt, so somebody should pay me."
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2209.506,2210.88,--That is correct.
2005.04-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2210.88,2217.13,"Rather, the legal theory here was that this contract related section of the law is violated."
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2282.715,2285.505,"Well, I don't--"
2005.04-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2285.505,2286.056,Is that right?
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2286.056,2288.001,"--Well, I don't really think--"
2005.04-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2288.001,2289.537,I'm trying to be helpful in this respect.
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2289.928,2291.542,"--I understand, and I do appreciate it."
2005.04-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2296.629,2296.99,No.
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2301.725,2302.225,Also--
2005.04-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2302.225,2304.433,"--were discriminatory, aiming at me, et cetera."
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2304.433,2304.843,--Yes.
2005.04-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2318.763,2322.845,Which you didn't allege and didn't even raise in the brief in opposition here.
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2322.845,2331.664,"--I... I think we alleged that in terms of the ability of Mr. McDonald to perform on the contract, even though it was--"
2005.04-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2331.664,2332.475,But those contracts--
2005.04-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2332.475,2335.135,His contract with... with the corporation?
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2335.135,2335.595,--The--
2005.04-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2335.595,2337.07,No.
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2337.07,2343.6,--The statute doesn't say that it has to be his own contract with the defendant.
2005.04-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2343.6,2344.743,That's exactly the issue.
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2345.114,2345.815,And that's--
2005.04-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2345.815,2348.333,--and that's how I understood this came... case came up here.
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2391.716,2396.007,"--Well, that is clearly the main thrust of... of our position."
2005.04-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2396.007,2404.251,"Now, could you tell me when... the... the claim was settled when your client's corporation was in bankruptcy."
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2404.712,2405.917,Yes.
2005.04-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2405.917,2416.007,And I assume your client had no... nothing to say about... about whether the settlement would be... would be accepted by the trustee or not.
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2416.007,2416.818,Absolutely.
2005.04-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2418.455,2435.936,"It was out of his hands, which means that, you know, you're... you're sort of pleading the advantage of a corporation, limited liability and all of that, and went through bankruptcy taking that advantage, one of the consequences of which was that you left it to the corporation to settle this claim."
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2458.064,2467.823,"The corporate form gives certain protections, largely from personal responsibility for corporate debt has some tax advantages."
2005.04-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2476.269,2502.387,"--But you'd have to concede at a minimum that now that the corporation has settled the breach of contract claim, that to the extent that the corporation could have recovered under 1981, that's gone too because those two claims were intimately related, and you would be precluded from bringing such a claim."
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2508.586,2522.107,"Your Honor, even if that claim had not been precluded by bankruptcy... and there were two plaintiffs in this case, JWM and McDonald... there certainly couldn't be double recovery."
2005.04-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2539.79,2546.45,So they... the Ninth Circuit's view is there are two potential plaintiffs in this situation.
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2553.151,2554.032,I'm sorry.
2005.04-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2554.032,2555.095,--The shareholder can sue.
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2561.816,2562.319,Correct.
2005.04-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2562.319,2570.009,"They both have 1981 claims, but the damages are different in the case of the individual than in the case of the corporation."
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2570.009,2571.003,Absolutely.
2005.04-593,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2571.003,2579.657,May I ask just... did the individual plaintiff assert the 1981 claim at any time before the settlement of the corporate claim?
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2579.657,2595.272,"Yes, I believe that the... and I would have to check on the timing of this, but I believe that the suit was filed prior to the settlement of the 1981 claim... of the bankruptcy--"
2005.04-593,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2595.272,2595.955,I would have assumed--
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2595.955,2596.446,--I'm sorry.
2005.04-593,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2597.638,2601.08,"--there wouldn't have been a settlement first without taking care of the second, if they had known both were on the table."
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2604.571,2605.222,That is my understanding.
2005.04-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2681.371,2690.399,"Well, it was his... it was his corporation, and until he went bankrupt, any recovery by that corporation would have been a recovery by... by John McDonald."
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2699.125,2701.552,"Your Honor, I don't think that's the--"
2005.04-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2701.552,2707.029,"But, you know, that's... that's one of the... one of the consequences of taking advantage of the corporate form."
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2707.029,2720.892,"--Your Honor, I don't think that's the case because if there was, for example, this two party suit, JWM could not recover for dignitary damages."
2005.04-593,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2723.6,2727.833,"Well, can you... can you do that under a general contract theory?"
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2727.833,2731.052,I don't believe you can do it under a general contract--
2005.04-593,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2731.052,2741.823,"So you're reporting not merely the... the tort of tortious interference, but some general, broader concept of tort law as being subsumed with... under 1981."
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2742.676,2749.016,"--Yes, and I think the... the case law indicates that, that this is not simply just federalization of State law."
2005.04-593,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2771.582,2780.5,"All right, but the... the focus of it is, as... as I understand it, and the... the kernel of it is... is the capacity to contract."
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2808.625,2821.612,"--I think that what we are saying I think is what the Court has said... is that this is a personal injury, and that dignitary claims are subsumed under 1981."
2005.04-593,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2823.9,2844.451,"Well, contract... I... you... you pointed out the... the terminology which includes contract damages or... or contract harm as personal harm, but it doesn't necessarily follow from that that every harm or every injury that is personal falls under... conceptually under the 1981 umbrella."
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2844.451,2845.244,--No.
2005.04-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2860.862,2864.021,But it doesn't... it doesn't talk about personal injury that... that broadly.
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2873.828,2874.571,"Well, it's--"
2005.04-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2874.571,2875.052,--personal injury.
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2875.575,2876.175,--it's--
2005.04-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2876.175,2878.053,--it's not a more generalized tort.
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2887.559,2887.601,"--I believe, Your Honor--"
2005.04-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2887.601,2888.846,--dignitary about that.
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2888.846,2899.024,"--that it goes to your right to not suffer discrimination within the realm of making, performing, and enforcing contracts."
2005.04-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2906.587,2915.002,And you're saying it means discrimination that relates to the making and enforcing of a contract with somebody else.
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2927.65,2939.135,"--Yes, in this circumstance where the contract with someone else was the mechanism that was used to target an individual."
2005.04-593,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2941.833,2944.181,"Yes, but there's no way to confine it to the individual, is it?"
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,2959.577,2997.179,"--If there is a circumstance, as I understand the hypothetical, where there is blatant and intentional discrimination, racial discrimination, by a multinational corporation like General Motors, who say we're not going to do business with any company that hires black people... and clearly there's an uphill battle for any kind of proof, but you'd have to show that there was actual targeting, that it really did interfere with the ability to perform contracts, and that there were specified individual damages."
2005.04-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3004.913,3013.89,"But... but when you say damages that can be proven, the only damages you... you insist upon proving is the fact that you were a target and that it... it insulted you."
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,3030.7,3033.931,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe we're saying that because--"
2005.04-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3033.931,3034.102,No.
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,3063.607,3096.625,"--I don't believe so, and I think that what was pled and we believe is not just the wages that were not paid, but also the dignitary damages and also the damages specifically aimed at John McDonald in terms of ruining his credit, going to the banks, and in a sense slandering him, and those kinds of damages that were not recoverable by JWM but were specifically John McDonald."
2005.04-593,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3096.625,3100.628,That was... that was the consequence of the bankruptcy of his corporation.
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,3102.513,3102.974,"No, sir."
2005.04-593,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3114.618,3121.118,"But none of the ruin occurred, as I understand it, until the corporation went bankrupt."
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,3151.367,3152.704,"I don't believe so, sir."
2005.04-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3174.016,3174.879,Do you have an action--
2005.04-593,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3174.879,3175.179,"Well, can you give me an example?"
2005.04-593,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3175.179,3176.624,--on that in California?
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,3182.07,3202.483,"--Well, I think the action that Mr. McDonald took was just this, the 1981 action, saying that there was a Federal violation, that this was done to discriminate against him, and this seems to fit in with the 1981 cause of action and the purpose of 1981, which is why this case was filed."
2005.04-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3202.483,3205.302,"If it fits, it's because of some cases."
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,3230.036,3239.354,"Well, again, we... I think we could look at Shaare Tefila as... as a good example of the kinds of damages."
2005.04-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3243.816,3245.693,But I thought that didn't go into anything.
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,3251.86,3258.892,"Well, the claim was still... it was certainly not because of any kind of... of privity."
2005.04-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3260.448,3277.027,"--I thought that that was about does the... does the act cover religion or... or does it cover that situation, or is it limited to race, or does anti semitism count as race."
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,3279.132,3288.864,"--Well, at that time, that... it said that anti semitism counted as race, but certainly they were able to recover once that threshold was met because of the dignitary harms."
2005.04-593,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3288.864,3298.421,"Well, I don't see anything in the opinion about... I just see the issue before the Court was does this come under the heading race."
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,3298.421,3303.547,My reading of that was... was a bit broader I think.
2005.04-593,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3322.062,3326.526,"Both Sullivan and Shaare Tefila, of course, though, were 1982 cases."
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,3326.757,3327.287,--Correct.
2005.04-593,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3327.287,3328.661,Not 1981 cases.
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,3328.661,3329.044,Right.
2005.04-593,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3354.329,3355.162,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.04-593,1,16403,allen_lichtenstein,,3355.162,3355.975,Thank you.
2005.04-593,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3355.975,3358.481,"Ms. Mahoney, you have 4 minutes remaining."
2005.04-593,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3358.481,3361.291,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2005.04-593,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3459.164,3461.692,"Ms. Mahoney, may... may I ask you one brief question that I should have asked on direct?"
2005.04-593,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3485.183,3487.921,"I think the corporation would, Your Honor."
2005.04-593,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3487.921,3488.442,You think the corporation would.
2005.04-593,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3488.442,3499.957,"Absolutely because they... a refusal to deal... it covers rights to make and enforce contracts, and if... if the defendant said, I will not deal with this company, then I think that they have a right."
2005.04-593,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3508.883,3510.246,But not under 1981.
2005.04-593,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3510.246,3527.59,"No, Your Honor, but the trustee makes a finding that the... the causation... or reports to the court that causation principles could not be established, and so there was no point in bringing a 1981 claim because he actually found in... in materials that are in the record of the bankruptcy proceeding--"
2005.04-593,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3527.59,3537.188,"But... but in your view, to the extent that racial discrimination might have affected negotiations, that would be an element of the corporation's claim under 1981 rather than an individual claim."
2005.04-593,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3537.188,3538.181,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2005.04-593,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3538.181,3538.392,Yes.
2005.04-593,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3538.392,3543.678,"Because if the... if they were negotiating on behalf of the company, that is the company's right to contract."
2005.04-593,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3545.576,3547.651,And you attribute the shareholder's race to the corporation?
2005.04-593,2,36325,maureen_e_mahoney,,3547.651,3549.635,That's what the courts of appeals all do.
2005.04-593,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3637.38,3638.041,"Thank you, counsel."
