1994.93-1199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.648,"We'll hear argument next in Number 93-1199, Marvin Stone v. The Immigration & Naturalization Service."
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,18.435,23.115,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.93-1199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,227.53,228.591,I take it--
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,244.775,276.725,"It is my understanding that the usual rule is that the filing of a petition for judicial review takes the matter into court, and that it does not divest the agency of the authority to reconsider, although it does not stop the court from considering the matter, and in that circumstance it is up to the court to decide whether it will choose to proceed with the case or allow it not to proceed."
1994.93-1199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,276.725,281.761,Which the statute here... an option that the statute here eliminates.
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,281.761,283.3,"No, Your Honor, I don't--"
1994.93-1199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,283.3,285.622,It says that they shall be consolidated in such a situation--
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,285.622,286.273,--No.
1994.93-1199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,338.26,360.246,"--My second question is whether the filing of the motion for reconsideration or for reopening simply tolls the period for review, or does it retroactively render the decision nonfinal so that you have the full period at the end of... once the petition for reconsideration is disposed of?"
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,360.246,366.039,"I have not seen a case that deals with that question, Your Honor, that comes up explicitly."
1994.93-1199,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,369.793,371.954,"Mr. Morrison, would you clarify what you said before?"
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,388.756,401.473,"--Yes, that is correct, Your Honor, and the question I believe Justice Scalia was asking me, is that because it makes it a tolling that you stop at that point... suppose they filed it, as in this case, on day 26."
1994.93-1199,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,443.125,448.938,"What happens if the Attorney General then says, on the plane or on the ship, out you go?"
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,472.836,473.106,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1199,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,473.106,474.287,--since you can't get to a court of appeals?
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,474.287,476.99,You may not go to the court of appeals under that circumstance.
1994.93-1199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,559.264,568.1,"If you go to the district court on habeas corpus, Mr. Morrison, what sort of considerations does the district court look at in deciding whether to give a stay or not?"
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,568.1,570.253,"I would think it would look at two things, Your Honor."
1994.93-1199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,579.647,583.911,Predicting probability of success in the court of appeals?
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,583.911,584.952,"Well, it's a little bit awkward."
1994.93-1199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,620.538,626.1,"Well, but the right to rehearing is totally a creature of agency regulations."
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,626.1,626.39,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,627.091,628.353,They could cut that out tomorrow.
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,628.353,631.896,"--I agree with that, and if they cut it out we wouldn't have a situation like this."
1994.93-1199,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,670.734,676.017,"The part that I might be a little confused about, that I need clarification about, is this."
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,684.514,685.273,"Your Honor, do you mean--"
1994.93-1199,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,685.273,685.524,--it's a final--
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,685.524,686.105,--a final--
1994.93-1199,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,686.105,691.621,"--it's no reconsideration, final order, go, and on the Government's interpretation, I know what I'm supposed to do."
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,720.094,720.494,--At that time.
1994.93-1199,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,720.494,721.225,"No, right."
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,721.225,721.946,That is correct.
1994.93-1199,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,721.946,725.097,"And if things drag on, the time will expire."
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,753.693,760.419,"Well, I would say that Your Honor is correct that that is the way the Government interprets the statutory scheme."
1994.93-1199,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,831.82,849.852,"Well, why isn't the most rational thing to do to say, file your notice of appeal immediately, then you can file for reconsideration, and everything is going forward, leave it to the judgment of the court of appeals whether it wants to stay the appeal pending the reconsideration at the agency level?"
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,849.852,852.354,"Well, Your Honor, I would say two things to that."
1994.93-1199,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,872.225,874.327,But that was the ICC's position in that case.
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,878.911,883.866,"--Well, it was the ICC's position because that was the way they could get the case thrown out of court."
1994.93-1199,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,895.474,898.985,But now there is no doubt about the Attorney General's position.
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,900.466,900.786,Yes.
1994.93-1199,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,900.786,907.381,"--and if you just read the regulations you'd know what you have to do, and you're saying that the Attorney General can't have such a regulation."
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,907.381,914.097,"That is correct, and I say that first because... I want to answer Your Honor's question about why the system wouldn't make sense."
1994.93-1199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,948.413,951.874,"Or even... or for that matter, even that the Attorney General intended the result to be different."
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,960.062,964.403,"Well, there is nothing in the regulation itself that tells you when you go to court."
1994.93-1199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1034.596,1038.078,"What about the 1990 amendment, Mr. Morrison?"
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1045.534,1053.238,"I must confess, Your Honor, when I looked at the 1990 amendment, I wasn't quite sure what it was actually going to do in the real world."
1994.93-1199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1064.598,1084.57,"Isn't it fair to say that it displays the expectation of Congress that at least with enough frequency to be worth addressing in the U.S. Code there would be two separate appeals, one from the original order and one from the denial of the petition for reconsideration?"
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1084.57,1092.845,"--I think that that is, as an inference... the Government's position first is that under our view of the statute there would never be a case in which this would happen."
1994.93-1199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1163.726,1170.088,"Is that situation common enough, however, to be a reasonable explanation for the statutory provision?"
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1170.088,1171.44,--I can't answer--
1994.93-1199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1171.44,1171.871,"I mean, you know--"
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1171.871,1172.832,"--I can't answer that question, Your Honor."
1994.93-1199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1172.832,1174.412,--you can come up with a circumstance that--
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1174.412,1178.376,"Well, I think it's quite common that aliens do submit new information."
1994.93-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1215.862,1218.834,"--Mr. Morrison, may I go back to Justice Breyer's question to you?"
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1254.249,1257.271,Subject to the right of going to the district court on a habeas corpus petition--
1994.93-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1257.271,1259.753,"Yes, but the habeas corpus is not a guarantee--"
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1259.753,1260.224,--and I would argue very vehemently that--
1994.93-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1260.224,1267.068,"--Let's put aside for a moment the habeas corpus, because that's not a guarantee by any means, whereas the appeal is a guarantee."
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1267.068,1286.732,"--Yes, Your Honor, but one would be hard-pressed to know what the Immigration Service would say in response to my motion, which would say, first, we have a timely motion for reconsideration which they haven't acted on, despite the many months it's been before them, they want to deport him, as soon as they act on it he's going to file and go to court on... he's going to go to court and get an automatic stay of deportation."
1994.93-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1312.038,1316.231,I'm just concerned that your position may not be the most protective of the immigrant.
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1317.393,1322.076,"Well, Your Honor, I am representing my client here today, and his case is not--"
1994.93-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1322.076,1332.751,"On this particular... the state of, you know, this particular record... I'm thinking of the hypothetical case in which a person 60 days after the order of deportation is entered, is about to be deported, and takes an appeal."
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1337.595,1338.326,--That is--
1994.93-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1338.326,1339.778,"Under your view, he could be deported."
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1339.778,1346.203,--He could be deported if the Service a)... I don't believe under the law... as I read the statute--
1994.93-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1346.203,1349.225,"Well, I understand, but you're relying on an issue you say we don't have to decide."
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1349.225,1350.375,"--Have to decide, that is correct."
1994.93-1199,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1353.808,1358.372,"But I'm just wondering if in order to protect the people in this position we do not need to decide that, and you say we don't."
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1376.176,1391.915,"That is, I believe, the only intellectually defensible way that you can reach the result which I'm urging this Court to reach today, that my client's petition for reconsideration stop, whether it's tolled or made nonfinal."
1994.93-1199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1408.408,1412.4,"If we affirm the Sixth Circuit here, your client is on his way, right?"
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1412.4,1413.892,"--That is correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1420.616,1423.168,Would that stay his deportation further?
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1423.168,1423.388,"--No, it would not."
1994.93-1199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1424.788,1427.78,When was the original order to deport him entered?
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1427.78,1432.455,"--The... well, the order to show cause was in March 1987."
1994.93-1199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1432.455,1435.276,"That was, what, 7 years ago?"
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1435.276,1435.557,Yes.
1994.93-1199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1436.458,1437.067,Eight.
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1437.067,1459.522,"The immigration judge was in January '88, the Board of Immigration Appeals was 3-1/2 years later, in July of 1991, and they have made no effort to deport him in those, whatever number of years you're measuring it from, despite their regulations and despite what they say the statute is, and I am very concerned about this, Your Honor."
1994.93-1199,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1474.536,1480.119,"Mr. Morrison, I want to come back to the 1990 amendment, the consolidation provision."
1994.93-1199,0,16500,alan_b_morrison,,1496.341,1514.113,"--As Your Honor may know, the Service has no time limits whatsoever on motions for either reconsideration or reopening, and I suppose I could, if I were an attorney in good faith, say to the INS, there's a new case which you've decided which is inconsistent even after my time for review has... I've already filed my petition for review."
1994.93-1199,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1525.596,1527.034,"--Very well, Mr. Morrison."
1994.93-1199,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1528.506,1532.81,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.93-1199,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1599.976,1628.483,"I assume, just at this point you might answer... I think Justice Scalia brought up the fact that her regulation doesn't say anything about whether or not reconsideration tolls or makes it nonfinal, and the regulation is written in the same words as the Hobbs Act, as the Administrative Procedures Act, as interpreted by this Court to mean that you file a motion for reconsideration, it isn't final any longer, so what is it that leads you to say that's what her decision is?"
1994.93-1199,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1639.031,1643.994,"Your Honor, we believe that the Locomotive Engineers addressed a different question."
1994.93-1199,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1679.227,1690.474,"But I think Justice Breyer's point is that just as the Hobbs Act did not require it, so also the text of the Attorney General's regulations do not require it."
1994.93-1199,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1690.474,1692.046,"Your Honor, we believe the--"
1994.93-1199,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1692.046,1693.448,The language is virtually the same.
1994.93-1199,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1693.448,1698.381,--We believe that the Attorney General's interpretation of that regulation is reasonable.
1994.93-1199,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1713.183,1728.11,"You say 1) you infer that from the regulation that says you can deport the person immediately, that you don't have... that its final... one thing that is in the regulations is that it's final for purposes of putting the person on the boat or the plane."
1994.93-1199,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1728.11,1756.501,"--Yes, Your Honor, and not only does that support the Attorney General's interpretation, there's another aspect of the regulations where the Attorney General provides that an alien does get an automatic stay during an administrative appeal from the immigration judge to the Board of Immigration Appeals, therefore evidencing that the Attorney General not providing such a stay means that... after dismissal of an appeal by the board means that that order is final."
1994.93-1199,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1787.031,1797.378,"Ms. Brinkmann, exactly what interpretation of what section are we talking about when you say that the Attorney General's interpretation is entitled to great deference?"
1994.93-1199,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1797.378,1807.064,"Your Honor, we believe that the language is 8 C.F.R. 243.1, establishing that a deportation order becomes final upon dismissal."
1994.93-1199,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1807.064,1810.316,Where is that in your brief?
1994.93-1199,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1810.316,1814.601,"That is on the very last page of the appendix to the Government's brief, Your Honor, page 10a."
1994.93-1199,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1814.601,1816.774,243.1 on page 10a?
1994.93-1199,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1816.774,1817.663,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1199,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1847.502,1871.629,"Ms. Brinkmann, I'm not... I guess I don't have everything in front of me, but it is not my impression that in other agencies the mere fact that an order is not final in the sense that a petition for reconsideration may still be filed prevents that order from being enforced."
1994.93-1199,1,17414,beth_s_brinkmann,,1894.946,1898.749,"No, Your Honor, I believe there are agency actions which can be enforced--"
1994.93-1199,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3111.539,3120.265,"Mr. Chief Justice, you began by asking Ms. Brinkmann what is it that we are being asked to construe, and what is it she's asking deference to."
1994.93-1199,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3220.892,3222.161,"Oh, I thought we've done that in past."
1994.93-1199,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3227.136,3230.919,The only case in which that arises is Weinberger v. Salfi.
1994.93-1199,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3250.363,3254.234,"Mr. Morrison, are you saying that the Hobbs Act couldn't be interpreted either way?"
1994.93-1199,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3278.03,3286.037,I was interested to hear her statement that anyone could go read that decision and understand that it was permissive.
1994.93-1199,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3306.742,3326.254,"But if she's right about what the statute means, that under the statute an agency can decide for itself whether its application for reconsider will stay the finality of its order for purposes of review, if she's right about that, then we do, we should defer to the agency's implementation of the Hobbs Act, if it can be implemented either way."
1994.93-1199,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3326.254,3328.897,I do not believe that that statute can mean that.
1994.93-1199,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3340.567,3342.456,"I think you've answered the question, Mr. Morrison."
1994.93-1199,2,16500,alan_b_morrison,,3342.456,3342.636,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1994.93-1199,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3342.636,3343.528,The case is submitted.
