1980.79-1404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.105,We will hear first this morning Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman and the consolidated cases.
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,16.869,19.182,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-1404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,167.794,170.433,Would that have been dispositive in itself or not?
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,170.433,172.244,Section 504?
1980.79-1404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,185.506,191.783,Would the result have been the same if the constitutional claim had not been reached?
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,191.783,197.718,--I'm not sure that there would have been a right to treatment under 504.
1980.79-1404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,202.093,205.451,"So the right to treatment is constitutionally based, is that the holding?"
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,205.451,206.498,--By the district court.
1980.79-1404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,206.498,212.915,"But, you've indicated that the district court relied on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,212.915,213.447,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-1404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,213.447,216.445,What if any other provisions of the Constitution did the court rely on?
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,216.445,220.21,The Due Process Clause and the Quid pro Quo Theory of right to treatment.
1980.79-1404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,220.21,221.663,Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment?
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,221.663,225.428,"Yes, sir, and also the Eight Amendment in terms of cruel and unusual punishment."
1980.79-1404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,225.428,225.678,As incorporated in the Fourteenth.
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,225.678,226.271,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-1404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,226.271,227.551,"Of course, we're not reviewing that judgment, are we?"
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,227.551,231.596,Those holdings in our understanding are not before the Court today.
1980.79-1404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,263.99,282.561,"Mr. Warshaw, with respect to the Court of Appeals' opinion, what power to legislate do you understand it thought that Congress was acting under when it passed this Developmental Act?"
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,282.561,289.402,"As I read the opinion, it found it unnecessary to reach the Fourteenth Amendment question and found that the spending power had been exercised."
1980.79-1404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,289.402,297.478,"If it's simply the spending power, isn't the ordinary remedy for the violation of the spending power the cutting off of funds?"
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,297.478,299.32,"That is part of our position, certainly."
1980.79-1404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,314.284,324.076,"If the State of Pennsylvania simply threw up its hands and said, this whole problem is just insoluble; we can't cope with it."
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,339.382,347.192,"No, sir, I think, both the courts... as I understand it, certainly the district court recognized that there is no affirmative constitutional right to provide treatment."
1980.79-1404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,363.029,370.26,Did the district court rely at all upon the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act?
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,370.26,370.932,Excuse me?
1980.79-1404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,370.932,373.822,Did the district court rely at all upon that statute?
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,373.822,374.197,"No, sir."
1980.79-1404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,385.629,386.613,And there was no basis in the district court?
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,386.613,388.472,--It was considered by the district court.
1980.79-1404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,388.472,395.626,"Well, the new statutory basis was briefed in the Court of Appeals, though?"
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,395.626,396.595,"Yes, it was, on the request--"
1980.79-1404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,396.595,397.064,At the request of the Court of Appeals?
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,397.064,397.798,--of the Court of Appeals.
1980.79-1404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,400.328,412.277,"Well, in any of the briefs, at that stage, was there any claim that the Developmental and Disabled Act rested on any power other than the spending power?"
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,420.538,427.052,"I don't think anybody... there are references to Katzenbach, which of course would be the relevant decision in the series of voting rights cases."
1980.79-1404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,433.174,434.298,"You read them that way here, though, don't you?"
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,434.298,435.064,Excuse me?
1980.79-1404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,435.064,437.624,"You read the briefs here to make that claim, don't you?"
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,437.624,439.967,"Yes, sir, I do."
1980.79-1404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,464.819,467.863,"Do you feel compelled to respond to that argument here, as stated?"
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,467.863,468.409,--To the constitutional argument?
1980.79-1404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,468.409,471.955,To that very argument that you just are reciting.
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,471.955,474.423,The argument that it is a condition of all federal funding?
1980.79-1404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,474.423,479.672,"No, that it's a... that this statute is an exercise of some power other than the spending power."
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,479.672,481.608,"Your Honor, yes."
1980.79-1404,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,554.204,558.391,"Though those are really two discrete questions, aren't they?"
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,558.391,558.937,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-1404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,584.615,591.954,"General Warshaw, where is the text of 6010 upon which the--"
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,591.954,594.891,It is cited throughout the briefs.
1980.79-1404,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,602.279,604.043,"--Where, if you know, the page?"
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,604.043,604.731,Excuse me.
1980.79-1404,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,620.38,621.396,What was that first number?
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,621.396,628.002,"--In the blue appendix, it would be at page 171(a), and that is the more complete version."
1980.79-1404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,916.432,942.297,"Is your argument that if the administrative agency charged with enforcing the Act that the Court of Appeals construed and applied, if the administrative agency charged with that enforcement had done, had ordered what the Court of Appeals ordered as a condition for federal funding, would you say that they would have exceeded their powers in this area?"
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,942.297,943.016,"Yes, sir, I would have."
1980.79-1404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,943.813,951.511,"Assume that they wouldn't, assume that if the administrative agency, if it had ordered that, that would have been within the Act."
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,966.724,967.755,--Certainly.
1980.79-1404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,973.941,975.58,--You would have ended up in a court somewhere.
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,975.58,978.048,--I believe that appellate process ended up in court.
1980.79-1404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,978.048,981.0,But you say an agency couldn't have done.
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,981.0,983.952,They could not have done what the Court of Appeals did here.
1980.79-1404,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,998.586,1014.674,"I suppose your argument also is that even if the agency could have done it, the proper way of enforcing would be through the agency rather than a direct suit in court like this?"
1980.79-1404,0,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,1014.674,1015.158,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-1404,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1079.897,1086.02,Mr. Kittredge.
1980.79-1404,1,42932,thomas_m_kittredge,,1086.02,1088.348,"Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1162.35,1169.472,"It was under Professor Hohfeld's analysis, whenever, there's a right, whenever anybody has a right, somebody else has a duty."
1980.79-1404,1,42932,thomas_m_kittredge,,1169.472,1173.659,"I think this Court dealt directly with that question, with respect to--"
1980.79-1404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1173.659,1174.642,Do you remember that?
1980.79-1404,1,42932,thomas_m_kittredge,,1177.391,1181.998,"--I think this Court has found that, for example, that there's a constitutional right to abortions."
1980.79-1404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1186.403,1187.544,"No, there's a freedom, there's a freedom."
1980.79-1404,1,42932,thomas_m_kittredge,,1199.506,1205.067,"--What would be the right, then, that was found by the 3rd Circuit?"
1980.79-1404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1219.592,1220.764,It's freedom.
1980.79-1404,1,42932,thomas_m_kittredge,,1226.075,1231.338,"If that is so, and if that was the intention of Congress, I submit, sir, that they would have plainly said so."
1980.79-1404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1236.288,1241.756,"Mr. Kittredge, what do you think Section 6010 does mean?"
1980.79-1404,1,42932,thomas_m_kittredge,,1241.756,1257.999,"I think that 6010 is an expression of what the Congress regarded as a statement of the obvious, that the mentally retarded do have a right to receive humane, decent, appropriate treatment and services."
1980.79-1404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1257.999,1258.515,What kind of right is it?
1980.79-1404,1,42932,thomas_m_kittredge,,1261.607,1263.137,"I don't think it's any of those, sir."
1980.79-1404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1274.382,1275.507,Is it the expression of or the creation of?
1980.79-1404,1,42932,thomas_m_kittredge,,1275.507,1277.412,"--Pardon, sir?"
1980.79-1404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1277.412,1284.956,"According to the Court of Appeals, it was the creation of a right, a statutory creation, a congressional creation of a right--"
1980.79-1404,1,42932,thomas_m_kittredge,,1284.956,1285.972,It in fact--
1980.79-1404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1285.972,1286.924,--not manifested before.
1980.79-1404,1,42932,thomas_m_kittredge,,1286.924,1291.438,"--If, in fact, Congress meant to create a right... ""create"", in an operative sense--"
1980.79-1404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1291.438,1291.72,Correct.
1980.79-1404,1,42932,thomas_m_kittredge,,1291.72,1296.592,"--they wouldn't have said, as they did in the 1978 amendment, that they were describing."
1980.79-1404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1371.234,1378.528,"Before you leave the Section 6010, is it not correct that Section 6010(3) describes an obligation?"
1980.79-1404,1,42932,thomas_m_kittredge,,1378.528,1379.84,"--It does indeed; yes, sir."
1980.79-1404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1379.84,1385.823,Do you just... you construe that as creating a new obligation or merely a prefatory-lire 6010(1) and (2)?
1980.79-1404,1,42932,thomas_m_kittredge,,1385.823,1387.415,"That's exactly right, quite; I do, sir."
1980.79-1404,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1409.781,1421.949,"Well, is it correct then that under your reading of the statute... and it may well be right... that the statute has the same right-creating and duty-creating effect if 6010 were totally eliminated from the statute?"
1980.79-1404,1,42932,thomas_m_kittredge,,1421.949,1422.244,That's correct.
1980.79-1404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1426.509,1434.007,"Of course, even if you're quite wrong and even if Congress purported to create rights and duties, there's a question of its power, isn't there?"
1980.79-1404,1,42932,thomas_m_kittredge,,1434.007,1435.069,"--Oh, absolutely, sir."
1980.79-1404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1505.556,1508.352,How many states have accepted these funds?
1980.79-1404,1,42932,thomas_m_kittredge,,1508.352,1510.116,I believe that all 50 have.
1980.79-1404,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1510.116,1514.428,"One recently, I think, withdrew, did it not?"
1980.79-1404,1,42932,thomas_m_kittredge,,1514.428,1522.174,"I believe, in Saturday's paper, it was reported that the State of Virginia has told the Federal Government that it can keep its DD Act money."
1980.79-1404,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1522.174,1539.76,"Isn't the second ground of the Court of Appeals, which purported to avoid the constitutional questions, really necessarily implicating constitutional questions through the back door?"
1980.79-1404,1,42932,thomas_m_kittredge,,1539.76,1558.472,"If you assume that the constitutional predicate of 6010 as found by the court below is the Fourteenth Amendment and the enforcement power in Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, then you have to determine what it is, what is the Fourteenth Amendment right that is being enforced?"
1980.79-1404,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1619.541,1624.852,"And the 3rd Circuit has not, then, avoided a constitutional question by its second holding?"
1980.79-1404,1,42932,thomas_m_kittredge,,1624.852,1626.085,"--I don't believe it has, sir."
1980.79-1404,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1734.963,1736.525,This was a federal district court?
1980.79-1404,1,42932,thomas_m_kittredge,,1736.525,1737.275,"Yes, sir, it was."
1980.79-1404,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1737.275,1738.086,Do you know who the judge was?
1980.79-1404,1,42932,thomas_m_kittredge,,1738.086,1740.039,I don't offhand.
1980.79-1404,1,15063,stanley_reed,scotus_justice,1798.187,1804.497,Have you cited that South Dakota case in your brief?
1980.79-1404,1,42932,thomas_m_kittredge,,1804.497,1807.214,I believe it's cited in an amicus brief.
1980.79-1404,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1811.104,1814.056,"If it isn't there, will you supply it to us?"
1980.79-1404,1,42932,thomas_m_kittredge,,1814.056,1815.227,"I shall be glad to do so, sir."
1980.79-1404,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1815.227,1818.82,If you're not sure that it's in the amicus brief.
1980.79-1404,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1825.286,1827.707,Mr. Klein.
1980.79-1404,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,1827.707,1830.69,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1404,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1903.66,1905.66,Where do those funds come from?
1980.79-1404,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,1905.66,1906.69,--From the State of Pennsylvania.
1980.79-1404,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2131.383,2132.788,Eliminated what?
1980.79-1404,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2132.788,2135.35,--The earmarking funds for deinstitutionalization.
1980.79-1404,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2199.543,2208.804,Could Congress have prescribed all of the conditions and limitations which the Court of Appeals has laid down?
1980.79-1404,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2208.804,2216.911,"I think, Your Honor, Congress could describe conditions as a condition of funding, so long as those conditions in themselves were not unconstitutional."
1980.79-1404,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2265.532,2274.154,"Well, Mr. Klein, you say this is just a conditional program, a grants-on-condition."
1980.79-1404,2,31305,joel_i_klein,,2281.853,2287.726,"--Mr. Justice White, if the conditions are as I describe them, they're not directly enforceable in court."
1980.79-1404,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2527.209,2534.942,Mr. Ferleger.
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2534.942,2555.761,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1404,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2618.126,2625.14,"Mr. Ferleger, you say that it's this situation which brings you to this Court."
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2638.462,2647.161,We would have been in this Court on constitutional grounds had Congress not enacted the Act after I filed the lawsuit in 1974.
1980.79-1404,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2647.161,2661.843,"Well, in other words, you're saying that the Constitution requires each state to provide some sort of care for the type of people you describe?"
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2661.843,2674.494,"We're saying that the Constitution requires the states to provide protection from denial of particular constitutional rights, which include the right to habilitation."
1980.79-1404,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2674.494,2677.493,"Well, what provision of the Constitution do you get that from?"
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2677.493,2686.442,"The sorts of rights I'm discussing are rights enunciated in this Court in Rodriguez, the right to more than zero education."
1980.79-1404,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2687.301,2688.972,Where are they enunciated in the Constitution?
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2690.003,2695.985,"--In the Fourteenth Amendment, the Due Process and Equal Protection Clause, and in the Eighth Amendment, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1980.79-1404,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2695.985,2710.792,"--Then you don't agree with your friend that the State of Pennsylvania could, or any other state, could close all of its institutions and simply say, people will have to take care of their own, as they did 100 or 200 years ago?"
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2710.792,2721.397,"Well, a denial of a right to care once someone is in a retardation program is, I think, different than a refusal of the state to create such a program."
1980.79-1404,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2737.125,2748.73,"What if, unlike Jackson v. Indiana, the state simply had never set about to create any sort of institutions for the mentally retarded?"
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2753.805,2754.633,"--No, I would not."
1980.79-1404,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2757.305,2761.179,But you won on your constitutional argument in the district court?
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2761.179,2761.882,That's correct.
1980.79-1404,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2761.882,2765.972,With respect to the people who hadn't been institutionalized?
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2765.972,2766.613,That's correct.
1980.79-1404,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2768.627,2771.907,And are you defending the judgment below on that ground?
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2771.907,2772.751,"--Yes, we do."
1980.79-1404,3,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2822.856,2834.039,"Mr. Ferleger, in view of your comments, do you disagree with General Warshaw's comment that Pennsylvania has been a leader in this field?"
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2834.039,2835.945,Pennsylvania has been a leader in this field.
1980.79-1404,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2895.311,2902.23,"But we have to presumably write a principal opinion, if we sustain your position."
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,2917.177,2919.552,I don't agree.
1980.79-1404,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3020.166,3036.395,"Mr. Ferleger, assuming the statute says precisely what you submit it says, your position is, I gather, that Congress had the power to enact this statute under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment?"
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3036.395,3038.582,"Yes, and Mr.--"
1980.79-1404,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3038.582,3042.409,You don't rely at all upon the spending power of Congress?
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3042.409,3052.887,"--Both the spending power and the Fourteenth Amendment, as the Court... Chief Justice Burger's opinion said in Fullilove, Congress used an amalgam of its power."
1980.79-1404,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3063.882,3065.601,Not from spending power?
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3065.601,3073.176,They said that because they rested it on that they don't have to reach the more difficult questions--
1980.79-1404,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3073.176,3085.75,"The spending power generally is, it's well established, that Congress can grant, as to a state... a state helps, say, in building a bridge, so long as the bridge meets certain specifications."
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3094.605,3094.933,--That is correct.
1980.79-1404,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3099.009,3101.212,"I know, but the offer is not nearly so explicit here, is it?"
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3112.442,3114.644,That's not correct and let me explain why.
1980.79-1404,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3120.766,3132.715,"My only point is that before you answer, the money expended by the Federal Government under this program is very inadequate to meet the so-called conditions of the grant."
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3132.715,3145.507,"--And that is why Congress said, we are creating the DD program to meld, in Congress's words, ""into a cohesive client-centered thrust"" all the other multi-habilitative programs."
1980.79-1404,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3145.507,3147.209,"So, including Medicaid and all the rest?"
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3147.209,3154.862,"Medicaid, Medicare, vocational rehabilitation, right to education for the handicapped... Congress noted all those in--"
1980.79-1404,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3154.862,3160.595,"You think this is a post-Medicaid imposition of a condition on the receipt of Medicaid, for example?"
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3160.595,3172.199,"--This is a requirement that the funds under Medicaid, funds which go to Pennhurst, for example, be used to provide habilitation, not to make people regress."
1980.79-1404,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3172.199,3181.18,"So your position is that any state that accepts medicaid is bound by what you say, 6010 of this statute requires?"
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3181.18,3181.993,Yes.
1980.79-1404,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3181.993,3196.392,"But even if that be true, what do you do with Justice Harlan's language of Rosado v. Wyman, where he says that if you don't like it, just don't take the funds?"
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3196.392,3198.158,He doesn't quite say that.
1980.79-1404,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3223.993,3230.131,Wouldn't you say the strong implication of the Rosado opinion is just a cutoff of funds?
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3230.131,3249.748,"I don't think so, Your Honor, because in Lau v. Nichols the Court said... and Chief Justice Burger's opinion in Fullilove in a separate section repeats the language... that affirmative relief is possible and required even though there was a cutoff remedy available to provide education for the Chinese students."
1980.79-1404,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3249.748,3257.776,But that was something that was based not just on the spending power?
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3257.776,3264.211,"Oh, that's... I'm talking about a Section 5 case, not simply the spending power case."
1980.79-1404,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3275.924,3280.235,"So, Rosado is irrelevant if you're right on the Section 5?"
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3280.235,3280.891,--Section 5?
1980.79-1404,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3281.891,3290.293,"Well, there are all sorts of affirmative obligations if a state voluntarily accepts the conditions of of welfare, of a highway program, or or building a bridge."
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3297.229,3298.368,That's correct.
1980.79-1404,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3298.368,3299.29,That's established.
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3304.944,3306.194,For example.
1980.79-1404,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3313.111,3314.22,"After, after the original grant?"
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3314.22,3317.298,"Well, Medicaid is one example, and it seems--"
1980.79-1404,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3317.298,3333.948,"Can Congress in 1960 say, we grant you X million dollars on these conditions and the state accepts the money on those conditions and complies with the conditions, and then in 1970 can Congress come along and impose additional conditions upon the 1960 grant?"
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3335.245,3348.722,"--No upon the 1960 funds, but upon all the funds that continue... $3 billion this year... to pour into these institutions, Congress can impose those conditions, and change the conditions, as Congress does frequently."
1980.79-1404,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3348.722,3351.736,May I ask a question along those lines?
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3359.124,3362.827,"That's a difficult question, Mr. Justice Powell, because--"
1980.79-1404,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3362.827,3364.607,What is your answer to it?
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3364.607,3380.117,"--Although it's not raised by this case, my answer would be that a state could only withdraw if it assured that the people who had been and are being benefited by the funds are not harmed."
1980.79-1404,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3382.147,3382.928,How would it do that?
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3382.928,3395.859,"--The difficulty of the question is that people currently receiving services, I think, would need to be assured of a lack of further harm for the state to withdraw."
1980.79-1404,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3395.859,3414.587,"I've understood you to argue that, you're talking about constitutional rights, if they are constitutional rights, even if a state withdrew, do you suggest a federal court would be obligated to construe and apply those rights?"
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3414.587,3416.82,I think a court would be obligated.
1980.79-1404,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3416.82,3421.022,Even if the only funding came from a state?
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3421.022,3421.538,Excuse me?
1980.79-1404,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3422.053,3436.345,"Even if the only funds for these institutions and for these patients came from the State of Pennsylvania, do I understand you to say that the rights you have described would still be enforceable by a federal court?"
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3436.345,3437.33,"Yes, they would."
1980.79-1404,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3452.464,3461.116,What if Congress cut off appropriations for the 6010-type programs?
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3461.116,3464.584,If Congress cut off appropriations?
1980.79-1404,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3464.584,3465.974,Just stopped appropriating money?
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3465.974,3470.988,"Then, Your Honor, we'd be back in the Court of Appeals on the constitutional issues."
1980.79-1404,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3470.988,3474.284,And what would you ask Congress... what would you make Congress do?
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3475.471,3481.406,"In that situation, in Pennsylvania, for my clients at Pennhurst--"
1980.79-1404,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3481.406,3483.296,I'm talking about the Chief Justice's hypothetical.
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3489.434,3489.965,"--No, no."
1980.79-1404,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3493.214,3494.743,"Well, what would you go into court for if they cut off the money?"
1980.79-1404,3,20870,david_ferleger,,3494.743,3499.133,"Not against the Congress, not against the Federal Government, but against the state--"
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,3858.521,3862.191,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1980.79-1404,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4115.011,4133.597,"Is there anything, Mr. Days, is there anything in the evidence that demonstrates that it is the custody that has caused that, or is it possible that that was the natural course of the unfortunate condition?"
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4133.597,4148.341,"--This record, Mr. Chief Justice, speaks very strongly to the point that however Pennsylvania officials have tried to fix up Pennhurst, the conditions recur."
1980.79-1404,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4172.285,4190.09,"The point I was inquiring about was, what is there in the record to demonstrate that a particular patient who has suffered regression, may not have suffered that same regression if they had stayed at home, or been somewhere else?"
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4190.09,4201.538,"--I think there is evidence in this record, Your Honor, that the fact that people in Pennhurst were not cared for, were not attended to, produced the type of regression that they experienced."
1980.79-1404,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4265.809,4281.975,"Do the experts really know whether this regression... and take the child, the younger person... comes from the environment or comes from a sense of abandonment by the parents?"
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4284.287,4291.392,"I think that the experts have testified uniformly that it does not come from the abandonment, it comes from conditions in the institution."
1980.79-1404,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4330.924,4344.295,"General Days, in Section 6011 of what has been referred to as D&D, it starts out with the statement,"
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4371.08,4373.814,The habilitation plan submitted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania?
1980.79-1404,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4373.814,4374.142,Yes.
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4374.142,4389.995,"It's my understanding that while there was paper compliance with some of these requirements, there was not the indication that in all respects habilitation plans had been provided."
1980.79-1404,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4414.454,4425.902,"Well, General, was there ever an indication by the Secretary that the state's compliance with the conditions of the statute was unsatisfactory?"
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4425.902,4427.026,"Not that I'm aware, Your Honor."
1980.79-1404,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4435.991,4436.991,"Well, that's true, isn't it?"
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4436.991,4443.177,"It is true, but I think one has to view that in the context of the particular action of the United States in this case."
1980.79-1404,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4447.222,4451.563,"Well, are you representing the agency that administers this program or not?"

1980.79-1404,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4460.278,4461.294,Whether it wants you to or not?
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4462.809,4463.762,"Well, with all due respect--"
1980.79-1404,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4463.762,4467.027,--Perfectly recurring situation.
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4467.027,4467.23,--That's right.

1980.79-1404,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4486.706,4486.94,Just about; yes.

1980.79-1404,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4582.793,4593.852,"But, General Days, is it not correct that in this litigation the United States did not raise any issue with respect to the violation of this statute until after the 3rd Circuit on its own motion brought the issue into the case?"

1980.79-1404,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4605.237,4608.268,And in your intervention you did not allege a violation of the statute?
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4608.268,4610.564,"That's right, we did not."
1980.79-1404,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4661.402,4663.792,"Well, what if we disagree with you on the statute and with the Court of Appeals?"
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4663.792,4680.004,"As we suggested in our brief, Mr. Justice White, if the Court believes that the DD Act does not provide an adequate basis for the relief below, we think that a remand is appropriate, so that the Court of Appeals can address the constitutional questions."
1980.79-1404,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4684.658,4690.265,"Mr. Days, before you proceed, perhaps you can help me on this question."
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4697.856,4700.589,--That's correct.
1980.79-1404,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4700.589,4704.572,Is it your position that that's entirely on the statute and the acceptance by the government of federal monies?
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4704.572,4705.743,That is correct.
1980.79-1404,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4705.743,4708.399,"In other words, you're not making any constitutional claim at all?"
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4708.399,4713.319,"Let me explain our intervention, Mr. Justice Powell."
1980.79-1404,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4738.309,4744.539,"But Mr. Days, couldn't you have prevented that somehow within the executive branch?"
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4760.722,4765.406,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we try to accomplish that on a daily basis."
1980.79-1404,4,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4842.001,4849.794,"Mr. Days, so that when you went in, you were also interested in enforcing the Act of Congress in that area?"
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4849.794,4850.497,I would take... absolutely.
1980.79-1404,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4858.494,4871.13,"General Day, just to clarify my thinking, are you saying that the federal Act would not have any applicability whatever, the DD Act, unless federal funds were being provided under it?"
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4871.13,4875.236,"That's not exactly correct, Mr. Justice Powell."
1980.79-1404,4,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4921.515,4930.418,"You're saying, if Medicaid funds are flowing, the obligations of 6010 would apply?"
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4930.418,4933.761,"That's absolutely our position, Mr. Justice Powell."
1980.79-1404,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4937.68,4948.317,"Well, then, if... and then, you take that position, you also take that position that 6010 was enacted by Congress in the exercise of its spending power?"
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4948.317,4951.626,"--That's correct, Your Honor; we are not here--"
1980.79-1404,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4951.626,4955.813,Even if there's no spending under the statute?
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4955.813,4963.591,"--Even if there were no spending under this statute, as long as there was spending under other federal programs."
1980.79-1404,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4963.591,4964.544,"Under some other, auspices?"
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,4964.544,4965.716,That's correct.
1980.79-1404,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5056.398,5073.5,"Mr. Days, could I ask, is there any evidence whatsoever, that the agency administering this statute had a view about the reach of the statute as applied to the Pennhurst situation?"
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,5078.764,5080.247,--There is certainly nothing definitive.
1980.79-1404,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5098.584,5113.672,"General Days, what is your response to the argument that if this is just an exercise of the spending power, the amount of money appropriated by the federal government is wholly inadequate to achieve the purposes that your construction of the statute would require?"
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,5113.672,5129.696,"My response, once again, goes back to the legislative history, that Congress on several occasions referred to the need to use DD funds to leverage the use of other federal and state monies to provide assistance to the developmentally disabled."
1980.79-1404,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5151.422,5165.337,"Don't you think that part of the established validity of the conditional spending power assumes that there shall be a knowing acceptance of the conditions on the part of the state, rather than a hidden, the acceptance that they only learn about afterwards."
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,5165.337,5168.68,Certainly it's preferable for Congress--
1980.79-1404,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5168.68,5173.225,"Well, don't you think that the whole validity of the concept depends upon that?"
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,5173.225,5178.13,--I don't think that the whole validity depends upon that.
1980.79-1404,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5179.332,5191.625,"The spending power is based upon the proposition that a state is free to accept or to reject the offer of federal funds, conditioned upon meeting certain requirements."
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,5197.074,5208.475,--I think what Congress has said in 6010 is not that the states are going to have their other federal funds terminated under the DD Act; that's perhaps another lawsuit.
1980.79-1404,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5225.36,5228.047,"Well, Pennsylvania seems to be quite surprised in this lawsuit."
1980.79-1404,4,20740,drew_s_days_iii,,5228.047,5242.759,"Well, perhaps I should say, no reasonable surprise associated with that arrangement, particularly during this long relationship between the Congress and the states in terms of effort to assist the developmentally disabled."
1980.79-1404,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5272.294,5280.916,Mr. Gilhool.
1980.79-1404,5,42713,thomas_k_gilhool,,5280.916,5283.806,"Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-1404,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5425.204,5437.854,But doesn't Congress have budgetary control over the federal executive institutions and oversight powers too?
1980.79-1404,5,42713,thomas_k_gilhool,,5437.854,5449.958,"Yes, indeed they do, Justice Rehnquist and 6010 in the four years immediately before its development came significantly from what the Congress had learned in the course of exercising that budgetary oversight."
1980.79-1404,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5466.202,5476.448,"I take it, when you speak about... the way you spoke about public funds, you are relying on the Fourteenth Amendment enforcement power?"
1980.79-1404,5,42713,thomas_k_gilhool,,5480.135,5480.775,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1404,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5480.775,5484.571,"You're just not speaking to the spending power, as General Days is?"
1980.79-1404,5,42713,thomas_k_gilhool,,5484.571,5488.411,"Your Honor, the spending power is perfectly adequate to reach--"
1980.79-1404,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5488.411,5494.722,Not to reach state funds except as tied to federal?
1980.79-1404,5,42713,thomas_k_gilhool,,5494.722,5496.066,"--Precisely, Your Honor."
1980.79-1404,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5496.066,5496.925,All right.
1980.79-1404,5,42713,thomas_k_gilhool,,5496.925,5517.775,"And in Harris v. McRae, this Court pointed out that not only are state funds which match federal funds reached, but the Congress has on occasion, in Title XIX, for example, and here, I suggest, also reached to state funds which are not matching funds but which are invoked for, similar purposes to those that the federal-state funds would be invoked for."
1980.79-1404,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5599.148,5600.117,When was 6010 passed?
1980.79-1404,5,42713,thomas_k_gilhool,,5600.117,5601.148,"--Pardon me, Justice--"
1980.79-1404,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5601.148,5602.851,When was 6010?
1980.79-1404,5,42713,thomas_k_gilhool,,5602.851,5604.802,"--1975, Justice Rehnquist."
1980.79-1404,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5605.427,5608.019,And when was this comment that you have referred to?
1980.79-1404,5,42713,thomas_k_gilhool,,5608.019,5609.472,"--In January, 1975."
1980.79-1404,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5609.472,5616.969,It was sometime during the year 1975 that the state of the art changed?
1980.79-1404,5,42713,thomas_k_gilhool,,5616.969,5619.263,"No, sir; oh, no, sir."
1980.79-1404,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5744.089,5754.195,May I interrupt long enough to ask you a question about how you think 6010(3) would actually operate under these circumstances?
1980.79-1404,5,42713,thomas_k_gilhool,,5790.477,5798.38,"Your Honor, Mr. Justice Blackmun's concurring opinion in Usery may have spoken to the question."
1980.79-1404,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5818.544,5818.825,Where would you draw the--
1980.79-1404,5,42713,thomas_k_gilhool,,5818.825,5830.117,"Well, Your Honor, I think this case does not raise that question for two reasons, both reflected in the legislative history of this Act, and in the record of this case."
1980.79-1404,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5848.766,5851.327,--But I'm asking what is a hypothetical question.
1980.79-1404,5,42713,thomas_k_gilhool,,5864.759,5872.242,"Your Honor, under no circumstances, it would be my view, could a federal court to issue an injunction against the Legislature of Pennsylvania."
1980.79-1404,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5872.242,5872.897,But what happens?
1980.79-1404,5,42713,thomas_k_gilhool,,5876.677,5886.672,"One remedial alternative for the district court would be to enjoin the use of federal funds, which are well in excess of $150 million in Pennsylvania."
1980.79-1404,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5886.672,5895.763,I understood you to say that 6010(3) authorized the federal courts to cut off those federal and state funds.
1980.79-1404,5,42713,thomas_k_gilhool,,5896.839,5899.245,"No, Your Honor, on the contrary."
1980.79-1404,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5978.011,5995.691,"But then, wouldn't that be a violation of the statutory act, the bill of rights, if the states simply say they quit and are not providing these mental patients with any of the bill of rights that Congress has announced they have?"
1980.79-1404,5,42713,thomas_k_gilhool,,5995.691,6008.436,"Yes, Justice Rehnquist, I think a strong argument can be made that such would violate the right declared in Section 1, in terms quite like the Civil Rights Act, 1982, where Title I of the Civil Rights Act--"
1980.79-1404,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6008.436,6010.247,Which horn of the dilemma do you choose?
1980.79-1404,5,42713,thomas_k_gilhool,,6010.247,6021.899,"--Well, Your Honor, I think we are faced with neither horn of the dilemma in this case, and the Court is not required to reach that question."
1980.79-1404,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6021.899,6034.831,"Well, if 6010 was enacted exclusively under Congress's spending power, then I suppose the state could withdraw, and not accept any federal spending."
1980.79-1404,5,42713,thomas_k_gilhool,,6034.831,6036.862,"Yes, Your Honor, that is--"
1980.79-1404,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6036.862,6043.577,"If on the other hand it were enacted under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, then perhaps a state couldn't withdraw."
1980.79-1404,5,42713,thomas_k_gilhool,,6043.577,6044.826,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-1404,6,31305,joel_i_klein,,6252.697,6256.178,"Mr. Chief Justice, if it's possible for the Court--"

1980.79-1404,7,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6261.879,6274.171,"Mr. Klein, I was about to ask your colleague before he ceded his time whether he agreed that the money was available?"
1980.79-1404,8,31305,joel_i_klein,,6274.171,6277.997,--Maybe.
1980.79-1404,8,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6279.325,6291.476,The claim is that one justification for the injunction is that the money is there and the state just refuses to spend it in accordance with the Act.
1980.79-1404,9,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,6291.476,6295.069,"Your Honor, there are two branches to that argument."
1980.79-1404,9,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6295.553,6297.318,"Well, did the Court find the money was available?"
1980.79-1404,9,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,6297.318,6303.832,"--If found that there was $18 million which had not yet been spent, but it had been committed to projects."
1980.79-1404,9,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6309.734,6310.719,Is there a short answer to my question?
1980.79-1404,9,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,6311.781,6312.155,There isn't.
1980.79-1404,9,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6339.145,6339.379,I guess there isn't a short answer.
1980.79-1404,9,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,6362.385,6365.744,I don't think on a federal grant statute they can tell us how to spend our funds.
1980.79-1404,9,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6370.82,6373.975,"They can only stop the federal flow of funds, is that it?"
1980.79-1404,9,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,6373.975,6374.428,"--Yes, sir."

1980.79-1404,9,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6403.463,6407.102,"And if you accept this, your program has to meet these specifications."
1980.79-1404,9,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,6407.102,6407.462,"Yes, sir."
1980.79-1404,9,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6413.226,6425.579,"You're saying, when the government grant comes, it's your money, and then the only way to enforce it is to enjoin its use, except in compliance with the Act."
1980.79-1404,9,17269,allen_c_warshaw,,6425.579,6426.016,"--Yes, sir."

1980.79-1404,10,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6578.221,6578.909,Is that a general statute?
1980.79-1404,10,31305,joel_i_klein,,6578.909,6580.908,That is a general statute.
