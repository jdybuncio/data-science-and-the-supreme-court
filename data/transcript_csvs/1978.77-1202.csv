1978.77-1202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,70.882,We'll hear arguments next in Michigan against Doran.
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,75.607,91.649,"Chief Justice Burger, members of the Court, I first address the question in this cause of the motion for dismissal on the grounds of mootness, which has been filed by counsel for the respondent herein."
1978.77-1202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,272.878,278.082,Would it make any difference whether he is in Michigan or in Cuba for the purposes of this case?
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,278.082,278.974,That's right sir.
1978.77-1202,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,278.974,281.938,"Well, it will make a difference if you are in Arizona, would it not?"
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,281.938,284.058,Yes sir.
1978.77-1202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,284.058,286.004,That's why I picked Cuba.
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,286.004,293.429,"Well sir, at the moment, I would suggest to Mr. Doran, Michigan, after all he's got -- he's safe there."
1978.77-1202,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,324.645,326.016,You do concede this.
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,326.016,326.795,Yes sir we do.
1978.77-1202,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,326.795,328.136,This simplifies the case.
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,328.136,328.975,Yes sir.
1978.77-1202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,390.233,413.79,"Would you say that the asylum state may at least demand that the demanding state when it presents its papers to the Governor of the asylum state, must the demanding state at least show that probable cause has been determined in that state before a warrant was issued?"
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,413.79,414.772,Yes sir.
1978.77-1202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,419.024,437.88,"And do you think -- do you think the asylum state may demand not only that the demanding state demonstrate that probable cause has been judicially determined in the demanding state, but that the demanding state demonstrate the basis for that determination?"
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,441.617,442.958,Yes sir.
1978.77-1202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,452.449,453.557,Re-examination?
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,453.557,454.036,Yes sir.
1978.77-1202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,454.036,456.791,Why do you conceive that with respect with probable cause?
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,473.971,475.133,Yes sir.
1978.77-1202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,482.367,483.948,Article I of what?
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,483.948,493.643,"Of the United States Constitution, which says that upon demand of the Governor of one state, the fugitive shall be rendered up to the demanding state."
1978.77-1202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,493.643,496.9,"I thought that was Article IV, Section 2?"
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,496.9,500.014,"I -- I stand corrected sir, Article IV, Section 2."
1978.77-1202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,500.014,503.877,Well if you rely on that why do you get to the issue of probable cause under --
1978.77-1202,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,503.877,514.948,Why did -- why did you concede just what you did that the demandings that the asylum state may at least demand that the -- a showing that the demanding state passed on probable cause?
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,514.948,517.518,"Well, I did not know that I made that concession sir."
1978.77-1202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,519.337,527.063,"Well, were you undertaking to tell us that all the demanding state need to show us a prima facie case of probable --"
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,527.063,527.356,Yes sir.
1978.77-1202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,527.356,528.913,-- cause by its papers?
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,528.913,546.788,"The big complaint, as I get it here, is that the affidavit in complaint, whereby in pursuant to which the warrant of arrest was issued merely stated the crime in the “conclusory” language of the statute."
1978.77-1202,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,553.429,566.627,"Mr. Attorney General, doesn't a warrant show that Arizona says that this man stole a car in Arizona on the same day he was under arrest in Michigan?"
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,566.627,567.526,Yes sir.
1978.77-1202,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,568.687,569.609,Is that possible?
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,569.609,570.118,No sir.
1978.77-1202,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,586.909,588.22,But when was the warrant issued?
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,590.496,595.52,"About -- let's see, we picked him up sir on December 18th, 1975."
1978.77-1202,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,595.52,597.28,I'm talking about the Arizona --
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,597.28,602.55,"Oh, the Arizona, I think was issued in the middle of January sir."
1978.77-1202,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,602.55,605.718,And it wasn't issued until after he was picked up in Michigan?
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,605.718,606.999,Yes sir.
1978.77-1202,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,606.999,612.958,"And after Michigan notified Arizona, that was when it was issued?"
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,612.958,614.18,Yes sir.
1978.77-1202,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,614.18,615.581,Real collaboration.
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,615.581,617.048,Yes sir.
1978.77-1202,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,617.048,618.485,When did you pick him up?
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,618.485,621.599,"We picked him up December 18th, 1975 sir."
1978.77-1202,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,621.599,623.665,And when did the Arizona warrant issue?
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,623.665,633.755,"Arizona issued 01-07-76, less than a month later the Arizona warrant issued sir."
1978.77-1202,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,633.755,642.432,"Well then, it may have been said that the Arizona authorities were relying on the Michigan arrest for a probable cause?"
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,642.432,642.905,No sir.
1978.77-1202,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,648.624,649.786,When?
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,649.786,655.738,It was sometime between December 18th and --
1978.77-1202,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,655.738,658.552,Was it -- was it before or after the Michigan arrest?
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,658.552,661.367,It was after sir.
1978.77-1202,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,661.367,663.936,And it was after Michigan notified Arizona?
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,663.936,664.679,Yes sir.
1978.77-1202,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,664.679,667.457,And so far the records on Arizona didn't know anything about it.
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,667.457,668.296,"Well, that's right sir."
1978.77-1202,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,671.304,677.769,"It doesn't say that, they could have issued the warrant without knowing where he was, couldn't they?"
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,677.769,679.967,I suppose but to -- what avail the --
1978.77-1202,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,679.967,682.061,Don't they usually do that?
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,682.061,684.121,"Not to my knowledge, no sir."
1978.77-1202,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,684.121,696.361,"Well, have you ever heard of -- can you give me any case where this happened, where a warrant was issued after the man was arrested in another state?"
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,696.361,701.086,"Most of the extraditions that I have dealt with did that, yes sir."
1978.77-1202,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,709.763,711.104,That's when they issued the warrant.
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,711.104,712.841,Yes sir.
1978.77-1202,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,712.841,714.092,For arrest?
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,714.092,716.009,Yes sir.
1978.77-1202,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,716.009,717.38,Often they don't know who he is.
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,717.38,720.494,"That's right, yes sir."
1978.77-1202,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,720.494,722.62,Until he's apprehended in the asylum state.
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,722.62,723.063,That's right.
1978.77-1202,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,753.746,755.566,And then you kept him in jail for two years?
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,755.566,760.806,"Oh yes sir, oh that would be a heinous --"
1978.77-1202,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,760.806,766.848,"Well, what is the amount of time you get for stealing the vehicle in Arizona?"
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,766.848,769.177,"Well, I suppose it's less than five years sir."
1978.77-1202,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,769.177,770.255,"Could be two, couldn't it?"
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,770.255,772.141,"It could, yes sir."
1978.77-1202,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,800.478,805.179,"He just want you to abide by the law, that's all."
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,805.179,806.67,"Now, historically --"
1978.77-1202,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,806.67,811.281,"Well, you say it takes further little imagination but I don't even have that minimum amount of imagination (Voice Overlap)."
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,811.281,815.586,"Obviously, he didn't want to run the risk of conviction and sentence in Arizona."
1978.77-1202,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,815.586,819.149,"Well, he couldn't be any worse off than being in prison, could he?"
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,819.149,822.646,"Yes sir, I can understand that."
1978.77-1202,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,822.646,827.646,Well then you say it takes further little imagination to see (Voice Overlap) exercise why he didn't (Voice Overlap)?
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,827.646,837.975,"Obviously, he believed the risk of conviction and sentence in Arizona was so very probable that he'd rather sit in the Michigan jail."
1978.77-1202,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,837.975,841.149,"Well, that's a certainty when you're in jail, not a probability."
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,841.149,842.137,Yes sir and --
1978.77-1202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,842.137,847.985,"He was there then pending of the possession charged in the State of Michigan, was he not?"
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,847.985,848.428,Yes sir.
1978.77-1202,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,848.428,850.045,"Well, when was that charge dismissed?"
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,850.045,860.398,"It was dismissed in January of 1976, when the Arizona requisition arrived and the Governor of Michigan issued his warrant of arrest pursuant to the Arizona --"
1978.77-1202,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,860.398,863.841,"So it's probably dismissed as soon as the people for Arizona arrived, isn't that right?"
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,863.841,864.231,Yes sir.
1978.77-1202,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,864.231,865.453,Or the requisition arrived.
1978.77-1202,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,865.453,867.004,"So, the two years was after that?"
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,867.004,867.776,Yes sir.
1978.77-1202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,867.776,876.788,You're suggesting he was following Hamlet's advised that we would rather bear those evils we have than flee to others that we know not of?
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,876.788,879.962,"Perhaps sir, perhaps."
1978.77-1202,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,881.699,886.992,Or are you suggesting the Michigan jails are warmer in Arizona?
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,895.19,900.992,"Obviously, he did not want the Arizona conviction and probable sentence that would follow."
1978.77-1202,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,900.992,906.106,"And he correctly anticipated that if he stuck it out in the Michigan courts, he might ultimately get free, which he did."
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,906.106,910.322,"Oh yes sir, it took four courts for the man (Voice Overlap)."
1978.77-1202,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,913.305,914.167,I'm not sure he is.
1978.77-1202,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,914.167,920.095,Have you ever think that there's a good possibility that this man is innocent?
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,920.095,921.922,"Well sir, yes, but --"
1978.77-1202,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,921.922,925.688,I can't get -- all your assumption is that he's going to be convicted in Arizona.
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,925.688,926.437,"Oh, no sir."
1978.77-1202,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,927.18,934.599,"Well, you kept -- didn't you just say that the reason he did it was because if he went to Arizona he'd be convicted?"
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,935.282,937.791,"He was obviously afraid of that, yes sir."
1978.77-1202,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,937.791,940.33,"Well then, you don't assume that the man is innocent."
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,940.33,947.749,"I would -- I will always assume, evidently he didn't."
1978.77-1202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,976.261,979.465,And you said that's the end of the inquiry by the asylum state?
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,979.465,980.243,Yes sir.
1978.77-1202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1071.754,1077.048,"Well, the Governor of Michigan can exercise compassion under Kentucky against Dennison if he wants to, can he?"
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,1077.048,1079.916,Oh yes sir.
1978.77-1202,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1088.24,1091.228,"Well, it says the duty can't be enforced by mandamus."
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,1091.228,1093.174,Oh that's right sir.
1978.77-1202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1106.797,1108.078,We don't have that here though.
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,1108.078,1108.647,No sir.
1978.77-1202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1108.647,1112.031,It wasn't the governor who did this.
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,1112.031,1112.803,"No sir, it was not."
1978.77-1202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1137.94,1139.431,Thank you Mr. Solicitor General.
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,1139.431,1139.94,Yes sir.
1978.77-1202,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1139.94,1141.407,It's now fifty.
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,1141.407,1162.815,Fifty.
1978.77-1202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1162.815,1163.294,You may continue counsel.
1978.77-1202,0,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,1163.294,1165.534,"Chief Justice, may I please the Court."
1978.77-1202,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1170.768,1173.457,Very well.
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1178.182,1181.619,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1202,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1214.332,1218.224,That was entirely appropriate Ms.Cummins for you to do so.
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1218.224,1228.347,"I do have one additional fact to relate to the Court, which came to light after the memorandum was filed, however."
1978.77-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1260.515,1262.814,That was a local hotel in the State of Michigan?
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1262.814,1272.066,In Bay City.
1978.77-1202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1299.631,1310.583,"Ms.Cummins, would you -- is there any explanation in the arrest, in the records as to the original Michigan arrest?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1310.583,1316.691,"Well, the record is somewhat murky as to the details surrounding Mr. Doran's --"
1978.77-1202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1316.691,1319.05,"Let me again, what was he arrested for?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1319.05,1327.404,He was arrested on a charge of possession of a stolen vehicle in Bay City on December 18th.
1978.77-1202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1327.404,1329.973,This is the same vehicle?
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1329.973,1330.925,Yes.
1978.77-1202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1330.925,1335.745,"Well, how does he -- how do you know it's the same vehicle?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1335.745,1339.997,It was the vehicle in which he had driven from Arizona.
1978.77-1202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1340.829,1345.021,You mean he was arrested because he was driving a car without a state license?
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1345.021,1352.41,"Apparently a check, and I'm not sure of this and the record does not really clear up this question."
1978.77-1202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1359.716,1361.985,But that was after he was arrested.
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1361.985,1363.722,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1363.722,1370.453,"If you've backed up a little I want to know when he was arrested, they said you are arrested for what?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1370.453,1372.812,I don't believe that was ever made certain Your Honor.
1978.77-1202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1373.052,1374.663,"We don't know, do we?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1374.663,1377.172,No.
1978.77-1202,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1426.365,1430.97,"Isn't that what most extraditions are, Ms.Cummins?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1436.593,1440.569,"Yes, Your Honor, I don't know what the statistics are on that."
1978.77-1202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1442.605,1456.97,"Doesn't the Constitution say that a person charged in any state with treason, felony, or other crime, we shall flee from justice, and be found in any other state, shall, on demand of the executive authority of the state from which he fled be delivered up?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1456.97,1457.719,"Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1978.77-1202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1457.719,1459.24,Where's the dilemma then?
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1459.24,1464.503,I don't -- I don't dispute the fact that extradition maybe he had on the mere charge.
1978.77-1202,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1478.246,1491.354,"Well, does the Michigan Supreme Court reviewed the Governor's exercise of discretion or did they review under the Constitution and the Federal Act?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1491.354,1503.653,"They are acting as a habeas corpus court, under the right of habeas corpus that has been traditionally provided to accuse fugitives."
1978.77-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1515.558,1519.115,They certainly indicated that the charge had been made.
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1519.115,1519.648,Yes.
1978.77-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1521.708,1530.744,"And held that despite the Constitution, something -- some papers besides indicating something besides the charge was necessary."
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1530.744,1531.936,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1548.427,1553.996,"So your answer is yes, so they must show something besides the charge."
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1553.996,1560.876,"Yes, they must show something besides a mere conclusion that probable cause has been found in the mere name of the charge."
1978.77-1202,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1560.876,1569.768,"But if he is indicted by a grand jury, could the Michigan courts re-examine the basis upon which the grand jury indicted?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1569.768,1572.942,"No Your Honor, and the Michigan Supreme Court distinguish that situation."
1978.77-1202,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1575.098,1577.876,"But that's all, they said they're not dealing, but could they?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1577.876,1578.565,Right.
1978.77-1202,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1578.565,1579.553,Could they?
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1579.553,1581.763,"No, they couldn't -- they couldn't reach that situation."
1978.77-1202,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1581.763,1588.703,"And what's the reason for that, because the Constitution uses the word “shall surrender up”?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1588.703,1602.955,I believe the reason for the distinction was that a grand jury indictment imports a finding of probable cause or at least a finding that is equivalent that the law views as equivalent to a finding of probable cause.
1978.77-1202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1602.955,1613.218,"What if just a charge without any supporting papers have been furnished to the Michigan authority, would the Michigan Supreme Court have come out the same way in your view?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1613.218,1616.602,"I think more so, they would have come out more emphatically."
1978.77-1202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1616.602,1621.806,So that it isn't a question of the Arizona authorities having furnished too much.
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1629.495,1630.627,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1630.627,1643.196,"Now, how do you reconcile that with the statement in matter of Strauss, the opinion this Court by Justice Brewer, where he says that who would doubt that an information is sufficient?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1643.196,1653.609,"I think what matter that Strauss is really dealing with was, at what stage does a criminal prosecution have to be advanced before extradition can be had upon their charge?"
1978.77-1202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1670.193,1684.229,"But in Strauss, the Court does say an information would be sufficient, which is what was involved in Gerstein against Pugh, and this Court held was not sufficient for probable cause?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1684.229,1704.013,"Yes, Your Honor but perhaps at least as far as that proposition is evident in matter of Strauss, that case should be re-examined in the light of Gerstein, but we don't have any dispute was Strauss' basic proposition in the mere charge is enough and that the meaning of the word “charged” is to be construed liberally."
1978.77-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1704.013,1711.735,"What in fact, Ms.Cummins, was furnished by the demanding state by Arizona in this case?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1711.735,1717.544,The demanding state furnished a warrant supported by a complaint.
1978.77-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1739.053,1740.394,And sworn to?
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1740.394,1742.58,Sworn to before a magistrate.
1978.77-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1742.58,1750.628,So it would be -- the constitutional provision says a person charge in any state and that's the extent of what it says.
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1773.436,1774.245,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1774.245,1774.868,Where's the complaint --
1978.77-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1774.868,1782.587,It wasn't insufficient and so far as the -- it wasn't an insufficient demand so far as the statutory language goes?
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1782.587,1783.33,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1783.33,1784.073,Right.
1978.77-1202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1784.073,1793.917,"The Solicitor General said that date of January, of December was changed, where is that in the record?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1793.917,1799.48,"Well, the complaint was amended to change the date of offense from December 18."
1978.77-1202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1799.48,1801.839,Is that in this appendix?
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1801.839,1804.564,I don't believe that the amended complaint is in the appendix.
1978.77-1202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1804.564,1808.57,"Well, how does it get before us?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1808.57,1813.833,"Well, I was under the impression that the Court had at its disposal of the complete record."
1978.77-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1813.833,1814.402,We do.
1978.77-1202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1814.402,1817.187,"Well, didn't you work on this appendix?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1817.187,1817.57,Yes.
1978.77-1202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1818.462,1828.103,"And you left these -- you left two documents in here that were corrected, and you didn't put the corrected ones in."
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1828.103,1829.115,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1830.816,1836.529,And you want me to rule with you and you don't even give me the documents to go with it.
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1836.529,1838.469,"I'm sorry for that oversight, Your Honor."
1978.77-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1843.499,1846.433,"And the complete record has been filed with the clerk in this case, isn't it?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1846.433,1848.679,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1202,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1848.679,1854.93,"Ms.Cummins, may I ask an arrest warrant issued in Arizona, in this case, did it not?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1854.93,1855.889,A warrant.
1978.77-1202,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1855.889,1856.961,And arrest warrant.
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1856.961,1858.751,"Yes, a warrant accompanied the complaint."
1978.77-1202,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1858.751,1860.278,"Yes, but it was an arrest warrant?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1860.278,1861.147,"Yes, it was."
1978.77-1202,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1861.147,1881.86,"But I wondered, Mr. Justice -- my brother Rehnquist asked you about Strauss earlier, there's another excerpt from Strauss, that was the word “charged” was used and its broad signification to cover any proceeding, which a state might see fit to adopt, by which a formal accusation was made against the alleged criminal."
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1903.86,1907.089,"Yes, Your Honor, papers were filed which charge to crime --"
1978.77-1202,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1907.089,1927.412,"No, but my question is, there was a charge, a sworn charge of a crime in Arizona, together with a warrant, an arrest warrant that was issued."
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1933.367,1950.134,"Strauss merely -- in my interpretation, Strauss takes a liberal view of the meaning of the word “charged” not as to the substance of the charge but as to how advanced the charge has to be, how advance the prosecution has to be --"
1978.77-1202,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1950.134,1963.96,"Well no, my real question was, wasn't everything that was submitted by Arizona, the Governor of Michigan in this case, did not -- those papers together satisfy what Strauss said would satisfy?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1963.96,1967.517,"Oh yes, Your Honor, definitely."
1978.77-1202,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1967.517,1969.786,Then why doesn't Strauss cover this case and would call for reversal?
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1969.786,1995.31,"Because I think that Strauss has expanded or at least further clarified by other holdings of this Court which in extradition cases which state that upon habeas corpus review of the demanding state's charging documents, an accuse may raise a question of the substantiality of the charge and that this is a question of law and that it's limited (Voice Overlap) to the face of the document."
1978.77-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1995.31,1998.867,"That's an issue that Strauss didn't deal with, that's your point, isn't it?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,1998.867,1999.13,Yes.
1978.77-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1999.13,2000.538,That was not an issue in Strauss?
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2000.538,2001.969,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2001.969,2009.484,"This warrant also resided, however, that a magistrate had found reasonable cause to believe."
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2019.095,2021.005,"Yes, Your Honor but that --"
1978.77-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2021.005,2026.664,"And you -- and you suggest that there must be some facts to support that, is that it?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2026.664,2026.808,Yes.
1978.77-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2026.808,2033.539,Not only some facts but enough facts to satisfy the asylum state that there really is probable cause?
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2033.539,2037.455,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1202,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2037.455,2059.418,"Even on then, Ms.Cummins, why in the other document filed, it gives the name, the motor number that vehicle, describes a vehicle that registered owner of the vehicle, and he says he took it from that person on such and such a date, wouldn't that be enough substantiation effect that there had been a -- there was probable cause, together with this conclusory statement of the magistrate that I have found probable cause?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2063.223,2069.301,"Well, these details that you mentioned are really not facts, they're conclusions."
1978.77-1202,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2069.301,2081.57,"Well, but didn't the arresting officers in Michigan verify that this was a vehicle and they arrest him, because he was thought to be in possession of a stolen vehicle that this had been -- I mean didn't they know this?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2081.57,2088.576,"They knew no more than the complaint which was eventually issued, which was stated on information and belief."
1978.77-1202,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2088.576,2094.085,But are you suggesting that the charge in Michigan had no basis?
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2102.013,2103.534,It's quite possible.
1978.77-1202,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2125.349,2135.343,"Well, didn't Justice Brewer in Strauss -- didn't Justice Brewer in Strauss emphasized that this was not the time and place to be trying out the facts of the case and the evidence?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2135.343,2136.75,"Oh yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1202,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2137.259,2139.894,You seem to be calling for some evidence rather than ultimate facts.
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2139.894,2151.535,"No, Mr. Chief Justice we're not calling for evidence, the Michigan Supreme Court was careful to point out, we do not suggest that we inquire into the underlying facts."
1978.77-1202,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2187.758,2201.195,Didn't someone -- some official in the State of Michigan make a determination of facts that there are essentially consistent with the determination made by the magistrate in Arizona?
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2201.195,2202.303,The Governor of Michigan --
1978.77-1202,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2202.303,2214.992,"No, I'm not speaking of the Governor, I'm speaking of whatever judicial or other officer caused to be filed a charge against Doran in Michigan courts."
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2218.609,2219.86,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.77-1202,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2219.86,2237.944,"Well then, suppose there's a deficiency, some of deficiency for the moment in the conclusions that you object to, aren't they supplied to the State of Michigan, by Michigan's own action?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2247.945,2260.484,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice but the issues in our case of receiving and concealing a stolen vehicle are different from the issues involved in the charge of larceny."
1978.77-1202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2302.196,2319.016,"Well, Michigan Supreme Court really didn't hold that they had that right in the sense of the Governor Miller can have that right, they said that Governor Miller couldn't execute the extradition warrant because the Federal Constitution prohibited from doing so, until they made that determination, didn't they?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2327.67,2338.149,"No, the Michigan Supreme Court stated categorically, this state cannot extradite, unless provided with sufficient details in the case like this to confirm a showing of probable cause."
1978.77-1202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2338.149,2340.455,And the reason was the Federal Constitution.
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2340.455,2342.096,Yes.
1978.77-1202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2342.096,2356.461,"Ms.Cummins, I have before the record, which consists of a certification of the record, the briefs and appendices and opinion of the Court."
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2361.282,2372.533,"Well, Mr. Justice Marshall, perhaps this confusion is resulting from my ignorance of this Court's procedural rules about who's responsibility it is to bring up the entire record."
1978.77-1202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2381.336,2382.857,All I'm saying madam --
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2382.857,2387.641,The appendix need not necessarily be complete because the Court would have the whole record before it.
1978.77-1202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2387.641,2391.623,All I'm saying is that you told me it was here a few minutes ago.
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2391.623,2393.27,"I assumed that was here, Your Honor."
1978.77-1202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2393.27,2401.534,"Well, thank you."
1978.77-1202,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2401.534,2413.444,"Ms.Cummins, I suppose this is completely irrelevant, but does the record show whether the Arizona Justice of the Peace who issued the arrest warrant was a lawyer?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2413.444,2414.253,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-1202,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2422.69,2434.996,"Secondly, is there any evidence in the record that the Justice of the Peace have before her the nine-page report that is referred to in the supporting affidavit of February 3?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2434.996,2446.547,There's an indication that she didn't have this before her because that affidavit was issued February 3rd and the warrant and complaints were issued January 7th.
1978.77-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2446.547,2456.391,But we don't really know that the totality of what was before the Justice of the Peace.
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2456.391,2456.781,"No, we don't."
1978.77-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2456.781,2459.589,"That might have been personal statements, aren't they."
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2459.589,2465.757,There might have been the Arizona procedures as pointed out by the Attorney General does provide for additional investigation.
1978.77-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2545.739,2552.41,"Oh, I suppose -- I suppose you would permit the demanding state to participate in the hearing?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2552.41,2553.991,"If they had expressed any interest in doing so, yes."
1978.77-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2553.991,2559.195,And would you permit them to present evidence of probable cause?
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2559.195,2568.77,"Yes, Your Honor, although we are not suggesting that habeas corpus review be expanded beyond a legal review of the sufficiency of the documents."
1978.77-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2579.333,2590.674,"You mean -- you mean if the demanding state -- if the asylum state determine that the papers were insufficient, that it would really expedite extradition to say the demanding state couldn't even supplement the information?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2590.674,2591.836,"Oh no, Your Honor."
1978.77-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2619.974,2631.98,But no matter how probable cause is determined in the demanding state or had been determined you would say the asylum state has a constitutional obligation to review that determination?
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2631.98,2646.059,"Yes, Your Honor because if confirmation of probable cause is not had in the asylum state prior to rendition, then the accused will have no Fourth Amendment remedy for extradition, once extradition takes place."
1978.77-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2646.059,2652.76,"Well, Gerstein said there should a probable cause determination, isn't it?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2652.76,2654.251,"Yes, Gerstein --"
1978.77-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2654.251,2665.802,"Well, if the demanding state says there has been then you have no reason to doubt that the fact that that event took place, why hasn't Gerstein satisfied?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2665.802,2672.533,Because Gerstein requires a probable cause determination by a neutral and detached magistrate.
1978.77-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2672.533,2676.868,I know but the papers here show that there was one in the demanding state.
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2676.868,2691.599,"Your Honor, this Court has always held that a probable cause finding by a neutral and detached magistrate maybe subject to review to determine if there were facts before the magistrate which really indicate that he made an independent assessment of probable cause."
1978.77-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2691.599,2697.521,"Yeah, but not in the -- not in the asylum state?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2697.521,2710.24,"But in the situation of a conventional arrest or a conventional search warrant, in here, extradition poses arguably and even more significant restraint than a mere arrest or a search."
1978.77-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2741.289,2745.93,"In Gerstein, that's exactly what was alleged, had been done."
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2772.156,2772.455,Yes sir.
1978.77-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2772.455,2779.342,"And this person would have all these -- your client would have all these Gerstein rights when it was returned in Arizona, wouldn't he?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2779.342,2780.324,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2780.324,2782.57,Assuming that he says he didn't have them.
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2782.57,2791.935,Gerstein afforded the right to interpose a probable cause determination between arrest and the point where a restraint becomes significant and in the extradition --
1978.77-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2791.935,2794.869,"Well, but that was a point after some confinement, wasn't it?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2794.869,2804.48,"Yes, but in an extradition case, the restraint becomes significant when the person is extradited, and after he's extradited he has no remedy."
1978.77-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2804.803,2810.941,"He has all the remedies that Gerstein has in the State of Florida and that he would have had, had he not left Arizona."
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2810.941,2813.54,But there's two phases to an extradition arrest.
1978.77-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2820.354,2821.971,Forced travel back home?
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2821.971,2822.51,Yes.
1978.77-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2822.51,2823.109,I mean --
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2823.109,2823.612,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-1202,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2841.241,2853.151,"Correct, you and I together, it's -- starting at page 86, there's a full discussion in the appendix of the changing of the dates."
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2858.001,2858.9,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1978.77-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2858.9,2886.059,"Could I -- can i ask you if -- suppose an information is filed but the defendant isn't in custody and then the officer goes before a magistrate, an independent magistrate, and wants to get an arrest warrant and he gets it on a determination of probable cause, then he is arrested."
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2891.921,2893.059,Gerstein merely --
1978.77-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2893.059,2894.466,Does it or not?
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2894.466,2895.364,No.
1978.77-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2895.364,2902.37,"Well, in this case, the officers who swore out to charge also got a warrant from a magistrate."
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2906.263,2910.538,Because Gerstein required a determination by a neutral and detached magistrate not a mere --
1978.77-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2910.538,2916.287,"Well, what was it -- how do you know this wasn't a neutral and detached magistrate, this was a Justice of the Peace?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2916.287,2922.119,Because there's no indication of the facts upon which a neutral and detached finding a probable cause could have been made.
1978.77-1202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2922.119,2927.808,"Well, that's saying that she acted wrongly not that she was not neutral and detached."
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2927.808,2943.311,"Part of the neutral and detached requirement extends to whether or not the facts are sufficient to convince -- a) to support an independent finding, a detached finding, and b) to satisfy the review in Court, that such a detached finding was made."
1978.77-1202,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2943.311,2952.676,"In Shadwick against City of Tampa which Justice Powell wrote for the Court some years ago, we held that city clerks of this Tampa were neutral and detached magistrates."
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2966.719,2975.396,"Yes, that's one aspect of the neutral and detached requirement that was review in Shadwick v. Tampa, and the question there was whether or not clerks of the Court could be judicial officers."
1978.77-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2979.821,2993.384,"Suppose this warrant have been signed by a judge of the Court of general jurisdiction in Arizona, but it had exactly the same recitation in it, I have determine that there's reasonable cause to believe, etcetera."
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,2999.597,3008.04,"We would make exactly the same claim we're making here, which is not to go behind the determination, but merely to confirm the determination on the basis of face of --"
1978.77-1202,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3008.04,3010.465,"Confirm it or disagree with it, either one?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,3010.465,3011.453,Or disagree.
1978.77-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3011.453,3014.567,So you really want two bites of the apple?
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,3014.567,3015.136,"Not necessarily, Your Honor."
1978.77-1202,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3015.136,3016.154,In Arizona and in Michigan.
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,3016.154,3030.421,"Not necessarily, Your Honor, but in an extradition case, not a renewed finding, not a rehearing but a confirmation of the existence of probable cause must be made if the accused rights are to be protected."
1978.77-1202,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3030.421,3044.517,"Of course, as a practical matter, this man has spent more than two years in Michigan jails, when he might have had this whole matter resolved by simply responding to the extraditions."
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,3044.517,3045.05,He might have --
1978.77-1202,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3045.05,3049.415,"So the hardships cut both ways, don't they?"
1978.77-1202,1,33921,kathleen_mcummins,,3050.074,3058.661,"He might have, he wish to avail himself of his habeas corpus remedy and that did not entail an admission by him of guilt."
1978.77-1202,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3058.661,3060.062,"Very well, Ms.Cummins."
1978.77-1202,2,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,3063.326,3068.23,"Mr. Chief Justice, I'd forego the remainder of my time, but I would like to say this sir."
1978.77-1202,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3083.44,3083.843,Thank you.
1978.77-1202,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3083.843,3088.574,Does the entire transcript over the habeas corpus herein had been done?
1978.77-1202,2,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,3088.574,3090.071,"No sir, its not in here."
1978.77-1202,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3090.071,3091.245,I mean is it available any place?
1978.77-1202,2,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,3091.245,3093.131,"Yes sir, I believe it is?"
1978.77-1202,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3093.131,3096.358,Is there anyway you can get it for us and file it with the clerk?
1978.77-1202,2,39108,robert_a_derengoski,,3096.358,3097.915,"Yes sir, we'll file it with the clerk."
1978.77-1202,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3097.915,3100.443,"Arrange this, have it sent to the clerk."
