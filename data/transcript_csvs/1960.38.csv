1960.38,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,19.834,"Number 38, New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Company, Petitioner, versus Mary L. Donnelly Henagan."
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,24.706,26.226,May it please the Court.
1960.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,238.764,240.72,"Before you go on, I just I want to get one thing clear."
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,250.178,261.247,"I think the testimony was that in making an odd -- well, he had slowed down to make the ordinary emergency -- non-emergency stop."
1960.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,261.247,261.841,At the station (Voice Overlap) --
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,261.841,265.501,"At that time, and it would have to take him about 500 or 600 feet as I recall."
1960.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,265.501,266.364,500 or 600 feet.
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,266.364,274.692,"500 or 600 feet, I think the testimony was that he would have taken to make the regular stop that he intended to take there."
1960.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,311.16,329.498,"Well, where is that (Inaudible)"
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,329.498,329.672,That --
1960.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,329.672,330.975,(Inaudible)
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,330.975,334.27,That is what I understand the plaintiff's theory is.
1960.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,334.853,339.883,What about (Inaudible)
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,339.883,340.12,I --
1960.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,340.12,341.798,(Inaudible)
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,341.798,344.119,I submit that there was no evidence.
1960.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,404.522,405.692,(Inaudible)
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,405.692,406.04,"Yes, sir."
1960.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,406.04,411.796,(Inaudible)
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,411.796,412.393,"Yes, sir."
1960.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,412.393,422.806,(Inaudible)
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,422.806,423.196,I think.
1960.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,425.032,433.219,"In other words, (Inaudible)"
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,433.219,435.607,That -- that was the testimony as I recall it.
1960.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,441.724,460.246,Was that -- is it your position that (Inaudible)
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,460.246,462.783,It -- it could.
1960.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,559.571,565.157,(Inaudible)
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,565.157,565.844,There -- there's --
1960.38,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,565.844,570.658,Even if the facts (Inaudible)
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,570.658,574.711,There's -- there's no evidence Your Honor that the train could have been stopped in that distance.
1960.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,574.711,582.308,I had understood the plaintiff's theory to be that an emergency stop would have been required even to stop the train in 180 feet.
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,582.308,582.546,But --
1960.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,582.546,595.8,"By means of an emergency stop, the suicide would not have been consummated and therefore, the plaintiff in this case would not have had the guilty delusion that she was guilty of the death of the -- the suicide."
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,595.8,605.653,"The theory of the Court of Appeals, I think was that an emergency stop could have been made sooner than it was that even though --"
1960.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,605.653,607.174,But still it would have been an emergency stop.
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,607.174,608.467,It still would have been an emergency stop.
1960.38,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,608.467,612.464,It would still have caused the -- whatever physical injury was done to the plaintiff.
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,612.464,614.707,And still it would have caused the physical injury.
1960.38,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1308.631,1315.722,"May I ask you please, did -- does the plaintiff -- the petitioner here relied -- the plaintiff here rely on res ipsa loquitur at all?"
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1315.722,1316.772,I don't think so Your Honor.
1960.38,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1317.126,1318.09,Specific negligence.
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1318.09,1319.962,"Specific negligence, yes sir."
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1334.803,1335.836,This --
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1335.836,1335.97,"Yes, sir."
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1335.97,1337.194,"I beg your pardon, no, go on."
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1337.194,1339.081,And that the burden still is on the plaintiff.
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1339.56,1343.168,I'm just going to ask whether you're going to leave yourself room to discuss the --
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1343.168,1343.364,I --
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1343.364,1345.44,-- judgment of the motion for new trial --
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1345.44,1345.562,I --
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1345.562,1348.671,-- and all that's involved in that particular clause.
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1348.671,1353.88,"I -- I think -- I think perhaps, I've got to proceed to that Your Honor."
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1480.052,1487.823,That would be the argument of course presupposes that although he -- it might not be a case for NOV.
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1490.812,1492.746,"That -- that's -- that's correct, Your Honor."
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1492.746,1495.529,Do you assume that or are you going to say anything about that?
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1495.529,1495.896,Well --
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1495.896,1497.689,-- in FELA cases.
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1497.689,1502.252,"In -- let -- let me -- let me say this, Your Honor."
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1644.595,1653.937,And you're arguing that the judgment brings up a motion for new trial or is that incidental part of the judgment.
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1653.937,1654.512,That's right.
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1659.081,1659.595,What --
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1659.595,1659.633,And --
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1659.633,1679.502,"Would you mind telling me -- would you mind explaining why two such experience, appellate judges or Judge Woofgrain and Judge Hartigan and called first the trial lawyers as Judge Aldrich who should've -- who rendered this decision at the motion for new trial required a separate appeal?"
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1679.502,1681.213,"I don't know, Your Honor, why -- why the --"
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1681.213,1682.933,You mean just that --
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1682.933,1683.168,Why -- why the --
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1683.168,1684.14,-- (Voice Overlap) puzzled.
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1685.0,1693.181,"It -- it was argued, I think to them by the plaintiff below at the time that it should've been a separate appeal."
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1711.174,1721.977,"But you're arguing here that although Judge Wyzanski might have been right in denying NOV, he should've entertained the motion for new trial as it -- that they weren't able to hide, isn't it?"
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1721.977,1722.536,That's right.
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1722.578,1723.445,"A different (Inaudible), is that it?"
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1723.445,1727.522,That is there were two separate motions even though combined in the same motion.
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1728.072,1732.301,"Now, what do you do with the case of Deen against Hickman in this Court, remember that case?"
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1732.301,1734.077,"I don't remember it, sir."
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1734.077,1737.144,"It's 358, a case coming up from Texas."
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1737.144,1737.853,I -- I don't remember that.
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1737.874,1743.666,"In other words, you say ordinarily, a motion for new trial is raisable."
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1756.915,1758.807,"Well, of course -- of course that -- that is true."
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1760.4,1762.193,Was that true enough in the FELA cases?
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1762.193,1783.605,"I -- I don't -- I don't -- I -- and I haven't -- didn't find that particular case, Your Honor, but of course, I think some of the District -- Circuit Court cases which I have cited in my brief indicate the same thing that there actual -- absolutely -- two absolutely different things. One, motion that judge passes on as a matter of law and the other one still has a discretion on a motion for new trial."
1960.38,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1815.826,1817.983,How could it have done so?
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1830.348,1831.258,From the judgment.
1960.38,0,15082,charles_e_whittaker,scotus_justice,1831.607,1838.917,We dismissed them in the Eight Circuit from the appeals of something but the judgment would -- it was wrong about that?
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1838.917,1854.277,That's exactly the position that I am taking that the -- that the -- in the appeal from -- from the judgment is the only appeal that pro -- properly could have been taken here because this action on the motion for new trial is encompassed within the judgment.
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1871.952,1880.537,"But -- but as you point out, the cases of the First Circuit where for one reason or another, the judgment is not appealable."
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1886.029,1887.409,As the final order in the case.
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1887.409,1888.046,Yes.
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1888.046,1888.55,And that is what --
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1888.55,1897.419,"So that on the generality is it -- or the generality of the rule as Justice Whittaker has indicated, it is what it is."
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1899.525,1899.943,That's right.
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1899.943,1902.541,So far as that's the way of doing just this.
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1902.541,1902.748,That's right.
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1902.748,1923.333,"What I want to know is whether the rule, whether in FELA case, you are contending as you must that although there's enough to make the judge put the case to the jury and if there's enough to let it go to the jury, he can't take the verdict away from the jury, he may take the verdict away on a motion for a new trial."
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1923.333,1938.687,"I -- I submit Your Honor that that's exactly what he could do, that is supposing, he had taken the position that he did as a matter of law, I have no authority to allow the motion NOV, yet I feel that there's been a miscarriage of justice in this case."
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1938.687,1945.25,Although -- although there was enough to go to the jury and the jury was entitled according to Rogers to give a verdict for the plaintiff.
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1945.25,1945.774,"Yes, I -- I --"
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1945.774,1949.239,"You mean nevertheless, take away to the verdict on a motion for a new trial."
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1949.693,1951.676,I -- I submit that that is so Your Honor.
1960.38,0,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1951.676,1954.311,"Well, I'm sorry you didn't look at Deen against Hickman."
1960.38,0,37070,noel_w_deering,,1954.311,1957.353,"I'm sorry too, sir."
1960.38,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1957.353,1959.762,Mr. Kelleher.
1960.38,1,31334,james_w_kelleher,,1959.762,1964.273,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2392.874,2400.667,(Inaudible)
1960.38,1,31334,james_w_kelleher,,2400.667,2402.558,The witness proves --
1960.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2402.558,2404.005,What -- what.
1960.38,1,31334,james_w_kelleher,,2404.005,2404.448,The witness proves it --
1960.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2404.448,2408.856,Mrs. Montell (Inaudible)
1960.38,1,31334,james_w_kelleher,,2408.856,2409.619,Yes.
1960.38,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2409.619,2411.805,(Inaudible)
1960.38,1,31334,james_w_kelleher,,2411.805,2415.838,"He says immediately before the train arrived, as the train was coming in."
