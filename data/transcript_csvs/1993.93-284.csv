1993.93-284,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.597,"We'll hear argument now in Number 93-284, Security Services, Inc. v. The K Mart Corporation."
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,10.588,13.34,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-284,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,46.462,54.89,"Well, it was never enforced during the time that the actual carrier had it, whatever its validity."
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,54.89,57.34,"--I don't agree, Mr. Chief Justice, that it wasn't enforced."
1993.93-284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,100.749,117.431,"But both the mileage guide itself and the commission regulations, as I understand it, advised whoever was going to check the tariff not to look to that mileage guide after a certain date, namely, the date when you were no longer listed as one of the people supporting that mileage guide."
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,117.431,118.569,"Well, Justice Scalia--"
1993.93-284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,118.569,120.76,Would that not confuse the public at least?
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,125.195,129.238,"--No, I don't believe the public would be confused, for several reasons, if I might elaborate."
1993.93-284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,140.984,143.628,"Well, you don't have to call it a voiding power."
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,157.175,162.018,"Your Honor, what the public reads is a tariff, and the tariff discloses the rate."
1993.93-284,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,173.445,178.379,"Well, if the shipper had read the guide and seen the asterisk, then he would have known that the rate should not be enforced--"
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,178.379,180.461,I don't believe that's correct.
1993.93-284,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,200.533,209.729,"--Well, this wasn't a defect in a calculation, it was a failure of a condition that must continue for the rate to be valid, and that condition failed."
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,209.729,212.14,"--I don't agree that the rate's not valid, Justice Kennedy."
1993.93-284,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,234.285,237.909,"If that's so, why is it so complicated to have all these distances that you have to have a bureau do it?"
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,237.909,240.089,I don't think that you have to have a bureau do it.
1993.93-284,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,248.805,257.271,"Is it in fact true that it's very obvious... to Washington to Baltimore, that it's very obvious there's one and only one shortest practical route?"
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,257.271,257.992,--That's true.
1993.93-284,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,259.011,261.404,Have you traveled it often?
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,261.404,264.787,I have traveled it on several occasions.
1993.93-284,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,269.438,276.294,"You don't take the position that there was something unreasonable beyond the statutory power on the ICC to require the filing of the mileage guide, do you?"
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,276.294,276.644,--No.
1993.93-284,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,277.574,285.678,Don't we then have to take tariff as meaning what the ICC has construed it to mean to require both the mileage rate and the mileage distance specification?
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,285.678,297.428,"--No, Justice Souter, you take the tariff as to what it discloses, and this tariff disclosed the rate dependent upon mileage, the charge, the derivative charge, and that said we're going to use these mileages."
1993.93-284,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,297.428,304.031,"You had one guide, and there were other guides that gave different distances between the same two points, were there not?"
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,312.275,312.666,No.
1993.93-284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,324.964,338.294,"Well, now, what if somebody else who read the ICC's rules said, I'm going to use this mileage guide to start off with, but after a certain date I'm going to withdraw from it, after which that will not govern me."
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,339.694,341.945,"Sure, absolutely they could."
1993.93-284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,341.945,342.256,Sure.
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,346.31,348.02,"Because, Justice Scalia--"
1993.93-284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,348.02,351.251,--who wants to continue to have the mileage guide applicable?
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,351.251,353.642,--Because the public would know from the rate tariff.
1993.93-284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,372.225,384.864,"And this is the mileage, but the reader might think well, of course, they are doing that on the assumption that they are following the ICC's rules, which means they only mean it for so long as they continue to subscribe to the mileage guide."
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,384.864,394.08,"Well, Justice Scalia, the fact is that during this time period, the ICC rules, the ICC had issued a rule in 1984 when it amended the tariff publishing regulations."
1993.93-284,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,444.444,450.277,How much were the dues involved that weren't paid that led to Riss not being a party to the--
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,450.277,459.514,"The dues I believe, Justice Ginsburg... and I'm only going from my personal knowledge and not from the record... were about $83 during this time period."
1993.93-284,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,459.514,473.422,"--Is there anything that accounts for how widespread this failure to continue to be members of the guide were, because I think one figure in the record was that between the years 1984 and 1988, 40 percent of the common carriers weren't paying their dues."
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,473.422,474.734,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.93-284,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,495.845,499.008,Was this because everybody was really making deals outside the tariff?
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,499.008,500.45,"--No, I don't believe so."
1993.93-284,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,532.841,546.229,"You didn't at the time Riss... the prebankruptcy Riss didn't have a whole lot of interest in adherence to this tariff, because in fact you were making deals for a price lower than the tariff."
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,546.229,548.921,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, I don't agree with that."
1993.93-284,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,601.784,618.597,"I understand what your argument is now in collecting from customers who paid less, but suppose there had been no bankruptcy, could Riss have gone after the people that it gave discount rates to, or would there have been some kind of estoppel working prebankruptcy?"
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,618.597,620.248,"I'm not sure I understand the question, Your Honor."
1993.93-284,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,620.248,628.913,All of these cases seeking more from customers who were given discounted rates come up in the context of a bankruptcy?
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,654.26,655.399,"No, I don't believe so."
1993.93-284,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,679.596,686.902,"And you say in addition, to answer Justice Ginsburg's... that Riss could have brought this action had no bankruptcy supervened?"
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,686.902,691.644,"--Not only could they have, they should have, and were required to by the act to bring that action."
1993.93-284,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,693.375,696.527,How do you explain the fact that no solvent carriers ever brought any of these actions?
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,696.527,702.271,--Solvent carriers bring these types of actions not as frequently as bankrupt carriers.
1993.93-284,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,702.271,702.942,Do they bring any of them?
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,706.244,707.766,Recently?
1993.93-284,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,707.766,708.255,Yes.
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,708.255,714.989,"Solvent carriers... yes, I have several carriers who I represent who have brought actions for undercharges."
1993.93-284,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,722.643,723.394,These are nonpaying shippers.
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,723.394,724.696,"--Yes, in that setting."
1993.93-284,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,724.696,728.539,Are there any undercharged suits that you know of brought by solvent carriers?
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,728.539,730.16,Not that I'm aware... not recently.
1993.93-284,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,774.078,774.609,Can I ask another question--
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,774.609,775.169,"Yes, Justice--"
1993.93-284,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,775.169,775.808,--about this general category?
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,782.333,783.585,--Not in recent years.
1993.93-284,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,786.176,791.219,"That's surprising, if there's this strong public interest supporting the full enforcement of the tariff rate."
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,791.219,794.861,"--Well, the fact is that the Interstate Commerce Commission does not reach the issue of reasonableness any more."
1993.93-284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,820.72,831.046,"Mr. Taylor, I assumed... well, under one of the regs of the Commerce Commission you can file a rate that has an expiration date on it, can't you?"
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,831.046,831.897,Yes.
1993.93-284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,831.897,834.338,And what happens to that rate when the expiration date comes?
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,836.339,837.1,It goes away.
1993.93-284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,837.1,840.522,"Now, why isn't this simply the same thing?"
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,871.261,886.812,"But in this case, Justice Scalia, the Riss 501-B tariff continued to be on the shelf, continued to be charged to people other than K Mart, and it was there for the public to view to see and to challenge if they wanted to."
1993.93-284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,886.812,897.718,"Yes, but the ICC had in effect said Riss' tariff shall be deemed to expire when Riss' membership expires."
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,901.101,904.474,"No, the rule is authorized."
1993.93-284,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,946.631,949.444,How is determination shown?
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,968.527,989.759,"Well, it's affected through what's called a participating carrier's tariff, so what you have to do is, you have to start with the Riss tariff, which says it's governed by the mileage guide and only by the mileage guide, and then you go from the mileage guide, which says this only applies for people listed in tariff 107, so you make a two-step removal from Riss' tariff to see who's listed."
1993.93-284,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1005.59,1012.084,"But that would be in a different booklet than the mileage guide itself, the list of people who haven't paid up?"
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,1012.084,1014.516,"Yes, that's exactly correct."
1993.93-284,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1161.24,1173.8,"Now, when you say, retroactive, this was not retroactive so that it voided the tariff before the date of the supplement to the rating bureau."
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,1173.8,1175.209,"That's correct, Justice Kennedy."
1993.93-284,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1175.209,1181.324,So it's not... it's retroactive only in the conclusory sense that you say that the rating bureau publication is irrelevant.
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,1181.324,1183.106,That's correct.
1993.93-284,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1229.516,1235.239,"Well, Mr. Taylor, what happens in the case of a rate which has passed its expiration date?"
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,1242.235,1243.073,--There is no right.
1993.93-284,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1249.047,1253.441,"So in that case, the shipper and the carrier could negotiate their own deal, so to speak?"
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,1253.441,1253.862,No.
1993.93-284,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1256.003,1264.339,"Well, now, you've said no rate applies, so wouldn't the only alternative be for the carrier and the shipper to negotiate their own deal?"
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,1264.339,1282.971,"--Mr. Chief Justice, in the case where there is no otherwise applicable rate, there would be no tariff and the carrier would be subject to whatever civil penalty... the civil penalties under the act, because the act does require you to maintain rates in other cases."
1993.93-284,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1282.971,1291.487,"But by hypothesis, you haven't maintained rates, and you've made a deal with the shipper to ship at a particular price."
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,1296.051,1301.203,"The carrier can always charge, and must always charge his tariff rate."
1993.93-284,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1301.203,1303.004,But by hypothesis we have no--
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,1303.004,1320.115,"If you had no tariff rate at all, in any tariff, not just the 501-B tariff, but if there was no other tariff applicable that might be higher or lower, now at that point you would... I assume you would have an illegal contract and nobody would be entitled to any compensation."
1993.93-284,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1320.115,1323.007,"--So that the carrier would be carrying for nothing, in effect."
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,1323.007,1323.858,"I agree, yes."
1993.93-284,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1323.858,1327.64,It seems a remarkably harsh result.
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,1327.64,1328.03,I--
1993.93-284,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1328.03,1332.442,I'm sure that is not how it works out.
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,1334.085,1334.853,--No.
1993.93-284,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1367.926,1371.158,The carrier is acting unlawfully if it has no filed rate.
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,1371.158,1373.138,"--That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1993.93-284,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1373.138,1375.712,"What are the penalties, apart from what the shipper would owe?"
1993.93-284,0,38391,paul_o_taylor,,1379.774,1382.325,"Well, there are certain civil forfei ure penalties."
1993.93-284,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1453.171,1454.523,"Very well, Mr. Taylor."
1993.93-284,1,43747,william_j_augello,,1458.196,1460.287,"It is, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.93-284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1565.007,1571.16,"Isn't it... I suppose, as your opposing counsel said, a separate publication?"
1993.93-284,1,43747,william_j_augello,,1584.568,1585.249,That's correct.
1993.93-284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1586.73,1595.856,"So you pick up the... if you just pick up the rate, you can pick up the mileage book and stop there, then you don't know that Riss is no longer paying its $83 a year."
1993.93-284,1,43747,william_j_augello,,1595.856,1618.992,"But the point is that it really is irrelevant whether you pick up the tariff or not, because carriers and shippers alike are charged with constructive notice of every duly filed tariff, and that I think is the problem that we ran into in the Overland case when the Court did not duly apply that principle."
1993.93-284,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1628.637,1655.685,"Mr. Augello, Mr. Taylor has told us that by 1985, when this tariff as you put it no longer governed because the company no longer participated in it, by that time, the Commission by decision had eliminated the requirement that you be a participant."
1993.93-284,1,43747,william_j_augello,,1655.685,1658.296,That is incorrect.
1993.93-284,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1658.296,1659.428,Is that incorrect?
1993.93-284,1,43747,william_j_augello,,1659.428,1659.959,It is.
1993.93-284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1755.961,1767.959,"Assuming someone would get that book and look at it, but there is no question that the word, ""participate"" means nothing more than pay your annual dues to belong to this--"
1993.93-284,1,43747,william_j_augello,,1767.959,1769.63,"--No, Your Honor."
1993.93-284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1783.88,1786.641,--I'm just asking what participate means.
1993.93-284,1,43747,william_j_augello,,1786.641,1786.932,Means?
1993.93-284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1790.593,1795.748,And one gets listed by filing the power of attorney and paying annual fees?
1993.93-284,1,43747,william_j_augello,,1795.748,1796.447,Precisely.
1993.93-284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1796.447,1798.309,There's nothing else beyond that.
1993.93-284,1,43747,william_j_augello,,1801.242,1801.632,No.
1993.93-284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1802.681,1804.333,--Subscribe and pay your annual fee.
1993.93-284,1,43747,william_j_augello,,1804.333,1805.373,That's correct.
1993.93-284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1805.373,1815.62,"Do you know why it is that the discontinuance was so widespread, so many carriers stopped paying their annual fees?"
1993.93-284,1,43747,william_j_augello,,1815.62,1816.0,Yes.
1993.93-284,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1881.673,1883.115,What percentage was that?
1993.93-284,1,43747,william_j_augello,,1883.115,1898.573,"Well, there's prob... I think there are 12,800 carriers listed in the Household Goods... that's the figure that I recall from the Commission's brief in the Overland case, so 111 carriers."
1993.93-284,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1964.708,1983.49,"If we can go back to my question, I think your answer was that the percentage was in fact a lot lower, but 111 is still a significant number dealing with a rule of the Commission that says one must have a filed rate, and to have this rate complete we need two parts, the rate and the distance."
1993.93-284,1,43747,william_j_augello,,1994.367,2009.758,"--Beginning in 1980, Congress decided to open the doors up to trucking, and the Commission's certificates, authorized carriers, suddenly jumped from about 15,000 to 35,000."
1993.93-284,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2031.743,2036.665,"Well, it's the same reason Mr. Taylor's client didn't charge the tariffed rate."
1993.93-284,1,43747,william_j_augello,,2038.167,2038.508,Exactly.
1993.93-284,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2038.508,2039.927,Who cares about tariffs?
1993.93-284,1,43747,william_j_augello,,2039.927,2040.448,Exactly.
1993.93-284,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2040.448,2042.07,The ICC's not enforcing them any more.
1993.93-284,1,43747,william_j_augello,,2048.043,2066.126,"That's right, but the shippers who were in good faith negotiating these rates with carriers, believing that the carrier was in full compliance with his tariffs, are now being saddled with these billions of dollars of undercharges."
1993.93-284,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2066.126,2086.61,"Apropos of a comment you made a moment ago, Mr. Augello, in your view, would it be permissible, or have been, for a carrier to file a mileage guide that said the distance from New York to Chicago is 300 miles so long as he did that with every single shipper?"
1993.93-284,1,43747,william_j_augello,,2086.61,2087.291,Yes.
1993.93-284,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2099.987,2102.548,And it doesn't matter how unrealistic the mileage is?
1993.93-284,1,43747,william_j_augello,,2102.548,2106.121,"I... I don't... no, I don't say that."
1993.93-284,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2108.352,2109.394,My question was--
1993.93-284,1,43747,william_j_augello,,2109.394,2110.155,How close?
1993.93-284,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2110.155,2113.968,"--300 miles from New York to Chicago, which, you know, is very optimistic."
1993.93-284,1,43747,william_j_augello,,2115.097,2128.458,"I wouldn't expect anyone would do that, but, you know, from a hypothetical standpoint I suppose if a competitor found him doing that he'd have a right to file a complaint, and--"
1993.93-284,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2128.458,2136.666,"I don't see why he couldn't file a tariff that says I'm only charged for the first 300 miles of the carriage, as sort of a... if he does it to everybody in a nondiscriminatory--"
1993.93-284,1,43747,william_j_augello,,2136.666,2137.544,--As long as there's no discrimination.
1993.93-284,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2137.544,2143.888,"--He just in effect says, everybody knows it's farther, but this is a... you know, it's like all sorts of discount deals that you run into."
1993.93-284,1,43747,william_j_augello,,2147.441,2162.351,"That's a novel one, but... I suppose they could also say, you get a reduced rate if your freight travels over Saturday night, like the airlines."
1993.93-284,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2165.654,2168.305,"It might save him a lot to truck in Findlay, Ohio, too, I suppose."
1993.93-284,1,43747,william_j_augello,,2168.305,2171.587,And both components must be published in a tariff.
1993.93-284,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2229.064,2232.747,It works in the bankrupt carrier's interest.
1993.93-284,1,43747,william_j_augello,,2237.471,2241.142,"Yes, it does, because they're trying to collect the undercharges."
1993.93-284,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2252.919,2259.855,"Oh, I see, it means the absence of the... the filed rate doctrine is what... the filed rate is what the carrier is trying to enforce."
1993.93-284,1,43747,william_j_augello,,2259.855,2266.83,"--Yes, even though that filed rate was not honored by him originally."
1993.93-284,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2290.696,2297.779,"You're saying he wants to have an advantage from not having turned one square corner, but not the disadvantage of not having turned the other."
1993.93-284,1,43747,william_j_augello,,2308.525,2311.668,"But I... thank you, Your Honor."
1993.93-284,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2311.668,2312.619,"Thank you, Mr. Augello."
1993.93-284,2,31702,john_f_manning,,2314.72,2322.136,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1993.93-284,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2355.789,2358.4,"What's the reason for that nonparticipation rule, Mr. Manning?"
1993.93-284,2,31702,john_f_manning,,2366.959,2378.695,"Well, as the ICC indicated in its Wonderoast decision, which is cited in our brief and which appears in 8 I.C.C. 2nd, that doctrine is an interpretation of the statutory requirement that appears in two sections."
1993.93-284,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2634.671,2635.432,Mr. Manning--
1993.93-284,2,31702,john_f_manning,,2635.432,2636.401,--I'm sorry.
1993.93-284,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2636.401,2645.218,"--the last sentence of 1312.4 on page 3a of the appendix of your brief says,"
1993.93-284,2,31702,john_f_manning,,2655.086,2695.464,"Well, that refers to... I think that that sentence refers to the kind of proceeding that Mr. Augello described in which HGB might come in and say, there are 111 carriers who refer to our mileage guide, but they haven't maintained their powers of attorney, they haven't paid their participation fees, and what the Commission has done in those cases, and there are two recent cases that involve this, both of which are cited in Mr. Augello's brief, what the Commission will do is, it will issue an order to the carriers either to reinstate their participation in the Mileage Guide tariff, or to cancel any reference to that participation."
1993.93-284,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2695.464,2698.225,But the sentence says carriers shall submit the necessary proof.
1993.93-284,2,31702,john_f_manning,,2704.46,2712.287,"No, no, I think that means that if someone challenges the tariff on the ground that a carrier has not--"
1993.93-284,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2712.287,2712.537,I see.
1993.93-284,2,31702,john_f_manning,,2712.537,2715.379,"--maintained, then the carrier has to show that it has participated."
1993.93-284,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2715.379,2715.709,Okay.
1993.93-284,2,31702,john_f_manning,,2715.709,2718.02,"And that raises an important point, which--"
1993.93-284,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2718.02,2726.234,"Mr. Manning, the Chief Justice's question brings up something that has... seems to me to underlie this whole matter."
1993.93-284,2,31702,john_f_manning,,2773.306,2792.089,"--Well, the ICC does believe that the filed rate and the filed rate doctrine are central to the whole scheme of regulating the transportation industry, and the ICC does... has in recent years taken an aggressive stance in enforcing the requirement of participations."
1993.93-284,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2849.305,2856.43,This is really a new belief in the centrality of filed rates by the Commission after our last few decisions.
1993.93-284,2,31702,john_f_manning,,2862.604,2885.128,"Well, I think... I mean, I think that a lot of the problems that have arisen in this case and that are percolating up through the system do come from the era prior to Maislin in which the Commission was taking a less aggressive stance about the centrality of the filed rate and had a more tolerant view of negotiated rates."
1993.93-284,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2885.128,2893.285,"But you're saying now, at least, post Maislin, the Commission is proceeding logically and consistently."
1993.93-284,2,31702,john_f_manning,,2893.285,2897.267,"Post Maislin the Commission is enforcing this requirement, yes, it is."
1993.93-284,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2902.151,2903.601,"Well, may I ask why--"
1993.93-284,2,31702,john_f_manning,,2903.601,2904.392,"Oh, of course."
1993.93-284,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2904.392,2922.294,"--in this very situation the Commission didn't say, if it is indeed saying the filed rate is it, didn't say, when such... when we detect such a thing, then we require the carrier to join, pay all the back dues, and slap a penalty on them."
1993.93-284,2,31702,john_f_manning,,2933.241,2937.722,"Well, that might be... that might be an appropriate exercise of the Commission's remedial discretion."
1993.93-284,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2952.713,2961.069,"Yes, but you are supporting the result that says, you missed your $83 so all bets are off and the privately negotiated rate is what sticks."
1993.93-284,2,31702,john_f_manning,,2961.069,2962.099,That is correct.
1993.93-284,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2979.009,2984.194,"Well, of course, I suppose it was much too late to give a remedy looking to the future, because the carrier was bankrupt, or out of business."
1993.93-284,2,31702,john_f_manning,,2984.194,2985.864,"Well, that's true, the carrier is not providing any--"
1993.93-284,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2985.864,2987.006,--do something that enabled them--
1993.93-284,2,31702,john_f_manning,,2987.006,2988.767,--The carrier is not providing any additional services.
1993.93-284,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2988.767,2993.481,--This is looking at a situation when that... it's much too late to order that particularly.
1993.93-284,2,31702,john_f_manning,,3004.267,3010.031,"Well, that's the only number that is... that the Commission has encountered in any official way."
1993.93-284,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3011.86,3014.484,So this is really kind of a fly speck in the whole picture.
1993.93-284,2,31702,john_f_manning,,3014.484,3031.004,"--Well, if... I mean, based on the number of violations that have been brought to the Commission's attention by HGB, which has every incentive to police the nonpayment of dues by those who refer to is mileage guide, I would think that the problem is not particularly significant as a percentage of the total participants."
1993.93-284,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3034.397,3036.078,Were you going to attempt to address the retroactivity?
1993.93-284,2,31702,john_f_manning,,3036.078,3037.58,"--Oh, I'd be happy to."
1993.93-284,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3108.556,3109.906,May I ask one other question?
1993.93-284,2,31702,john_f_manning,,3109.906,3110.507,Yes.
1993.93-284,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3110.507,3117.602,"We were directed to the attention of page 35 of the Joint Appendix, and treating that as though it were a third document as part of all the tariffs."
1993.93-284,2,31702,john_f_manning,,3130.86,3131.271,"Oh, yes."
1993.93-284,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3170.447,3171.597,"Thank you, Mr. Manning."
1993.93-284,3,38391,paul_o_taylor,,3173.58,3174.818,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1993.93-284,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3205.829,3209.932,"Well, the Government... it only comes about effectively when notice is given to the public."
1993.93-284,3,38391,paul_o_taylor,,3209.932,3213.543,"--Well, that is not, however, what the regulation says."
1993.93-284,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3214.164,3215.974,Is that the way it works in practice?
1993.93-284,3,38391,paul_o_taylor,,3226.272,3231.205,"--Justice Souter, you can't possibly know, because the powers of attorney are never filed."
1993.93-284,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3258.734,3265.028,Do you agree or disagree that the publication of the Household Goods 100 is a tariff?
1993.93-284,3,38391,paul_o_taylor,,3265.028,3265.967,--It is a tariff.
1993.93-284,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3328.238,3329.009,"Well, wait... wait."
1993.93-284,3,38391,paul_o_taylor,,3333.832,3334.854,That continues on.
1993.93-284,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3336.045,3337.494,"230 out of 12,000."
1993.93-284,3,38391,paul_o_taylor,,3337.494,3341.478,"Yes, even though they did not... that's 230, Justice Stevens in a 2-month period."
1993.93-284,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3351.445,3355.046,All of the relevant events in this case come up pre-Maislin.
1993.93-284,3,38391,paul_o_taylor,,3355.046,3355.717,--Yes.
1993.93-284,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3426.503,3427.753,"Thank you, Mr. Taylor."
