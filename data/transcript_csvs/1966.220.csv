1966.220,0,38229,paul_a_porter,,14.156,14.95,Mr. Porter for petitioner.
1966.220,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,14.95,15.734,Mr. Porter.
1966.220,0,38229,paul_a_porter,,15.734,18.714,And Mr. Lyons.
1966.220,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,38.832,39.398,Very well.
1966.220,0,38229,paul_a_porter,,39.398,65.444,This case is here on certiorari from the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to review the holding of the District Court that without jurisdiction by reason of the Norris-La Guardia Act to issue an injunction against the picketing which suddenly surrounded of the Jacksonville terminal and effectively prevented all rail access through those facilities.
1966.220,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,1227.388,1228.51,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.
1966.220,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1320.915,1325.146,"See Mr. Lyons, we were dealing in Cargo River with minor disputes."
1966.220,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,1325.146,1326.277,With the minor disputes.
1966.220,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1326.277,1331.898,For which Congress had provided a terminal procedure in effect in arbitration.
1966.220,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,1331.898,1332.567,Right.
1966.220,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1332.567,1334.344,"You don't have that here, do you?"
1966.220,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,1334.344,1344.134,"Here, we have as between the Florida East Coast and its Brotherhoods, there have been certain procedures."
1966.220,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1449.868,1458.298,Did the pickets represent that they're signs or otherwise what dispute it was the location of their picket?
1966.220,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,1458.298,1464.019,Their signs represented a referred to the major dispute with the FEC.
1966.220,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1556.391,1563.225,"That's the answer to your suggestion that the union could've filed another under Section 6, isn't it?"
1966.220,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,1568.351,1572.907,"Well, we contend that there is a controversy of a commercial nature."
1966.220,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1593.523,1596.458,That dispute is with the Florida East Coast.
1966.220,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,1596.458,1598.899,They have a dispute with the Florida East Coast.
1966.220,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1598.899,1600.526,They have none with your client?
1966.220,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,1600.526,1603.464,They apparently have a controversy with our clients.
1966.220,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1616.617,1627.321,But it's not a -- but I think you said that your clients themselves would respond in case of notices filed under Section 6 that this was not a dispute within the meaning of that section.
1966.220,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,1627.321,1633.747,I think we have first take that position whether our position is right as a matter that would have to be decided.
1966.220,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1692.261,1704.318,"Mr. Lyons, would your position that such a situation would not constitute a labor dispute be consistent with what you're arguing to us today?"
1966.220,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,1704.318,1728.458,"For that situation, our basic position Your Honor is that there is not a labor dispute between the coastline and the seaboard and the terminal company on the one hand and the unions on the other that there is a commercial controversy and that the unions desire the railroad to embargo the FEC."
1966.220,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1749.423,1752.623,But they're not going to you because they -- their position is identically to yours.
1966.220,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,1757.141,1761.133,"Well, in that light of that Your Honor, if that's -- if that remains their position then they --"
1966.220,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1761.133,1768.385,Perhaps I didn't understand their position but I didn't think that they had or that they claim to have any labor dispute with your carriers.
1966.220,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,1768.385,1777.856,Those circumstances would be the -- the only circumstances under which the actual processes of the Railway Labor Act could be followed here.
1966.220,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1798.348,1814.822,"I've been wondering why you're bear away from Justice Stewart's question as to whether you have any dispute with the unions, these other companies, why do you have to bear away from that?"
1966.220,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,1814.822,1818.364,"Well, our position on that is this Your Honor."
1966.220,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1860.482,1867.255,Is that kind of a controversy contemplated under the Railway Labor Act?
1966.220,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,1867.255,1880.668,I believe that Congress in passing the Railway Labor Act in short never -- never dreamed that unions would resort to a tactic of the sort involved here.
1966.220,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1880.668,1898.766,"Well, in essence what you're saying is that Mr. Lyons that neither the Railway Labor Act nor the Norris-LaGuardia Act deals with this dispute that this is not a labor dispute under either act but a commercial dispute and in consequence equity is free to deal with it as you as have to do it."
1966.220,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,1898.766,1912.084,That's essentially our position Your Honor and the reason for that is that the Court has to take the two we suggest to take a two statutes together and give them a harmonizing reading between --
1966.220,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1912.084,1916.155,"So, it's a non-presented situation --"
1966.220,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,1916.155,1920.228,I don't believe in just to try to do this before.
1966.220,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1920.228,1937.642,"I mean the fact is that historically there's been industry-wide bargaining and an industry-wide settlements or at least regional in a railroad industry and there was against that background that this legislature was enacted and that Congress obviously didn't foresee the possibility of this Congress situation arising, wouldn't you agree with that?"
1966.220,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,1937.642,1950.731,"Well, besides I think if we go back in to history there probably before the adjustment boards were setup and certainly before the ‘34 Act where the procedures of the adjustment board were made mandatory."
1966.220,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1954.6,1957.376,But not over -- not rates of pay and wages and working conditions.
1966.220,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,1957.376,1958.983,I think those are generally been on more --
1966.220,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1958.983,1959.74,And that's what we are talking about here.
1966.220,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,1959.74,1960.913,-- a broader basis.
1966.220,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1960.913,1966.055,Of grievances was on a property of an individual carrier but I'm talking about major industry.
1966.220,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,1966.055,1966.771,"Well, there's never been --"
1966.220,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1966.771,1969.216,An industry-wide bargaining and industry-wide settlements --
1966.220,1,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,1969.216,1984.696,I don't know of any case and which either on grievance in the 334 era where there was an attempt to impose the secondary boycott of this sort in order to put pressure on the carrier that have grievance.
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,2829.102,2832.056,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2883.986,2887.706,"What legality point, is that the constitutional?"
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,2887.706,2895.463,It's constitutional and the Clayton Act and Norris-LaGuardia statutory both.
1966.220,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2940.423,2961.439,"Well, except -- wouldn't you -- am I entirely wrong in thinking that this as a factual matter is rather unprecedented in the railroad industry because isn't it -- am I not correct in thinking that railroad labor disputes are generally settled on an industry-wide phases and that was true at the time this legislation was passed, National Labor Act."
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,2961.439,2971.221,"Your Honor, I'm -- my information is to the contrary as I understand the pattern of industry-wide bargaining in the railroad industry did not develop until the 1930's."
1966.220,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2987.359,2988.48,"No, Regional."
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,2988.48,3002.932,"But there is regional bargaining and that is a pattern that has developed but subsequent the passage of the Railway Labor Act in 1926, the Norris-LaGuardia Act in 1932 and the amendments to the Railway Labor Act in 1934."
1966.220,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3154.176,3159.293,Of course you're talking now about your dispute with somebody is not a party to this lawsuit.
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,3159.293,3170.011,We're talking about our dispute with the FEC and we say that this case is clearly and undeniably arises out of that major dispute.
1966.220,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3403.664,3412.156,"Well, doesn't that -- isn't that true all of the country in compass places, every time there's an interchange of east coast car they're doing business with another carrier?"
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,3412.156,3413.439,That's true Your Honor.
1966.220,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3449.717,3451.166,"Well, you're talking about that place."
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,3474.907,3475.98,That -- that's correct.
1966.220,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3479.529,3481.319,In yards the terminal and --
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,3481.319,3483.043,Many other connecting points.
1966.220,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3494.413,3496.597,That's perhaps there's more that goes on it.
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,3496.597,3496.898,Yes.
1966.220,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3496.898,3499.228,"But -- but that's not the place, there are many places."
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,3499.228,3500.081,That's correct.
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3510.015,3512.632,"Well, for example could Chicago be one of those places?"
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,3512.632,3513.364,"No, Your Honor."
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3513.364,3514.12,Did not?
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,3514.12,3526.733,"You see the distinction, the argument has been made, District Court, Court of Appeal and here this morning that our theory is that we can picket anywhere in FEC cars."
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3556.279,3566.564,And what you're really saying as I gather is that in -- and then NLRA language in the way that (Voice Overlap) says that for this is primary picketing.
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,3566.564,3567.363,Precisely Your Honor.
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3567.363,3568.016,Right across the board --
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,3568.016,3568.443,Precisely.
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3568.443,3578.848,"-- those secondary activity whatsoever and that was in, if these were subject for the NLRA this would be ruled primary picketing -- subject to injunction of your or damages under (Inaudible)."
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,3578.848,3586.941,And this is exactly what the petitioner has told the Court of Appeals in their brief at page 21 to the Court of Appeals.
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3669.721,3680.998,"Mr. Rutledge, we now know where that FEC gate is, how many employees on the FEC payroll, does the record indicate work in terminal?"
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,3680.998,3688.871,"Your Honor, I'm not sure that -- the record does not indicate that.The FEC --"
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3688.871,3691.167,"Well, it must indicate that there are some FEC employees."
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,3691.167,3698.582,"The -- the record indicates only this, that the manager of the terminal company in three years never saw anybody used that gate."
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3707.88,3724.676,"Well, I thought you just told Justice White that the distinction you draw between Chicago situation in this is that FEC operates with its own personnel a number of the activity within the terminal then surely then the record just tell us what the number -- who the FEC personnel on it."
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,3724.676,3727.003,"Your Honor, perhaps I wasn't clear."
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3736.395,3737.489,You mean they're just a train crew?
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,3737.489,3738.389,On train.
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3740.67,3742.608,And is that all FEC has working in the train?
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,3742.608,3743.301,No.
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3781.497,3786.638,"Well, does the record show the FEC has an office or any kind in the terminal?"
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,3786.638,3805.229,"The record shows that the -- that under the contract that the FEC has with the terminal company and other railroads, the FEC has a right to use in common with all the other railroads every facility and every office and every part of the terminal company."
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3821.849,3828.624,"How about switching is there anything in the record -- switching equipment, is there anything in the record about FEC switching equipment in the terminal?"
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,3828.624,3829.099,Yes.
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3855.387,3862.89,"Well, do a lot of -- I take it a lot of passenger movements originate here for the FEC."
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,3862.89,3864.433,Not a great volume now.
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3865.76,3867.733,And -- and then terminate?
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,3867.733,3868.452,And terminate.
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3868.452,3869.686,"Now, how about trade?"
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,3869.686,3877.249,"Now, the trade business here is the largest aspect to the FEC business here."
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3886.026,3889.352,But by -- not by FEC employees I gather.
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,3889.352,3890.105,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3890.508,3892.27,"Well, now, that's what I'm trying to get at here."
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,3892.27,3896.084,Let me see if I can get that.
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3918.744,3922.417,"In the acts to interchange is done by those on the train who came into that area, is that it?"
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,3922.417,3926.069,And the FEC crews go on in there and they make interchange --
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3926.069,3926.474,I get it.
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,3926.474,3927.166,-- in that point.
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3962.258,3992.803,"Well, if in the ordinary labor dispute under the NLRA if I -- the unions got a dispute with the manufacturer, it's picketing the manufacture its gate and the manufacture is operating with replacements and producing goods and the goods come out at gate and they go down to street to a customer, to a processor and there's a sale transaction and you deliver to that processor."
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4007.144,4007.799,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4007.799,4015.112,And then how about going around to the other gate of the processor where the processor's employees come from?
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4015.112,4015.893,"Your Honor, they may --"
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4015.893,4017.809,"And you're on a little bit of trouble, aren't you?"
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4017.809,4023.884,"They may do that also. First of all, they may do that very differently in the garment industry."
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4027.382,4029.543,"Well, we're not talking about the garment industry."
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4029.543,4030.099,No.
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4041.477,4048.368,"So, the rules that you make about secondary or primary what the line between primary and secondary is may well depend on the industries."
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4048.368,4048.893,Exactly.
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4048.893,4055.279,And it may well depend on a particular practical aspect of either company relationship.
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4055.279,4056.626,"Very -- very definitely, Your Honor."
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4056.626,4058.558,That's exactly what this argument about.
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4058.558,4060.333,That's exactly what this argument is about.
1966.220,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4061.452,4067.437,If you can run it from the statute not upon -- it depends on a derivatively upon the industry.
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4070.77,4072.675,There's a particularized statute for the garment industry --
1966.220,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4072.675,4080.204,"In response to the particular peculiarized need to that industry but it's the statute, it's not any court-made exception."
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4080.204,4088.753,"Well, the statute makes an exception from the laws that existed before and then the garment industry is an exception to the --"
1966.220,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4088.753,4089.662,"The exceptions, yes."
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4089.662,4091.056,That's correct.
1966.220,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4091.219,4092.398,Done by the legislature?
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4092.398,4127.892,But -- but what I would like to emphasize here is that Congress has ever since 1914 the Clayton Act in 1914 and again in 1926 and again in 1932 and again in 1934 and then again in 1935 when the Wagner Act was passed and again in 1947 when (Inaudible) was passed and again in 1959 when the Landrum-Griffin Act was passed Congress that has been dealing with this problem has never used the word “secondary boycott” in the statute.
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4186.393,4188.457,Are conceding Mr. Rutledge that --
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4188.457,4188.783,What?
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4188.783,4196.41,Are you conceding that you have a problem as somebody put this to the picketing secondary aspect?
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4196.41,4199.14,We have more of a problem Your Honor but I don't think we have a fatal problem.
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4199.14,4214.208,"Do you think that -- do you think the Railroad Labor Act previews to -- wasn't it to disallow a secondary, honest to goodness secondary activity, secondary picketing?"
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4214.208,4214.697,I don't think --
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4214.697,4223.322,Against the neutral or enacted prohibited appeals neutral -- to the employees of neutral employers.
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4227.099,4227.731,"No, Your Honor."
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4236.399,4237.902,If someone might picket it.
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4237.902,4254.224,It may -- it maybe -- it's our contention that it is not that this is not this case because this is picketing which is addressed to people approaching the place where the FEC regulate and daily does business.
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4265.767,4268.141,But why not?
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4268.141,4268.949,It -- it's --
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4268.949,4276.034,Why can't -- why can't do it -- it's under the FEC trains all if FEC come in and leave by one gate.
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4276.034,4279.034,"They come in over this bridge, they come in a variety of tracks."
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4279.034,4287.883,"Well, why don't you -- why can't you just picket if it most to the FEC employees which are really the people you're making your appeal to."
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4303.814,4304.947,"Your Honor, we submit --"
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4304.947,4314.726,Why don't you just picket those gates where the FEC employees who really do that work in its premises?
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4314.726,4314.92,The first --
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4314.92,4322.336,"because they have know -- there apparently no other FEC employees for any significance better on it accept on those pay, why don't you just picket those gate?"
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4322.336,4327.368,The first answer to that Your Honor is that we're limited in picketing this point right here.
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4332.006,4333.476,"Well, what he could?"
1966.220,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4333.476,4337.777,That is in the terminal is it?
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4337.777,4341.445,"Your Honor, it's an entrance to the terminal."
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4342.797,4345.747,What if he could?
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4345.747,4349.067,"Well, that would not -- our position isn't that that's --"
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4349.067,4357.248,"-- wouldn't that be the limit, why wouldn't that be the limit of so called primary picket?"
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4357.248,4371.549,We submit Your Honor the answer to that question is the primary picketing is not limited by definition by definition that this Court has made to appeal just to employees of the primary employer.
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4387.782,4395.488,You're saying you have a right to appeal to anybody who is regularly contributing to the running of the establish of which you have at primary dispute?
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4395.488,4396.088,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4396.088,4402.735,And this is one of the places where the FEC has regularly nourished?
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4402.735,4404.017,Yes. Your Honor.
1966.220,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4793.604,4802.926,"Do you look just to the language of the Norris-LaGuardia Act and nothing else in Chicago River case would not and could not have been decided the way it was, isn't that correct?"
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4802.926,4819.767,That's correct Your Honor and I would like to move on under that of this Court of course has held that the later passed Railway Labor Act in the sense that it was extensively amended in 1934.
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4965.024,4977.107,"Well, anyway Mr. Rutledge as I understand it the panel of your argument is you have no dispute with this section in any sense if it requires Section 6."
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4977.107,4978.218,That's correct.
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4978.218,4996.69,But your real dispute is with FEC and that derive from it is the authority legally to put the questions you are on these petitioners and that you're protected by Norris-LaGuardia against the injunction against that kind.
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,4998.153,4999.757,That is correct Your Honor.
1966.220,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5168.458,5198.748,"I understand your -- the relative lines of defense of your argument to be that if we're persuaded that you're right about the Norris-LaGuardia Act effect in taking away any power of the federal court to issue an injunction in this case that -- then that's true whether or not this is secondary boycott, isn't that -- that is your argument, isn't it?"
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,5198.748,5199.375,That's -- that's true.
1966.220,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5199.375,5216.579,You -- you put them in summary in a different order but I understood your argument to be I so understand it that if you're right about the Norris-LaGuardia Act that is true even if this is a boycott which would be illegal under the National Labor Relations Act in an industry affected by that Act?
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,5216.579,5217.35,Precisely.
1966.220,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5217.35,5219.245,Is that -- do I understand it correctly?
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,5219.245,5220.376,That -- that's correct.
1966.220,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5220.376,5220.864,Yes.
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,5220.864,5236.832,"Now, I would like to refer to what we call the degree of oral argument, the argument that we're going to go up to Atlanta or going to go to Chicago and go up here and shutdown terminals all over the country because there are FEC cars went through that."
1966.220,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5253.525,5259.792,But wouldn't the logic of your argument also say that there could be an injunction there by federal court?
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,5259.792,5284.015,Not necessarily particularly if the view that the Court of Appeals took of Norris-LaGuardia is adopted namely that the -- there must be a unity of interest even perhaps more close and more direct than total industry wide.
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5287.004,5295.366,What do you mean specifically to that to do kind of operation that goes on to Jacksonville namely of FEC train with FEC crews coming in?
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,5295.366,5295.66,That --
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5295.66,5298.173,Unless you don't have it in Chicago I gather.
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,5298.173,5309.421,That would be the relevance as I understand it of Chief Judge Tuttle's discussion of the fact that the seaboard and the ACL are in competition with the FEC.
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5316.846,5331.471,I must say Mr. Rutledge I don't quite understand why the principle has any different depending upon whether FEC crews goes to the terminal or not.
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,5332.627,5341.551,We -- we say that that is a significant fact Your Honor because that shows that this is a regular place of operation for the FEC.
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5365.487,5372.733,"Incidentally, if you prevail what -- what's the position of the petitioners when respect to an injunction that FEC get against?"
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,5372.733,5380.889,"Well, Your Honor we've been trying to get into that litigation, our position is this, we petition to intervene before all these occurred."
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5426.933,5450.526,"Mr. Rutledge, if the Atlantic Coast Line had a separate terminal through which if through train went and the Atlantic Coast Line used this terminal only for purpose of interchange with FEC and other railroads, you wouldn't claim the rights to go and picket Atlantic Coast Line separate terminal, would you?"
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,5450.526,5459.597,"No, we would not Your Honor and the facts in this case show we submit and of course this can be developed much more clearly on a more extensive theory."
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5472.755,5473.339,Do you --
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,5473.339,5474.366,-- trains came in --
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5474.366,5482.716,-- you must admit though that within this terminal not only to FEC doing a lot of business but so of the other lines?
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,5482.716,5483.237,That's correct.
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5483.237,5493.529,And also doing -- FEC is doing a lot of business in that terminal with has no connection with the other line and somewhere to the other line to do a lot of business at terminal absolutely no connection with FEC.
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,5493.529,5494.84,That's correct.
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5494.84,5502.919,"So, this is addressed to the ordinary case of an injunction to where you seal off the primary employer from all the connection."
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,5513.889,5521.011,"Your Honor, so the long as the integrated and inseparable that's a necessary by product of addressing the primary pressure --"
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5521.011,5526.493,"Well, it's already admitted that you let the Atlantic trains to go there without any interruption."
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,5526.493,5530.578,That's very clearly it can be done and we submit that --
1966.220,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5530.578,5542.3,But you say this is really is the old common side of problem that the demands on the primary employer or had custom over the damage does --
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,5542.3,5557.218,"Well, we submit that that there are numerous ways that the operations here can be arranged so that our right to picket, what we claim are right to be to picket primary employer will have minimum effect."
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5557.218,5562.074,"Well, that is the petitioners would embargo all FEC's staff."
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,5562.074,5565.981,Not embargo is only one solution which we --
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5565.981,5569.361,What you want -- you want them to stop handling any FEC interchange?
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,5569.361,5572.082,"We -- we want Your Honor, that's correct."
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5576.454,5579.059,But not an embargo?
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,5579.587,5591.006,Where an embargo is technically I would understand to be something imposed legally under the Interstate Commerce Act for requirement by commission action.
1966.220,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5648.381,5661.759,"If you're right Mr. Rutledge that you're under no -- there's no incentive at all for you to limit the impact of what you're doing if you're right if the Norris-LaGuardia Act would then say a federal courts from enjoining anything, whatever you want."
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,5661.759,5684.08,"Your Honor, there's a very significant interest for us to limit this as much as we can and that interest is our own self-interest because when we for instance put picket lines around the entire terminal company in order to reach the FEC operation this puts our own people out of work if they are out to picket lines."
1966.220,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5696.64,5698.81,"Well, but that's what you are doing."
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,5698.81,5710.735,That certainly is what we're doing in this dispute because were compel to by the integrated operation here but if we can work out in arrangement where it won't be integrated we have very motive of self-interest to limit as much as we can.
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5710.735,5715.993,"Incidentally, Mr. Rutledge even if you we're not here don't you have a -- the most identical state court injunction?"
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,5715.993,5717.306,"We do have Your Honor, yes."
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5717.306,5718.122,Where is that case?
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,5718.122,5719.093,That's on appeal.
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5719.093,5719.534,Where?
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,5719.534,5727.413,To the District Court of Appeal in Tallahassee and it was also before this Court on a probation proceeding.
1966.220,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,5727.413,5728.81,"But what you said now, was it?"
1966.220,2,37269,neal_rutledge,,5728.81,5732.39,"Yes, it's pending before this Court."
1966.220,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5732.39,5738.06,Mr. Milledge.
1966.220,3,16604,allan_milledge,,5738.06,5740.638,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.220,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5952.754,5954.461,"Well, it's the preemptive issue there --"
1966.220,3,16604,allan_milledge,,5954.461,5956.311,It is preemption.
1966.220,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5991.674,5995.241,We'll recess now.
1966.220,3,16604,allan_milledge,,5995.241,5998.01,Please the Court.
1966.220,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6262.135,6268.292,The duties under the Interstate Commerce Act also aren't they are carriers?
1966.220,3,16604,allan_milledge,,6268.292,6284.935,There are duties but of course this Court has held on many occasions particularly we would cite telegraphers in which the labor policy of the United States is not to be subordinated to the transportation policy.
1966.220,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6284.935,6289.601,How about the case of last term involving this railroad in this --
1966.220,3,16604,allan_milledge,,6289.601,6290.519,The Clerk's case?
1966.220,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6290.519,6292.161,This predecessor in this tribunal?
1966.220,3,16604,allan_milledge,,6292.161,6322.343,That was a specific provision of the Railway Labor Act 27 which required carriers to make and maintain agreements and we interpreted that to mean that that is the none ups the railway labor movement that you couldn't change them without a Section 6 notice and of course that was essentially the holding the of this Court with the modification of reasonably necessary about of a case of a specific duty which --
1966.220,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6322.343,6338.219,"Well, I'm referring to the train particularly to that case with rule as to my question as to the duties of railroads -- of carriers under the Interstate Commerce Act to operate wasn't this some of lines in the opinion of the Court on that statute?"
1966.220,3,16604,allan_milledge,,6338.219,6339.733,Right.
1966.220,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6358.198,6367.54,"But in this whole grab bag of sometimes inconsistent statutes, that statutes is one of that to be thrown into I suppose, isn't it?"
1966.220,3,16604,allan_milledge,,6367.54,6369.091,The Interstate Commerce Act.
1966.220,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6389.073,6400.539,"I -- I suppose that if that have an injunction is issue here against here union a damage action would lie also, wouldn't it?"
1966.220,3,16604,allan_milledge,,6400.539,6402.905,I would presume so.
1966.220,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6426.96,6442.547,But doesn't damage action is been forbidden under the same provisions because injunction can damage action sits down on the same two feet with respect to this activity there under the antitrust laws or guess maybe --
1966.220,3,16604,allan_milledge,,6442.547,6445.014,Hudson would be a good example of that --
1966.220,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6445.014,6448.876,"So, we're dealing -- we're talking about damage is an injunction?"
1966.220,3,16604,allan_milledge,,6448.876,6451.11,"I think so, yes."
1966.220,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6486.051,6490.594,Mr. Lyons.
1966.220,4,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,6490.594,6492.703,May it please the Court.
1966.220,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6516.164,6517.707,How to issue an injunction?
1966.220,4,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,6517.707,6518.334,Right.
1966.220,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6788.263,6793.874,(Inaudible)
1966.220,4,21158,dennis_g_lyons,,6793.874,6811.968,"We contend that on the substantive side, first that there is on the jurisdictional side, we say that you have to read the Norris-LaGuardia Act definition of labor dispute with the definition of the dispute in the Railway Labor Act."
