1978.77-719,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,90.337,"We'll hear arguments next in 719, Chapman against the Houston Welfare Rights Organization."
1978.77-719,0,21735,david_h_young,,93.933,97.653,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-719,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,317.803,320.92,What practical difference in that change?
1978.77-719,0,21735,david_h_young,,320.92,326.646,I hope to demonstrate there is no practical difference.
1978.77-719,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,542.712,550.468,Who would oppose any remand for purpose of amending the complaint?
1978.77-719,0,21735,david_h_young,,550.468,552.324,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-719,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,599.031,604.54,Do you feel then that the -- if we should reach the merits of the Van Lare case is not controlling?
1978.77-719,0,21735,david_h_young,,604.54,606.937,Yes.
1978.77-719,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,606.937,613.943,"Because there was a constitutional claim here in the sense that there was a Supremacy Clause claim, wasn't there?"
1978.77-719,0,21735,david_h_young,,614.542,616.332,That you certainly where he is.
1978.77-719,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,618.183,620.248,But certainly whenever the --
1978.77-719,0,21735,david_h_young,,620.248,620.977,That certainly an issue --
1978.77-719,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,620.977,640.425,"Whenever the complaint is based upon a conflict between of state's statute of policy in a federal statute and claim being made that the state is acting inconsistently with the federal statute that's necessarily as Supremacy Clause claim, isn't it which is a constitutional claim at least?"
1978.77-719,0,21735,david_h_young,,640.425,644.377,"Well, that is how it's characterized, yes."
1978.77-719,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,644.377,645.216,Yes.
1978.77-719,0,21735,david_h_young,,645.216,646.701,I don't subscribe to it.
1978.77-719,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,646.701,660.294,"Mr. Young, you say you hope to speak to a very little as I read your petition or your brief on the merits is the first question raised in your brief on a merits and if you'll notice the case set for argument after yours as well --"
1978.77-719,0,21735,david_h_young,,660.294,661.12,I have.
1978.77-719,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,661.12,663.524,In which that's the only question raised here.
1978.77-719,0,21735,david_h_young,,663.524,664.406,Yes.
1978.77-719,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,885.574,888.806,"Well, excuse me Mr. Young."
1978.77-719,0,21735,david_h_young,,911.152,912.23,"It is, yes."
1978.77-719,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,912.23,933.285,"And in that footnote, the Court says, Although, other Circuits disagree we have held that Section 1983 is an act of Congress providing for the protection of Civil Rights sufficient to invoke Section 1343(4) jurisdiction."
1978.77-719,0,21735,david_h_young,,939.016,940.451,As to subparagraph 4.
1978.77-719,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,940.451,954.468,"As to whether or not since 1983 is an act of Congress providing for the protection of Civil Rights efficient to invoke 1343(4) jurisdiction, is there any disagreement on that?"
1978.77-719,0,21735,david_h_young,,954.468,963.283,"As to the later part, yes not to the former whether it's sufficient invoke 1343(a) jurisdiction is an issue."
1978.77-719,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,966.495,979.517,I thought the disagreement was whether or not this lawsuit is within the ambit of 1343(4) or you want to say 1343(3) or (4)?
1978.77-719,0,21735,david_h_young,,979.517,981.386,"Well,--"
1978.77-719,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,981.386,989.096,"Not whether a lawsuit that is within 1343 is there is jurisdiction such a lawsuit under 1983, I don't think there's any disagreement about that."
1978.77-719,0,21735,david_h_young,,989.096,992.777,"Well, perhaps I wasn't following your first question."
1978.77-719,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,992.777,998.359,"Well, in other words, I don't follow this footnote and I was asking you if you could help me explain it."
1978.77-719,0,21735,david_h_young,,998.359,1013.514,"Well, I think the explanation is the confusion among the effects of the Supremacy Clause on the one hand, 1983 on the other hand and then the two subsections of 1343 plus the Social Security Act."
1978.77-719,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1048.607,1053.181,"Because we don't -- nobody gets to the merits if you're right on your jurisdictional claim, isn't that correct?"
1978.77-719,0,21735,david_h_young,,1053.181,1053.945,That's true.
1978.77-719,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1181.568,1185.429,We'll resume there at 1:00.
1978.77-719,0,21735,david_h_young,,1203.652,1206.78,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-719,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1664.756,1666.301,Mr. Skarda.
1978.77-719,1,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,1666.301,1673.961,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-719,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1912.472,1917.979,Your position is in any Supremacy Clause case is a 1983 case?
1978.77-719,2,21735,david_h_young,,1917.979,1919.152,That's correct Your Honor.
1978.77-719,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1921.841,1922.128,Yes.
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,1922.128,1923.194,But the cover law requirement.
1978.77-719,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1923.194,1925.098,Yes.
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,1925.098,1926.138,And --
1978.77-719,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1926.138,1933.432,Regardless of what the underlying rate is involved or what underlying claim is involve?
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,1933.432,1937.139,If it involves a conflict and let me expand on that if I may Your Honor.
1978.77-719,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1937.139,1948.934,"So, you would say in your position that surely if you had a $10,000.00 in controversy you could bring your action under 1331?"
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,1948.934,1951.359,That's correct Your Honor.
1978.77-719,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1967.901,1983.827,"Mr. Skarda, I'm not sure I understand your position for me a very difficult case because it involves so much circularity of the arguments on both sides to this jurisdictional question."
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2038.77,2048.399,"That's correct Your Honor but 1343(3) also says, A civil action authorized by law and that's been interpreted to refer back."
1978.77-719,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2050.603,2052.639,You need 1983 for your argument?
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2052.639,2053.824,For a cause of action yes Your Honor.
1978.77-719,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2053.824,2054.706,Do you?
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2054.706,2055.694,We believe we do.
1978.77-719,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2055.694,2061.646,Because only that Section is a law that authorizes this cause of action?
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2061.646,2062.844,That's our argument Your Honor.
1978.77-719,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2062.844,2063.909,Yes.
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2063.909,2069.983,And we have of course again believe that's what the Court found in Edelman versus Jordan.
1978.77-719,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2085.192,2091.92,If you have apparently you don't think that the Supremacy Clause case has to involve a law providing for equal rights?
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2091.92,2095.216,"No, that's correct Your Honor."
1978.77-719,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2095.216,2095.755,What would happen --
1978.77-719,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2095.755,2108.242,Do you think the Supremacy Clause case is that 1343(3) covers and include many none equal rights cases?
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2108.242,2116.181,We don't think they have included the large number of none equal rights cases but we think they included those basic cases and conflict.
1978.77-719,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2124.457,2134.878,"Can you conceive of a case between G1eneral Ferguson, General Motors and General Electric under the Supremacy Clause under 1343(4)?"
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2134.878,2138.423,By itself without 1983 then since it would not color of state law problem.
1978.77-719,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2138.423,2147.043,"My answer to Justice White was Supremacy 1343 automatically, you don't really mean that do you?"
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2147.043,2154.223,We think we need Section 1983 in the color of state law provisions Justice Marshall.
1978.77-719,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2157.457,2163.852,"Oh, unless -- there is a Supremacy Clause problem involved in anyway unless the state is involved."
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2163.852,2164.679,That's correct Your Honor.
1978.77-719,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2164.679,2170.655,And that's usually I mean that's recurring instance where the Supremacy Clause is invoked --
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2170.655,2171.134,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-719,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2171.134,2175.865,There is where there's been and assertion are on under state law?
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2175.865,2179.225,"We agree, that's correct Your Honor."
1978.77-719,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2179.225,2193.937,But you are saying that even though Congress seem to say in 1343(3) that only certain kinds of statutory claims would be vindicated soon as Supremacy Clause you can read each other statutory claims?
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2193.937,2198.687,But if we have the authorized by law provision such as Section 1983 here.
1978.77-719,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2213.525,2216.938,But it does limit that the kinds of statutory claims it would reach?
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2216.938,2217.537,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-719,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2218.376,2226.508,And yet through the Supremacy Clause you would say you can reach any statutory claim as long as there was a color of state law in both.
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2226.508,2228.173,And the clear federal conflict.
1978.77-719,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2228.173,2229.838,Uh-huh!
1978.77-719,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2229.838,2239.167,Where will you be by a clear federal conflict presumably clear or unclear if there's a claim of conflict you'd have jurisdiction to adjudicate it?
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2239.167,2250.066,"Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we believe that it would not reach for example a state law provision which is identical to the federal law provision."
1978.77-719,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2250.066,2254.508,And just no claims just arising under like a questions about construction?
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2254.508,2255.406,That's correct.
1978.77-719,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2255.406,2257.143,Or the facts or something?
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2257.143,2263.656,"For example, in our State in Texas there is provision that they cannot delay in giving assistance and must provide fair hearings."
1978.77-719,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2275.292,2283.173,"Well, wouldn't you have and as applied claim in other words even though the state and federal claims were statutorily identical?"
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2290.48,2293.295,Certainly we would Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1978.77-719,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2305.319,2306.445,"Well, that is not a practical reason."
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2308.68,2311.667,"That's correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2311.667,2317.954,Have you just abandon your suggestion a moment ago that there has to be a clear conflict between the state rule and the federal rule?
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2320.386,2332.111,If they're precisely the same unless there was a patter or practice which meant to the state rule even though written appears to be the federal rule but it is not apply as the federal rule is intended.
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2334.746,2342.207,"Well, then, couldn't in ever case couldn't pursue in the first instance to the federal court saying you don't think you'd win in the state court?"
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2342.207,2342.566,"No, Your Honor."
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2353.861,2366.205,"Well, you say is a matter of federal law you're entitled to some kind of a benefit if your client is incapacitated and the state has found him not to be incapacitated but they're wrong as a matte of federal law why aren't you still entitle to go in a 1983?"
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2366.205,2373.331,"Unless, they announce they have the right, they administer the program to decide incapacity unless say announce are rule which restricts the federal -- we would not --"
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2373.331,2375.954,"They say, we apply the same rule as a federal?"
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2375.954,2377.679,"Then, we don't believe that we could get into the federal --"
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2377.679,2389.038,"How do you reconcile that with Monroe against Pape, State of Illinois or City of Chicago said they announced exactly the same rule as the federal constitution required and yet the Court here how could you go right into the federal court?"
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2389.038,2398.32,"But of course in Monroe versus Pape, that was a Due Process violation for waking someone up at their home at night breaking down the door of their apartment and taken them to jail."
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2398.32,2402.529,"Do you think it's due to the constitutional rule on the state rule, is it?"
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2409.656,2421.822,We believe and it's a Supremacy Clause theory that the state rule either in practice or as written will have to be different from the federal rule.
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2421.822,2425.475,But it didn't in Monroe against Pape is all I'm saying?
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2425.475,2428.397,Of course the state didn't carry out their rule in Monroe versus Pape --
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2428.397,2435.875,"Well, they didn't have a chance to find out whether they would or not because they said you can't sue unless you can go and sue in the federal court without suing the state court."
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2437.971,2451.138,"Well, the only welfare you can to it where there is no state federal conflict such as our example the incapacity situation where the state simply decides the facts in a case."
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2451.138,2452.342,I know it would repetitiuos.
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2456.158,2461.797,I think it's different from Monroe versus Pape because there is no question of conflict.
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2461.797,2465.798,There's no question of conflict in Monroe against Pape?
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2465.798,2468.311,We believe that Monroe versus Pape will come under our theory --
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2468.311,2473.832,I don't argue the rule against policeman beating up you know people when they search them at all.
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2473.832,2482.87,"And we come under our theory in terms if that's applied, it's a pattern it doesn't grant to realize written."
1978.77-719,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2482.87,2495.396,"Well, 1343(3) dependently gives jurisdiction where the claim is constitutional, doesn't it?"
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2495.396,2498.498,1343(3) again Your Honor says authorize by lawsuit.
1978.77-719,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2499.324,2505.834,"Well, I know but it also -- but it gives jurisdiction over constitutional claims?"
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2505.834,2506.493,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-719,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2508.276,2514.383,And if they or the kind in 1983 contemplates?
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2514.383,2515.986,That's our position Your Honor.
1978.77-719,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2605.633,2615.801,"Well, Hagans agains Lavine depended on the assertion of a substantial constitutional claim and then statutory claim with regard its pendent, wasn't it?"
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2615.801,2618.544,That is correct Your Honor.
1978.77-719,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2618.544,2622.005,And what wasn't the issue we're talking about now reserved in Hagans against Lavine?
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2622.005,2627.155,"In footnote 5 there was a specifically reserved, yes Your Honor and we believe it's now open for the Court's decision."
1978.77-719,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2663.792,2676.127,"If this case did involve more than $10,000.00 exclusive of interest and cost, it seems to be consider as I understand that that there would be jurisdiction under 1331?"
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2676.127,2676.846,That's correct Your Honor.
1978.77-719,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2676.846,2678.571,And why would that be?
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2678.571,2683.217,Because it would be a case arising under the constitutional laws.
1978.77-719,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2688.487,2698.607,Do you have some cases that saying the laws provision covers any kind of statutory or federal statutory claim?
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2698.607,2708.907,The 1331 case is we believe that decided to this Court of course that's not this case.
1978.77-719,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2715.089,2730.706,"Well, never mind I know when you take you time but I just didn't know that it has been squarely decided here that maybe has that the and laws provision of 1983 refers to any federal statutory claim whatsoever?"
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2730.706,2738.718,"Oh no, now, as I taken 1331 no and I will address that argument at this moment if I may Your Honor."
1978.77-719,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2738.718,2740.001,"Well, --"
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2740.001,2742.946,And of course for making that in our brief.
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2788.19,2794.626,"Mr. Skarda, in that point you mentioned the two statutes have a coextensive in the sense."
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2806.766,2810.273,We think they do Your Honor and of course that's necessary to reach jurisdiction.
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2813.035,2824.355,"So, then under the and laws provision it has be laws providing for equal rights and effect then you have to say do you not that the Social Security Act is an act providing for the equal rights of citizens?"
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2824.355,2839.742,"No, we would argue only Your Honor that you have to say the 1983 is such an act and in fact we regard that equal rights language is a short hand reference back to 1983 and we cited in our brief to some revise our arguments that that is indeed what happened."
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2839.982,2850.569,Unless you just told me though that you do acquit the words and laws in 1983 with the words act of Congress providing for equal rights in 1343(3)?
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2850.569,2857.296,"Yes, Your Honor but we think once you get back to Section 1983 you don't carry over the equal rights limitations."
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2857.296,2859.06,"So, they're not coextensive are you?"
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2859.06,2870.856,We claim that they coextensive in terms of 1983 only that if it's not -- if we say if it's in 1983 then it's encompass by 1443(3) because they both started out in the same place.
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2870.856,2881.036,"Well, then going back to my first, you do not take the position that the words and laws in 1983 are coextensive with the words act of Congress providing of equal rights in 43(3)?"
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2881.036,2882.413,"No, we would then --"
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2882.413,2885.826,You say that 1983 provision is broader.
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2885.826,2890.617,"No, we're saying that it's --"
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2890.617,2891.324,You must --
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2891.324,2894.007,That we must come within -- once again within 1983 we automatically --
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2894.007,2902.438,But in order to get within 1983 you must construe the word laws in 1983 to be broader than the concept of laws protecting equal rights.
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2902.438,2903.562,That's correct Your Honor.
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2903.562,2907.047,"Therefore, you do not take the position that the two statutes are coextensive?"
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2907.047,2910.041,"Well, we call it a kind of coextensive in this Your Honor, but we're talking really about level (Voice Overlap) --"
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2910.041,2912.975,"Well, coextensive to the extent that it helps you but to the extent that hurts?"
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2912.975,2918.963,That's correct Your Honor and of course our reasoning again is where that language came from in the 1875 provision.
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2918.963,2920.221,I understand.
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2920.221,2935.114,And as this Court well knows and that 1875 provision was in particularly well laid out that in our brief we indicate that there were some trying to refer back and pick up Section 1983 and of course if --
1978.77-719,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2935.114,2941.188,"What was that 1875 that Congress enacted for the first time general federal question jurisdiction, wasn't it?"
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2941.188,2941.998,That's correct Your Honor.
1978.77-719,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2941.998,2952.731,"Wouldn't have been kind of strange for them to put a $2,000.00 or $3,000.00 jurisdictional limitation on that kind of jurisdiction and still have treated as broadly as you say they do 1343?"
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,2952.731,2974.298,Of Course 1343 only refers again to our color of law claims and as we understand the 1875 legislation on general federal question that there was no discussion of this particular point and then a relationship that the 1875 provisions really taken out if you would in the absence of any reference to 1331 jurisdiction.
1978.77-719,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3133.332,3136.434,Of course the Second Circuit protection Supremacy Clause --
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,3136.434,3137.859,They do Your Honor and --
1978.77-719,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3137.859,3139.614,Respondents having said that?
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,3139.614,3144.7,And the labor the constitutional claims for pages and pages and many decisions.
1978.77-719,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3217.819,3224.586,"Well, would you claim that the Social Security Act is an act providing for the protection of Civil Rights so that 1983 is?"
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,3224.586,3236.191,Just 1983 Your Honor and of course manual solar's comment also pick up these notes that breadth to the jurisdiction and the debate in the 1957 Act.
1978.77-719,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3236.191,3239.587,"In both of your arguments you have to go back through 1983, don't you?"
1978.77-719,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3239.587,3240.845,That's is correct Justice.
1978.77-719,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3240.845,3242.587,Right.
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,3242.587,3257.686,And there are law view articles reading Hague v. CIO and Bomar v. Key available at that time and cited in our brief which deal with those 19 -- with to get problem between 1343(3) and 1983.
1978.77-719,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3263.443,3264.357,Do you --
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,3264.357,3265.407,"Yes, Justice Marshall."
1978.77-719,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3265.407,3271.749,What the Hague versus CIO decide about anything?
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,3271.749,3281.466,We believe Hague versus CIO address whether or not interference with the federal right under National Labor Relations Act and of course they were dissents on whether or not this is really a free speech right of assembly case.
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3312.162,3313.24,Have you finished your answer with Justice?
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,3313.24,3314.59,Yes.
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3314.59,3323.389,If you're correct Mr. Skarda and you maybe of course that the word laws in 1983 it much broader than the or is somewhat broader than the concept of equal rights.
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,3333.499,3340.014,"That's why it's somewhat broader than our Supremacy Clause argument but again, 1983 is limited to state action."
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3340.014,3340.601,Yes.
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,3340.601,3343.564,"And so, we don't only involve suits against the state party defendant."
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3343.564,3353.344,But it would apply if I understand your concept correctly to any federal right given to an individual citizen as against state authority?
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,3353.344,3353.967,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3353.967,3361.594,And you would never have to us we did for example in the Bucky case last year consider whether or not there was an implied cause of action under Title 6.
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,3364.984,3375.59,And of course our reasons for that again the historical reasons that Congress was concerned about notions of federalism at that time and pass the Act to enforce 1443.
1978.77-719,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3375.59,3383.973,Your fundamental difference is the jurisdictional amount applies to suits between private citizens and there's no reason for jurisdictional amount when the claim is by the individual against the --
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,3383.973,3387.267,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1978.77-719,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3418.111,3433.486,But you would I suppose you would say that if your view of 1983 the and laws provision is right it must covered by 1983 cover a lot of laws other than Civil Rights law?
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,3433.486,3442.219,It is a broader argument Your Honor than the Supremacy Clause claim.
1978.77-719,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3442.219,3445.249,"I wasn't asking about a Supremacy Clause, I was asking about --"
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,3445.249,3446.686,19 --
1978.77-719,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3446.686,3451.836,"1334(4), it says Civil Rights refers to Civil Rights law?"
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,3451.836,3461.508,"Okay, get our from that -- but then again it's almost identical the and laws argument in terms of number of cases because it refers back to Section 1983 which is requires color of law provision to get us in there."
1978.77-719,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3461.508,3462.89,I understand that.
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,3462.89,3469.602,"So, there would be somewhat identical in terms of coverage under 1983 as Civil Rights statute."
1978.77-719,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3469.602,3470.737,"Well, I don't know."
1978.77-719,3,33161,jeffrey_j_skarda,,3489.501,3504.632,Of course we're saying all we are and it's been criticized at the chicken egg circular argument is that 19 -- all we are saying is that 1983 is a Civil Right statute.
1978.77-719,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3524.258,3528.304,"Mr. Young, do you have anything further?"
1978.77-719,4,21735,david_h_young,,3529.909,3534.927,"Okay, thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-719,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3797.692,3798.471,Thank you gentlemen.
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,3859.493,3863.198,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.77-719,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4025.404,4028.05,The case 1871 statute have the words and laws in it?
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4028.05,4031.99,The 1871 statute only used the word constitution.
1978.77-719,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4128.024,4131.774,Right under the federal statute enforcing the Constitution.
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4131.774,4139.441,Those rights Mr. Justice White would include of necessity all rights under federal law for the three reasons that I mentioned.
1978.77-719,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4160.008,4166.34,"Well, if you feel that you don't need the and laws language would you have real to have with Swift versus Wickham, don't you?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4166.34,4172.819,I feel that we need the and laws language today.
1978.77-719,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4179.345,4180.611,"Under your view, you don't need it in your case?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4180.611,4181.091,Excuse me.
1978.77-719,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4181.091,4184.42,"Under your view, you don't need it in your case?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4184.42,4187.764,"Yes, you don't need it if you read and laws is being redundant."
1978.77-719,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4188.478,4190.573,"Well, but don't you read it is being redundant?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4190.573,4191.268,"No, not necessary."
1978.77-719,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4200.302,4203.328,"Well, do you rely on the and laws provision in this case at all?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4203.328,4204.295,"Yes, I do."
1978.77-719,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4219.27,4222.585,"Well, don't you plead the Supremacy Clause claim?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4222.585,4228.468,"Yes, the Supremacy Clause claim is of necessity included in the pleadings because it comes under 1343."
1978.77-719,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4228.468,4233.226,"If you're right about to see your Supremacy Clause claim, what do you need and laws about?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4233.226,4239.036,If I'm right about my Supremacy Clause claim I do not need the and laws you're correct.
1978.77-719,5,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,4239.036,4241.111,You have at least two alternative arguments?
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4241.111,4244.628,I have two alternative arguments and what I'm saying is that there are three arguments --
1978.77-719,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4244.628,4249.144,But if you're right about the one and laws word are redundant?
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4249.144,4250.994,"Yes, that's correct if I am."
1978.77-719,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4331.658,4342.096,"I don't think I follow, you say that we're dealing only with the federal statute but you're dealing with the federal statute that's claimed to override or preempt the state statute, aren't you?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4342.096,4357.798,"But what I'm saying is that in the cases under Swift, the exception to the convocation of the three-judge court occurred when you had both of federal statute and a state statute as suppose to simply a state statute and I'm --"
1978.77-719,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4357.798,4360.433,Don't you have a federal statute in the state statute here?
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4360.433,4374.406,"Yes, I do and I'm saying that there is not the same state concern in those situations and that's precisely why this type of case is readdressable and should be brought in federal court."
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4425.829,4428.975,Those state courts can give a federal court jurisdiction?
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4428.975,4430.212,Excuse me?
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4430.212,4435.201,Those state courts nor you can give the federal court jurisdiction?
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4435.201,4437.821,"No, I believe that Congress gave the federal courts jurisdiction very clearly."
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4437.821,4441.591,"Now, you're saying that the state courts in New Jersey give us jurisdiction?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4441.591,4444.939,"No, if I was saying that I didn't mean to."
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4458.584,4462.284,Now give me the decision of any Court that said that.
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4462.284,4474.858,The name of case is in this appendix to my petitioners brief; it's Atchison versus the Department of Institutions and Agencies to the State of New Jersey and there was a conflict there urged between a federal food --
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4474.858,4476.62,Does that apply to this case?
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4476.62,4479.173,"No, it applies in terms of its rational."
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4479.173,4484.553,"Well, why is it that a federal judge can read English better than a state judge?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4484.553,4487.236,I don't think that that's the point Mr. Justice Marshall.
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4487.236,4489.552,"Well, isn't the Constitution written in English?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4489.552,4490.93,"Yes, it is Mr. Justice Marshall."
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4505.529,4513.538,Only if you say that federal judges understand the Constitution better than state judges?
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4513.538,4514.512,I don't think I was saying that.
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4524.882,4532.39,"Now, do you also think the state judges are better able to understand state laws than federal judges?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4532.39,4533.304,I don't think that that's --
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4533.304,4534.055,Do you?
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4534.055,4535.115,"No, I don't think that's the proper --"
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4535.115,4540.509,"Because if you do please join us on the several case, will you?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4540.509,4545.252,"Yes, I think that that's sort of like placing in somewhat of bond."
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4546.378,4552.893,What about if I tell you to know your theory that a federal judge knows more federal law than a state judge?
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4552.893,4553.54,I think he does.
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4553.54,4554.81,Huh?
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4554.81,4556.869,I think the federal judge does know more federal law than a state --
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4556.869,4559.438,The date that he arise on the bench?
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4559.438,4561.201,"No, certainly not."
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4572.479,4574.39,"In fact, urging to get to that point where you're going now."
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4574.39,4582.732,"Yes, I think that in point of fact though the federal judiciary is more equipped to interpret federal statutes."
1978.77-719,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4617.681,4622.28,If you have a Supremacy claim you can always bring it here if it's turned down by the state courts then.
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4622.28,4644.714,"That would be the only circumstance on an appeal, that would be the only constitutional but as we argue in this case we believe that the jurisdiction rest even a part from the Supremacy Mr. Justice Rehnquist and that would be through the interconnection of the and laws Clause of the 1983 and the Act of Congress providing for the protection of equal rights and the Act of Congress providing for the protection of Civil Rights."
1978.77-719,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4664.595,4679.26,"Well, I thought you were saying that there really isn't any alternative if in some areas that you simply can't get your federal question adjudicated unless you're allowed to have jurisdiction in the federal courts."
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4679.26,4699.313,"Well, of course at the present time it's very, very difficult because some of the arising under cases have been interpreted to exclude for constitutional reasons -- the Supremacy Clause and if in point of fact, the only thing that we were left within a constitutional sense that is the only thing that would give us a clear right of action in terms of an appeal to United States Supreme Court was that Supremacy Clause issue."
1978.77-719,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4713.148,4714.87,That's a burden that lots of litigants --
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4714.87,4730.076,"No, I understand that and there are certainly a mechanism at a reason for that but I think that nowhere will you find a situation where you have a direct federal statute in conflict with the state statute having a federal courts say but we really don't have jurisdiction over that."
1978.77-719,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4797.044,4801.47,Are you through Mr. Gardner with your discussion to 1343(3)?
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4801.47,4802.092,I'm not through with it.
1978.77-719,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4803.854,4817.22,I'm not quite sure I understand whether you take the position that the words and laws in 1983 are broader or coextensive than the words by any act of Congress providing for equal rights in 1343(3)?
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4817.22,4820.261,I categorically take the position that they're broader and they have to be --
1978.77-719,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4820.261,4821.662,"So, there is a gap between the two state?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4821.662,4825.222,"So -- well, I'm saying that --"
1978.77-719,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4825.222,4825.826,"I mean, there's --"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4825.826,4834.192,There's not a gap if you read providing for the protection of Civil Rights as being coextensive with 1983.
1978.77-719,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4855.177,4869.869,"Because you say that part of the function of 1983 is to provide for equal rights of citizens and it has additional functions and those additional functions maybe this jurisdiction to perform those additional functions conferred by subparagraph 3, that's --"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4869.869,4877.068,"That yes, exactly it's suppose can do it in a cause of actions in somewhat the rational in the Ruby but that was accepted in both Vasquez and in Gomez."
1978.77-719,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4953.466,4968.835,"So, you would say that whenever you have the claim against the state agency or person acting under color of state law in which you assert to federal basis for your claim, you never need to enquire into other Congress intended to apply a private cause of action because 1983 will always provide the vehicle for the cause of action?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4968.835,4972.217,"Yes, and in point of fact I disagree with previous counsel."
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4979.051,4984.497,"Well, then Civil Rights is just surplusage?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,4984.497,5000.672,"In which Mr. Justice Marshall, Civil Rights is in surplusage in 1343(3) and (4) because 1983 is the quintessence if you will of the Civil Rights Act that's why it's not surplusage but 1983 --"
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5000.672,5001.651,But why is it there?
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5005.554,5009.186,"Yes, you do need -- you still need 1983."
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5009.186,5011.799,Do you need Civil Rights?
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5011.799,5012.865,You do need Civil --
1978.77-719,5,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,5012.865,5016.615,"Subparagraph 4 surplusage in your theory, you never need subparagraph 4?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5016.615,5020.045,You never need subparagraph 4 because there's jurisdiction under subparagraph 3.
1978.77-719,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5033.262,5049.714,"But you need the phrase act of Congress providing for equal rights of citizens in three or act of Congress providing for the protection of Civil Rights and four, in order generically to invoke 1983?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5049.714,5052.538,"Correct, in order to invoke them for purposes of jurisdiction."
1978.77-719,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5052.538,5062.29,"Generically, and then when you invoke 1983 you see exactly what it says and it says something beyond what is genus would imply?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5062.29,5073.675,"Yes, and I think this Court noted in the footnote in Lynch and I think Mr. Justice Ferguson when he was talking about gas which was having when he was talking in price dealing with 241."
1978.77-719,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5089.774,5092.242,"Well, Congress never needed that before then?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5092.242,5093.241,Excuse me.
1978.77-719,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5093.241,5097.694,Congress never -- it was unnecessary for Congress to had in Section --
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5097.694,5099.077,"Yes, exactly."
1978.77-719,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5111.368,5122.425,"Well, I don't accept your interpretation of 3 then you can accept your interpretation of 4 either in the sense that Civil Rights isn't just an automatic reference to 1983?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5122.425,5125.505,"Well, I think that that brings up a whole different issue."
1978.77-719,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5222.337,5228.756,"No, but if you're arguing on 4 has the same problem with it because you then have to say and laws and 83' is broader than Civil Rights in 4 --"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5228.756,5229.297,Both Mr. Justice Stewart.
1978.77-719,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5229.297,5230.469,"So, you get the same --"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5230.469,5234.06,"Mr. Justice Stewart, both arguments have to --"
1978.77-719,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5234.06,5236.145,Requires that and laws be a broader concept on the --
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5236.145,5239.363,Require the and laws exactly.
1978.77-719,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5252.27,5254.798,Has any court ever adopted this line of reasoning?
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5254.798,5285.927,"Yes, I believe that Justice Learned Hand in Bowmar versus Keith accepted this line of reasoning where the problem with the New York school teacher who went on jury duty pursuant to a federal statute and loss her job and brought an action under 1983 and 1343 and if I recall in that case, the Court said that it's clear that these statutes were meant to deal with federal rights -- federal statutory rights."
1978.77-719,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5300.478,5317.068,"Well, isn't one thing to say that 1983 embraces Civil Rights Act as you put in the sense that it creates a cause of action for people who have been damaged by violation of some substantive right created else where?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5317.068,5323.628,But you know I think that the quote that I was referring to in this Court would embraces the Social Security Act.
1978.77-719,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5338.963,5339.82,Well --
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5339.82,5341.259,I'm sorry I have misstated.
1978.77-719,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5341.259,5360.961,"Yes, to get back to your treat of 1983 does it necessarily follow that 1983 is itself a law protecting Civil Rights, could not one argue that it is simply an Act which gives you a cause of action if some Civil Right created else where has been infringed?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5360.961,5371.467,I don't think it can be clearly argue that way because that misperceives the entire rational of this Court in examining Board versus Florida as where noted their complementary germination.
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5385.072,5393.313,"Mr. Gardner, which case was that where we said that Civil Rights included welfare?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5393.313,5399.005,"In Edelman versus Jordan, I believe that the Court indicated that the Social Security --"
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5399.005,5402.181,"I didn't say indicated, I said held."
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5402.181,5404.186,There -- it was not in the holding.
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5404.299,5405.147,There is none?
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5405.147,5406.584,"Right, there's none specifically other than --"
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5406.584,5415.874,"Well, don't we have to hold that for you to win?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5415.874,5420.471,You have to hold that for me to win on 1343(4).
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5426.088,5430.054,"Well, don't you happen to do that to get on the 1393?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5430.054,5430.947,1393?
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5430.947,5432.735,Yes.
1978.77-719,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5435.875,5436.658,1983.
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5436.658,5438.178,1983.
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5438.178,5445.462,"1983 if we satisfy the and laws okay, then we would have to satisfy would be either 43(3) or (4)."
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5446.433,5449.867,"Well, 1983, we're talking about Civil Rights."
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5449.867,5453.929,1983 was talking about the deprivation of federal rights not -- it was not --
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5453.929,5458.836,If the deprivation of Civil Rights is going to say that about 80 million times?
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5458.836,5464.948,It's generically a Civil Rights Act but it embraces the deprivation of federal rights by state into position.
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5464.948,5478.768,"Well, don't -- we have to find that denial of welfare is a denial of rights guaranteed by 1983?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5478.768,5485.605,You have to find that the Social Security Act is in fact included within the phrase and laws that's all you have to find.
1978.77-719,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5487.571,5492.888,"You don't want to agree with that 1983, you don't want to agree to that?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5493.891,5500.583,"No, I don't agree that I think that you have to find that 1983 through its and laws conduit embraces the Social Security Act."
1978.77-719,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5508.348,5521.146,"Just before you sit down, do the Court's opinion in Rachel case or the Peacock case bare on this at all?"
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5521.146,5524.101,Rational was not holding wise in the Peacock case.
1978.77-719,5,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5524.101,5525.855,They deal about the removal statute the different statute under relying rational wise.
1978.77-719,5,42736,theodore_a_gardner,,5525.855,5543.402,"Yes, in different statute and specifically I think it's interesting that in Rachel versus Georgia, the Court refused to expand 1443 to include a broad brush because they said, Congress didn't do in 1443 would it did in 1983."
1978.77-719,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5584.437,5588.957,Mr. Skillman.
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,5588.957,5593.209,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-719,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5736.036,5746.936,"The merits of this controversy in so far as the claim is a conflict between the state and federal law were decided adversely to the complaint in Quern against Mandley, weren't they?"
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,5746.936,5751.677,I would say they have been conclusively adjudicated adversely to the petitioners Your Honor yes.
1978.77-719,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5751.677,5752.784,"In that case, yes."
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,5752.784,5754.283,I Would say so.
1978.77-719,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5754.283,5759.841,"They had another claim of course that this violated state law itself, didn't he?"
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,5759.841,5764.021,"I -- yes, there was that pending state claim which is really receiving of --"
1978.77-719,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5764.021,5767.876,Which of course not (Voice Overlap) in Quern at all.
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,5767.876,5775.919,And I think that claim is also fabulous at this point knowing the face of the complaint but in light of the affidavit is they were filing a motion for some rejudgment.
1978.77-719,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5981.455,5985.563,But 1343(4) --
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,5985.563,5996.084,"Well, 1343(4) presents somewhat different questions that I would like if I may Your Honor to address later on."
1978.77-719,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6042.816,6045.219,"Well, that's not quite the claim."
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6056.494,6071.619,"No, Your Honor we think that 1983 provides a cause of action where you can find some other legislation that provides the substantive cause of action."
1978.77-719,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6073.104,6076.286,It's in itself is not an act of Congress providing for equal rights?
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6076.286,6078.168,Not by itself.
1978.77-719,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6078.168,6090.661,"And you have to make that argument, don't you You have to take that position and successfully assert it in order for you to prevail, don't you --"
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6090.661,6091.26,"Well, I think that --"
1978.77-719,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6091.26,6092.352,In this grant of the argument?
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6092.352,6098.257,"Well, I think that certainly critical part of our argument whether its acceptance is a precondition to --"
1978.77-719,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6098.257,6099.275,"Well, if it's a critical part --"
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6099.275,6100.593,It's only critical of our argument..
1978.77-719,6,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,6101.3,6116.886,"Mr. Skillman, right on that point, there were some cases if I recall correctly in which jurisdiction was predicated on a constitutional claim and then pendant to the constitutional claim and attack was made on a state welfare program or one kind or another."
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6129.22,6140.176,I think that what the Court has done without articulate in those cases is to imply from the Social Security Act itself.
1978.77-719,6,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,6159.597,6163.447,Do you think the Court has to disavow those cases to sustain your position?
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6163.447,6165.1,"No, not at all."
1978.77-719,6,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,6165.1,6173.838,"In other words, you concede there is some kind of a federal cause of action here if not under 1983 at least it's implied under the Social Security Act?"
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6173.838,6192.868,"Well, I think that there's certainly at this point pretty long line of cases which in the pendant jurisdiction context have at least issued declaratory judgments and I have recognized a cause of action for declaratory judgment whether or not damages for example would be appropriate in that same context as --"
1978.77-719,6,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,6192.868,6195.499,"Well, if your relief is being granted --"
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6195.499,6199.303,Is a different question and I don't know that that's have been addressed.
1978.77-719,6,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,6199.303,6201.713,But injunctive relief has been given in some of those case I believe.
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6201.713,6205.436,I believe that not only declaratory relief but also injunctive relief.
1978.77-719,6,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,6206.765,6220.059,And but you say that the federal basis for the cause of action those cases should not properly be consider in 1983 but should be considered in implied cause of action predicated in the underlying statute even though the Court never discussed it or analyze it.
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6220.059,6221.864,I think that's correct Your Honor.
1978.77-719,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6221.864,6232.637,"I don't quite understand that if and laws and 1983 covers all statutes -- covers all federal statutes, do you need to say that?"
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6232.637,6254.738,"Well, no but we very strongly argue against that proposition and we think that and laws and 1983 must be read in light of its companion jurisdictional statute 1343(3) and not extend to every statute that's been enacted by Congress."
1978.77-719,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6254.738,6274.758,"But first of all, you said that 1983 is not an act of Congress providing for equal rights of citizens and it's not an act of Congress providing for the protection of Civil Rights that it's merely an act of Congress that authorizes a cause of action --"
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6274.758,6275.305,Based on --
1978.77-719,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6275.305,6276.361,Based on something else.
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6276.361,6277.177,Substantive rights found else where.
1978.77-719,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6277.177,6282.207,If 1343(3) as everybody agrees no more than a jurisdictional statute --
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6282.207,6282.926,That is correct.
1978.77-719,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6282.926,6287.495,That 1983 is no more than authorizes a cause of action.
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6287.495,6288.062,That's correct.
1978.77-719,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6288.062,6291.004,But that cause of action must be based upon something else?
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6291.004,6291.793,That's correct.
1978.77-719,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6291.793,6298.444,"And that therefore, 1983 does not fall within the definition of 1343(3) or (4)?"
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6298.444,6301.965,That's correct.
1978.77-719,6,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,6301.965,6303.39,"Excuse me, I want to be sure I have your position."
1978.77-719,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6311.609,6315.429,"Yes, they were originally enacted at the same time."
1978.77-719,6,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,6315.429,6316.956,If you say then I understand you.
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6324.641,6333.431,That's correct that's I said in response to Mr. Justice Stewart's question and I hope it's a critical part of our argument but not necessarily a precondition to deciding in this respect.
1978.77-719,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6333.431,6335.066,In you they respect of prevail?
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6335.066,6335.493,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-719,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,6335.493,6336.042,Yes.
1978.77-719,6,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6336.042,6348.391,Did Rosado against Wyman articulate the basis for jurisdiction over the statutory claim?
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6348.391,6350.487,I don't believe so.
1978.77-719,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6544.601,6560.218,"So, wouldn't go so far as to say that 1983 reaches all claims under any federal statute that might be fairly said to enforce some constitutional provision?"
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6560.218,6560.552,"No, I think --"
1978.77-719,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6560.552,6564.355,Don't say you have to be enforcing the Civil War Amendments?
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6564.355,6571.888,Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments and I think more doubtful but probably also the Fifteenth Amendment.
1978.77-719,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6571.888,6572.235,"Well, then --"
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6572.235,6572.535,I think --
1978.77-719,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6572.535,6574.26,"You didn't need four, did you?"
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6574.26,6578.14,"Well, there maybe on certainties about the Fifteenth Amendment may have been the reason for four."
1978.77-719,6,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6580.286,6581.512,"Mr. Skillman, --"
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6581.512,6585.132,Inclusive -- puts the phrase including the right to vote.
1978.77-719,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6596.997,6608.345,"Do you think that you -- to have a cause of action to have jurisdiction under 1343(4), do you agree that you must refer in the first place to 1983?"
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6615.559,6623.691,"Well, if your question is, is there any other statute besides 1983 which also might serve that function, I don't know."
1978.77-719,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6626.004,6637.269,"So, do you think in any action under 1343(4) must involve state action?"
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6637.269,6640.892,That's -- that's a good question.
1978.77-719,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6640.892,6643.894,"Well, if you require 1983 it does, doesn't it?"
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6643.894,6645.519,Yes.
1978.77-719,6,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6927.768,6931.75,They don't reply to both class?
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,6931.75,6941.092,"Well, the possible existence of a class is something that I think only emerged at some point beyond the face of the complaint Your Honor."
1978.77-719,6,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,7017.769,7020.152,"Mr. Skillman, before you sit down."
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,7055.2,7058.025,I'm not sure I picked up the full quote Your Honor.
1978.77-719,6,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,7058.025,7072.903,The full quote is that it is of course through that Rosado against Wyman held that suits in federal court under Section 1983 are proper to secure compliance with the provisions of the Social Security Act on the part of the participating states.
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,7093.627,7099.666,"I don't know the exact context and which that sentence appears but on its face, I would have to agree with that."
1978.77-719,6,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,7099.666,7104.393,"So, that one branch of your argument would require the Court to disavow the statement in effect?"
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,7104.393,7109.283,At least that the statement and I don't know if that statement was (Voice Overlap) to the whole decision --
1978.77-719,6,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,7109.283,7115.452,In this decision that or unless it is a correct description of the holding in Rosado that will require.
1978.77-719,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7115.452,7121.118,That brings him -- is it correct description the holding in Rosado?
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,7123.092,7126.571,There was a constitutional claim in Rosado and there was a --
1978.77-719,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7126.571,7134.294,"But you don't think that will makes any difference on this point I gather from what you've said that you still have to inquire about the cause of action, that's right."
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,7134.294,7146.098,"I think that you still have to find a cause of action even though the -- even on dependent claim, you still have to find a cause of action, but I think that that was found in the Social Security Act itself in Rosado."
1978.77-719,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7146.098,7160.733,"Well, but if there's a substantial let's say equal protection claim under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution then clearly under Hagans against Lavine and other cases as you can have pendant statutory claim --"
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,7160.733,7162.544,As to jurisdiction there's no question about that.
1978.77-719,6,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7162.544,7163.35,"Right, no, no --"
1978.77-719,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7163.35,7164.655,That's a question is cause of action --
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,7164.655,7167.809,As to the cause of action there might still be a question about.
1978.77-719,6,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,7167.809,7171.47,"Well, there is really a cause, there really is a question, is there not?"
1978.77-719,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7171.47,7176.498,Hagans and Lavine left that very question open but Rosado didn't apparently know it.
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,7176.498,7184.201,"Well, it didn't address (Voice Overlap) but it silently grant the relief."
1978.77-719,6,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,7184.201,7184.329,Yes.
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,7184.329,7184.816,Correct exactly.
1978.77-719,6,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,7184.816,7188.05,I have to find cause of action some place --
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,7188.05,7211.651,And I would suggest to that it found the cause of action for at least for declaratory injunctive relief in the Social Security Act itself and it certainly become common in the last decade result to imply causes of action from constitutional and statutory provisions Hagans and GI case versus Borack and I can go and I am sure with the considerably law that was not.
1978.77-719,6,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,7211.651,7214.403,Hagans came several years after Rosado?
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,7214.403,7215.531,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-719,6,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7215.531,7219.054,How about Hagans and Edelman?
1978.77-719,6,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,7219.054,7221.268,Same years.
1978.77-719,6,42073,stephen_skillman,,7221.268,7229.709,I think Hagans is later but I won't want to say that with total assurance -- their close in time.
1978.77-719,6,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7231.266,7235.172,"Mr. Young, you have just one minute left if you wish to use that."
1978.77-719,7,21735,david_h_young,,7235.172,7239.501,The jump was from Rosado to Hagans and Hagans noted the question.
1978.77-719,7,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,7305.64,7318.305,But if theoretically answered his argument that it's an act which provides a remedy rather than creating any new rights and therefore it's a statute which secure his rights within the meaning of the jurisdictional claim.
1978.77-719,7,21735,david_h_young,,7318.305,7356.317,"I think that the analysis by Mr. Justice Brennan in gas and I think the analysis from Mr. Justice Ferguson in Price and the analysis by Mr. Justice Stone in Hague versus CIO where they're interpreting very similar language in the criminal conspiracy statutes that is secured by the Constitution and they say we find though circular for the position that the word secured by mean created by rather secured by can embrace both created by, warranted by, finding its manifest in, embrace etcetera and I submit that under that type of analysis it unduly restricts the statute to resist and to limit it only to create."
1978.77-719,7,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7356.317,7364.591,"So, you'd say to put a little different I suppose that a statute creating a new remedy is an example of a statutes securing a right?"
1978.77-719,7,21735,david_h_young,,7364.591,7373.628,Exactly and that's precisely what Congress was attempting to do pursuant to Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment giving to multuity of the historical age.
1978.77-719,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7373.628,7384.195,And do you have to be right on this don't you in order even to support your alternative Supremacy Clause argument?
1978.77-719,7,21735,david_h_young,,7384.195,7393.732,"Yes, I do because of the authorized by law section of 1343(3) as counsel in the previous case stated and I associate myself with his position."
1978.77-719,7,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,7397.362,7397.981,Right.
1978.77-719,7,21735,david_h_young,,7397.981,7400.929,The Supremacy Clause to why there's 1343(3).
1978.77-719,7,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7402.535,7403.264,Thank you gentlemen.
