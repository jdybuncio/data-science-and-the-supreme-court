1982.81-1335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.121,We will hear arguments next in District of Columbia Court of Appeals and others against Feldman and Hickey.
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,74.298,95.806,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, these two cases are here on a single issue, whether the federal courts in the District of Columbia have jurisdiction to review prior decisions of the D.C. Court of Appeals denying applications to the D.C. bar or the D.C. bar examination by particular applicants."
1982.81-1335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,127.044,130.59,Neither of them?
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,132.418,139.056,"--Neither took the bar examination, and neither was a graduate of an ABA approved law school."
1982.81-1335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,139.056,145.678,"So they were, as I understood, the problem is that they were barred from taking the examination."
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,146.647,153.175,"On the circumstances presented to the D.C. Court of Appeals, each one was not permitted to take the D.C. bar examination."
1982.81-1335,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,385.674,395.045,"Mr. Rezneck, do you think your case stands on any different footing than if you were representing the highest court of a state?"
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,395.045,398.716,"Yes, I do, because of the Court Reorganization Act, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.81-1335,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,398.716,401.698,In what respect does it stand on a different footing?
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,401.698,424.784,"I think that considering the history of regulation of the bar in the District, which was originally confided to the U.S. District Court as a court of general jurisdiction, you had a considered judgment by Congress expressed in that statute transferring that jurisdiction to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals as the highest court of the District of Columbia."
1982.81-1335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,467.5,474.294,"Well, suppose before Alaska was admitted to the Union it had the same kind of a problem."
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,489.273,492.318,Then it is a state.
1982.81-1335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,626.31,632.511,"Well, in those days, Mr. Rezneck, there was a Municipal Court which is somewhat like the Superior Court now."
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,633.933,635.011,"No, it was... well--"
1982.81-1335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,635.011,635.777,Somewhat.
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,635.777,638.901,--The Superior Court is a court of general jurisdiction.
1982.81-1335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,638.901,639.057,Yes.
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,639.057,640.462,The Municipal Court was certainly not.
1982.81-1335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,640.462,645.711,"It performed functions somewhat like, but broader."
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,650.756,653.427,There was separate admission to the Municipal Court bar.
1982.81-1335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,654.739,655.611,Did you have to take an examination?
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,655.611,656.283,--No.
1982.81-1335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,670.919,676.307,"And then when the Municipal Court later became the Court of General Sessions, did the same practice prevail?"
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,676.307,678.806,"The same situation prevailed, because that was prior to Court Reorganization."
1982.81-1335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,678.806,681.211,And then it went from the Court of General Sessions to--
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,681.211,687.318,"The Superior Court, and it was then that the Superior Court became a court of general jurisdiction."
1982.81-1335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,690.505,691.38,--Like any other... Like any other state court.
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,691.38,691.911,--Correct.
1982.81-1335,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,705.296,714.09,"Mr. Rezneck, are there any areas at all in which judgments of the D.C. Court of Appeals are reviewable other than in this Court?"
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,714.09,730.083,I think that there may be one provision in the Court Reorganization Act that deals with certain types of criminal cases where you have a joinder of D.C. Code and U.S. Code offenses in the local court system.
1982.81-1335,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,746.046,750.044,"But after that phase-out, judgments of the D.C. Court of Appeals would be reviewable only by this Court?"
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,750.044,750.809,--Only by this Court.
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,796.072,798.712,Did those cases raise Constitutional questions?
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,798.712,799.29,Some did.
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,799.29,811.893,"But is... Is your view that the case turns on the fact that there was an application for the right to take the bar exam, or would it be the same case if they had never applied, and just made an attack on the rule collaterally?"
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,811.893,815.002,"If they had gone into the District Court originally, in the first instance?"
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,815.002,815.314,Yes.
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,828.653,832.651,"Well, you don't, of course, have to reach that question here, because of the case--"
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,832.651,834.229,But I am trying to understand your theory.
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,834.229,835.073,--Right.
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,835.073,843.663,"I mean, is it your view that the jurisdiction is so exclusive that every attack on the rule must be made by seeking admission to the bar?"
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,843.663,851.675,"If we were pressed to take a position on that because the facts required it, I think our position would be that the will of Congress is that exclusive jurisdiction over bar admission should be--"
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,851.675,852.315,Would you limit that--
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,852.315,853.548,--in the D.C. Court of Appeals.
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,853.548,855.767,--Would you limit that contention to the D.C. Court of Appeals?
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,857.469,860.405,"No, because there is no Act of Congress that would govern in such situations."
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,860.405,863.685,And you probably don't think it would be valid as applied to state courts.
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,863.685,870.027,"Well, I haven't had to face that question, and of course it is not necessary to face the question that you put in these cases, because--"
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,870.027,882.351,"Well, the reason it may be is that at least as to one of the applicants, it is not at all clear that he applied for anything other than discretionary relief from the rule as opposed to a holding that the rule was invalid."
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,882.351,883.521,--I think--
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,883.521,888.565,"And if he just asked for discretionary relief, it might be just like a case where he had done nothing."
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,888.565,894.406,"--I think that there are three... I have thought about this, and I think that there are three possible approaches that could be taken, and there are authorities, I think, that support each of them."
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,970.204,976.0,"Under the third view, you wouldn't draw a distinction between a license for a doctor, say, and a license for a lawyer?"
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,976.0,977.17,Not under that third view.
1982.81-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,989.228,998.193,"And what do you say about the, again, on the waiver, that this is just a... I know your rule, but please waive it?"
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1001.895,1013.89,"Well, I don't think that is really an accurate summation of what happened here, because I know that the Respondents here have attempted to avoid the effect of the Summers case--"
1982.81-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1013.89,1014.5,Yes.
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1014.5,1027.541,"--by asserting that all that they were doing was asking for a waiver, and that they were not in any sense making a so-called claim of right which would create a justiciable controversy and lead to a judicial determination."
1982.81-1335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1096.528,1097.747,"Excuse me, Mr. Rezneck."
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1099.777,1100.934,--That is in the Joint Appendix.
1982.81-1335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1100.934,1102.307,"--Oh, in the Joint Appendix."
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1102.307,1103.839,"Right, 20a."
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1149.742,1153.99,"Yes, I know, but he starts his petition by saying he seeks a waiver."
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1153.99,1154.755,Yes--
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1154.755,1158.767,"--and the last line is, for the foregoing compelling reasons, rule so and so should be waived."
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1160.908,1170.233,"--He does, but I don't think that the terminology... I don't think that the terminology of a request for a waiver can be determinative of the question whether the D.C. Court of Appeals made a judicial determination in his case."
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1178.137,1182.073,Do you think there was appellate jurisdiction in this Court to review that determination?
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1185.415,1187.712,Are you speaking of the Hickey case specifically?
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1187.712,1190.553,The one that... Which one is Page 21?
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1191.287,1192.068,That's the Hickey petition.
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1192.068,1192.24,Yes.
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1192.24,1192.818,Right.
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1200.518,1203.813,"But on this petition, they entered an order denying it and saying we refuse to waive the rule."
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1203.813,1203.829,--Right.
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1203.829,1206.969,Is it your view that that was an appealable order in this Court?
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1206.969,1231.412,"Well, I think that the question of this Court's jurisdiction over that kind of decision is, I think, unsettled in the sense that there is no doubt that this Court would have Constitutional... Article III jurisdiction to review it, because it is a matter which arises in the District of Columbia, where all law is federal, and I think that you will find in Justice Marshall's opinion in the Pernall case--"
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1231.412,1236.565,"Well, I don't mean to interrupt, but you say he couldn't bring an independent proceeding in the District Court."
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1236.565,1236.831,--Right.
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1236.831,1239.252,"And I am asking you, did he have any remedy at all?"
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1241.111,1249.108,"I think that he could if there is a question as to whether he explicitly had not raised federal Constitutional questions, assuming that that--"
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1249.108,1250.092,"Well, we've got the petition in front of us."
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1250.092,1250.436,--Right.
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1250.436,1254.011,"As you read the petition, did we have jurisdiction to review the order denying?"
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1254.011,1260.618,I think there is a question on the petition as written as to whether there would be statutory jurisdiction under 1257.
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1260.618,1260.759,So your answer is no.
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1260.759,1262.743,"Your Honor, I think that is an unsettled question."
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1308.662,1322.0,"Well, in other words... I think I understand your... Your position is, his only remedy is by filing in the D.C. Court of Appeals and then direct review here, and at his first opportunity he must raise all the questions he wants to raise, and then we could review them, and he is--"
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1322.0,1323.844,"I don't think it would necessarily be his first opportunity, Your Honor."
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1323.844,1324.469,--You said he bypassed--
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1324.469,1325.17,He could have--
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1325.17,1327.592,"--All he did was ask for a waiver, and he is done now."
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1327.592,1336.963,--He could have gone... He could have gone back and raised any and all federal Constitutional or statutory questions by way of petition for reconsideration after the action of the Court of Appeals in this case.
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1345.646,1347.302,But there would be no... was there a timeliness requirement on that?
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1347.302,1347.834,--No.
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1347.834,1352.988,This is an adjudication that really doesn't bar him from just starting all over again wherever he wanted.
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1352.988,1353.504,That is... That is correct.
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1355.706,1356.331,A rather strange case of adjudication.
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1356.331,1370.622,"--We took the position in the District Court, Your Honor, that if Mr. Hickey wants to renew this process and apply for a waiver and raise any and all of those questions now, he is free to do that in the D.C. Court of Appeals now and the court will hear him."
1982.81-1335,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1370.622,1389.082,"Mr. Rezneck, it seems to me I have seen perhaps in some New York proceedings, if someone is dissatisfied with what might be classified as an administrative action of the New York Court of Appeals, they apparently have a right to bring an action in the Supreme Court of New York, which is obviously subsidiary to the Court of Appeals."
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1395.845,1411.933,I think one... I suppose one could presuppose or postulate that you could... you could have formulated an action perhaps against the admissions committee in the Superior Court.
1982.81-1335,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1428.659,1444.435,And it is that statute that confides the jurisdiction or the responsibility for admission to the bar to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals that you rely on to say that the... that Court of Appeals is in a different position here than the highest court of the state?
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1444.435,1458.57,"Well, I rely on it as making a Congressional allocation of jurisdiction between local and federal courts which has no counterpart in any federal statute applying elsewhere in the United States."
1982.81-1335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1458.57,1468.66,"Well, if you were representing the state of New Jersey in the same set of facts, would you be making different arguments, except that you think you have an additional argument?"
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1468.66,1469.472,I would... That is correct.
1982.81-1335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1496.289,1505.222,Is that the case in which there is some suggestion that there is the risk that the federal courts would become superboards of law examiners?
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1506.691,1544.489,"Well, there is a lot of language in these cases, and I may say, if I might speak to that point, that... because I think it does give some additional strength here to the idea that it is entirely rational to construe the Congressional purpose here as conferring this jurisdiction exclusively on the court, on the D.C. Court of Appeals, that we are dealing here with judges who, although Article I judges, admittedly, are nevertheless nominated by the President, are confirmed by the Senate of the United States, are used to dealing with questions of federal Constitutional and statutory law as their daily staple."
1982.81-1335,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1569.745,1589.438,"Well, Mr. Rezneck, what if I went before the... or what if my wife, assuming she were admitted to the bar, went before the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and applied for admission to that court, saying that she was admitted to practice in the state of Arizona, the district of Arizona, and the Ninth Circuit says, no, we don't admit women to practice here?"
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1593.858,1596.936,--If the... If that was the decision of the Ninth Circuit?
1982.81-1335,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1596.936,1597.436,Yes.
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1597.436,1601.621,"Well, I would think she would have a petition for certiorari in this Court."
1982.81-1335,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1601.621,1607.339,And that that would be a case in the Court of Appeals within our jurisdiction?
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1607.339,1610.712,"Yes, that would, it seems to me, be a clear Constitutional violation by the Ninth Circuit."
1982.81-1335,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1610.712,1624.988,"Well, I assume it would be, and I assume that Respondents here are claiming that there was a clear Constitutional violation, and your answer isn't that there wasn't a violation, but that whatever the case with respect to that may be, there is no remedy."
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1624.988,1651.399,"No, I think that... the case that you put is really an... is in the sense that you have the judicial determination by the Ninth Circuit acting in a judicial capacity which would be reviewable in this Court on writ of certiorari, just as here it is our position that you had a judicial determination by the D.C. Court of Appeals acting in a judicial capacity which was reviewable by this Court, but not in a lower Federal District Court."
1982.81-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1655.584,1663.238,"Well, we wouldn't... if the Constitutional issues weren't raised, we normally wouldn't review those issues."
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1663.238,1670.639,You are speaking on review of the D.C. Court of Appeals decision.
1982.81-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1670.639,1670.967,Yes.
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1670.967,1682.494,"Well, again, I think that really goes to a question which has not ever been settled in the District of Columbia, because as Justice Marshall's opinion which I referred to in Pernall--"
1982.81-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1682.494,1690.039,"I know he could have raised them, and I know your position is that whether he raised them or not, the federal court has no role in this matter at all."
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1690.039,1690.696,--That is correct.
1982.81-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1690.696,1706.048,"But until he does raise those issues, at least some federal issue, some federal... is the decision reviewable here, other than... just other than the refusal to waive?"
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1706.048,1713.014,"It may be reviewable as a decision on federal law, all of which decisions are ultimately reviewable here."
1982.81-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1713.014,1714.733,"Well, I know, but it wouldn't include Constitutional issues."
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1714.733,1716.262,"Yes, it--"
1982.81-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1716.262,1717.09,If he didn't raise them.
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1717.09,1729.383,"--If in fact he didn't raise them, that would pose a question, but he pleaded the facts which would support the very Constitutional claim that he articulated as a Constitutional claim when he got to the District Court."
1982.81-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1729.383,1736.332,We normally require something more than a record that... on the basis of which a Constitutional issue could have been raised.
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1736.332,1748.156,"I think my point would be that with respect to the question here, which is the allocation of jurisdiction between the D.C. Court of Appeals and the Federal District Court, that if he could have raised those questions--"
1982.81-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1748.156,1748.594,Right.
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1748.594,1753.7,"--in the D.C. Court of Appeals, and obtained a full and fair hearing of them, and there is no contention to the contrary--"
1982.81-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1753.7,1755.559,Then he could never go to the federal court.
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1755.559,1759.541,--that he cannot go to the Federal District Court under the scheme that is in effect in the District of Columbia.
1982.81-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1760.103,1763.853,And he couldn't go there in the first instance without going to the--
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1763.853,1769.288,"We don't have to reach that point, but if forced to it, that would also be our position."
1982.81-1335,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1769.288,1769.85,"--Well, the same rule."
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1769.85,1779.721,"But I emphasize that he is entirely free to seek to raise those questions now if he chooses to do so, assuming he did not do so before, and of course I am only referring to Mr. Hickey in this regard."
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1787.843,1791.122,What if he has to raise factual questions to make out his Constitutional claim?
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1800.056,1803.008,"Well, of course, we don't have anything like that here."
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1803.008,1803.867,"No, but I mean, I am just asking you."
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1806.617,1815.955,"I think that... I think that the state court system, at least in the first instance, subject to review by this Court, would provide the factfinding mechanism by which such a question would be adjudicated."
1982.81-1335,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1832.622,1834.542,That is kind of an exhaustion requirement.
1982.81-1335,0,21410,daniel_a_rezneck,,1834.542,1838.962,"We are not disputing that proposition at all, but again, that doesn't arise in this case."
1982.81-1335,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1841.821,1842.336,Very well.
1982.81-1335,1,40415,robert_m_sussman,,1845.944,1847.881,Thank you.
1982.81-1335,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1910.199,1913.729,Must all jurisdictions have the same patterns?
1982.81-1335,1,40415,robert_m_sussman,,1921.851,1922.757,--No.
1982.81-1335,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1934.018,1939.781,"Well, you need not spend your time establishing that there are other ways to learn the law."
1982.81-1335,1,40415,robert_m_sussman,,1948.636,1965.88,"--Well, I think the issue here, Your Honor, is the jurisdiction of the District Court to hear a Constitutional challenge to the requirements for bar admission in the District of Columbia."
1982.81-1335,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2187.619,2202.675,"Well, now that you are here, are you in the position of saying that this Court sits to review the exercise of discretion by 51 or two or three, depending on how you count Puerto Rico--"
1982.81-1335,1,40415,robert_m_sussman,,2202.675,2231.195,"No, I... Your Honor, I don't think that this Court sits to review the exercise of discretion by state court systems, but I do think that this Court and the lower federal courts sit to enforce Constitutional rights in cases where Constitutional issues have been properly raised, and--"
1982.81-1335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2231.195,2233.523,"--Well, you don't think this case is properly here, I would think."
1982.81-1335,1,40415,robert_m_sussman,,2233.523,2239.317,"--Well, I think it is here on appeal from the decision of the D.C.--"
1982.81-1335,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2239.317,2239.831,"You didn't come here, anyway."
1982.81-1335,1,40415,robert_m_sussman,,2239.831,2242.206,"--Well, that's right."
1982.81-1335,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2285.517,2307.117,"Would you think that the rule, whatever the rule is, should be the same for a jurisdiction which would not permit a person to sit for examinations to be... to practice medicine unless they had graduated from a school, a medical school accredited by the American Medical Association or some other such body?"
1982.81-1335,1,40415,robert_m_sussman,,2307.117,2355.706,"Well, I think that on the merits, there are certain Constitutional principles which should be applied to all accreditation schemes, whether they are schemes involving the practice of medicine, the practice of law, or the practice of any other profession, and I think that it would be anomalous if the federal courts, lower federal courts were free to entertain Constitutional claims involving the legality of a state's accreditation scheme for medicine but not to entertain exactly the same claims when they arise in connection with admission to the bar."
1982.81-1335,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2364.469,2368.655,"Counsel, are you arguing that there is a Constitutional right to a waiver?"
1982.81-1335,1,40415,robert_m_sussman,,2368.655,2370.186,--No.
1982.81-1335,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2371.919,2373.966,"Well, how else could you get here?"
1982.81-1335,1,40415,robert_m_sussman,,2373.966,2383.525,"You mean, how else could we get to the Court on an appeal from a decision of the--"
1982.81-1335,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2383.525,2384.462,"Well, could you get to any court?"
1982.81-1335,1,40415,robert_m_sussman,,2384.462,2411.826,"--I think the Constitutional claim that we asserted in the... in the District Court and in our complaint is not that there is a Constitutional right to a waiver, but that Rule 46, both on its face and as administered over a period of time by the D.C. Court of Appeals was unconstitutional."
1982.81-1335,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2418.948,2422.447,"Well, you did, didn't you, petition and ask them to waive?"
1982.81-1335,1,40415,robert_m_sussman,,2422.447,2430.038,"--We did but we didn't request that as a matter of Constitutional right, and indeed that is the very point that we are making."
1982.81-1335,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2430.038,2433.004,"Well, what right did you have to ask them for a waiver?"
1982.81-1335,1,40415,robert_m_sussman,,2433.004,2435.676,I think that is precisely the issue.
1982.81-1335,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2451.622,2459.587,It is really a different claim that you presented to the United States District Court than was presented to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
1982.81-1335,1,40415,robert_m_sussman,,2459.587,2461.994,"--Oh, I think it is a very different claim, and--"
1982.81-1335,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2461.994,2472.802,Why shouldn't you at least have gone to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals with your Constitutional claim as a matter of exhaustion before you went to the District Court?
1982.81-1335,1,40415,robert_m_sussman,,2472.802,2490.653,"--Well, Justice Rehnquist, I think that the decisions of this Court have recognized that where a litigant is attempting to raise a Constitutional issue, the litigant has a choice of forum."
1982.81-1335,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2500.072,2501.664,Are those 1983 cases?
1982.81-1335,1,40415,robert_m_sussman,,2501.664,2506.46,"Well, Monroe v. Pape is one of those cases."
1982.81-1335,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2524.857,2531.198,What authority do you have other than 1983 claims that there is no principle of exhaustion available here?
1982.81-1335,1,40415,robert_m_sussman,,2535.198,2561.812,"Well, the cases that we have cited in our... in our brief are 1983 cases, but I would say beyond that that the exhaustion requirement as I have always understood it is a requirement in most cases to exhaust administrative remedies."
1982.81-1335,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2608.073,2613.15,But even if the decision-maker is the highest court of the District of Columbia?
1982.81-1335,1,40415,robert_m_sussman,,2613.15,2619.491,"--Even if the decision-maker is the highest court of the District of Columbia, I would--"
1982.81-1335,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2619.491,2641.796,"Hasn't the reason for saying on occasion that you don't have to raise Constitutional issues before an administrative tribunal is that typically such a tribunal may be made up of an engineer and a doctor and an architect, who probably don't have too much expertise in Constitutional questions, but I wouldn't think that would apply where the administrator is a court."
1982.81-1335,1,40415,robert_m_sussman,,2641.796,2657.663,"--Well, Your Honor, if I can respectfully disagree, I think that in the absence of strong countervailing policy considerations, a litigant is entitled to litigate Constitutional issues in the federal court."
1982.81-1335,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2721.185,2723.528,No one likes to sue to be admitted to the bar.
1982.81-1335,1,40415,robert_m_sussman,,2723.528,2724.888,"--Well, that's right."
1982.81-1335,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2749.392,2757.218,"Well, there is some suggestion, at least, that Feldman raised his Constitutional issue with the D.C. Court of Appeals."
1982.81-1335,1,40415,robert_m_sussman,,2757.218,2769.742,"Your Honor, I think that we advised the D.C. Court of Appeals that we were contemplating raising Constitutional issues."
1982.81-1335,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2830.609,2839.262,"Well, we now have a problem, I suppose, of splitting a cause of action, possibly, and neither of the federal courts ruled on that issue, did they?"
1982.81-1335,1,40415,robert_m_sussman,,2839.262,2858.239,"--That's right, neither of the courts ruled on that issue, but I don't think that that is an issue which one has to decide if the Court concludes that the petition was merely administrative in character."
1982.81-1335,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2859.269,2876.497,"Well, if the Court were to conclude that your filing was judicial in character initially, then presumably we would be faced with what to do with the splitting of the cause of action or the res judicata problem."
1982.81-1335,1,40415,robert_m_sussman,,2880.386,2893.819,"--Well, I think you are right, if you conclude that the petition sought judicial action, the issues remaining are res judicata issues."
1982.81-1335,2,36003,michael_f_healy,,3075.151,3095.909,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, we requested the opportunity to present a brief argument this afternoon on behalf of Mr. Hickey because of certain important distinctions between Mr. Hickey's case and that of Mr. Feldman."
1982.81-1335,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3276.413,3276.804,"Well, there is dispute about that."
1982.81-1335,2,36003,michael_f_healy,,3276.804,3277.96,Mr. Rezneck--
1982.81-1335,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3277.96,3289.049,"I understood Mr. Rezneck to say that the federal court has no role at all, that if you want to challenge these rules, you go to the D.C. Court of Appeals, period."
1982.81-1335,2,36003,michael_f_healy,,3289.049,3292.736,"--Mr. Rezneck, when pressed this afternoon, Justice White, did say that."
1982.81-1335,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3295.594,3299.405,"Well, I know, but don't say there isn't a dispute about it, because he has just made the dispute--"
1982.81-1335,2,36003,michael_f_healy,,3299.405,3303.918,"Your Honor, let me say there should be no dispute."
1982.81-1335,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3313.602,3321.113,--There is no other situation that has the statute that Mr. Rezneck claims makes a special case out of the District.
1982.81-1335,2,36003,michael_f_healy,,3321.113,3326.831,"--Your Honor, I think that contention is respectfully without merit."
1982.81-1335,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3382.636,3390.336,Supposing Mr. Hickey had gone in the first instance to the District Court without ever having gone to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
1982.81-1335,2,36003,michael_f_healy,,3407.095,3417.889,"Your Honor, you might have a question of standing at that point, and in fact in the District Court counsel for petitioners argued that because we had not made a formal application after having been denied the waiver, that we didn't have standing."
1982.81-1335,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3426.792,3427.839,Why did you have standing?
1982.81-1335,2,36003,michael_f_healy,,3432.757,3442.145,"We had... as the D.C. Circuit found, Mr. Hickey in his petition acknowledged that the rule applied to him, and would on its face have barred him from sitting for the bar examination."
1982.81-1335,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3452.124,3455.983,But they didn't interpret it as having requested admission to the bar.
1982.81-1335,2,36003,michael_f_healy,,3455.983,3458.903,Not a claim of right to admission to the bar.
1982.81-1335,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3491.374,3499.402,"Wasn't the Court of Appeals, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals judgment or its order... it says, you are not entitled to admission."
1982.81-1335,2,36003,michael_f_healy,,3499.402,3502.729,--It says that a petition for waiver will not be granted.
1982.81-1335,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3502.729,3505.54,"Yes, and this rule keeps you out."
1982.81-1335,2,36003,michael_f_healy,,3505.54,3506.837,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-1335,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3513.739,3524.001,"Well, Ex Parte Garland says that it is a judicial action, doesn't it, the exclusion of attorneys from the bar is an exercise of judicial power."
1982.81-1335,2,36003,michael_f_healy,,3524.001,3530.124,"--Justice O'Connor, I would respectfully submit that there is a difference between judicial power and a judicial act."
1982.81-1335,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3564.437,3570.06,The District of Columbia Court of Appeals certainly said this rule is sufficient to keep you out.
1982.81-1335,2,36003,michael_f_healy,,3570.06,3582.211,"Yes, Your Honor, it did, and what we then did in Federal District Court was to contend that the rules were unconstitutional on their face and as applied."
1982.81-1335,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3582.211,3586.819,"And if that had been by a state court, you would have had a right to go into the Federal District Court."
1982.81-1335,2,36003,michael_f_healy,,3587.662,3588.225,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-1335,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3588.225,3591.098,"Now, where is that case?"
1982.81-1335,2,36003,michael_f_healy,,3593.879,3596.8,In the state court situation?
1982.81-1335,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3596.8,3604.781,"That the highest court of the state rules against you, and that gives you a right of action in the district court of that state."
1982.81-1335,2,36003,michael_f_healy,,3604.781,3620.664,"The Ktsanes court, the Seventh Circuit decision... it is K-t-s-a-n-e-s... said that an application for a waiver from the court's rules does not become a judicial act within the meaning of Summers, and that one has the right subsequently to go to federal court."
1982.81-1335,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3620.664,3621.446,I didn't say waiver or anything.
1982.81-1335,2,36003,michael_f_healy,,3638.47,3638.939,"Yes, sir."
