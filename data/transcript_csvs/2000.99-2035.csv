2000.99-2035,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.367,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Number 99-2035, Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Group."
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,11.15,14.222,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court--"
2000.99-2035,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,100.441,123.155,"Mr. Reynolds, when you have a standard, what should I say, so wildly extreme, as wildly disproportionate, does it make any difference... does it really... do you really think it makes any difference whether you're reviewing the lower court for a... de novo, or for abuse of discretion?"
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,154.426,162.121,"Well, Your Honor, I think that you certainly could come to the same conclusion under both standards, but the--"
2000.99-2035,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,162.121,168.396,"Well, the point is, wouldn't you almost... wouldn't you virtually always come to the same conclusion under both standards?"
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,168.396,177.382,"--I don't know that you would, and I think that the reason de novo review is important is that you have a legal issue here."
2000.99-2035,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,196.394,209.362,"Well, do you have much doubt, Mr. Reynolds, that if the standard is de novo review, there will be more determinations of lower... of the district court, trial court upset than if there's abuse of discretion review?"
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,209.362,217.039,"I believe there probably would be more awards that would be upset, or there would be more remittitur decisions."
2000.99-2035,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,217.039,220.732,"More law would develop in the courts of appeals, presumably."
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,220.732,227.354,"That's exactly the point I was trying to make, that I do think that you would get a more coherent body of law."
2000.99-2035,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,245.446,250.35,"Mr. Reynolds, is this a mixed question of fact and law that we're talking about?"
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,250.35,268.563,"--Justice O'Connor, I think that it could be characterized as a mixed question of fact and law in that, as I understand what that means, it means that if you have established facts, and you're applying a legal principle to those facts, that would be a mixed question of fact and law."
2000.99-2035,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,268.563,280.989,"For instance, in the first prong, the reprehensible conduct, presumably a review of the facts is included in the appellate review, so you do seem to have a mixed standard--"
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,280.989,282.111,"Well, to some--"
2000.99-2035,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,282.111,282.682,--mixed question.
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,282.682,284.552,"--Excuse me, Your Honor."
2000.99-2035,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,321.781,334.808,"On the reprehensibility of the conduct, do you envisage that if you prevail the circuit court will have some sort of standards for reprehensibility, or how will it go about writing this?"
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,334.808,335.879,Well--
2000.99-2035,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,335.879,348.91,"I could see if it was abuse of discretion, I can hear the circuit court saying, well, trial judges see the witness, and they heard the whole trial, and they're in the position to make this judgment, and we're not going to second guess them."
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,361.738,361.959,--I--
2000.99-2035,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,361.959,362.71,Under your view?
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,362.71,379.202,"--As I understand it, Your Honor, the court of appeals would basically take the conduct and, on the established record, that would be the baseline, if you will, for its comparative analysis under the Gore factors."
2000.99-2035,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,401.775,419.778,"Mr. Reynolds, may I interrupt you at that point, because what you described sounded very much to me like what a jury does when it's choosing among negligence degrees of culpability, negligence, gross negligence, recklessness."
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,434.999,445.894,"Well, Your Honor, here the... we are over a threshold of malice that is necessary in order to award a punitive award."
2000.99-2035,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,445.894,449.186,Just like you would be over a threshold if you decide there's negligence.
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,455.722,488.173,"Right, but I think what the Court has said in BMW v. Gore is that you are going to determine whether or not the punishment that is imposed here is reasonably related to the crime, and whether it rationally serves the interest of punishment and deterrence, and that is an analysis, a legal analysis that looks to this conduct as compared to similar conduct and the way in which that has been treated in the punishment arena, and in other situations."
2000.99-2035,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,488.173,501.521,Could you describe the precise test that the court of appeals would be applying under your standard as compared with the precise test that would apply under an arbitrary and capricious standard?
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,523.025,524.739,I think that that would--
2000.99-2035,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,524.739,525.219,Okay.
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,525.219,526.588,"--I don't quarrel with that, Your Honor."
2000.99-2035,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,526.588,544.41,"Now, if you're using an abuse of discretion standard, you would be asking whether any reasonable judge, whether no reasonable judge could think that any reasonable person would consider this proportionate."
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,548.303,549.212,"Well, Your Honor, I--"
2000.99-2035,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,549.212,553.847,I... it's just too subtle for me to understand the difference between the two.
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,553.847,564.934,"--I think that there is a substantive standard that has been announced as being applicable in BMW v. Gore, and we're not going back and suggesting we revisit that."
2000.99-2035,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,608.514,626.966,"I understand that, but it seems to me that whenever a court of appeals finds that no reasonable person could possibly consider this proportionate, so it is wildly disproportionate, it would automatically find that no reasonable judge could have thought that a reasonable person would find this proportionate."
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,629.527,629.878,"Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-2035,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,629.898,633.012,"--without automatically making the other one, so what are we arguing about?"
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,633.012,648.001,"--I don't disagree that where you have a punitive award that is so over the line that everybody agrees that it would be unconstitutional, that whichever standard you apply would probably give you the same result."
2000.99-2035,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,680.902,697.834,"Whatever word you use to describe it, I take it that what you're essentially asking is to have the judge, as a panel of three judges, sit as though they were jurors, as though they were jurors making a determination of reprehensibility."
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,697.834,707.001,As though they were jurors in making the policy judgment as to what the appropriate punishment is in order to fulfill the goals of deterrence and retribution.
2000.99-2035,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,707.001,717.86,"And then if we go back in history, punitive damages, I believe, was considered in the bailiwick of the jury, and not the judge."
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,725.765,756.565,"Well, I believe it's clear that you could have a court overturn a verdict if, indeed, it was a verdict that was outrageously excessive, or, as they said in the early cases, driven by juror bias or passion, and was not proportional to the offense, and I believe the common law, as well as the early American law, has said that punitive damages would certainly be reviewable in that regard, as would compensatory, so I think--"
2000.99-2035,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,756.565,757.354,Mr. Reynolds--
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,757.354,758.225,--appellate review is available.
2000.99-2035,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,758.225,765.722,"--I'm not certain of that, and I think that, at least as to compensatory damages, there was some disagreement on this Court whether there was any allowance of--"
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,765.722,766.34,Right.
2000.99-2035,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,766.34,767.622,--appellate review at all.
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,769.362,770.904,I understand--
2000.99-2035,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,770.904,771.395,--on that question.
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,771.395,777.059,--but I believe in Gasperini you said that there was appellate review.
2000.99-2035,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,777.059,792.998,"Would you argue, Mr. Reynolds, different principles to... and different propositions to the circuit court than you would to the jury, or do you just argue the same thing?"
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,792.998,815.564,"I think that the... well, the arguments to the jury in this regard would depend in large part on the instructions that were given to the jury, and I think there are some instructions that would be very problematic to give the jury in terms of the BMW v. Gore guideposts, so--"
2000.99-2035,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,815.564,815.845,Mr.--
2000.99-2035,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,815.845,817.643,--So that the court of appeals--
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,817.643,817.863,--I don't think the jury would have the same--
2000.99-2035,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,817.863,825.821,"--does consider different propositions, i.e., comparative awards and similar cases in other parts of the country, or something like that?"
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,825.821,827.06,--I think that's right.
2000.99-2035,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,860.933,861.744,Mr. Reynolds--
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,861.744,868.369,"It is a check, if you will, at the appellate level on the jury judgment call."
2000.99-2035,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,868.369,884.921,"--So if that's true, then Justice Scalia's proposition that no reasonable juror could find the award doesn't quite work, because you're putting forth different contentions to the two different bodies."
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,890.946,891.504,I--
2000.99-2035,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,891.504,907.215,"--that this is inconsistent with what other juries and judges have done around the country and therefore just doesn't meet the standard of proportionality under some Nation wide proportionality standard that the jury didn't hear about, or is the answer that the jury can hear about this stuff?"
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,907.215,916.311,--I think that certainly there are special instructions that could help to inform the jury's decision that we would not be at all adverse to giving.
2000.99-2035,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,929.321,932.543,"Mr. Reynolds, you're looking over one important player."
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,963.034,978.976,"--That's correct, and I think that as we were saying, Justice Ginsburg, the court of appeals would, in that instance, do the traditional deferential review of the historical facts, or the fact questions, but as to this legal question it would be a de novo review."
2000.99-2035,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,978.976,984.892,"Mr. Reynolds, let me ask you if I am understanding your argument correctly in this respect."
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1100.219,1102.72,"That is fair, Justice Breyer."
2000.99-2035,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1108.176,1108.527,--I agree.
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1108.757,1113.22,--My argument that the de novo review is in and of itself--
2000.99-2035,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1113.22,1122.476,"But the value is not only in the substantive standard, the value is in the application of that standard in sort of developed appellate discussions."
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1122.476,1127.0,"--I think that's right, especially in light of the recent decision in BMW v. Gore."
2000.99-2035,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1127.0,1129.341,"May I ask you a question, Mr. Reynolds?"
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1173.701,1182.367,"I know you're not going to like this answer, because I think that what I would say is, the court of appeals probably could take either approach."
2000.99-2035,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1207.056,1209.908,"Mr. Reynolds, is it settled--"
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1209.908,1211.61,--I have a specific response one way or the other on that.
2000.99-2035,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1211.61,1213.832,--Is it settled that a court of appeals could order a remittitur?
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1216.382,1216.652,I--
2000.99-2035,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1216.652,1217.924,I thought that was an open question.
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1217.924,1225.759,"--Well, I... as I said to Justice Stevens, I'm not sure I can say it's settled, so I think that my sense is that they could do either one."
2000.99-2035,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1246.495,1248.318,But we... this Court has never ruled on that question--
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1248.318,1249.189,--No.
2000.99-2035,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1249.189,1249.908,--and it's in the background.
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1257.074,1257.795,Well--
2000.99-2035,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1257.795,1264.317,--Can instruct the entry of a final judgment that's different from the number that the jury came in?
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1264.317,1280.558,"--Your Honor, I think that the Seventh Amendment Reexamination Clause would not inhibit a court of appeals from directing the maximum amount, and I say that because we're in an area where we aren't concerned with facts tried to the jury."
2000.99-2035,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1302.233,1304.163,"Mr. Reynolds, this problem exists no matter how we come out in this case, doesn't it?"
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1304.163,1304.354,I--
2000.99-2035,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1304.354,1305.315,What relevance does this have to this case?
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1318.014,1320.926,--I think that you would have the same--
2000.99-2035,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1320.926,1327.13,"I mean, whatever standard you're going to use, if you decide that the district court got it wrong, you're going to be confronted with this issue--"
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1327.13,1328.168,--I--
2000.99-2035,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1328.168,1340.778,"--so it seems to me it has nothing to do with what we're wrestling with, but what I would like to know is why you think that a court of appeals would not be developing law if it's only applying the abuse of discretion standard."
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1342.629,1344.812,--I would--
2000.99-2035,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1344.812,1350.755,"--and the written opinion would say, you know, no reasonable judge could consider that this was not wildly disproportionate?"
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1352.216,1373.049,"--I believe the kind of opinion you're likely to get is what we got in this case, where the Ninth Circuit simply says they do not believe that the district court abused discretion, and it would not provide any enlightenment, or any kind of coherent... doctrinal coherence to the BMW v. Gore factors in an application of that."
2000.99-2035,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1373.049,1377.713,"So what you want is not... I mean, I can't... I'm having trouble seeing what the difference is between the standards."
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1384.846,1386.238,This is a Federal case.
2000.99-2035,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1386.238,1391.782,So they're already reviewing for abuse of discretion under Rule 59 the decision not to give a new trial on the issue.
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1391.782,1392.912,That's correct.
2000.99-2035,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1392.912,1393.372,All right.
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1466.254,1467.724,I--
2000.99-2035,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1467.724,1474.95,"The people who want a tough review say, de novo, the people who want a weak review say, abuse of discretion, but those are slogans."
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1478.953,1488.097,"--I think as the judge would act it is as you describe, but I do think it certainly does make a difference what standard you are imposing."
2000.99-2035,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1488.097,1488.397,"Well, all right."
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1504.919,1511.013,Well--
2000.99-2035,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1592.739,1597.281,Isn't it always an abuse of discretion when the trial court makes an error of law?
2000.99-2035,0,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,1597.281,1629.292,"I think when the trial court makes an error of law, that it would certainly be an abuse of discretion, but I also would say that I think the standard we use here is one that is compelled by the nature of the inquiry and the fact that it's constitutional, and by the Gore guideposts, and the comparative analysis which are extrinsic to the historical fact record, and that's what requires that there be a de novo review."
2000.99-2035,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1633.596,1634.056,"Very well, Mr. Reynolds."
2000.99-2035,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1636.298,1643.534,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2000.99-2035,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1680.87,1689.285,"What do we do generally, if you look at our precedents, on mixed questions of fact and law on appellate review?"
2000.99-2035,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1696.371,1711.721,"--Well, we believe that reasonableness is maybe a close analogy, because the touchstone of excessiveness is, of course, reasonableness, and it is the sort of grossly excessive standard that Justice Scalia has referred to, and in many contexts reasonableness--"
2000.99-2035,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1711.721,1729.413,"Well, but there is more than one question under the Gore standard, in addition to reprehensibility, the ratio between compensatory and punitive damages awarded, and how the award compares to other sanctions available for comparable misconduct."
2000.99-2035,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1745.421,1747.283,"--Well, it's done both, Your Honor."
2000.99-2035,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1786.289,1801.75,"I couldn't find any except the ones... I just had to look this up for another reason, and Justice Ginsburg has a couple in an opinion she wrote, but the case... I mean, this seems not a question of mixed fact and law, but up to a certain point you decide what the facts are."
2000.99-2035,1,31723,jonathan_s_massey,,1840.246,1840.736,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2000.99-2035,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1840.736,1841.067,All right.

2000.99-2035,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3268.782,3277.698,"Excuse me, doesn't pain and suffering come into a Gasperini calculation sometimes, or often?"
2000.99-2035,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3277.698,3280.941,--But again it goes to the compensation in the compensatory award.
2000.99-2035,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3284.443,3285.034,"Yes, but it's... I understand."
2000.99-2035,2,45975,william_bradford_reynolds,,3291.85,3301.517,"--The calculation, I would submit, Mr. Justice Scalia, is on the side of the fact finding, the historical facts, and what the harm is to the injured party."
2000.99-2035,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3376.568,3380.568,"Thank you, Mr. Reynolds. The case is submitted."
