1970.420,0,22220,eugene_a_epting,,47.883,53.322,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1970.420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,296.042,298.682,And the Board here decided to do it?
1970.420,0,22220,eugene_a_epting,,298.682,302.343,"The Board here decided to -- well, let's put it this way."
1970.420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,313.341,314.783,But you weren't under an order?
1970.420,0,22220,eugene_a_epting,,314.783,318.103,We were not under an order and we didn’t want to get under an order.
1970.420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,318.103,331.564,"And you [Laughter] -- so, does this case pose the question I asked the counsel who just --"
1970.420,0,22220,eugene_a_epting,,331.564,335.683,It’s strikingly similar except they’re talking about a statutory --
1970.420,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,335.683,337.963,"I mean, in terms of the power of the board on its own to do something?"
1970.420,0,22220,eugene_a_epting,,337.963,340.165,"Yes sir, yes sir."
1970.420,1,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1526.096,1529.443,Mr. Chief Justice and if it please the Court.
1970.420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1873.048,1893.967,"Yes, but the HEW makes it pursuant to its statutory authority and that statute have to be valid, and you just -- you really changed the question whether the school boards can do it, as to whether Congress can do it?"
1970.420,1,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1893.967,1900.925,"If HEW’s action is valid, of course that would be true, but we deny that HEW’s action is valid."
1970.420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1900.925,1924.362,"Yes, and you say that no governmental authority may decide that for educational reasons, we want educate blacks and whites together and therefore we will not send them to the same neighborhood schools that we used to?"
1970.420,1,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1924.362,1926.065,"Before Brown, yes."
1970.420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1934.608,1936.638,"Oh, yes I think it is."
1970.420,1,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1945.976,1954.071,I thought I understood the Justice to propose a question whereby the Board voluntarily and without compulsion elected to --
1970.420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1954.071,1971.343,"But let's concede for the moment that your board did act under compulsion of HEW. Let’s assume that an HEW action is valid, action under the statute that was operating in."
1970.420,1,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1971.343,1973.774,You assume my case then.
1970.420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1973.774,1977.736,"Well, no because that you would say the statute is unconstitutional?"
1970.420,1,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1977.736,1978.829,I beg your pardon.
1970.420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1978.829,1980.645,You would say that statute is unconstitutional.
1970.420,1,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,1980.645,1981.972,Correct.
1970.420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1989.773,1990.703,"Oh, no."
1970.420,1,22691,e_freeman_leverett,,2009.563,2011.833,I would answer your question this way Mr. Justice White.
1970.420,2,22220,eugene_a_epting,,3499.908,3505.487,"Excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice I am about used it and I think I have said all I need to say."
