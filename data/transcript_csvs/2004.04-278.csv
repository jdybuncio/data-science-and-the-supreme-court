2004.04-278,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.252,"We'll hear argument on number 04-278, the Town of Castle Rock versus Jessica Gonzales."
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,10.639,13.69,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2004.04-278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,42.842,50.863,Tell us how we know exactly how much discretion the State of Colorado wanted to give to the police.
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,50.863,52.335,"Well, Justice O'Connor--"
2004.04-278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,52.335,57.076,Without a statute that uses the word shall enforce.
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,62.03,76.158,"--Well, they have in other cases, as we note in our brief, that the word shall is not always mandatory, particularly here, I think, Justice O'Connor, when we have such a backdrop of law enforcement discretion."
2004.04-278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,76.158,81.539,"Well, are there Colorado cases that tell us how we should read those statutes?"
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,81.539,83.623,Not in particular on this statute.
2004.04-278,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,95.318,101.585,"So do you concede that if shall means shall, that it creates a property interest?"
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,101.585,102.945,"No, Justice Scalia, I do not."
2004.04-278,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,120.219,130.005,"Mr. Eastman, would you comment on the extent of deference that we should give to the court of appeals' interpretation of Colorado while in view of what we said in Bishop against Wood?"
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,130.005,134.959,"--Yes, I don't think here, because it's not just an application of Colorado law here."
2004.04-278,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,140.483,151.762,"But the Colorado statute is the one that's controlling in this case and normally, at least according to Bishop against Wood, we defer to the interpretation of the court of appeals as the issue of state law."
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,151.762,166.492,"--Well, what you're asking is that the court of appeals that created... that read this statute shall, without any Colorado court interpretation, and did so without any greater indication from the Colorado legislature, that it intended more than just to give direction to police."
2004.04-278,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,177.644,181.532,"Of course, that's the issue, whether Colorado intended to create it."
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,181.532,183.542,"Well, but I think there is a big difference."
2004.04-278,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,183.744,191.887,"The reading in Bishop against Wood was really counterintuitive also, as the dissenters pointed out, as you would agree, I think."
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,191.887,205.333,"--Yes, and I think when you're looking at a statute such as this, that is invoking the federal court's... I mean, what we're using is a state law to invoke federal protections."
2004.04-278,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,216.899,225.474,Did you suggest to the federal court that it certify the question of the meaning of Colorado law to this Colorado Supreme Court?
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,225.474,230.306,"No, we did not, because I don't think the statute gets us over the hurdle to make that even necessary."
2004.04-278,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,241.308,242.118,"Wait, wait."
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,258.341,259.829,"--No, Justice Scalia, I don't."
2004.04-278,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,259.829,262.31,You don't concede that that's a state question at all?
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,262.31,262.897,No.
2004.04-278,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,265.275,267.221,"Well, isn't that what we squarely held in Bishop?"
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,267.221,275.844,"--Well, what we have to look at is whether, first, the state, under Roth, intended to create a property interest rather than just giving mandatory direction to its officers."
2004.04-278,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,296.25,298.617,Suppose shall does mean shall.
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,336.317,349.08,"Justice Breyer, I agree, and the difference between even mandatory language directing law enforcement to behave in a certain way is a far cry from actually creating a property interest in Mrs. Gonzales herself."
2004.04-278,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,372.818,381.948,But if you compare it to... this is a court order and it's enforceable.
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,406.305,421.468,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, you know, the analogy we cite in our reply brief and the U.S. marshal statute, 42 U.S.C. 1990 that says that there is a right in the beneficiary to have a warrant issued."
2004.04-278,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,464.455,468.075,"But isn't that true of all injunctive orders, they're not issued to the police."
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,473.34,478.177,"To my knowledge, we've never held that the police have an actionable obligation to enforce them."
2004.04-278,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,479.142,502.416,"But wouldn't you concede that in the case of the injunction in which there is a specific order in relation to a specific respondent, that the police have much less discretion than they would have when there is in effect a general statute saying, respond in these kinds of situations?"
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,502.416,505.179,"--Justice Souter, they still have a great deal of discretion here."
2004.04-278,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,508.24,515.289,"In the case of the statute that we're talking with, but they don't have that kind of discretion, do they, in Justice Ginsburg's example?"
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,531.973,535.487,"Well, let me take your invitation, then, and respond back."
2004.04-278,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,569.109,576.052,But is discretion... does discretion on the means to use include discretion to do nothing?
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,576.052,579.977,"--Well, it includes a finding of probable cause."
2004.04-278,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,590.404,593.189,But were any of those determinations made here?
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,593.189,595.455,"--Well, we don't know."
2004.04-278,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,610.952,615.922,"So are you requesting that there are insufficient fact findings here, so it should be returned--"
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,615.922,628.268,"--No, Justice Ginsburg, because what we're saying is that there is not a property interest at all and it doesn't matter, even if these allegations are true, there is no underlying property interest that would invoke the procedural protections of the Fourteenth Amendment."
2004.04-278,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,628.268,629.677,"Mr. Eastman, can I ask you this question?"
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,644.519,654.754,"Justice Stevens, you're asking whether, for purposes of federal constitutional law, the state court decision that Colorado had created a property interest is dispositive."
2004.04-278,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,659.313,662.151,"Then your answer is no, we would not have jurisdiction in that event."
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,662.151,671.334,"--Well, no, I was saying that yes, you would, because what we're talking about is looking to the state legislature on whether they've created a property interest for purposes of federal law."
2004.04-278,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,671.334,675.734,We could say that they had misconstrued Colorado law?
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,678.005,678.901,Okay.
2004.04-278,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,678.901,680.778,But I think you meant--
2004.04-278,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,680.778,698.735,"Perhaps what you mean is that what is a property interest for purposes of Colorado law, if Colorado chooses to nominate some utterly zany thing of property interest, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's a property interest for purposes of the Federal Constitution."
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,698.735,701.598,"Justice Scalia, I'm happy to do that."
2004.04-278,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,701.598,705.357,"--You can do that, but you won't find any cases making that point."
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,705.357,708.882,"No, you won't, but it makes perfect sense--"
2004.04-278,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,708.882,710.322,"I don't think you need a case for that, do you?"
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,710.322,711.421,"--No, but it makes perfect sense."
2004.04-278,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,711.421,712.694,But you have cases saying the contrary.
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,713.474,717.752,What we want to find out is whether the Colorado--
2004.04-278,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,717.752,722.46,Do we have any cases involving a zany property interest having been found by a state?
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,723.394,728.072,--We don't even have any cases involving a property interest to enforcement against somebody else.
2004.04-278,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,756.94,757.499,--May I stop you?
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,767.834,783.909,"It was, but the case has been relied on by several subsequent decisions including in the Second Circuit in the Attica case, inmates of Attica, for the proposition that there is just simply no right to an enforcement against somebody else, that there is no entitlement."
2004.04-278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,809.493,826.858,"Mr. Eastman, assuming for the moment there is no due... procedural due process right here, on the facts of this case, does Colorado law provide any alternative remedy for Mrs. Gonzales?"
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,826.858,828.821,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, it does."
2004.04-278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,828.821,830.496,And what would that be?
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,830.496,831.557,There are several remedies.
2004.04-278,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,842.239,851.268,"So she could presumably ask for some relief under that notion, against the police and possibly the town?"
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,851.268,853.353,--Against the police and... not the town.
2004.04-278,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,870.169,876.227,You say the tort statute means something like the Federal Tort Claims Act.
2004.04-278,0,30137,john_c_eastman,,878.462,878.979,--It does.
2004.04-278,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,935.421,936.962,"Very well, Mr. Eastman."
2004.04-278,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,939.043,951.768,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2004.04-278,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1009.436,1020.566,"What good is... what does the restraining order do, then, other than give her a right to sue the person who is restrained for contempt?"
2004.04-278,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1020.566,1023.67,--I think it does two main things.
2004.04-278,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1050.784,1055.392,But only to ask the police and the police are not obliged to respond.
2004.04-278,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1055.392,1056.464,That is correct.
2004.04-278,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1065.53,1067.876,"Do the police have any duty at all, in your view?"
2004.04-278,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1067.876,1074.142,--The police... I don't believe that the police have any sort of actionable duty.
2004.04-278,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1080.728,1086.738,Could the police just issue an order saying ignore all orders of this kind?
2004.04-278,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1086.738,1094.172,"I think that if they were to do that, I do not think that there would be sort of any individual right to challenge that."
2004.04-278,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1099.814,1104.533,That's the sort of aggressive sort of thing that the Colorado courts could conclusively decide.
2004.04-278,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1104.533,1110.506,"--That's something the Colorado courts decide, and it's something that would be... that could be addressed through the political process as well."
2004.04-278,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1110.506,1117.786,Are there any extreme cases we could imagine where the police have a duty to protect the citizen?
2004.04-278,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1132.384,1136.512,I think any duty that there would be would be a substantive duty.
2004.04-278,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1144.847,1151.205,"Did DeShaney stand for the proposition there could never be an affirmative duty to intervene, under what you're talking about the Constitution here?"
2004.04-278,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1151.205,1161.983,"--I think it would be, in a case, for example, where a prisoner was handcuffed in his cell with a cell mate who the authorities knew to be basically interested in harming him."
2004.04-278,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1175.314,1180.338,But there has to be some state... the state has to have created the risk somehow?
2004.04-278,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1180.338,1184.967,"Under DeShaney, the state has to have created the risk or increased the vulnerability of the person."
2004.04-278,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1237.488,1245.765,What's your response to the fact that the Tenth Circuit found otherwise and that we usually defer?
2004.04-278,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1245.765,1261.625,"I think our response would be that it's not simply... well, first of all, I don't want to make too much of the fact that it's obviously a very close question of state law because the Tenth Circuit was divided by a single vote."
2004.04-278,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1297.967,1304.062,"Do you agree that if this case stands with the state system, we would have to accept their holding on the property right issue?"
2004.04-278,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1304.062,1308.947,"--Obviously, I think there would be a much closer question at a minimum."
2004.04-278,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1314.499,1321.549,"No, let's say the Supreme Court has said, this is what the statute means and so forth and so on, wouldn't that be binding on this?"
2004.04-278,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1321.549,1322.647,I think it would be binding.
2004.04-278,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1329.797,1333.875,"Or whether the question of property right... the property right issue is not a question of federal law, it is a question of state law."
2004.04-278,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1333.875,1334.008,That is correct.
2004.04-278,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1337.122,1339.565,What did they hold in the Tenth Circuit?
2004.04-278,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1350.641,1352.56,"--That's absolutely correct, Justice Breyer."
2004.04-278,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1352.56,1354.543,So what did they hold in the Tenth Circuit in respect to that?
2004.04-278,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1354.543,1364.724,"Basically they said that because it is... because the statute was mandatory, they basically leapt from that to an inference that because it was mandatory, it was a duty that she could enforce."
2004.04-278,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1366.585,1368.958,They should reask the certified question?
2004.04-278,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1368.958,1390.466,"--I don't think that they need to because that is something that, again, it would be a useful thing given that there are 50 legislatures out there and there are probably at least 20 and perhaps 31 similar statutes that rather than certify the question and then have to certify on a state-by-state basis, just to adopt a background rule that this Court applies."
2004.04-278,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1390.466,1392.562,But a background rule is awfully tough.
2004.04-278,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1419.693,1431.623,"Well, I think the rule that the Court could create is that in a criminal context, which is all that is at stake here, there is a background presumption that individuals lack a judicially cognizable right to arrest or prosecution."
2004.04-278,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1467.093,1472.945,But is it not true that the Colorado legislature could create such a right if it did it with sufficient specificity?
2004.04-278,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1472.945,1474.582,I think that that is correct.
2004.04-278,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1486.646,1488.224,The Constitution does say property right.
2004.04-278,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1496.907,1506.047,"--Justice Scalia, all I'm saying is that the Roth cases haven't really indicated that there might be limits on that."
2004.04-278,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1507.14,1511.971,"Well, because there has been no case that really did not involve something that could reasonably be called property."
2004.04-278,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1511.971,1512.403,--Correct.
2004.04-278,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1542.784,1544.149,That's the state's problem.
2004.04-278,1,30165,john_p_elwood,,1551.049,1556.814,--I think that you would require a much clearer statement before accepting that kind of procedural innovation.
2004.04-278,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1557.72,1558.526,"Yes, it has."
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,1563.123,1569.133,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2004.04-278,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1597.25,1602.386,What process do you think your client was entitled to?
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,1602.386,1610.508,We believe that what my client seeks is much less than what police officers do every day.
2004.04-278,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1626.119,1629.756,Could that simply be made by the person on the desk?
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,1629.756,1648.87,"It can, Your Honor, but it needs to be a probable cause determination that is actually communicated to the holder of the restraining order, whether it be a favorable or adverse determination, there needs to be some notice provided to the holder of a restraining order of what the police officers intend to do."
2004.04-278,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1648.87,1649.562,"Well, does--"
2004.04-278,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1649.562,1652.277,"That... no, please."
2004.04-278,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1652.277,1656.058,--The basic problem that I have is you just put your finger on.
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,1707.936,1710.005,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe so."
2004.04-278,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1722.612,1725.882,"But that's not the kind that you've brought, as I understand it."
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,1746.543,1750.383,"As the case stands now, it is a Monell claim, Your Honor."
2004.04-278,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1751.946,1755.225,"But it's not a class action, is it?"
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,1767.61,1768.798,"Yes, you are correct, Your Honor."
2004.04-278,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1795.054,1819.384,"I'll grant you that, but as I understand it, what stands between or what would stand between your ignoring complaint and success would simply be the police's statement of a reason because, as I take it, I take it that you don't deny she was heard, they answered the phone, they talked to her."
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,1843.714,1843.932,No.
2004.04-278,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1850.145,1855.345,"And if they had said, we don't think there is probable cause, that would be the end of your case."
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,1855.345,1857.355,As long as there was a good faith determination.
2004.04-278,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1865.568,1876.649,"Suppose they just say, look, in our experience, children come home in two or three hours and, moreover, we have other things to do that are more important."
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,1887.648,1892.639,"No, Your Honor, that is not a thoughtful, objective--"
2004.04-278,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1892.639,1894.708,"So what you really want is what they should do, is they should respond?"
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,1894.708,1900.143,--They should respond by making an objective probable cause determination--
2004.04-278,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1900.143,1902.084,"But in this case, you would say they should respond?"
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,1902.084,1905.96,--They should have made the probable cause determination.
2004.04-278,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1905.96,1908.045,"But then your complaint is the result, not the procedure."
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,1920.252,1935.308,"There was no procedure here, Your Honor, and that's the point of our lawsuit is that the fact that Castle Rock has an official custom and policy of ignoring, of not applying any procedure to these types of claims is the crux of our complaint in this case."
2004.04-278,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1935.308,1941.755,"Why was your procedure, assuming your entitled to a procedure, why did it have to come from Castle Rock?"
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,1957.75,1964.757,"At the point at which she realized the police weren't really going to do anything, she found out her children were dead."
2004.04-278,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1968.433,1975.819,"Well, just as she could have complained to the police earlier, she could have gone to the court earlier when she saw that the police weren't doing anything."
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,1975.819,1979.621,But the police told her to continue to wait.
2004.04-278,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1991.248,2000.629,"That may be a tort, but it's not necessarily a denial of process if the proper place to seek that process was from the court that issued the restraining order."
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2000.629,2005.887,"--But the restraining order has no meaning, Your Honor, unless the police are willing to enforce it."
2004.04-278,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2005.887,2009.923,"That's right, and the court can make sure that they enforce it upon complaint."
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2009.923,2015.0,"In this case, it's our position that the legislature has done so as well."
2004.04-278,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2015.0,2022.425,Let me ask you a question that is suggested by Justice Scalia's question.
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2086.706,2092.702,"No, Your Honor, and I apologize if I misstated... if I gave you that impression."
2004.04-278,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2092.702,2102.312,"Well, my general question, then, is how does a reviewing court determine when or the point at which there has been a denial?"
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2102.312,2109.293,The initial contact with the police department we're saying has to involve appropriate processes--
2004.04-278,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2109.293,2115.244,"So following the first phone call, they would have to have made an express probable cause determination?"
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2115.244,2121.399,--They would have had to have made a probable cause determination in good faith and conveyed and communicated--
2004.04-278,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2121.399,2122.429,And communicate that to her.
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2122.429,2124.214,"--Communicated that to her, which they never did."
2004.04-278,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2131.773,2140.21,Did they simply have to take her word as to the facts on the probable cause issue?
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2140.21,2162.492,"No, not at all, Your Honor, and I believe that the whole intent of Goss versus Lopez was to allow a high school student to understand the interpretation of the principal's view of the facts, and allow the student the opportunity to clarify or to fill in any missing points in terms of the understanding being--"
2004.04-278,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2162.492,2166.295,"That's true, but Goss versus Lopez, to my knowledge... you may know more about it."
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2214.79,2220.241,"--Your Honor, we're not asking for the Court to instruct the police department they have to draw--"
2004.04-278,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2220.241,2220.886,Exactly.
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2239.403,2246.133,"--Your Honor, if I could respond, the delay issue is not the crux of the problem."
2004.04-278,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2257.856,2260.005,What good could that have done anyone?
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2260.005,2261.637,It would have allowed her the opportunity--
2004.04-278,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2261.637,2265.37,"She knew, as it was, that they weren't going to do anything."
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2277.328,2284.479,"--Your Honor, I don't believe the record is such that we've alleged that Ms. Gonzales knew that they weren't going to do anything."
2004.04-278,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2287.738,2290.175,They said call back in two hours and whatnot.
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2290.175,2292.447,"--And she continued to do that, to follow their instructions."
2004.04-278,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2292.447,2300.446,"And each time at the end of the call, she knew that they weren't going to do... they weren't going to go out and look and they weren't going to enforce the order at that point, didn't she?"
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2300.446,2302.457,I'm not sure that's correct.
2004.04-278,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2302.457,2315.758,"I mean, I can understand you're making an argument... you have made it, but I can understand you're making an argument that the point of procedure is to force people, in this case the police, to face facts."
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2358.913,2359.792,Your Honor--
2004.04-278,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2359.792,2361.969,"I mean, how do you get around that dilemma?"
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2361.969,2373.766,--We believe that the process test that we're articulating here is unique to domestic violence mandatory arrest statutes across the country.
2004.04-278,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2382.075,2398.752,"Then why weren't they enacted with an express provision saying, and by the way, the police have got to go, either through the following procedure or, by the way, this statute creates a right on the part of the protected party."
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2423.6,2427.797,"--I would respectfully submit, Your Honor, that they have, especially in Colorado."
2004.04-278,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2433.168,2440.772,But it doesn't say that people like your client have a personal right to enforcement with a damage remedy.
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2440.772,2446.607,"It doesn't, Your Honor, but the fact that there is a court order here in place individualizes the entitlement."
2004.04-278,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2494.111,2503.552,"Mr. Reichel, how would you describe, briefly, the property that your client has been deprived of?"
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2506.149,2509.935,The property is an entitlement to enforcement of her order.
2004.04-278,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2513.557,2518.148,The entitlement to enforcement of an order is property?
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2540.105,2546.377,--There is no opinion of this Court that talks about orders per se.
2004.04-278,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2585.731,2589.534,"Yeah, but it's, at the end of the day, they were unemployment benefits, right?"
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2589.912,2590.563,--That's true.
2004.04-278,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2590.563,2599.026,Wouldn't the better analogy be to assume she made a contract with a private detective agency to protect her from these events.
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2608.786,2621.8,"Well, Your Honor, that's true, although when she went into court, I think she believed that she had a contract with the State of Colorado, at least a promise by the State of Colorado that she would obtain some protection."
2004.04-278,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2621.8,2627.751,"But it seems to me a contract for protection would be a familiar kind of property, is what I'm suggesting."
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2627.751,2628.653,Exactly.
2004.04-278,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2629.639,2631.399,"--But there is no contract here, is there?"
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2631.399,2633.517,--There is no contract but there is an order.
2004.04-278,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2654.513,2659.185,Could you be precise about what is the due process?
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2671.046,2679.893,"We believe that there has to be an objective, thoughtful, reasoned evaluation of her complaint of a violation."
2004.04-278,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2691.658,2701.344,"But you said a moment ago, this could be done by the sergeant on duty at the desk who probably had three other calls waiting."
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2704.33,2705.38,"--Certainly, Your Honor."
2004.04-278,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2732.142,2733.443,But on any timetable?
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2733.443,2738.34,"Yeah, we're not asking for the police department to drop everything."
2004.04-278,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2740.531,2755.533,"If I understand your position correctly, I know what the allegations are here, but if the evidence should show later on that in response to one of these telephone calls, the desk sergeant said, send a squad car out and see if you can locate the kids, you would lose?"
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2755.533,2758.973,"--No, Your Honor, that's not what I'm saying."
2004.04-278,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2758.973,2765.005,Because that would have been a good faith response by somebody to try and find out whether there was probable cause.
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2765.005,2781.597,"There has to be an articulation of the determination of probable cause to the holder of the restraining order to allow her to, for example, clarify facts, to perhaps talk to a superior or perhaps, in this case, go somewhere else for help, go to the court."
2004.04-278,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2781.597,2782.45,but where do you get that?
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2802.773,2808.085,I believe it was wrapped within the concept of a probable cause determination.
2004.04-278,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2818.041,2821.736,"So the notice... yeah, did it say with a statement of reasons?"
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2821.736,2823.865,"With a statement of reasons, it did, Your Honor."
2004.04-278,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2823.865,2826.877,Where does that come from?
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2826.877,2834.408,"Well, the statement of reasons, Your Honor, allows again for there to be communication on both sides."
2004.04-278,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2838.43,2840.84,I know that it would be a fair process that you're describing.
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2840.84,2841.495,--A meaningful process.
2004.04-278,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2841.495,2859.057,"But is it an essential one, that is, that nothing spells out... in most of the cases that involve property and a procedural due process right, it's a hearing that the person is seeking."
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2869.014,2874.773,"Well, I believe that the enforcement of the order flows from the probable cause determination."
2004.04-278,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2895.817,2929.848,"But if the police... let's say, focusing on this case, suppose they had looked at this order and said, wow, it gives him weekends with the girls, it gives him summertime with the girls and, subject to his ex-wife's agreement, dinner time with the girls, this can't be all that urgent because if he would harm the girls then why is the judge allowing him so much sole time with them?"
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2944.536,2951.848,"There could have been, Your Honor, but again, those reasons were never articulated to my client and any reasons the police officers may have had are not in the record."
2004.04-278,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2951.848,2959.555,But this is such a new sort of a requirement you're seeking us to develop here.
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2975.182,2979.107,"It would be a different kind of case, Your Honor."
2004.04-278,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2979.107,2979.245,Yes.
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2989.255,2991.089,"I really have no idea, Your Honor."
2004.04-278,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2993.143,2996.252,Could you still bring a state tort suit?
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,2996.252,2996.978,"No, Your Honor."
2004.04-278,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3007.148,3007.622,Why?
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,3016.374,3025.445,--I believe that centers more around the causation and foreseeability issues that are triggered by that type of a claim.
2004.04-278,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3025.445,3037.467,"Well, if the state cares so little about enforcing what its officers do under its own laws, isn't that some indication that it did not intend to create the property interest that you're arguing for?"
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,3037.467,3039.685,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe that at all."
2004.04-278,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3057.647,3061.376,Do you have any other cases besides Logan?
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,3061.376,3063.338,On that issue?
2004.04-278,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3063.338,3064.068,Yes.
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,3064.068,3083.23,"Not with that elaborate of a discussion on the issue, although I would submit that the existence of a post-depravation remedy, so to speak here, is irrelevant under, again, Logan, simply because we're left now with the Monell claim."
2004.04-278,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3098.419,3119.368,"If there had been a question certified to the Colorado Supreme Court, and the Colorado Supreme Court said we weren't intending to create any entitlement here, evidence that we don't even have a tort action that's willful or wanton conduct, no liability at all in the municipality."
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,3126.221,3127.966,"We probably wouldn't be here, Your Honor."
2004.04-278,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3189.496,3196.695,May I ask you whether you would favor or disfavor our certifying the question whether there is a property right here to the Colorado Supreme Court?
2004.04-278,2,17992,brian_j_reichel,,3196.695,3206.594,"--At this point in time, I suppose I would disfavor it, because I believe that Bishop versus Wood is controlling."
2004.04-278,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3214.396,3215.911,"Thank you, Mr. Reichel."
