1980.79-900,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.42,We will hear arguments next in Federal Trade Commission v. Standard Oil Company of California.
1980.79-900,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,97.228,100.097,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1980.79-900,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,518.687,523.324,Are you going at some point to mention the proceeding in Indiana?
1980.79-900,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,528.293,552.426,"The proceeding in Indiana, Mr. Chief Justice, was a similar proceeding brought by Standard Oil of Indiana, another one of the eight respondents, also asserting that the Commission did not have reason to believe that Section 5 of the Act had been violated at the time it filed its petition, its administrative complaint."
1980.79-900,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,586.665,592.485,"What would you say is the impact of that holding on this case, if any?"
1980.79-900,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,592.485,622.071,"Well, I think... I think it has no precedential value for this purpose, it just shows that another district court thought that it could at that stage of the administrative proceeding look into the adequacy of the reason to believe standard, or look into whether the Commission did in fact make the reason to believe determination."
1980.79-900,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,689.482,695.553,"Mr. Solicitor General, Standard Oil of California is the only one of the eight respondents before us in this case."
1980.79-900,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,695.553,698.821,"It is the only one before us in this case; yes, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1980.79-900,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,698.821,715.199,"General McCree, in an administrative proceeding such as this, does the main information-seeking process occur in the pleading stage or in the discovery stage?"
1980.79-900,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,732.411,734.428,I think not.
1980.79-900,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,800.37,821.784,Wouldn't one go further than that in the court system and say that if a prosecutor initiates a prosecution a defendant can't come in and have it dismissed on the grounds that the prosecutor had no reason to believe that the evidence would prove the case?
1980.79-900,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,821.784,822.367,That's right.
1980.79-900,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1017.377,1030.787,"Well, would it really require any probing at all if five commissioners all signed a piece of paper and verified it saying, we have reason to believe that the unfair practices took place?"
1980.79-900,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1030.787,1035.525,"Well, we contend that that's really what we have here."
1980.79-900,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1106.519,1120.279,"Could there be a preliminary proceeding to inquire into the truth of whether a grand jury had ever indeed handed down, or whether, on the contrary, a fraud was being perpetrated on the court?"
1980.79-900,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1120.279,1141.625,"I think perhaps in an extraordinary circumstance, but when the indictment is fair on its face, there's no suggestion that it's a forgery, there's no suggestion that it was altered, it just relates to the mental processes of the grand juror, which is exactly what we have here."
1980.79-900,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1164.64,1169.342,"May I ask you of your interpretation of the 9th Circuit opinion, assuming the following."
1980.79-900,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1203.366,1213.99,"Well, it certainly would be a waste of judicial time and a waste of administrative time to do that, because they could do exactly what you suggest."
1980.79-900,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1217.858,1227.564,"They may in effect be contending that... this is some years ago, but in all these years the Commission still hasn't made its determination that there's reason to believe there's a violation."
1980.79-900,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1230.0,1239.872,--It's certainly passing strange that the Commission would keep it alive under all those circumstances if it had not at least ratified its act of filing it.
1980.79-900,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1239.872,1247.127,--Doesn't the very fact you're here defending what the Commission did implicitly indicate that somebody has reason to believe the case ought to go forward.
1980.79-900,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1247.127,1249.127,"Mr. Justice Stevens, I certainly agree with that."
1980.79-900,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1317.391,1342.106,"Could you, Mr. Solicitor General, concede arguendo... and assume, arguendo... that the Commission may have acted with unseemly haste in responding to the congressional inquiry and yet take the position that that has nothing to do with the central issue?"
1980.79-900,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1342.106,1372.542,"Arguendo, Mr. Chief Justice, I can make that concession, and I think this happens sometimes in the criminal area where a prosecution takes place because the public is insistent upon the solving of some crime that vexes it, and sometimes perhaps in those instances a grand jury may return an indictment with unseemly haste."
1980.79-900,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1509.831,1518.103,"Is that point, Mr. Solicitor General, preserved in the petition for certiorari, do you think?"
1980.79-900,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1518.103,1519.788,We think it is.
1980.79-900,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1545.004,1549.225,"That really is directed at a different point, isn't it, not final agency action?"
1980.79-900,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1549.225,1559.83,"--It is ultimately, except it can't... if it's not agency action at all, it can't be final agency action, and we suggest that--"
1980.79-900,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1559.83,1564.9,"Well, would you be as satisfied with winning on the argument you've made up to now as you would on this one?"
1980.79-900,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1564.9,1568.436,--I would prefer to win on the argument I've made up to now.
1980.79-900,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1568.436,1572.404,"Namely, that it's committed to agency discretion?"
1980.79-900,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1572.404,1575.792,That it's committed to agency discretion and that it is not reviewable.
1980.79-900,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1575.792,1577.992,Even though it's agency action?
1980.79-900,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1577.992,1590.366,"If the Court should decide this is agency action and wishes to agree with our contention that it's committed to agency discretion, we'd be very pleased to win on that basis."
1980.79-900,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1590.366,1594.17,"Why do we need to deal with that at all, or do we?"
1980.79-900,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1594.17,1618.552,"I'm pleased to have the Court make that inquiry but I'm just suggesting that on proper analysis it isn't agency action, because the Administrative Procedures Act defines agency action as a number of things, none of which remotely resembles the filing of a complaint."
1980.79-900,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1618.552,1627.908,"Well, if it isn't subject to judicial review, then no matter how we describe it it isn't final agency action."
1980.79-900,0,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,1629.443,1630.827,That's entirely correct.
1980.79-900,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1642.132,1642.083,Very well.
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,1734.81,1740.298,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:"
1980.79-900,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1740.298,1750.92,Would you care to comment on the possible implications of the Indiana holding where we have the same parties?
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,1756.824,1758.11,"--I'd be glad to do that, Your Honor."
1980.79-900,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1959.572,1973.331,I take it you would necessarily reject any analogy between the indictments by a grand jury and the action and the action taken here.
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,1973.331,1975.766,"I'd like to comment on that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1980.79-900,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2034.12,2040.543,"Mr. Sears, how do you distinguish the Costello case in that case?"
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,2040.543,2042.426,"--May I just finish my sentence, Your Honor?"
1980.79-900,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2042.426,2042.876,Certainly.
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,2042.876,2060.587,"--whereas in this case obviously the Commission itself is prosecutor here as well as judge under the FTC Act and the Commission acts directly upon the citizens, the person."
1980.79-900,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2102.431,2115.924,Do you suggest then that in a federal court a defendant could come in and move to dismiss an indictment on the ground that the Government simply had no evidence to prove its case?
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,2115.924,2122.595,"Again, sir, as the cases which I have cited in my brief demonstrate, that is done."
1980.79-900,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2122.595,2126.481,Are there any cases from this Court support that?
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,2126.481,2135.92,"I submit, sir, that Costello from this Court supports that, that it directly supports that."
1980.79-900,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2135.92,2145.609,"Well, this is an approach something like Thompson v. Louisville, isn't it?"
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,2145.609,2151.18,"It may be, Your Honor, though I couldn't testify to that."
1980.79-900,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2157.183,2161.051,That was a case of no relevant evidence whatsoever.
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,2161.051,2175.295,"In that case, Your Honor, it supports this case, because my contention here is that the Commission issued the complaint in Docket 8934, having before it no evidence which could support any inference--"
1980.79-900,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2175.295,2178.497,"And why do you say it issued the complaint, Mr. Sears?"
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,2178.497,2193.257,"--Because, again, of reasons which I have laid out in my brief, Your Honor, that the Commission felt intense pressure in the extraordinary circumstances of that time."
1980.79-900,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2193.257,2202.695,"You mean, they got together and said, we can't resist this pressure of Senator Jackson and let's just go ahead and do it even though we have no evidence whatever?"
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,2202.695,2203.562,"Well, Your Honor--"
1980.79-900,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2203.562,2205.33,Would they go that far?
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,2205.33,2208.615,"--Let me put it a little differently, if I might."
1980.79-900,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2241.086,2243.705,So that Senator Jackson's interest was no part of this?
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,2243.705,2246.538,"No, I don't say that either, sir."
1980.79-900,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2274.939,2284.544,"I gather your argument does... but your argument does suggest that they knew that they had absolutely no evidence to support the issuance of the complaint, no reason to believe."
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,2284.544,2289.448,"Well, let me... let me talk around the corners of that a little bit."
1980.79-900,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2337.813,2342.515,"Mr. Sears, supposing that we affirm the 9th Circuit?"
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,2360.509,2368.498,"Let me state it in my view, sir, what it is that the Commission should do."
1980.79-900,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2390.746,2402.921,Say they add to their affidavit that we could remedy this situation either by withdrawing the complaint or by amending the complaint and saying that as of the present we have reason to believe there is a violation.
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,2410.075,2419.364,"They must, for the reason I've already stated, an explicit legal requirement, they must withdraw the present complaint."
1980.79-900,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2522.112,2525.098,"They could do it for the period prior to 1973, couldn't they?"
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,2525.098,2526.15,"Or... and as well; yes, sir."
1980.79-900,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2526.15,2529.402,I really don't understand what you accomplish by this lawsuit.
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,2538.674,2541.893,"I have not made myself fully clear, Your Honor."
1980.79-900,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2541.893,2542.36,Not to me.
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,2542.36,2554.168,"Well, I am saying to you, sir, that the Commission, the Commission may or may not today have reason to believe that Standard of California has violated the law."
1980.79-900,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2560.905,2577.664,"Well, it is in evidence if the Commission resisted your motion to dismiss and they're still defending their right to prosecute this action, and we presume that public agencies are acting in good faith for the most part; they are public officers and I think there is some presumption of validity to their action."
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,2577.664,2603.315,"There is a presumption of regularity, which is, as Your Honor knows, a rebuttable presumption, and the point of this complaint is that Standard of California has shown a proper basis for a judicial inquiry into whether the Commission, when it issued the complaint, did have any basis for a reason to believe determination."
1980.79-900,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2604.516,2608.802,I take it you concede that it's regular on its face?
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,2612.087,2630.382,"--The complaint includes as all Commission complaints include, a recital, a formal recital at the outset, that there has been a finding of reason to believe, and that the action is in the public interest."
1980.79-900,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2675.447,2677.53,"Mr. Sears, let me try it another way."
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,2684.136,2692.908,"That's an interesting question, Your Honor."
1980.79-900,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2696.026,2702.597,And what would you be alleging or indicating or urging?
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,2702.597,2721.826,I'll tell you why I hesitated: because it is the existence of the Jackson letter coupled with subsequent developments of public record that provided very apparent reason for inquiry into what if anything it was the Commission had done.
1980.79-900,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2721.826,2726.812,Where do you get the right to inquire into the motive of a Government agency?
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,2726.812,2736.818,"There may be an inquiry into motive of an agency in appropriate cases, sir."
1980.79-900,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2794.671,2799.158,"Well, Mr. Sears, if you go to prosecutorial discretion, then I have a lot of trouble."
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,2819.103,2826.126,"No, I would think that would clearly not vitiate that conviction."
1980.79-900,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2826.126,2828.142,"And if a Senator had written a letter, would it vitiate it?"
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,2828.142,2830.661,"No, that would not vitiate that conviction."
1980.79-900,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2830.661,2835.315,So where do you get your prosecutorial discretion in this case?
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,2841.969,2845.771,"Well, that is why I was responding the way I was."
1980.79-900,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2852.291,2854.193,I thought that's what you said.
1980.79-900,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2854.193,2874.856,"But if we rule in your favor, don't we have to say that every time a respondent is made a party by the Federal Trade Commission that party has a right to go into Federal District Court before there's been any trial before the administrative law judge and say, the agency doesn't have any facts to back up its allegations?"
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,2874.856,2882.427,"Your Honor, one of the great things about the United States is that the courts are open to litigants."
1980.79-900,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2955.475,2970.735,"Suppose the record were opened and we knew or it was stipulated that three Commissioners thought there was reason to believe, and two thought there was not reason to believe."
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,2990.279,3000.587,The Federal Trade Commission Act permits complaints to issue on the vote of three Commissioners.
1980.79-900,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3036.443,3052.687,"Could I ask you, are you suggesting that the courts review, must review, or that you're entitled to have the courts review whether or not there was actually probable cause to issue the complaint?"
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,3052.687,3059.174,That's precisely my analogy... the different... the concerns--
1980.79-900,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3059.174,3060.641,What did the Court of Appeals hold?
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,3060.641,3061.191,--Yes.
1980.79-900,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3063.459,3073.082,The Court of Appeals held that the only thing that was reviewable was whether they had purported to make the determination.
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,3073.082,3075.116,"--Well, let me address that."
1980.79-900,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3078.552,3079.754,What did it reject?
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,3082.706,3092.562,--Let me state what my understanding of the narrow scope of review directed by the 9th Circuit is.
1980.79-900,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3092.562,3093.028,All right.
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,3093.028,3094.861,"We have to go to the court's language, of course."
1980.79-900,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3094.861,3095.094,All right.
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,3095.094,3097.813,The court said this in its opinion:
1980.79-900,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3152.4,3154.583,"Well, I had misunderstood then, apparently."
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,3169.944,3171.744,"I think not, Your Honor, for the reason--"
1980.79-900,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3171.744,3177.432,"Well, let's suppose for the moment that I am correct in reading the Court of Appeals opinion the way I do."
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,3183.852,3190.256,"--If I may, sir, I know no way--"
1980.79-900,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3190.256,3195.06,"Is there... do you suppose there's an answer to my question, or do you have an answer for it?"
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,3195.06,3211.605,"--The answer to your question, sir, is, yes, I would be entitled to proceed to explore, as the 9th Circuit said, as you interpret the opinion, whether a determination of reason to believe was made by the Commissioner."
1980.79-900,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3211.605,3217.175,"Yes, whether a determination had been made, not whether it was a correct determination?"
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,3217.175,3221.227,"That's correct, Your Honor; yes, sir."
1980.79-900,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3221.227,3230.567,But you are now urging that it is also open to a court in this case to say whether the determination was correct?
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,3230.567,3236.886,Not whether it was correct in the opinion of the District Court.
1980.79-900,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3274.196,3275.862,Is this what the Court of Appeals said?
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,3285.753,3287.855,"That's what the court said; yes, sir."
1980.79-900,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3287.855,3288.771,And that's what it held.
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,3288.771,3290.621,That happens to be what it held; right.
1980.79-900,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3290.621,3298.727,"And you're suggesting, however, that whether there is reason to believe, is open to review."
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,3298.727,3299.829,"I am, sir, and again--"
1980.79-900,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3299.829,3313.804,"And I again suggest to you that you may not be able to urge that as a respondent without having cross-petitioner, because it expands the relief."
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,3313.804,3315.923,"--I don't understand that, Your Honor."
1980.79-900,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3329.432,3337.836,"If you sustain, if we agreed with everything you've argued today, you would get more relief cut of this Court than the Court of Appeals gave you."
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,3337.836,3340.638,"Oh, I don't agree with that, with great deference, Your Honor."
1980.79-900,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3343.806,3344.642,I don't blame you.
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,3344.642,3356.582,"--I have read to you the precise sentences from the 9th Circuit, which to my mind indicate the definition of a very narrow scope of review directed by the court."
1980.79-900,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3360.284,3360.534,All right.
1980.79-900,1,26143,george_a_sears,,3361.334,3379.948,The nature of Standard's claim points the way to the necessary relief in District Court and dissolves arguments about exhaustion of administrative remedy and finality of administrative... agency action.
1980.79-900,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3493.621,3497.942,"Do you have anything further, Mr. Solicitor General?"
1980.79-900,2,45410,wade_h_mccree_jr,,3497.942,3503.244,"Mr. Chief Justice, with the Court's permission, we will rest our argument on our brief."
1980.79-900,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3503.244,3504.746,Very well.
