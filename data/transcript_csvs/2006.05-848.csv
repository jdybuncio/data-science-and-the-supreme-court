2006.05-848,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.446,We will hear argument first this morning in Environmental Defense versus Duke Energy Corporation.
2006.05-848,0,41253,sean_h_donahue,,7.146,9.417,"Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-848,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,38.745,51.675,"That's a disputed point, I gather, central to the case, whether or not the regulations measured PSD emissions through that device rather than the hourly emissions."
2006.05-848,0,41253,sean_h_donahue,,51.675,79.973,"That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, but the text of the regulations refers pervasively, and I'm referring to the definition of major modification which is in 40 CFR 51.166(b)(2) and subsequent paragraphs of that regulation, refers pervasively to actual emissions and measures emissions exclusively in tons per year."
2006.05-848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,79.973,91.172,"It is a little of an exaggeration, though, to say that EPA has since the issuance of the regulations always interpreted them the way that you prefer."
2006.05-848,0,41253,sean_h_donahue,,105.65,106.081,"Yes, Justice Scalia."
2006.05-848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,111.193,113.545,"Rightly so, I think."
2006.05-848,0,41253,sean_h_donahue,,123.893,132.569,"Well, Justice Scalia, as we point out in our brief, Director Reich does not adopt Duke's theory, in fact contradicts it."
2006.05-848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,182.542,201.522,"Well, whatever the reason he gave, was it... these opinions were out there when the challenge to the regulations, in which Duke did not participate, when that challenge was brought, were these... were those opinions already out there?"
2006.05-848,0,41253,sean_h_donahue,,201.522,216.473,Those opinions were out there but the plain language of the regulation and the preamble which explain that the increased hours exclusion was simply to allow companies to respond to demand and to link the coverage of PSD to construction activity.
2006.05-848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,230.163,237.356,"I understand that, and I think you may have the better of the argument on me on the interpretation of the PSD regulations."
2006.05-848,0,41253,sean_h_donahue,,260.391,275.401,"Well, Justice Scalia, these regulations were challenged early on and there was a... as the Court is aware, there was a settlement agreement in 1982 to which Duke was, in fact, a party, that proposed to add the hourly rate test that is completely absent from these regulations."
2006.05-848,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,275.401,282.826,But could Duke have had a challenge to the 1992 or 2000 regulations?
2006.05-848,0,41253,sean_h_donahue,,286.229,293.573,"They did in fact precisely that, Justice Kennedy, and that was resolved in the New York proceeding by the D.C. Circuit."
2006.05-848,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,303.13,316.587,"I don't want to jump ahead to the jurisdictional argument if you want to talk about the modification substantive point first, but it is not clear to me whether Duke should have acted in 1980, 1992 or 2000, or all of the above."
2006.05-848,0,41253,sean_h_donahue,,316.587,318.868,"--Well, the regulations were clear on their face."
2006.05-848,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,323.443,325.093,That's an audacious statement.
2006.05-848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,326.485,329.526,We've wrestled with these things for several days.
2006.05-848,0,41253,sean_h_donahue,,331.858,335.871,"--They're clear in this respect, they did not include an hourly rate test."
2006.05-848,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,362.429,366.279,"If they are so clear, how can you account for Mr. Reich's interpretation?"
2006.05-848,0,41253,sean_h_donahue,,367.962,368.372,Right.
2006.05-848,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,387.393,398.422,"I know you say he's wrong, but if somebody in his position with his expertise can interpret the regulations in that way, doesn't that show that they're not clear on their face?"
2006.05-848,0,41253,sean_h_donahue,,398.422,409.61,"--We think that this Court can resolve, can interpret, can address the reasonableness of EPA's construction of the increased hours exclusion."
2006.05-848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,434.393,434.804,Right.
2006.05-848,0,41253,sean_h_donahue,,472.029,482.718,"Well, that... they're not ambiguous as to whether they're identical, and to hold that they have to be is certainly an invalidation."
2006.05-848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,505.813,513.996,"Well, I don't think the same argument has necessarily to be made, but the question still before us is how you interpret the regulations."
2006.05-848,0,41253,sean_h_donahue,,520.091,520.462,Right.
2006.05-848,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,520.462,530.529,"But in deciding that, whatever was argued in prior cases, it seems to me that we're entitled to take into account the necessity that the regulations comply with the statute."
2006.05-848,0,41253,sean_h_donahue,,545.039,545.289,No.
2006.05-848,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,580.973,588.106,"If the regulations are ambiguous, then the agency can interpret them in different ways and can change its interpretation over time."
2006.05-848,0,41253,sean_h_donahue,,605.297,609.3,"--Accepting that premise, they could have sought an applicability determination."
2006.05-848,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,623.419,632.295,"Mr. Donahue, were there earlier enforcement actions in which EPA was taking the position that it took in this action against Duke?"
2006.05-848,0,41253,sean_h_donahue,,632.295,642.142,"Well, in the WEPCO decision... I mean, EPA has always taken the position that actual annual emissions is the standard under the 1980 rules."
2006.05-848,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,642.142,645.935,"But were they, in fact, enforcing that standard?"
2006.05-848,0,41253,sean_h_donahue,,654.871,655.971,Certainly.
2006.05-848,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,733.214,733.595,"Thank you,--"
2006.05-848,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,743.872,746.872,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-848,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,811.654,816.199,"Should a challenge to that have been brought in the D.C. Circuit at that time, or would you have argued that's too late?"
2006.05-848,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,816.199,821.431,"--Well, I'm not sure whether it could have been brought at that time."
2006.05-848,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,837.602,846.989,"Well, presumably Duke could say, we looked at the Reich memorandum and we were following that and all of a sudden this new 1988 thing came up and they are surprised by that."
2006.05-848,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,851.251,861.339,"--Well, they might have that argument, Your Honor, except for the fact that the challenge to the 1980 rules was stayed and was not reopened until 2003."
2006.05-848,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,916.122,922.047,"To be fair to them, that very same argument was more a product of the Fourth Circuit than of Duke."
2006.05-848,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,930.833,931.163,Yes.
2006.05-848,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,963.574,964.825,Why was that rejection wrong?
2006.05-848,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1003.509,1024.473,"Your Honor, it is a fundamental principle of administrative law and deference to agency decisionmaking that when Congress adopts an ambiguous statutory phrase and charges the agency with implementing that phrase the agency has discretion, has a delegation of rulemaking authority and policymaking authority to choose from among the various permissible interpretations."
2006.05-848,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1024.473,1035.08,"Of course it does, but when Congress says the definition in the two statutes has to be the same, whatever choice the agency makes among those options has to be applied to both, it seems to me."
2006.05-848,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1035.08,1046.488,"No, Your Honor, because Congress has not mandated, as it could have done, that the choice of the specific interpretation from among the permissible options must be identical across both programs."
2006.05-848,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1046.488,1049.1,"Well, then it's meaningless to say the definition has to be the same."
2006.05-848,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1049.1,1049.51,"No, Your Honor."
2006.05-848,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1049.51,1050.201,Entirely meaningless.
2006.05-848,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1050.201,1058.357,"The statutory definition is ambiguous, but within the limits of the ambiguity it imposes constraints on the discretion of the agency."
2006.05-848,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1106.129,1110.273,"And the ambiguity is the word ""increase"", which could mean different things?"
2006.05-848,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1110.273,1110.964,"Yes, Your Honor."
2006.05-848,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1110.964,1123.483,The Government as I understand it now has a proposed regulation that would align the standards with the two programs.
2006.05-848,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1141.574,1147.328,"Yes, Your Honor, with respect to certain types of units, electric generating units like those at issue in this case, that's correct."
2006.05-848,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1150.17,1174.727,"Well, since the government is now taking the position that another Duke could do just what was done here and there's an enforcement action pending, would you, if you prevailed in that enforcement action, nonetheless enforce, though it's those against the current government policy?"
2006.05-848,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1174.727,1181.261,"Your Honor, the 2005 proposal that you're referring to is only a proposal, a notice of proposed rulemaking."
2006.05-848,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1195.37,1199.915,"Well, what exactly are you seeking in these enforcement proceedings?"
2006.05-848,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1204.456,1205.989,"--It is civil enforcement proceedings, Your Honor."
2006.05-848,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1211.451,1235.828,"If you have an enforcement proceeding and there is a legitimate question of whether or not the agency's interpretation is consistent with the statute with Chevron deference and so forth and the court looks at it and says, you know, I have a real problem with the way the agency interpreted the basic statute when it first issued the regulation, the court can't get into that merely because the parties didn't present it earlier?"
2006.05-848,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1235.828,1236.89,That's correct.
2006.05-848,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1236.89,1239.721,The court's almost issuing an advisory opinion in a way.
2006.05-848,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1239.721,1240.342,"No, Your Honor."
2006.05-848,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1264.148,1274.894,Are there other areas in the law where courts have to take as binding a legal proposition that they think is dead wrong when they--
2006.05-848,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1274.894,1276.714,It's quite common.
2006.05-848,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1363.041,1364.463,"Mr. Hungar, I'm curious."
2006.05-848,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1377.23,1379.383,"Well, I think that's an unresolved question."
2006.05-848,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1380.753,1381.363,"Well, a nice question."
2006.05-848,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1387.557,1398.134,"--Well, presumably the argument would be that the creation of the company and the first applicability of the regulations to it is an after-arising ground."
2006.05-848,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1401.767,1405.53,Could it bring it up by a declaration of non-applicability?
2006.05-848,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1408.633,1414.025,"Well, it could seek a determination of non-applicability, but... and it could obtain judicial review of that determination."
2006.05-848,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1430.115,1433.908,In the midst of the enforcement action that's being brought against them by EPA?
2006.05-848,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1443.385,1452.891,"If this completely speculative and hypothetical situation were ever to arise, a court might well exercise its equitable discretion to stay proceedings pending review in the D.C. Circuit."
2006.05-848,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1452.891,1454.772,Can I ask you about an argument I think they did make?
2006.05-848,1,42821,thomas_g_hungar,,1553.646,1555.237,"There are several things, Your Honor."
2006.05-848,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1648.778,1649.978,"--Thank you, Mr. Hungar."
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1657.524,1659.756,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2006.05-848,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1692.176,1698.331,Then why were some companies asking for declarations of nonapplicability?
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1698.331,1702.003,To confirm precisely that interpretation.
2006.05-848,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1715.742,1729.031,But Mr. Donahue said that there were nonapplicability applications after those early ones that came out the other way.
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1730.381,1730.651,No.
2006.05-848,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1731.583,1739.687,--who asked for a declaration of nonapplication and then EPA took the position that it is currently taking.
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1739.687,1742.549,"--As I heard Mr. Donahue, he was talking about WEPCO."
2006.05-848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1816.818,1818.571,Who was saying that?
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1818.571,1828.856,"--That is the... it is the chief of the air and waste management division, James Wolburn, giving guidance to Region 4."
2006.05-848,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1856.555,1859.727,It looks like... I went back and read the Puerto Rico cement case.
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1891.758,1896.432,"Well, Justice Breyer, I think Puerto Rico cement is a somewhat complicated problem."
2006.05-848,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1921.247,1938.982,"--The analysis which was probably pretty much based on what they said, I think was that the reason there was increased potential here to pollute, was really because this change would permit the plant to be run more intensively or more hours, something like that."
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1938.982,1943.984,"But that was based on the question of involving you know, normal operations or non-normal operations."
2006.05-848,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1950.259,1950.846,"No, we didn't address it."
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,1980.796,1983.548,--I don't think they were really arguing that particular point.
2006.05-848,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2019.712,2043.498,"--So then they'll say your argument here, even if you are right, I think they think you're wrong... but even if you're right, they'll say well, that's an argument that it is arbitrary, capricious abuse of discretion for them to change horses in the middle of the stream, i.e., for them to take an interpretation of a reg that was longstanding and without adequate notice and comment and so forth radically reverse that interpretation."
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2045.859,2047.611,"But that is the issue in front of you, I believe."
2006.05-848,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2047.611,2048.052,Because?
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2048.052,2048.811,Because--
2006.05-848,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2048.811,2053.596,"They say because the Fourth Circuit didn't go really on that, it went on some statutory thing, and--"
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2053.596,2055.676,"--To be sure, but that's the opinion."
2006.05-848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2058.978,2059.78,"May I ask a question, Mr. Phillips?"
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2073.167,2077.969,"--If... I'm not sure I understood the predicate of the question, Justice Stevens."
2006.05-848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2079.411,2085.786,"You know... what's that, page 7 and 8 of the... of a source to modified have to have a significant increase in the SO2 elements."
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2085.786,2086.226,"Oh, I see."
2006.05-848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2086.226,2087.478,And they answered no.
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2089.138,2089.759,Right.
2006.05-848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2089.759,2096.735,"I'm just asking... want to know, under the statute, could they have answered yes and would that have been a permissible answer?"
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2096.735,2098.385,"No, our position would be no."
2006.05-848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2101.577,2106.062,"So you're not basically relying on the fact that you were misled, you're basically relying on the fact that they have interpreted the statute incorrectly."
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2106.062,2108.732,"Yes, actually we're making both arguments."
2006.05-848,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2123.582,2130.065,"Well, is what the government is saying here is that suppose the regulation can be interpreted to say X or Y."
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2142.025,2143.696,I think that's exactly what they have to be arguing.
2006.05-848,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2189.594,2193.547,"Just a pause, under your view or the Fourth Circuit's view?"
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2217.614,2218.035,--Yes.
2006.05-848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2259.683,2260.874,That's the NSPS section.
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2260.874,2261.895,That's the NSPS section.
2006.05-848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2278.748,2282.788,They say that that provision only applies when there is no SIP.
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2284.931,2293.367,"--Well, in the first place it would apply in at least South Carolina immediately because there is a SIP that incorporates exactly the same language."
2006.05-848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2314.852,2316.071,I don't understand that.
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2326.837,2327.648,Okay.
2006.05-848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2327.648,2330.76,I don't know how you can say it automatically applies when there is a SIP.
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2330.76,2332.242,The way that would apply--
2006.05-848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2332.242,2333.372,"Part 51, in other words."
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2333.372,2334.023,--Right.
2006.05-848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2413.016,2434.65,"Mr. Phillips, before you get away from this section 52, because I think that is the best section for your case, 52.01(d), is there, is there any sensible reason why you would want to have a different definition of modification for non-SIP situations than you would for SIP situations?"
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2434.65,2435.061,No.
2006.05-848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2438.754,2439.724,That occurred to me when--
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2439.724,2441.256,--And I have not heard the other--
2006.05-848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2499.685,2501.087,--You're quoting page 9?
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2501.087,2502.547,Page 9 of their reply brief.
2006.05-848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2502.547,2503.798,"Oh, in their reply brief?"
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2503.798,2505.389,"The SG's reply brief, I apologize."
2006.05-848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2523.25,2526.453,"Mr. Phillips, can I ask another sort of basic question?"
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2543.924,2545.895,Substantively different?
2006.05-848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2545.895,2547.497,Substantively different.
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2547.497,2549.069,"No, I think that would be impermissible--"
2006.05-848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2549.069,2549.35,You think the statute required the regulation to be identical?
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2549.35,2550.819,--Yes.
2006.05-848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2569.762,2571.744,Your answer is no?
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2571.744,2573.235,My answer is no.
2006.05-848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2575.649,2577.438,It's definitely no.
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2578.189,2580.14,That's a no with some emphasis.
2006.05-848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2580.14,2589.517,Would it have been permissible for the agency to adopt one definition for 10 years and then change the definition to the other definition for all programs?
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2589.517,2590.288,For all of it?
2006.05-848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2590.288,2591.059,Yes.
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2591.059,2591.45,Yes.
2006.05-848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2593.1,2595.681,So either definition could comply with the statute?
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2595.681,2596.522,--Yes.
2006.05-848,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2603.096,2608.8,"--The obvious reason to do it is, I guess you have an area of the country, let's say, which is quite clean in the air."
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2640.371,2656.963,"--Well, I think the premise of that is, the real question is, if Congress had meant that, why would Congress have adopted the same word, modification, as the construction trigger that existed in NSPS?"
2006.05-848,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2656.963,2666.587,"Because you can use the same word, you can apply the same word in different places differently, depending on what your basic object is in the different place."
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2687.32,2702.151,"Because by the time the statute came up for review by Congress, and the PSD program, the new source review, there was already a very extensive regulatory history about the meaning of the term ""modification""."
2006.05-848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2702.151,2713.067,"Well, I think what's wrong with it is that you could have achieved that same result by simply not saying that modification in one program has to mean the same as modification in the other."
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2726.226,2739.096,"And it also seems to me, Justice Breyer, it clearly creates an obligation on the part of EPA to be very explicit if it's, in fact, going to do what you say it's going to do."
2006.05-848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2802.798,2807.471,"They make a kind of interesting argument, major modification is not a subset of modification."
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2807.471,2808.732,Yeah.
2006.05-848,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2858.537,2859.346,Why?
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2878.889,2879.25,--Sure.
2006.05-848,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2879.25,2881.03,Where does it say in the statute that they can't?
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2881.03,2891.626,"Where it says in the statute is where it makes this specific cross-reference, because if all they wanted to do was get that definition, all they had to do was use the word modification."
2006.05-848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2894.648,2896.05,"Mr. Phillips, I want to be sure I understand your position."
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2909.227,2911.37,--It's a general principle that--
2006.05-848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2911.37,2916.443,So there's nothing in the statute itself that says that principle shall apply to this case?
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2916.443,2923.038,"--No, but the general principle is that if the same language is used in two different portions, you presume they have the same meaning."
2006.05-848,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2942.069,2945.431,Your answer is you are not relying simply on the general principle.
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2955.148,2957.58,"--It depends on which general principle, I suppose you're talking about."
2006.05-848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2961.894,2967.698,But your reference of modification as defined elsewhere merely defines the scope of the statutory meaning.
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,2974.069,3006.333,"I think if you read it in context, when you recognize that what Congress was doing is adopting a statutory scheme that overlays on a regulatory scheme that was well established with very specific meanings, and where Congress quite clearly picked and chose... I think that's the way to say it... from the regulatory scheme, and said we'll take these and not take those, and has a provision at the end... 168 says, all the regulations remain in effect until they get changed at some point, suggesting--"
2006.05-848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3006.333,3007.743,Let me just be sure I understand the point.
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3016.608,3017.039,--No.
2006.05-848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3019.87,3028.155,"So you're saying that if you used the definition as defined in another statute, that implicitly says all regulations defining this term must be identical."
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3028.155,3040.053,"--I don't know if I have to go quite that far because I have more evidence than that in this particular case, because I have the fact that they say as used in, which suggests that it's more than just a definitional point."
2006.05-848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3054.262,3061.808,"This is very helpful to me, because the government has accused you of abandoning the court of appeals approach to the case, and I think you're endorsing the court of appeals."
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3061.808,3062.727,I do endorse it.
2006.05-848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3106.898,3108.518,It's not just a matter of using the same word.
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3108.518,3109.149,--Yes.
2006.05-848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3110.339,3113.461,It's a matter of a statute which says it shall have the same meaning.
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3113.461,3113.971,Right.
2006.05-848,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3118.684,3124.669,"Well, could they have said that construction means both modification and then come up with a new word, alteration?"
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3137.707,3139.089,Absolutely.
2006.05-848,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3139.089,3139.597,--to the PSD?
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3139.597,3141.049,Could they have gotten away with that?
2006.05-848,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3161.964,3163.704,But you do have a brief here.
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3170.219,3170.85,Yes.
2006.05-848,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3170.85,3186.808,"And throughout that brief it refers again and again to the problem, their proposed reg is not taking, i.e., the potential capacity, which is change the machine so it puts out more per minute or whatever, but rather, it's using actual emissions even though you don't change the capacity of the machine."
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3193.173,3198.556,"The other side has not argued collateral estoppel, if that's the argument you're trying to make, Justice Breyer."
2006.05-848,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3198.556,3199.117,No.
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3203.061,3206.603,"Well, you have to put that into context."
2006.05-848,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3233.661,3234.21,No.
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3244.828,3248.14,"--Well, again, if you are arguing that as a matter of collateral estoppel, then--"
2006.05-848,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3248.14,3251.644,"No, not collateral estoppel, but you know, I'd be repeating myself."
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3251.644,3255.574,"--But if it's not collateral estoppel and it's not 307(b)(2), then--"
2006.05-848,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3255.574,3256.185,That's what it is.
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3256.185,3266.022,"--So you are doing it as... see, I don't think it... I think if you read 307(b)(2)'s language, it talks about action of the administrator, and what action of the administrator are we, in fact, challenging here?"
2006.05-848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3292.54,3298.034,"Mr. Phillips, can I go back for a second to the meaning in (a) includes the same meaning as in (b)."
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3315.765,3317.985,--As long as they are consistent?
2006.05-848,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3317.985,3318.456,Yes.
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3318.456,3318.857,Yes.
2006.05-848,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3320.887,3324.079,Could you explain to me again why this isn't a 307(b) problem?
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3325.64,3325.98,Right.
2006.05-848,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3370.809,3374.984,You can't challenge in the D.C. Circuit the administrator's interpretation that led to the enforcement action?
2006.05-848,2,19760,carter_g_phillips,,3374.984,3376.884,--I don't know how that's a final action.
2006.05-848,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3420.411,3421.442,"Thank you, Mr. Phillips."
2006.05-848,3,41253,sean_h_donahue,,3424.394,3427.457,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2006.05-848,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3462.98,3465.451,"Well, the one in part 52 surely does."
2006.05-848,3,41253,sean_h_donahue,,3468.355,3469.324,"--No, I don't give them that."
2006.05-848,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3469.324,3470.166,You don't give them that.
2006.05-848,3,41253,sean_h_donahue,,3470.166,3476.22,"Because it says rate, and the 1980 PSC regulations say that the relevant rate is tons per year."
2006.05-848,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3493.5,3496.311,"Major... when you say the statutory term, you mean ""modification""?"
2006.05-848,3,41253,sean_h_donahue,,3496.311,3496.802,--Correct.
2006.05-848,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3496.802,3500.874,"So then why weren't those proposed regulations saying just that, adopted?"
2006.05-848,3,41253,sean_h_donahue,,3500.874,3503.728,"I don't know the answer to that, but it's absolutely clear."
2006.05-848,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3525.16,3526.682,"That's a tough sell, isn't it?"
2006.05-848,3,41253,sean_h_donahue,,3537.068,3541.803,--I think that there's no other reading of what EPA meant from the regulations.
2006.05-848,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3576.344,3578.054,"Where is ""rate"" defined?"
2006.05-848,3,41253,sean_h_donahue,,3583.47,3591.808,51.166(b)(21) and (b)(23).
2006.05-848,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3591.808,3593.187,It's not defined.
2006.05-848,3,41253,sean_h_donahue,,3594.619,3597.02,It's the only... it's tons per year consistently.
2006.05-848,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3611.359,3612.0,"Thank you, Mr. Donahue."
