1993.93-5770,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.965,"We'll hear argument next in Number 93-5770, Robert Edward Stansbury v. California."
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,59.383,63.506,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.93-5770,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,235.124,250.899,"Mr. Stansbury, the question on which we granted certiorari is whether a trial court can determine that a criminal defendant is not in custody for Miranda purposes on the basis of the police officer's subjective intent that they didn't consider the defendant a suspect."
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,250.899,251.429,That is correct.
1993.93-5770,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,251.429,255.179,We don't ordinarily go into extensive review of facts.
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,255.179,268.127,"The extensive... I'm not going into an extensive review of the facts, Mr. Chief Justice, but the issue as to what caused the suspicion to focus on the defendant was, of course, the principal issue in the court below."
1993.93-5770,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,326.321,338.629,"Well, speaking for myself, I think you're probably right about the standard that we have enunciated, but again speaking for myself, I didn't think the supreme court of California had departed in any material way from it."
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,338.629,356.809,"I believe the supreme court of California stated the issue at the beginning as whether a reasonable person would believe himself in custody, but in fact, the analysis that that court made of the facts were focused almost entirely upon what was in the policeman's mind."
1993.93-5770,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,468.624,474.888,"So you're acknowledging, then, that the answer to the question presented is no?"
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,474.888,485.274,"--The question presented, may a trial court determine custody on the basis of the suspicion in the policeman's mind, the answer is no."
1993.93-5770,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,485.274,493.38,"So there is no dispute about the correct answer to the question presented, and the only question is what we do from there on?"
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,493.38,494.707,I think that's correct.
1993.93-5770,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,597.228,613.519,"Well, why isn't the appropriate thing if the wrong standard was used, for us to say that's... the rest of it should be redone by the California court and not by us?"
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,613.519,618.986,Both the parties in the case believe that this Court can determine custody on the basis of the record.
1993.93-5770,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,620.955,624.095,But why should this Court make the determination--
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,624.095,624.905,--This Court need not--
1993.93-5770,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,624.905,627.155,--that ordinarily would be made by the California court?
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,627.155,629.717,--I don't think this Court need make the determination.
1993.93-5770,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,655.347,659.642,"If there was custody, then what follows from that?"
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,660.938,666.359,"If there were custody, the bottom line would be that it would go back to the State for a determination, presumably, of harmless error."
1993.93-5770,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,690.91,703.406,"--Do you say that for Miranda purposes it is irrelevant whether the investigation has focused on the suspect, or are you just contending that in making that determination we must use objective evidence only?"
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,703.406,714.572,The focus is material if it somehow conveyed to the individuals and it therefore influences what he thinks are his rights.
1993.93-5770,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,723.678,728.615,So it's a correct and relevant inquiry to ask whether or not the investigation has focused on the subject--
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,728.615,729.426,--I think--
1993.93-5770,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,729.426,732.956,--provided you use only objective indicia to make that determination?
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,732.956,734.831,"--I wouldn't put it that way, Justice Kennedy."
1993.93-5770,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,748.637,754.962,"Well, whether or not the investigation was focusing on him would have some bearing on his conclusion, would it not?"
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,754.962,769.988,"It could have, if it were conveyed to him in some fashion, but it would not necessarily be conveyed to him, and in this case, there was nothing conveyed to him on the issue of suspicion, and the trial court didn't find that there was anything."
1993.93-5770,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,869.213,887.143,"If our standard is supposed to be how would a reasonable person perceive... would a reasonable person feel himself in custody, then we don't take into account at all that this is a person who is in fact... who in fact committed the crime?"
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,887.143,888.611,--That is correct.
1993.93-5770,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,888.611,889.314,So we keep the--
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,889.314,891.048,You would assume it's a reasonable innocent person.
1993.93-5770,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,891.048,891.657,--Right.
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,906.823,915.57,You take that person as coming to his door and seeing four police officers with guns in their hands saying... and this is what they said.
1993.93-5770,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,929.813,934.639,There was one part of that scenario that was confusing to me.
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,943.933,947.76,There was no finding they were not visible.
1993.93-5770,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1145.164,1164.86,"Mr. Westberg, I'm looking through the pages of the appendix that contain the opinion of the supreme court of California, and on page 471, the first sentence in the first full paragraph is... it's this volume II of the Joint Appendix."
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,1164.86,1166.375,"I have it, Mr. Chief Justice."
1993.93-5770,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1166.375,1167.156,"It says, custody"
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,1175.919,1176.653,That is correct.
1993.93-5770,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1177.294,1182.04,"And then again on page 476, they announce the same thing."
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,1200.94,1225.303,"My answer to that, Mr. Chief Justice, is that although the court made that statement on page 471, the bulk of the discussion by the court of the issue is whether there was substantial evidence to support the finding of the trial judge about suspicion in the policeman's mind focusing on the petitioner, and the court deals at great length with that point."
1993.93-5770,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1243.984,1253.059,"Well, but presumably the trial court may have made implied findings when it declined to suppress what it did suppress of the statements."
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,1253.059,1293.98,"The trial court actually did suppress part of the statements, so you cannot draw a conclusion that the court made a finding... I would say that the court made a finding that the petitioner was in custody at the end of the interview, because it suppressed what he said after he had described the car, and yet the physical surroundings, the fact that the defendant was in jail, had not changed, so we have a bizarre situation where the court has found custody, but found that it attached at a particular point in time, based on its view of when the policeman's mind registered a certain level of suspicion."
1993.93-5770,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1293.98,1307.631,"Well, you don't contend there's anything impossible about a person not being in custody at the outset of the interrogation and being in custody later on."
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,1330.34,1331.09,Absolutely right.
1993.93-5770,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1331.09,1332.761,--At this point custody attaches.
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,1333.308,1333.98,I agree with that.
1993.93-5770,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1333.98,1334.276,Okay.
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,1334.276,1335.557,There's no question about that.
1993.93-5770,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1411.43,1414.273,Was the room locked?
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,1414.273,1419.553,That's a very... there's no evidence as to whether the room was locked.
1993.93-5770,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1456.162,1456.662,"Well, I would assume--"
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,1456.662,1457.912,--they did not... because one of the questions--
1993.93-5770,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1457.912,1459.177,--if the door is locked there's a--
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,1459.177,1459.677,--the State would have to put on--
1993.93-5770,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1459.677,1461.692,--greater probability he's in custody than if it isn't locked.
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,1461.692,1463.707,"--It was inside the jail, however."
1993.93-5770,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1467.595,1475.609,But the question whether the door was locked was raised in a question and not... and the evidence is unclear on what the answer is.
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,1475.609,1482.871,"The officer was asked, was the door locked, and said, ""I don't remember""."
1993.93-5770,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1482.871,1488.822,What is clear is that the exit--
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,1488.822,1489.822,It was very clear--
1993.93-5770,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1489.822,1490.773,--from the jail was locked.
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,1490.773,1496.319,--It was very clear that he could not have left the premises without keys being provided.
1993.93-5770,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1510.095,1515.515,"Of course, that's the case for the police who are there, too, or if I went to visit, I couldn't get out with out a key."
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,1517.841,1518.935,That is true--
1993.93-5770,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1518.935,1526.79,"It just means that they chose to interrogate him there, and nobody who's in there, even if he's a policeman, even if he's the warden, can get out without somebody opening the door."
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,1526.79,1534.615,"--Well, I think the question, Justice Scalia, would be whether the reasonable policeman would think that he's in custody because be has to ask for a key, and I don't think he would."
1993.93-5770,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1541.409,1542.815,"Very well, Mr. Stansbury--"
1993.93-5770,0,40829,robert_m_westberg,,1542.815,1543.237,Westberg.
1993.93-5770,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1543.237,1544.846,--Ms. Bunney.
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,1544.846,1548.985,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1993.93-5770,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1557.825,1563.589,"So you really concede the legal issue in the case, that we must use the objective standard?"
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,1563.589,1567.275,We agree that you must use an objective standard.
1993.93-5770,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1567.275,1575.724,So all we're talking about here is whether or not under the objective standard the California supreme court was correct in reaching its finding.
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,1575.724,1581.065,We also ask the Court to uphold the California court's finding that petitioner was not in custody.
1993.93-5770,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1606.415,1621.145,What do we do with the part of the California decision that says the trial court's determination that suspicion focused on defendant only when he mentioned the turquoise car is supported by substantial evidence?
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,1656.926,1659.815,"--Excuse me, Your Honor, that's not correct."
1993.93-5770,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1660.565,1673.122,"The question presented is, may a trial court determine that a criminal defendant is not in custody on the basis of police officers' subjective, undisclosed conclusion that they did not consider defendant a suspect."
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,1673.122,1677.777,"--Your Honor, the part that makes the difference is undisclosed."
1993.93-5770,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1681.12,1684.962,But the question is undisclosed.
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,1710.967,1711.529,No--
1993.93-5770,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1711.529,1713.81,You're answer to the question presented is no--
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,1713.81,1714.06,"--No, Your Honor--"
1993.93-5770,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1714.06,1721.448,"--and so both sides agree that the question presented should be answered no, and then what do we do, having answered the question presented, no."
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,1721.448,1724.54,--We also disagree with the question presented.
1993.93-5770,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1742.393,1744.143,"Would... yes, we need to get into that."
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,1754.825,1761.275,--There are some statements in the California supreme court's opinion which do relate to subjective intent.
1993.93-5770,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1761.275,1762.227,Yes.
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,1763.321,1763.649,"Yes, Your Honor."
1993.93-5770,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1763.649,1774.051,And the trial court likewise seemed to find the subjective intent of the officers quite important.
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,1783.798,1785.39,Your Honor--
1993.93-5770,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1785.39,1787.578,--to directly focus their attention.
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,1787.578,1792.731,"--Your Honor, we believe that the standard employed by the California supreme court was essentially correct."
1993.93-5770,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1895.346,1904.186,I don't see why it's irrelevant that the guns were drawn simply because a finding may have been made that at that point he was going voluntarily.
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,1944.296,1953.633,"First, Your Honor, with response to the guns, again, it's our position that the court found that defendant didn't see the guns."
1993.93-5770,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1973.314,1993.54,"Well, I thought you were making the point that all of these earlier facts which he was pointing to in effect once they re resolved at an earlier stage against him are thereafter rendered totally irrelevant for whatever... even if they arguably have a bearing on his feelings at a later stage."
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,1995.008,1998.381,"It is our position, Your Honor, because--"
1993.93-5770,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1998.381,2013.001,"Well, I mean, he doesn't acquire amnesia at the point at which he gets into the car, or the point at which he enters the police station, and isn't he entitled to consider the cumulative effect of all the facts?"
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2045.675,2051.579,"--The Court can look to the totality of the circumstances, but where--"
1993.93-5770,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2051.579,2053.547,That really was my only point.
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2069.447,2081.192,"--The importance of it is that the facts are resolved in favor of consent, so that that fact becomes, at most, less significant."
1993.93-5770,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2081.192,2089.08,May I just be sure I understand what... your point about the guns were that the California court found that the guns were not seen?
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2101.449,2110.259,"What I'm basing it on, Your Honor, is a page 476 of the Joint Appendix, in which the Court said there is no evidence defendant saw the guns."
1993.93-5770,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2110.259,2114.804,"Well, but that's not quite the equivalent of finding that he did not see them."
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2114.804,2117.146,"Well, we believe it is equivalent to finding that."
1993.93-5770,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2117.146,2126.174,"And the finding on consent is the statement, defendant was very cooperative and agreed to come in to the Pomona Police Department for an interview?"
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2126.174,2135.655,"The basis is the California supreme court's finding that he was invited, that he was invited, not commanded to come to the police department."
1993.93-5770,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2135.655,2137.497,And the fact that he accepted the invitation means it was truly voluntarily.
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2137.497,2144.074,"Yes, that it was voluntary, and similarly, the State courts found that petition consented to transportation by the police."
1993.93-5770,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2154.132,2155.396,What makes it an invitation?
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2162.988,2176.186,"It's not necessarily that they're polite, although... it's... in this case, what the police said is, you're a possible witness to a homicide, and we have homicide investigators who'd like to talk to you, will you come along with us?"
1993.93-5770,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2181.87,2194.958,"If someone says, will you come along with us, and points a gun, or has a gun visible, that would convey a different impression to a reasonable mind, would it not, than if somebody is in plain clothes and says--"
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2194.958,2203.205,"Well, this officer was in plain clothes, and the gun... at least the officer that he spoke to, the gun was not visible."
1993.93-5770,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2203.205,2206.157,"--Well, that... again, we don't know whether it was visible."
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2207.985,2212.342,And Officer Lee testified that he deliberately hid the gun.
1993.93-5770,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2212.342,2213.811,One... and how many officers--
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2213.811,2219.089,"There were four officers, Your Honor, but the one officer who talked to him was the one officer who testified on that point."
1993.93-5770,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2219.089,2233.099,"--It's just hard for me to understand how a gun is in a person's hand... the other officer said, the gun was not drawn but in his hand, not pointed, but if a gun is in your hand, it seems to me it's got to be visible."
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2233.771,2241.72,"No, Your Honor, because in this case Officer Lee specifically testified, as a narcotics officer, I hide my gun behind my leg."
1993.93-5770,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2241.72,2246.673,But the other officer testified... I'm reading at the top of page 476.
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2253.67,2257.465,"It was in his hand, that's correct, Your Honor, but not displayed."
1993.93-5770,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2257.465,2259.01,What time of day did this take place?
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2259.01,2260.775,"This was 11:00 at night, Your Honor."
1993.93-5770,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2270.896,2272.443,Were there officers in the back seat?
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2272.443,2274.051,There was one officer in the back seat.
1993.93-5770,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2318.127,2321.11,May I go back a moment to the offer to let him drive himself?
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2326.5,2328.655,"The record does not reflect that, Your Honor."
1993.93-5770,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2328.655,2329.545,Either way?
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2329.545,2330.763,Either way.
1993.93-5770,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2375.496,2393.284,"You do agree that it's a little more difficult that it wasn't in just the station house that you can enter and exit, but that it was that he was in the jail portion where you have to get through several barriers, and you couldn't do it on your own."
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2393.284,2394.346,--In this case--
1993.93-5770,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2394.346,2398.673,That's something of a weighing factor that would be in a reasonable mind.
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2402.077,2411.824,"--And that's... petitioner argues that he was in custody because he needed assistance to leave the police station, but police stations are routinely locked facilities, secured facilities."
1993.93-5770,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2414.964,2425.599,Does it make any difference that it was in the jail part as distinguished from the part where the public comes in and out of the police station?
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2425.599,2441.374,"--The only difference is that the police station is part of the jail facility, so there's... in this case it doesn't, because citizens do need assistance to get out of the police station, with the possible exception of a public lobby."
1993.93-5770,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2441.374,2448.435,"Wasn't there something about, one of these police officers was from a different district and didn't know... he only knew how to come in through the jail way?"
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2448.435,2448.966,That's right--
1993.93-5770,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2448.966,2455.276,"There was a way to get into that police station that you could get out of, too, without a key, but that was not the part that he was in."
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2455.276,2467.114,"--That doesn't mean that the person... that... each entrance to this police station required entrance through a secured doorway, with the exception of the public lobby."
1993.93-5770,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2511.425,2517.344,I thought he said that it is relevant provided it is objectively communicated to the defendant--
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2517.344,2518.094,--And that--
1993.93-5770,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2518.094,2533.93,"--or the suspect, and there are at least 11 different parts of the California supreme court opinion, beginning at page 471, where the supreme court talks about what Johnson was thinking about, and you concede that is irrelevant, do you not?"
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2533.93,2539.008,--To the extent it wasn't disclosed to the defendant.
1993.93-5770,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2539.008,2541.32,Of course... to the extent it was not disclosed.
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2541.32,2542.286,But--
1993.93-5770,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2542.286,2549.69,So I think the Chief Justice is quite correct that the California supreme court enunciated the correct legal standard.
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2586.051,2586.457,"--Thank you, Your Honor."
1993.93-5770,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2622.113,2623.207,It what?
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2623.207,2635.562,"In... where the information is somehow conveyed to the defendant, either by word or action, then the focus is relevant."
1993.93-5770,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2635.562,2650.633,"Yes, but I find it not at all surprising that the California supreme court talks about whether subjectively these investigating officers thought that this person was a target of the investigation."
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2658.614,2660.988,"That's... that's our point, Your Honor, that--"
1993.93-5770,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2660.988,2666.955,So it's perfectly proper for the California court to talk about the subjective intentions.
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2680.2,2683.261,--At the beginning of the interview--
1993.93-5770,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2683.261,2684.368,"After the... yes, go ahead."
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2684.368,2690.679,"--At the beginning of the interview, Johnson told Stansbury that he was a witness only."
1993.93-5770,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2691.945,2695.116,"Was this at the beginning of the interview, or when he was at the house?"
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2695.116,2700.347,--Both Officer Lee at the house and Lieutenant Johnson at the beginning of the interview--
1993.93-5770,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2700.347,2700.613,Johnson at the station.
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2700.613,2703.065,--told Stansbury that he was a witness.
1993.93-5770,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2753.967,2756.575,Can you be a witness and a suspect at the same time?
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2756.575,2768.679,"Well... yes, Your Honor, because obviously you're a witness... if you commit the crime, you witness what happened, so I don't think that you couldn't be both."
1993.93-5770,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2774.52,2791.483,"Going to the question whether the officers would have in fact have had to have thought he was a suspect in order to communicate that idea to them, is it not true that there are many police interrogations in which the police in the course of questioning suggest facts that are not in fact what they know?"
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2791.483,2793.295,That's--
1993.93-5770,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2793.295,2794.059,That happens.
1993.93-5770,1,15476,aileen_bunney,,2794.059,2801.713,"--That happens, yes, Your Honor, that is true, but normally what happens in those circumstances, you're still talking about accusatory types of questioning."
1993.93-5770,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2968.413,2970.365,"Thank you, Ms. Bunney."
1993.93-5770,2,40829,robert_m_westberg,,2973.349,2986.718,"Mr. Chief Justice, Justice Stevens, the Supreme Court said at page 471 that focus was one of the most important factors, and they listed the focus of the degree of suspicion."
1993.93-5770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3030.653,3036.588,"Well, isn't the burden on someone who seeks to exclude testimony to make a case?"
1993.93-5770,2,40829,robert_m_westberg,,3036.588,3057.502,"--Under People v. Sam, California has allocated that burden to the State to demonstrate the admissibility of the testimony, and in fact, in People v. Sam, California supreme court cited in the brief, the respondent does not disagree, Mr. Chief Justice, that the burden of proof was on the State in this proceeding."
1993.93-5770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3060.422,3061.546,On the... on burden of proof--
1993.93-5770,2,40829,robert_m_westberg,,3061.546,3064.404,--To show that he was not in custody.
1993.93-5770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3064.404,3066.498,--As a matter of Federal constitutional--
1993.93-5770,2,40829,robert_m_westberg,,3066.498,3067.637,Not as a matter of Federal constitutional--
1993.93-5770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3067.637,3069.575,--As a matter of California law.
1993.93-5770,2,40829,robert_m_westberg,,3069.575,3070.292,"--California law, I think--"
1993.93-5770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3070.292,3073.058,"And of course, we wouldn't review any finding of that sort."
1993.93-5770,2,40829,robert_m_westberg,,3073.058,3073.433,--Certainly not.
1993.93-5770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3077.65,3083.85,--under a mistaken view that the Federal law required it.
1993.93-5770,2,40829,robert_m_westberg,,3083.85,3091.598,"That it was required by this Court, or unless they did it in a way that this Court thought deprived constitutional rights, but in this case they've allocated it to the State."
1993.93-5770,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3198.085,3202.506,And we can take judicial notice that a lot of questions can be asked in the span of 20 or 30 minutes.
1993.93-5770,2,40829,robert_m_westberg,,3202.506,3204.566,--I would agree.
1993.93-5770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3207.971,3210.845,"Thank you, Mr. Westberg."
1993.93-5770,2,40829,robert_m_westberg,,3210.845,3211.063,Thank you.
1993.93-5770,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3211.063,3211.657,The case is submitted.
