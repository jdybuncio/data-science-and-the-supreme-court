1997.96-1400,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.288,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-1400, California and State Lands Commission v. the Deep Sea Research, Inc.--"
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,64.414,68.024,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,133.828,136.5,"Well, there's really no such thing as an in rem action, then."
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,136.5,137.822,"No, that's--"
1997.96-1400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,137.822,142.734,"Well, I mean, you cannot possibly adjudicate the rights to a particular piece of property."
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,146.246,147.899,--Justice Scalia--
1997.96-1400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,147.899,152.872,"--who can come in and say, no, it's really mine, and this adjudication was for naught."
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,152.872,157.473,"--Justice Scalia, all we're asking in this case is that the State be dismissed."
1997.96-1400,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,161.988,162.746,Then it's not an in rem judgment.
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,187.342,190.686,"Justice Souter, I believe that is what we are saying."
1997.96-1400,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,197.31,215.641,"And isn't the reason that they're not... isn't the reason that you're not going to file this kind of an objection on, let's say, an East Coast salvage case is that there is no colorable basis, in your mind or anybody else's, for your doing so, for your having a claim that might be cut off and therefore in fact adjudicated by the in rem action?"
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,215.641,217.945,"That will be the practical effect, yes."
1997.96-1400,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,217.945,218.613,All right.
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,296.925,307.951,"Justice Souter, the problem with that rule is that by inquiring into the location, inquiring into the issues that you mentioned, you're adjudicating the merits of the claim."
1997.96-1400,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,307.951,328.736,"No, I'm simply... my suggestion was that you've at least got to come forward with a basis for saying, yes, there is a reasonable basis for saying that State interests are involved here, as distinct from the case that would occur if the wreck were beyond the 3-mile limit, or the wreck were in the Gulf of Mexico, or in Europe."
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,356.604,369.024,"I understand, Justice Souter, but I do not see as a practical matter how this inquiry that you're talking about about preliminary matters cannot but implicate a question on the merits, and this is what--"
1997.96-1400,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,369.024,371.234,"Oh, it implicates it, but it doesn't determine it."
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,381.132,393.186,--We think that the... the State of California thinks that the broad concept of sovereign immunity in the Eleventh Amendment means that even the type of preliminary inquiry that you're asking for is forbidden.
1997.96-1400,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,394.057,409.689,"I think I might agree with that, and then suggest that perhaps the Eleventh Amendment doesn't apply at all to an in rem action where the res is not in the custody, the actual custody of the State."
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,425.909,430.943,"--Well, Your Honor, we don't think we're destroying the utility of in rem actions."
1997.96-1400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,441.659,459.602,"Well, but there is some indication, isn't there, that when the Framers were drafting the Constitution and when the Eleventh Amendment was adopted that it was thought that certain types of suits in admiralty weren't covered by the Eleventh Amendment at all."
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,459.602,461.322,I--
1997.96-1400,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,461.322,474.581,"The prize cases, for example... and very possibly in rem cases of this type, where the State isn't in possession, as such, of the property."
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,474.581,493.192,"--Your Honor, since the early cases, which we do not believe stand for the citation by the other parties in this case, those cases did not involve in rem actions at all, or possession was not central to the holding."
1997.96-1400,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,505.822,521.361,"Well, Mr. Rusconi, your opponents cite the old Peters case from this Court as standing for the proposition that a Federal court can adjudicate an action so long as the property is not in the possession of the State."
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,523.312,523.881,"--Yes, we do."
1997.96-1400,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,554.484,556.765,What's your answer to The Davis?
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,575.318,578.8,"Well, yes, title was not involved in The Davis, and that involved--"
1997.96-1400,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,578.8,579.96,"Well, why should that make a difference here?"
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,579.96,580.721,--Because--
1997.96-1400,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,580.721,589.647,Regardless of what's being adjudicated you're saying we have the right to an Eleventh Amendment immunity even though we weren't in possession and even though it is in rem.
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,589.647,590.678,--That's correct.
1997.96-1400,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,602.533,618.506,"No, but if sovereign immunity of the United States would not have prevailed in that case, there's at least a pretty fair argument that it's unlikely that the concept of sovereign immunity recognized in the Eleventh Amendment for State purposes would, in fact, be somehow more powerful or broader."
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,620.105,629.552,"--Well, I believe that the cases have diverged on the Eleventh Amendment immunity that is given to the States versus the sovereign immunity of the United States."
1997.96-1400,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,629.552,633.795,"No, but do you take the position that State sovereign immunity in fact is broader than Federal sovereign immunity?"
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,633.795,638.087,"I believe that under the... let me... I think the best way to answer that is, under this Court's--"
1997.96-1400,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,638.087,639.569,"Well, how about a yes or no, and then explain?"
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,647.564,656.179,"--I think it is broader in that the Congress can change the immunity, sovereign immunity of the United States."
1997.96-1400,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,660.503,669.73,"Well, is there any indication that the concept of sovereign immunity understood at the time of The Davis was in fact a weaker concept under the--"
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,669.73,669.98,--No.
1997.96-1400,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,669.98,670.238,--Okay.
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,670.238,687.301,"I... but I also want to add that we're talking here about a vessel that is on the sovereign lands of the State of California, and whose title is being tried, and whose... the State is not making a bound... a baseless claim in this case, and the recent jurisprudence of this Court--"
1997.96-1400,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,687.301,688.55,You say it's on the--
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,699.028,699.987,--Perhaps I misunderstand your question.
1997.96-1400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,709.194,713.708,You have greater sovereignty over the sea bed than you have over the dry land in California?
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,713.708,730.507,"It is held subject to a public trust, a unique trust that all sovereign lands in the State of California are held that are not held, say, on proprietary lands, which may be sold, whereas sovereign lands, it takes a unique statutory scheme to get rid of them."
1997.96-1400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,730.507,731.098,I don't understand.
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,762.719,764.849,"This is a difficult case, Justice Souter."
1997.96-1400,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,768.842,781.312,"Well, is my... I... Coeur D'Alene is fine, but I mean, is there something wrong with the, kind of the equity argument that I just made that if you're going to depend on sovereign lands I think you've got to take the burden as well as the benefit?"
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,781.312,784.834,--I don't see what the burden is here.
1997.96-1400,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,784.834,792.559,The burden is that you are going to be subject to some incidents of in rem jurisdiction.
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,821.727,823.279,A couple of things.
1997.96-1400,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,837.728,849.876,"Well, the reason is that you got this boon out of Congress in 1953, and presumably Congress did not intend to destroy the utility of in rem admiralty actions in the course of doing it."
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,851.457,860.553,"I understand your argument, Justice Souter, but California believes that its title and its regulatory authority transcend questions such as possession."
1997.96-1400,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,860.553,862.865,May I interrupt you with just one question there?
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,878.514,880.055,They are different actions.
1997.96-1400,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,896.707,902.761,"No, but all I'm saying is, is it not... would you not agree that you might lose on the title argument and still win on the regulatory argument?"
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,902.761,903.042,--Correct.
1997.96-1400,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,903.042,903.881,Okay.
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,943.688,949.422,"First question, theoretically yes, but again, I don't see the practical implication of--"
1997.96-1400,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,949.422,958.577,"Title companies... I'm interested in that because, of course, the title insurance companies often raise rates a lot when there's just a theoretical objection, so I'm quite interested."
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,960.587,967.303,--The... I'm not an expert in marine title insurance law.
1997.96-1400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1004.596,1005.227,--I don't understand that.
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,1006.539,1011.842,--Because an... a suit to quiet title is an adjudication of a State's right.
1997.96-1400,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1028.742,1039.509,We're talking here about an in rem action in admiralty which I think has long had special characteristics that might not carry over to bankruptcy or to a quiet title action.
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,1057.133,1057.792,"--No, no, no."
1997.96-1400,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1067.217,1074.213,"Well, but are you equating a quiet title action with this sort of in rem action in admiralty?"
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,1074.213,1084.889,"What I'm saying is... yes, that the... the functional equivalent of the admiralty action is a direct quiet title action against the State."
1997.96-1400,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1084.889,1090.603,"Yes, but the difference, traditionally, is that the in rem action adjudicates title against the world."
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,1102.991,1110.565,But what's the effect of that in rem judgment that Deep Sea Research owns the Brother Jonathan?
1997.96-1400,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1116.74,1118.873,"Well, you can intervene in the case if you want to."
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,1135.313,1138.996,"--Correct, we do, and as a practical matter States are not going to sit back."
1997.96-1400,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1152.503,1159.158,"Isn't that practically the end of such actions, because let's take this case."
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,1177.681,1184.784,"Well, they adjudicate the claims amongst the claimants that are brought into Federal court, but the Eleventh Amendment--"
1997.96-1400,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1184.784,1196.021,"Well, what kind of litigant would be satisfied with the judgment that has a big player looming out there saying, whatever this district court does, it won't touch us and we can reargue the whole thing?"
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,1196.021,1201.777,"--Well, the litigant is going to have to come into State court against the State, and this type of split jurisdiction is not uncommon."
1997.96-1400,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1204.218,1207.06,Do you think your position is entirely consistent with our Treasure Salvors decision?
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,1207.06,1208.84,"--Yes, we do."
1997.96-1400,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1226.101,1227.713,"No, but shouldn't... under your view shouldn't the action have been dismissed?"
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,1232.686,1235.948,"No, the... as to the State of Florida it should have been dismissed."
1997.96-1400,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1235.948,1237.5,"Right, which it was not."
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,1237.5,1238.54,Which it was not.
1997.96-1400,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1238.54,1239.231,Yes.
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,1253.18,1268.329,"It is, but we believe that The Bright case, which purports to say that the Eleventh Amendment does not apply to in rem actions, has very little authority left after the New York number II case, and after Treasure Salvors, which--"
1997.96-1400,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1268.329,1280.648,"Well, except in the... The Bright is very much like this case, is it not, in that what we are dealing with is a res that was not in the possession of the Government, or is that incorrect, or of the State?"
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,1280.648,1284.03,"--No, it was not."
1997.96-1400,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1284.03,1298.41,"You see, in New York I and II you could plausibly make the argument that this was a disguised or ineffective damages remedy against the State, but this was the case that Justice Story relied on in his commentaries."
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,1302.672,1305.603,I believe--
1997.96-1400,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1305.603,1316.151,"But it does indicate the practice at the time was to recognize that admiralty in rem proceedings ought to be able to proceed efficiently, and that is to bind all of the probable claimants."
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,1316.151,1331.331,"--That may have been what Justice Washington was purporting to hold, but again, I think the recent jurisdiction of this Court gets... has gotten away from the type of formalistic, what pigeon hole does the action fit into, and looks at the effect of the judgment on the State."
1997.96-1400,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1331.331,1347.15,"But in New York, both of those cases were... they did repudiate formalism, and they said that in those cases it was basically an in personam action against the State, so I don't think that supports your theory here, because this Court did not treat them as in rem actions."
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,1347.15,1348.151,"That's true, but in the--"
1997.96-1400,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1348.151,1349.912,So why do you cite them for that proposition?
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,1349.912,1353.635,--In the plurality decision in Welch and also in--
1997.96-1400,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1353.635,1357.107,But I'm talking to you about the two Ex parte New York cases.
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,1357.107,1369.796,"--Yes, but the Court in both Welch and in the Treasure Salvors case cites the New York number II for the broad concept that the Eleventh Amendment does apply in in rem actions."
1997.96-1400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1375.951,1378.953,"Why do you think... just to move on there, I mean, there's a few other issues in the case."
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,1380.504,1389.959,--This wreck has been abandoned because under general maritime law as it's developed in this country abandonment can be shown through the passage of time and the failure to salvage on the part of the owner.
1997.96-1400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1399.516,1405.749,"Well, let's assume in the old days, never mind new technology, that a vessel goes down into a coral reef."
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,1425.063,1431.947,"Under general maritime law, there... as it's developed there must be objective steps taken by the owner of that ship to try and salvage it."
1997.96-1400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1431.947,1433.907,If it's... even if it's not salvageable?
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,1433.907,1435.339,Even if it's not salvageable.
1997.96-1400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1435.339,1437.55,What case do you cite for that proposition?
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,1437.55,1440.014,The cases that we cite in--
1997.96-1400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1440.014,1447.347,"You must... the... if I understand, you're saying the law requires you to do what is obviously not doable, is that it?"
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,1447.347,1447.608,--Yes.
1997.96-1400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1448.349,1449.758,The law requires a vain act.
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,1451.751,1456.185,It's a unique aspect of abandonment law because in that case--
1997.96-1400,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1456.185,1456.425,--It certainly is.
1997.96-1400,0,32527,joseph_c_rusconi,,1456.425,1478.709,"--In that case a salvager could come in and take that property and be entitled to a salvage award up to and including the full value of the vessel, and so it's possible under circum... I'm not saying it's likely in that case, but it's possible under the circumstances that by the nonaction or the disappearance of the owner of the vessel that you're talking about it could be abandoned."
1997.96-1400,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1478.709,1479.97,"Thank you, Mr. Rusconi."

1997.96-1400,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1529.244,1533.426,Was this a case within the admiralty jurisdiction of the court?
1997.96-1400,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1533.426,1534.397,This one?
1997.96-1400,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1534.397,1534.808,Yes.
1997.96-1400,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1534.808,1535.129,Yes.
1997.96-1400,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1535.129,1538.441,And the ASA does not change that?
1997.96-1400,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1538.441,1539.54,No.
1997.96-1400,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1541.142,1543.283,So cases under the ASA are within the admiralty jurisdiction of the--
1997.96-1400,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1543.283,1543.523,--No.
1997.96-1400,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1595.756,1621.195,"--Does that mean the Eleventh Amendment objection of the State then becomes active, whereas... and a problem, whereas before we could have displaced it by saying that historically in rem admiralty jurisdiction is sufficient to bind the State, but once we're in... within the Federal question jurisdiction the State then makes the argument that the Eleventh Amendment sort of springs back into play?"
1997.96-1400,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1621.195,1648.0,"That becomes a much more difficult proposition, Justice Kennedy, because what happens in practical effect is that once the State owns it by operation of the Abandoned Shipwreck Act there are other consequences that might flow from admiralty courts' orders, and it might be appropriate at that point for the State to say that the perpetuation and continuation of the suit is in effect an action against the State."
1997.96-1400,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1648.0,1657.177,"Mr. Frederick, do you agree that if the... if this property were in the possession of the State that the Eleventh Amendment would prevent an in rem adjudication of title?"
1997.96-1400,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1657.177,1657.577,Yes.
1997.96-1400,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1706.0,1717.747,"Well, under the Abandoned Shipwreck Act, if it applies, if the requirements are met, does that automatically then put the State in possession of the wreck?"
1997.96-1400,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1717.747,1718.478,No.
1997.96-1400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1728.162,1730.055,"Here, I gather they don't even know where it is."
1997.96-1400,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1730.055,1731.735,"--That's correct, Justice Scalia."
1997.96-1400,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1731.735,1733.796,Do... is that true now?
1997.96-1400,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1745.663,1747.866,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, I believe that is the case."
1997.96-1400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1749.808,1750.639,They're doing it at night in the dark?
1997.96-1400,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1753.701,1770.992,"--Respondent's counsel is better positioned to know what its officials and representatives are doing than I am, but what the district court did here, Justice O'Connor, was to draw a circle basically and to say that the shipwreck is somewhere within that circle, and allow the salvage to proceed."
1997.96-1400,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1815.841,1829.309,"Mr. Frederick, I'm just curious about where the Government saw the light, because you made a rather strong argument in the Ninth Circuit that the Eleventh Amendment does apply, and that... and now you've switched positions on that."
1997.96-1400,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1829.309,1847.151,"Justice Ginsburg, when the Court granted certiorari in this case we carefully examined the requisites of immunity and when immunity is appropriate in in rem actions, and the courts since the Treasure Salvors case have been in confusion over whether or not a colorable claim needs to be asserted."
1997.96-1400,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1864.553,1867.795,So you say Treasure Salvors was wrong?
1997.96-1400,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1867.795,1868.256,No.
1997.96-1400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1882.187,1883.397,"Mr. Alford, I--"
1997.96-1400,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1888.12,1889.51,"Yes, and I... may I--"
1997.96-1400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1889.51,1890.532,"--Abandonment, which--"
1997.96-1400,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1890.532,1891.871,"--Yes, I would like to address abandonment, Justice Scalia."
1997.96-1400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1908.213,1908.694,--Why?
1997.96-1400,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1938.641,1943.246,"--Justice Scalia, if you waited 130 years without attempting--"
1997.96-1400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1947.797,1951.131,You have the insurance companies who paid off the money and who are still in existence.
1997.96-1400,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1951.131,1951.541,Well--
1997.96-1400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1951.541,1953.702,I don't see how 130 years makes any difference.
1997.96-1400,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1969.102,1974.355,"--Justice Scalia, in this case respondents don't even know that it was a silver dollar that they lost."
1997.96-1400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1986.383,1990.336,"Well, but that's a different issue as to whether... that's the issue of who owns it."
1997.96-1400,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1990.336,1991.077,No.
1997.96-1400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1991.077,1994.961,But not the issue of whether the person who owns it has abandoned it or not.
1997.96-1400,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,1994.961,1999.933,You have to know what property you own before you can know whether or not you did not abandon it.
1997.96-1400,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1999.933,2004.765,"But your answer, your answer to Justice Scalia... because he's saying voluntary abandonment."
1997.96-1400,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2029.302,2031.073,"Justice Breyer, I can't give you a firm time."
1997.96-1400,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2031.924,2032.265,Give me a hint.
1997.96-1400,1,20869,david_c_frederick,,2037.887,2038.158,--No.
1997.96-1400,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2038.348,2039.838,What about lives in being plus 21 years?
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2056.15,2057.79,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1400,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2114.488,2122.351,You don't want to go the whole hog and say that in fact there simply is no Eleventh Amendment applicability to an admiralty in rem action?
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2122.351,2128.956,"Your Honor, I do not think that is consistent with this Court's cases, and I certainly don't think it's necessary to decide this case."
1997.96-1400,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2132.41,2132.91,A possession rule.
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2132.91,2144.478,"--A possession rule, that's right, Your Honor, and the possession rule has been applied not only to States but also to foreign sovereigns and to the Federal Government and, you know, the question is, why should any different rule apply to the States?"
1997.96-1400,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2144.478,2147.64,"What does the possession rule mean, strictly speaking?"
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2169.763,2173.266,"Well, I don't think possession and ownership necessarily have to be equated, Your Honor."
1997.96-1400,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2180.341,2180.762,Right.
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2180.762,2189.896,"Then certainly in that case the private party would be deemed to be the one in possession of the boat that is in the slip that it has leased from the Government, but--"
1997.96-1400,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2189.896,2193.679,"Well, can I just vary the Chief Justice's question a little?"
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2214.002,2215.494,"--Well, Your Honor, no, I don't think so."
1997.96-1400,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2243.13,2253.168,"But if they had located them, and had sent a diver down affixing a sign saying, claimed by the State, that would be enough for the possession rule, would it?"
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2253.168,2255.74,"--Well, Your Honor, I think so."
1997.96-1400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2277.114,2278.456,"Well, maybe it doesn't have to send a diver down."
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2283.86,2288.511,"Well, Your Honor, there has to be some act of physical dominion and control."
1997.96-1400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2288.511,2291.193,"Well, I mean, the rock hits the... it lands right on the deck."
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2299.248,2301.19,"Your Honor, I do think that would be sufficient."
1997.96-1400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2311.107,2312.567,"Well, you're not talking about possession, then."
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2316.919,2317.89,"No, Your Honor."
1997.96-1400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2318.211,2320.462,I thought possession and an assertion of ownership are two different things.
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2320.462,2329.408,"--They absolutely are, Your Honor, but taking physical... some act that shows physical dominion over the property I think is possession."
1997.96-1400,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2329.408,2333.871,"Well, why would posting a buoy above it be an act of possession?"
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2333.871,2340.654,"Well, Your Honor, traditionally that's the way that it's indicated in the admiralty law with the case of sunken property."
1997.96-1400,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2365.171,2366.974,Are you going to talk about the abandonment issue?
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2366.974,2368.143,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.96-1400,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2397.002,2403.766,"Well, can we infer a voluntary relinquishment simply on the basis of insufficient activity to pursue the claim?"
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2421.04,2425.04,"I agree certainly, Your Honor, that abandonment can be inferred from the circumstances."
1997.96-1400,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2436.299,2440.091,But you have it in your adverse possession all the time in real estate.
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2444.695,2457.472,"--That's true, Your Honor, but it's my understanding in those cases that the possession has to be open and notorious, such that it would give any claimant notice that another person is occupying the property, and that's certainly not the case here."
1997.96-1400,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2459.285,2461.115,"Well, except you know you've lost something."
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2461.115,2463.936,"--You certainly know you've lost something, Your Honor, that's correct."
1997.96-1400,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2463.936,2473.532,"Under your rule, I... if there has to be some voluntary act relinquishing all claim of title, I suppose that no one would ever do that."
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2473.532,2475.132,"Well, Your Honor--"
1997.96-1400,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2475.132,2479.998,"You'd teach a child when you're 3 years old, don't ever abandon that dollar in the steam grate, because some day it might be yours."
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2482.138,2483.568,--I agree with Your Honor.
1997.96-1400,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2501.8,2505.243,What about the Park Service that they quote in the amicus brief?
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2547.144,2554.517,"Well, Your Honor, there has to be some evidence that there is a relinquishment of ownership or, on the converse, there has to be some evidence."
1997.96-1400,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2554.517,2557.018,"The evidence is, they never marked it."
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2570.987,2574.089,"Well, Your Honor, the problem is we don't know whether that's this case."
1997.96-1400,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2575.912,2587.51,"Well, so far as the standard is concerned, are you... are we trying to find a subjective state of mind, or are we trying to determine what objectively is reasonable so far as ownership of ancient property?"
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2587.51,2590.17,"--Well, Your Honor, I think it's part of both."
1997.96-1400,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2597.704,2601.758,"Well, subjective, I'm never sure... I'm not sure you're ever going to be able to show it."
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2601.758,2605.041,"I think you can, Your Honor."
1997.96-1400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2613.556,2614.688,You don't mean subjective.
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2623.553,2629.658,"Well, Your Honor, I think the fundamental issue is, is the owner's intent, but certainly the court can look to objective factors and--"
1997.96-1400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2629.658,2630.816,So your answer to my question is yes.
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2643.385,2643.896,"--No, Your Honor."
1997.96-1400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2643.896,2644.547,Of course not.
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2648.118,2649.48,That's right.
1997.96-1400,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2652.662,2673.195,"Well, but that's exactly contrary to the--"
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2675.326,2684.853,"If I understand Your Honor's question correctly, yes, I think it is... ultimately that subjective intent is the key issue, but it can be proven by objective factors."
1997.96-1400,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2684.853,2687.144,"Well, so here, whose intent do we look for?"
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2695.208,2697.492,"I think it's that, Your Honor, but it's also more."
1997.96-1400,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2705.767,2711.189,"Well, the present claimants claim only by virtue of an assignment from the insurance company, don't they?"
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2711.189,2711.7,--No.
1997.96-1400,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2717.033,2722.747,"Yes, but don't your clients, or at least some of them, claim by virtue of assignment from the insurance company?"
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2722.747,2723.398,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-1400,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2726.392,2727.602,"Yes, but--"
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2727.602,2727.963,--but it's a claim based on Federal law.
1997.96-1400,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2727.963,2732.404,--let's analyze the claim that you get by assignment from the insurance company.
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2740.031,2742.943,"I think it's the intent of the company as a whole, Your Honor, and I think--"
1997.96-1400,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2742.943,2743.704,And how do we find that out?
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2743.704,2756.99,"--Factors that the court can consider... well, I think it would be inappropriate for the Court to constrain the district court's discretion in this regard, but, for example, factors the district court might consider are whether the insurance company's ever made any effort to locate the vessel--"
1997.96-1400,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2756.99,2758.723,"Well, now we're talking about objective factors."
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2758.723,2759.291,--That's right.
1997.96-1400,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2759.291,2763.075,"But you say the subjective intent we're looking for is the,"
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2765.729,2781.568,"That's correct, Your Honor, but as evidenced by objective factors, and I think the objective factors in this case, for instance, could include whether the company ever made any effort to locate the vessel, whether they... whether it was technologically feasible for them to locate the vessel, whether they wrote it off as a loss on their books--"
1997.96-1400,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2781.568,2788.272,"It seems to me we can almost take judicial notice that no one, especially an insurance company, ever wants to give up claim of ownership to anything it might have."
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2790.443,2801.591,"--Well, Your Honor, I assume that's true, but again I think there's a fundamental distinction here between property that's lost and property that is abandoned, and property that's lost is not necessarily abandoned."
1997.96-1400,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2806.805,2812.089,"Well now, let's talk specifically about the property here."
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2824.738,2826.256,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-1400,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2829.779,2841.367,"And so do we look at specific pieces of property to determine whether that property has been abandoned, or do we treat it as a whole somehow?"
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2841.367,2844.65,"Your Honor, I think it has to be treated as a whole, particularly under the ASA."
1997.96-1400,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2844.65,2844.79,Why?
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2863.7,2871.227,"Your Honor, under the Abandoned Shipwreck Act, section 2102(e), I believe, of the act, it defines a shipwreck as"
1997.96-1400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2883.075,2884.156,"Well, which way do you treat it?"
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2892.971,2894.694,"Your Honor, I think--"
1997.96-1400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2894.694,2896.304,Is there any reason to pick one rather than the other?
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2896.304,2897.486,"--Well, there is, Your Honor, because--"
1997.96-1400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2897.486,2897.884,What's that?
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2897.884,2910.293,"--Because if the court finds that because part of the property was abandoned the entire property is abandoned, then you certainly have a takings problem, particularly in a context like this, where no notice was given to particular claimants."
1997.96-1400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2910.293,2911.124,I see.
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2911.124,2920.451,"That's why it was essential for the district court to find at this stage that the wreck was not abandoned, because there was no notice to potential claimants."
1997.96-1400,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2920.451,2923.014,Was that a preliminary finding of some kind?
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2926.468,2927.416,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-1400,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2946.86,2950.701,How do you read the Ninth Circuit opinion on the abandonment issue?
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2952.553,2954.114,"I don't think the Ninth Circuit did, Your Honor."
1997.96-1400,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2981.213,2991.009,"May I ask you, under your view of abandonment, was the gold in the hull of the ship that was involved in the Treasure Salvors case abandoned by the Spanish?"
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2991.009,2993.4,"Your Honor, I--"
1997.96-1400,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2993.4,2998.112,"There's no evidence of affirmative, you know, voluntary relinquishment of interest in all that money."
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,2998.112,2998.603,--Right.
1997.96-1400,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3001.705,3002.416,"Well, let me give them to you, then."
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3012.164,3016.755,"--I believe so, Your Honor, because it's my understanding the Government did not come forward after notice in that case."
1997.96-1400,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3017.727,3020.95,"The abandonment took place after the finding of the vessel, then."
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3020.95,3027.401,"--Well, the finding of abandonment was appropriate once the court issued notice to the public and no claimants came forward."
1997.96-1400,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3027.401,3028.643,"No, but I don't... the word finding was bad."
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3034.136,3037.138,"I don't know the answer to that question, Your Honor."
1997.96-1400,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3037.508,3042.662,"It seems to me it's precisely the same situation we have here, except instead of Spanish gold it's American dollars."
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3042.662,3048.896,"Well, the critical difference, Your Honor, is that in Treasure Salvors notice was given to the public and no one came forward claiming ownership."
1997.96-1400,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3049.637,3053.298,"But that's almost a default type of thing rather than abandonment, isn't it?"
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3053.298,3054.569,"--Well, Your Honor--"
1997.96-1400,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3054.569,3056.511,Default of judicial proceedings.
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3056.511,3058.073,"--That's true, Your Honor."
1997.96-1400,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3061.105,3061.535,"Well, no."
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3072.261,3085.53,"That's correct, Your Honor, but I think the issues are related in at least one respect and that is, in a sense, if notice was given to the public and no one comes forward claiming the property, that is, I think, powerful evidence that the property is abandoned."
1997.96-1400,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3091.713,3098.438,"But if we have a rule like the Ninth Circuit rule, which is bothering me, what we do about the Ninth Circuit's statement?"
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3139.105,3141.926,"No, Your Honor, I do not think you're right in that worry."
1997.96-1400,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3151.893,3158.768,"No, no, somebody's great-great-grandmother had some cargo and she left a will, and those things can be traced."
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3178.241,3188.048,"--Well, Your Honor, I think the passage of time in itself, without anything more, is not sufficient to infer abandonment where claimants actually come forward."
1997.96-1400,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3201.047,3203.879,That's consistent with what I take it to be your answer to Justice Stevens.
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3212.484,3213.834,"--No, Your Honor."
1997.96-1400,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3213.834,3216.656,And that seems to me a very extraordinary position.
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3216.656,3217.768,"No, Your Honor."
1997.96-1400,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3228.486,3239.515,Would it be fair to say that it's your point that the Spanish are not foreclosed unless it has been shown that they affirmatively took some act to abandon?
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3239.515,3240.106,"--No, Your Honor."
1997.96-1400,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3247.379,3257.867,"Now, if, in fact, this shipwreck was abandoned, if at the bottom line that's the finding, then your clients are just out, I take it."
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3279.831,3282.512,"That's exactly correct, Your Honor, because of the operation of the Abandoned Shipwreck Act."
1997.96-1400,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3282.512,3283.844,May I ask just one other question?
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3304.016,3330.674,"Well, Your Honor, on the first question, I think we have to start from the presumption that Congress did not intend to change the fundamental concept of abandonment that has been applied for years both in the common law and in the general maritime law, and indeed that Congress is not free to define abandonment in some way other than as a voluntary process, and there's no evidence, certainly, in the legislative record that Congress intended to depart from the traditional standard of abandonment."
1997.96-1400,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3332.073,3335.266,But there is evidence that they thought the statute would apply to a large number of vessels.
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3335.266,3336.287,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-1400,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3336.287,3338.869,"And I don't think, under your view, it would apply to any."
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3338.869,3341.31,"Well, I respectfully disagree, Your Honor."
1997.96-1400,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3350.816,3353.429,"But that's the line that you draw... for example, the United States."
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3358.892,3361.495,"Well, we don't know yet, Your Honor, and that's the problem."
1997.96-1400,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3363.206,3364.395,But suppose that's the case.
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3385.679,3389.061,"Your Honor, an inference of abandonment might well be appropriate in those circumstances."
1997.96-1400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3389.061,3390.053,"Well, not against a sovereign."
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3392.575,3392.926,"Well, that's true."
1997.96-1400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3394.138,3396.118,Abandonment never applies against a sovereign.
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3396.118,3401.373,"--That's right, but barring that, that complication, I think an inference of abandonment would be appropriate."
1997.96-1400,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3401.373,3404.155,The United States might well be on the other side of this issue if there were not that convenient rule.
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3404.155,3405.544,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1997.96-1400,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3405.955,3417.402,"But you say it's all or nothing, that the fact that the Federal Government hasn't abandoned the gold under legal theory means nothing, because we're going to look at this as one unit."
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3417.402,3418.243,"Well, Your Honor--"
1997.96-1400,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3418.243,3420.834,And it's just too bad for the United States.
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3420.834,3424.388,"--No, to the contrary, Your Honor, the United States claim is preserved."
1997.96-1400,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3428.579,3434.723,"But your position was that it can't... it isn't severable, that the abandonment is of the wreck and all it's contents, or nothing."
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3434.723,3435.514,"Well, Your Honor."
1997.96-1400,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3435.514,3436.085,It's all or nothing.
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3437.174,3438.937,It's all or nothing if one--
1997.96-1400,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3438.937,3439.668,Can't parcel it out.
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3444.991,3454.747,"--Your Honor, I partly agree with that, and I say partly because it would be inappropriate for this Court to say that because part of the property on the wreck is abandoned the whole thing is abandoned."
1997.96-1400,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3458.439,3459.605,"Thank you, Mr. Alford."
1997.96-1400,2,23510,fletcher_c_alford,,3459.605,3460.005,Thank you.
1997.96-1400,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3460.005,3461.088,The case is submitted.
