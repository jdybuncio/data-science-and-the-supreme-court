1973.73-718,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,19.328,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in number 73-718, Bangor Punta Operations against Bangor & Aroostook Railroad."
1973.73-718,0,32552,james_v_ryan,,19.328,23.729,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-718,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,208.227,217.759,Mr. Ryan do you meet the Court of Appeals holding as applicable to the State Law accounts as well as the Federal question?
1973.73-718,0,32552,james_v_ryan,,217.759,218.774,Yes sir.
1973.73-718,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,218.774,219.205,Both.
1973.73-718,0,32552,james_v_ryan,,219.205,220.361,Yes sir.
1973.73-718,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,220.361,223.375,Is there any Maine law that supports that?
1973.73-718,0,32552,james_v_ryan,,223.375,224.907,Yes sir and the --
1973.73-718,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,224.907,226.866,That supports the holding of the Court of Appeal?
1973.73-718,0,32552,james_v_ryan,,226.866,232.339,"No not at holding the Court of Appeals do not know sir, no excuse me I misunderstood your complaint, your question."
1973.73-718,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,451.508,468.311,"If the action is border in the name of the corporation not in the name of Amoskeag you say that Amoskeag gets the real party in interest but originally you do not look behind a corporate plaintiffs to see who the stockholders are in order to determine who are the real party in interest is, do you?"
1973.73-718,0,32552,james_v_ryan,,468.311,471.603,"I think the answer to that is yes, generally that is so."
1973.73-718,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,488.251,491.436,Why do you say that?
1973.73-718,0,32552,james_v_ryan,,491.436,511.118,"Well, it's difficult for me to understand how one can say that a 99% shareholder or affect you can violate rules of law regarding a subsidiary person strictly injured."
1973.73-718,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,524.217,537.341,Then what you really saying is that whatever Bangor Punta did to the railroad at the time they owned 99% of stock really wasn't actionable on the part of railroad even then?
1973.73-718,0,32552,james_v_ryan,,537.341,541.694,Correct exactly because so --
1973.73-718,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,541.694,547.413,"Mr. Ryan who were the parties that were really wronged here, the former shareholders?"
1973.73-718,0,32552,james_v_ryan,,547.413,553.564,"The seven-tenths of 1%, you see Bangor Punta owned in affect 99%."
1973.73-718,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,553.564,556.569,Have they ever instituted any kind of action at all?
1973.73-718,0,32552,james_v_ryan,,556.569,557.961,No sir.
1973.73-718,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,557.961,567.622,Would the situation be different in your view if Amoskeag owned only 75% of the stock?
1973.73-718,0,32552,james_v_ryan,,567.622,570.93,"It could be the same, it could be different depending upon the facts."
1973.73-718,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,597.675,605.587,"Something would depend on when the other 25% had acquired their stock, wouldn't it in answer of Mr. Justice Blackmun's question?"
1973.73-718,0,32552,james_v_ryan,,605.587,615.269,"It could, if they acquired their stock after the events, they would have the same disability that Amoskeag would have, but I assumed --"
1973.73-718,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,615.269,616.237,In contrary?
1973.73-718,0,32552,james_v_ryan,,616.237,617.178,That is right.
1973.73-718,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,617.178,630.283,But if a Bangor Punta had been be only a 75% owner rather than a 99% owner at the time this thing was going on then conceivably the other 25% might have a very legitimate point?
1973.73-718,0,32552,james_v_ryan,,630.283,630.714,Oh!
1973.73-718,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,633.832,636.308,And that would be a typical minority stockholder suit?
1973.73-718,0,32552,james_v_ryan,,636.308,636.759,That's correct.
1973.73-718,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,638.599,642.624,And it would not accrue to the benefit of the railroad or would it?
1973.73-718,0,32552,james_v_ryan,,642.624,643.301,It could.
1973.73-718,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,718.435,723.066,"Certainly Rule 23 by its turn as no bearing on this action, does it?"
1973.73-718,0,32552,james_v_ryan,,723.066,725.467,Only if Amoskeag sued.
1973.73-718,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,725.467,727.299,"Yeah, but Amoskeag didn't sue."
1973.73-718,0,32552,james_v_ryan,,727.299,728.079,That is correct.
1973.73-718,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1137.77,1141.151,Well Mr. Ryan.
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,1143.059,1146.61,Mr Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-718,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1196.907,1200.899,Who else would get the benefit of this windfall?
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,1200.899,1208.091,Probably I believe is the interest which the First Circuit found would benefit from this.
1973.73-718,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1208.091,1210.093,Just how would you analyze -- (Voice Overlap)
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,1210.093,1224.156,"Yes sir, I think the record well illustrates the fact that the present owners of the Railroad Amoskeag are engaged in the process of developing a Northern New England Rail system."
1973.73-718,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1265.05,1270.854,Would they have any legal obligation to dedicate this windfall to that --?
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,1270.854,1272.581,They don't have any legal obligation.
1973.73-718,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1326.03,1333.05,"Am I am correct Mr. Lefkowitz the First Circuit, however, imposed no such condition as to the use of funds?"
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,1333.05,1344.992,They strongly suggested that it could be they didn't because I think they were leaving that Mr. Justice Blackmun to the District Court if there should be a recovery.
1973.73-718,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1357.136,1367.939,"Mr. Lefkowitz, how much of the holding of the Court of Appeals, does it disagree with Judge Gnew on Maine law?"
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,1367.939,1385.917,"As I understand, it really very little -- i think the main part of the Court of Appeals' holding goes to the heart of the separate identifiable interest of the public in the railroad as contrasted with the interest of only it's controlling stockholder."
1973.73-718,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1385.917,1389.143,And that's in no respect to Maine law?
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,1389.143,1390.542,That is supported by Maine law.
1973.73-718,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1418.644,1428.579,"Well do you concede that the propriety of Judge Gnew's ruling if this were the Alpha, Delta, Widget Company rather than a Railroad?"
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,1428.579,1431.018,I think that and I thought a lot about this.
1973.73-718,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1495.823,1500.762,Under Maine Law are there dividends regulated in any way?
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,1500.762,1507.566,As far as I know not except in the usual course which is that they can in para capitals.
1973.73-718,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1507.566,1508.324,"No, other -- no other --"
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,1508.324,1510.622,There is no other regulation--
1973.73-718,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1510.622,1518.603,Not the kind of regulation you tab over an electric utility for example on requirement to put their earnings back into reduced rates?
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,1518.603,1520.287,Not that I know off sir under Maine Law.
1973.73-718,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1544.28,1562.429,"Mr. Lefkowitz even as to the Federal counts, the Securities and Exchange Act -- now is it your view that independently of Maine Law there is a Federal --?"
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,1562.429,1562.948,Yes sir.
1973.73-718,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1562.948,1563.603,(Voice Overlap) is applicable?
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,1563.603,1568.12,Yes sir very much so and we tried to point that out in our brief.
1973.73-718,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1585.63,1597.779,"So that even if Maine Law would disagree with the Court of Appeals, you still say that the Court of Appeals would be right as to the counts with threshold of Federal Law."
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,1597.779,1601.295,Yes sir and I think that the use of Rule 23 --
1973.73-718,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1601.295,1603.357,One other thing Mr. Lefkowitz?
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,1608.732,1609.285,Yes sir.
1973.73-718,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1609.285,1613.926,It permits the Federal courts to ask the Maine Supreme Court that what is Maine Law?
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,1613.926,1614.822,Yes sir.
1973.73-718,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1614.822,1625.567,Did -- was it ever suggested to the First Circuit that perhaps as to the Maine Law accounts at least that there ought to be that certification here?
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,1625.567,1627.747,No sir it was not suggested as to those.
1973.73-718,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1632.671,1642.306,"Well, that's my difficulty, but you have got 13 counts here which I think five at least are state law counts, on the worst condition --"
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,1642.306,1644.133,Those are the basically counts that are --
1973.73-718,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1644.133,1651.425,"You have the Maine Public Utilities Law, you have two or three common law counts which I gather must mean that Maine Common Law?"
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,1651.425,1653.629,Yes sir.
1973.73-718,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1656.196,1663.531,Don't you think this is the sort of thing that extended -- turns on Maine law that we ought to ask that Court of Appeals might have asked --
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,1663.531,1663.827,As to those --
1973.73-718,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1663.827,1666.319,-- the Supreme Court what the Maine law is?
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,1666.319,1687.809,"As to those counts under Maine Law for convergence and violation of the statue under Maine Law, by possibly the Court of Appeals could have asked that, but I think again we are getting away from the main aspect of this case which is that this is the railroad suing to right the wrongs that was done to it."
1973.73-718,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1736.645,1738.203,As interest?
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,1738.203,1741.995,Yes sir the present innocent controlling stockholder Justice White.
1973.73-718,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1894.575,1910.244,What was the one percent it wasn't control by Bangor Punta had brought a minority stockholders action while Bangor Punta owned 99% and forced in effect the corporation to sue on the same count your suing on now.
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,1921.46,1923.548,It would have inured to the benefit of the corporation.
1973.73-718,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1966.735,1973.187,"Well to the extent that it would have enhanced the value of the stock, Amoskeag would have to pay more for it than when it bought it?"
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,1973.187,1975.102,"Yeah, that's what I am saying, I really don't know."
1973.73-718,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1983.904,1988.245,"Well because that wouldn't be treated on the books as increase in earnings, where they would have been --"
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,1988.245,1998.807,"I think ICC accounting, it may have to be treated that way, but as you are speaking, so I think that it will enhance perhaps the value of the assets."
1973.73-718,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1998.807,2004.515,"It would certainly increase -- it was 15 million dollars more in the corporation, it would be certainly increase the net worth?"
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,2004.515,2006.084,Yes sir it would.
1973.73-718,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2006.084,2007.311,And that's would have some effect --
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,2007.311,2024.285,"That would have some effect upon what they -- I wish to emphasize incidentally that although there is -- Amoskeag paid five million for the stock and there is a recovery you cited, it's not seven million dollars, that's when you add up all the various kinds together."
1973.73-718,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2029.881,2044.963,"If there is one percent minority stockholders had brought a derivative suit and recovered substantially long before this new transaction, a new purchaser would have to pay quite a bit higher price for the Railroad, wouldn't they?"
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,2044.963,2047.31,That's what I am not clear about Mr. Justice Burger.
1973.73-718,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2047.806,2055.681,I suppose hypothetically there was a -- in the derivative of stockholders suit there was a five million dollar recovery?
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,2055.681,2057.596,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-718,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2057.596,2064.012,"You suggest there is any doubt, but that would increase the value and therefore the probable asking purchase price?"
1973.73-718,1,16391,alan_l_lefkowitz,,2064.012,2068.114,"Would be higher, indeed might be, and probably would."
1973.73-718,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2260.547,2261.386,Mr. Ryan.
1973.73-718,2,32552,james_v_ryan,,2261.386,2268.695,Just two points; Mr. Justice Brennan on the question as to whether a certification would have been required here.
1973.73-718,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2287.224,2294.969,"Well, I gather each of you insist that the Maine law is federal in your favor?(Voice Overlap)"
1973.73-718,2,32552,james_v_ryan,,2294.969,2296.612,"I address your attention to the point four, Your Honor."
1973.73-718,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2296.612,2303.412,"Well I know, but so you say and Mr. Lefkowitz cite to something else what he says is settles the law on his side of it."
1973.73-718,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2307.859,2321.408,"Mr. Ryan, let's assume for the moment that someone has removed assets from the corporation illegally, and has assets to the corporation that he has converted to his own use."
1973.73-718,2,32552,james_v_ryan,,2335.002,2336.865,"Well, I think you use any windfall --"
1973.73-718,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2336.865,2344.9,"You said as windfall, but so that may be, but if the assets are not recovered it's a windfall to a wrong doer?"
1973.73-718,2,32552,james_v_ryan,,2344.9,2352.427,"Well, I know why are the -- the person who practice the corporation, purchases the balance sheet, and a balance sheet --"
1973.73-718,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2352.427,2356.296,"Conceding the windfall, Mr. Ryan?"
1973.73-718,2,32552,james_v_ryan,,2356.296,2366.065,"The party is an uninjured party and if you are going to permit uninjured parties to maintain action to recover alleged deprivations of assets, well then --"
1973.73-718,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2366.065,2373.105,"Well what could you do with all the assets that have been illegally converted, leave them with them the wrong doer?"
1973.73-718,2,32552,james_v_ryan,,2373.105,2377.037,I don't -- I think it's you can't say they have been illegally converted.
1973.73-718,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2377.037,2377.369,Let's assume --
1973.73-718,2,32552,james_v_ryan,,2377.369,2378.952,"Well, assume that they are illegally converted --"
1973.73-718,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2378.952,2379.296,Well that's what the lawsuit is all about?
1973.73-718,2,32552,james_v_ryan,,2379.296,2382.925,"I say that, there maybe people who could maintain the action."
1973.73-718,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2390.568,2407.092,"The Corporation -- the corporation normally represents all the people who are interested as a corporation, and that one percent would certainly benefit if the corporation recovered these illegally converted assets if they have been illegally converted, but that is what the lawsuit is all about?"
1973.73-718,2,32552,james_v_ryan,,2407.092,2411.777,"That is quite true, but I think when you look at this corporation, you look at what?"
1973.73-718,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2416.4,2420.321,"But you are just arguing again that it is a windfall, and I am asking why?"
1973.73-718,2,32552,james_v_ryan,,2420.321,2421.47,"Essentially yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-718,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2421.47,2431.999,I am asking why prefer the wrong doer to someone who might receive windfall -- an innocent party might receive a windfall?
1973.73-718,2,32552,james_v_ryan,,2431.999,2452.012,"Well, the only way I guess, I could answer that if you are going to permit that type of a situation, then you are going to have a lot of people going around bringing lawsuits, who haven't been injured, but are going to re-rectifying wrongs and you know, if you are going to find a lot people who are going to be able -- who are going to want to go around and sue for $5,000,000 and they haven't been injured."
1973.73-718,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2460.766,2480.237,Well I take it you would have the same -- you would have the same -- take the same position if there have been a 100 stockholders of the old corporation and then there had been mismanagement and alleged conversion of assets and then a 100 all sold-out to Amoskeag?
1973.73-718,2,32552,james_v_ryan,,2480.237,2481.342,"Then, you are changing it."
1973.73-718,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2486.09,2487.49,How about my question now?
1973.73-718,2,32552,james_v_ryan,,2499.741,2502.413,I think you would have to evaluate each transaction.
1973.73-718,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2527.284,2542.55,"That's a critical part of your position I take it that not only is their sole stockholder now, who did not own a stock when the wrong was done, but there was a sole, in effect a sole stockholder when the wrong was done?"
1973.73-718,2,32552,james_v_ryan,,2542.55,2547.658,I think that there is no injured party before the Court.
1973.73-718,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2563.489,2564.135,"Thank you, gentlemen."
