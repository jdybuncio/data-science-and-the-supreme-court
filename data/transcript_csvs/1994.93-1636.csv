1994.93-1636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.956,"We'll hear argument now in Number 93-1636, Tom Swint v. the Chambers County Commission."
1994.93-1636,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,11.322,13.641,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.93-1636,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,108.185,122.029,"Mr. McDuff, could the district court judge have certified an appeal on this issue if it determined that judicial economy would be served by that?"
1994.93-1636,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,122.029,122.329,Yes.
1994.93-1636,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,123.412,125.814,Was the district judge asked to do that?
1994.93-1636,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,125.814,126.114,No.
1994.93-1636,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,126.114,126.564,No.
1994.93-1636,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,126.564,142.959,"And I... I guess my opponents can speak to this better than I, but I assume he was not asked because, under existing Eleventh Circuit case law, the court of appeals had discretionary pendent review, and there was no need to take the district judge's time with a request for certification."
1994.93-1636,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,147.846,157.702,"Suppose the district judge had been asked and then... and refused to certify under 1292(b), could the Eleventh Circuit nonetheless exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction?"
1994.93-1636,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,157.702,159.235,"--Yes, I think so."
1994.93-1636,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,159.235,159.654,Under the--
1994.93-1636,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,159.654,161.47,"Under our view, yes, that's correct."
1994.93-1636,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,161.47,179.199,"--Perhaps this is a question better reserved for your opponent, but when... when the question of pendent appellate jurisdiction drawing in other parties came up for the district courts, Congress provided the solution in 1367, is it, in 1990."
1994.93-1636,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,186.387,201.414,"Because I think the situation in 1367 is very different, because there you're talking about parties who are not... who at least prior to 1367 were viewed by this Court in the Findley case as not even being properly in Federal court."
1994.93-1636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,246.01,252.664,"Mr. McDuff, it must be hard to argue a case where your opponent has not disagreed with you on the issue--"
1994.93-1636,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,279.931,285.985,"Because I think 1292(b) is a very different... well, let me answer it this way."
1994.93-1636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,303.347,310.952,"--Well, sure it does, but the basic reason why you assert pendent jurisdiction exists under 1291 is exactly the same."
1994.93-1636,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,319.974,324.712,"But in a certified question, there is not a preexisting appeal."
1994.93-1636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,369.324,370.291,I wouldn't make that argument.
1994.93-1636,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,379.78,381.215,But it seems to--
1994.93-1636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,381.215,384.501,"Have a lower court ask for them to be resolved, but if he doesn't--"
1994.93-1636,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,384.501,402.295,"--It seems to us to be rather strange to have the notion of under 1291 an appeal that already is validly before the court of appeals... that is, the qualified immunity appeal in this case... yet the court of appeals has to have the permission, in effect, of the district judge in order to consider any other issues in the case."
1994.93-1636,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,402.295,406.914,"--Why isn't the answer to that Abney, which was on the books when 1292(b) was--"
1994.93-1636,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,406.914,407.616,I'm sorry.
1994.93-1636,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,407.616,415.603,"--Why isn't the answer to that the holding in Abney, which was on the books when 1292(b) was enacted by Congress?"
1994.93-1636,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,415.603,422.209,"We've got three answers to Abney, and let me, if I can, spin them out very quickly."
1994.93-1636,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,469.772,497.757,"Well, that would be a point to be considered, but it's also the case that we're trying... or if our object is to consider what Congress' understanding of the scope of 1291 and 1292(b) might be, the fact that Abney came first before the enactment of 1292(b) would be a reason, whatever its soundness, for assuming that Congress intended the exclusive means of getting these related cases... related issues to beat 1292(b)."
1994.93-1636,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,497.757,500.709,"I'm sorry, I misunderstood your point earlier, and I see it now."
1994.93-1636,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,517.169,518.486,"I mean, why should we make that assumption?"
1994.93-1636,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,526.859,531.513,--But Abney does not contain a very thorough discussion of this issue.
1994.93-1636,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,611.049,619.905,"That's the very purpose of a final judgment rule that says, you reserve all of your objections all the way down the line, and then you have an appeal from the final judgment."
1994.93-1636,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,626.759,627.192,That's correct.
1994.93-1636,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,627.192,627.642,Your opponent did.
1994.93-1636,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,627.642,628.142,That's correct.
1994.93-1636,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,628.142,645.52,"And perhaps we ought to let you address the next question you have and ask your opponent, who was responsible for bringing the pendent claim urging the Eleventh Circuit to take it, to continue with the 1292(B)/1291 question."
1994.93-1636,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,645.52,646.053,Very well.
1994.93-1636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,646.053,648.122,Although you are aiding and abetting him.
1994.93-1636,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,651.774,652.626,We were forced to.
1994.93-1636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,688.632,689.682,Mr. McDuff--
1994.93-1636,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,689.682,690.115,--Yes.
1994.93-1636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,690.115,700.273,--ordinarily we give great deference to the determination of a court of appeals that reviews cases from a State like Alabama regularly as to what Alabama law is.
1994.93-1636,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,708.979,729.709,"Mr. Chief Justice, we don't... we don't say that they were wrong in saying what Alabama law means as a matter of State law, but we are saying, given what Alabama law is and what the Eleventh Circuit said it is, it has a different result in terms of the Federal law than the Eleventh Circuit said it did."
1994.93-1636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,746.469,764.43,"Well, you would agree, then, that whatever the Eleventh Circuit said, if the sheriff is enforcing Alabama State law rather than the policy of the county law, that that would be binding, but you say the Eleventh Circuit was wrong, it was the consequences of that for the 1983 action?"
1994.93-1636,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,764.43,766.863,"No, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that."
1994.93-1636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,784.927,793.348,"I would think it would be preeminently a question of State law as to where the sheriff derives his authority, where does the policy come from that he enforces."
1994.93-1636,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,795.7,804.971,I think... we perceive that as a conclusion that the Eleventh Circuit drew from the givens of Alabama law.
1994.93-1636,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,849.933,855.837,This sheriff has Eleventh Amendment immunity for suits against him in his official capacity.
1994.93-1636,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,855.837,863.324,"--Well, that's what the district court actually said in an early order in this case when it dismissed the sheriff in his official capacity."
1994.93-1636,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,879.917,882.869,I thought there were holdings to that effect in the Eleventh Circuit.
1994.93-1636,0,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,887.921,907.834,"The only one I'm aware of is... and this is the one that pertains to Alabama... is the one in Parker v. Williams, and at the end of that footnote the Eleventh Circuit says, now, to the extent the sheriff is being sued in his official capacity as a representative of the county, we don't need to pass on that because the county is a defendant in Parker v. Williams anyway."
1994.93-1636,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,930.1,931.65,"Very well, Mr. McDuff."
1994.93-1636,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,932.866,945.824,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1994.93-1636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1013.268,1025.76,"Are you saying, then, the county can... if the sheriff decides he wants to do one thing that he thinks the law requires, can the board of supervisors say no, you're wrong on that?"
1994.93-1636,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1025.76,1032.347,"--My understanding is that the board of... the county commissioners do not exercise supervisory authority over the sheriff, but... and the court--"
1994.93-1636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1032.347,1036.132,Then why do you say it's the policy of the board of supervisors that he's carrying out?
1994.93-1636,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1036.132,1040.618,"--No, our... we think that the court of appeals and the respondent make this mistake."
1994.93-1636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1100.058,1104.61,"Well, how would the county exercise law enforcement authority--"
1994.93-1636,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1104.61,1104.976,It's--
1994.93-1636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1104.976,1108.062,--other than by the commissioners or by the sheriff?
1994.93-1636,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1108.062,1111.716,--Our view is it's the sheriff that exercises law enforcement authority for the county.
1994.93-1636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1148.889,1155.728,Couldn't State officers also be elected by subunits of the State?
1994.93-1636,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1155.728,1158.596,"I would say this, there... what we looked--"
1994.93-1636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1158.596,1163.648,"I mean, the fact that he's elected by the county doesn't necessarily show that he's not a State officer."
1994.93-1636,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1163.648,1178.491,"--I would say this, these factors: first, he's elected by the county for the purpose of exercising authority within the county, so he's not like a State legislator who is sent to the State capital, so he is exercising final policymaking authority within the county."
1994.93-1636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1192.401,1199.555,Doesn't the... don't the Alabama statutes say something about what the sheriff shall do?
1994.93-1636,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1199.555,1199.855,--Yes.
1994.93-1636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1205.959,1208.077,Do they say nothing more than that?
1994.93-1636,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1208.077,1210.296,"--Well, they say... they say a number of things."
1994.93-1636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1230.507,1233.728,"Well, I mean, so does a prosecutor."
1994.93-1636,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1233.728,1234.711,"Well, actually--"
1994.93-1636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1234.711,1237.263,"I mean, a Federal prosecutor doesn't normally--"
1994.93-1636,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1237.263,1246.802,"--Well, Federal prosecutors are subject, of course, to the command structure of the Department of Justice, I might refer to it... as I might refer to it, and actually in Alabama county--"
1994.93-1636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1246.802,1253.123,"--Smilingly, as... I mean, I assume they have an enormous amount of independence."
1994.93-1636,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1253.123,1262.478,"--Well, but as a legal matter the Governor of Alabama cannot remove a sheriff of Chambers County."
1994.93-1636,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1298.084,1308.459,"Mr. Wolfson, you relied on three factors, the election, his salary is paid by the county, the expenses of his office are paid by the salary... by the county."
1994.93-1636,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1316.465,1325.238,--I think those three factors are enough if there is nothing on the other side of the coin that says that he must follow higher authority from the State.
1994.93-1636,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1361.577,1371.267,"Mr. Wolfson, would the sheriff be considered a State officer for purposes of Eleventh Amendment immunity?"
1994.93-1636,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1371.267,1374.235,We agree with what petitioner said on that point.
1994.93-1636,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1382.74,1400.719,"And normally you would expect, then, that on this question of whether the sheriff is a State or county officer for purposes of this suit, that the result would be the same."
1994.93-1636,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1400.719,1403.988,I would... I think that decision was incorrect by the district court.
1994.93-1636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1428.036,1429.821,"Mr. Wolfson, you're assuming a dichotomy."
1994.93-1636,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1455.123,1462.109,"--Well I... counties, as I tried to make the point earlier, here it's not that... the county can control the sheriff."
1994.93-1636,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1463.292,1471.398,"But not the body corporate that's being sued under 1983, and that's the whole assumption of 1983, isn't it, that you're dealing with something like a corporation?"
1994.93-1636,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1471.398,1477.786,"Actually, Alabama law, as I understand it, refers to the county as the body corporate and politic, not the county commission, but--"
1994.93-1636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1477.786,1480.254,But the party here is the Chambers County Commission.
1994.93-1636,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1480.254,1481.204,--I recognize that.
1994.93-1636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1514.661,1524.1,"Well, but under your theory it's the county as an entity, rather than the county commission, that would be sustainable for liability, and yet the party here is the county commission."
1994.93-1636,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1524.1,1527.135,The county was sued when the sheriff was named in his official capacity.
1994.93-1636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1527.135,1527.801,And dropped.
1994.93-1636,1,38417,paul_r_q_wolfson,,1527.801,1529.318,It's--
1994.93-1636,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1529.318,1530.587,Thank you.
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1532.353,1537.841,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1994.93-1636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1556.635,1559.787,"Well, why does the county commission have to have control?"
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1568.026,1577.616,"If the county commissioners make law enforcement policy, the county is clearly responsible for any actions by the county commission, because the county commission is the governing body of the corporation, which is Chambers County."
1994.93-1636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1577.616,1586.674,"Right, so if the repository of discretionary authority over law enforcement happens to be in the sheriff rather than in the county commission, why wouldn't the county, for the same reasons, be liable?"
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1586.674,1595.01,"It is conceivable that State law could establish an independent, autonomous municipal official who has authority to make policy for the municipal corporation."
1994.93-1636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1596.729,1599.814,"No, but if they do, I take it your answer is, yes, the county would be responsible."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1599.814,1600.197,Absolutely--
1994.93-1636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1600.197,1600.697,Okay.
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1600.697,1605.468,--if State law said that sheriffs are county officials with policymaking authority over law enforcement.
1994.93-1636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1605.468,1617.543,"So the issue as you see it is not whether there happens to be a county commission between ""the county"" and the sheriff, the issue is whether the sheriff is, in fact, a county official."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1617.543,1619.561,"Well, I think there's two levels of inquiry, Your Honor."
1994.93-1636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1648.295,1649.68,"Well, not every indication."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1657.936,1660.888,"--Well, those things also apply equally to any number of people--"
1994.93-1636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1660.888,1662.571,"For purposes of 1983, at least."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1662.571,1667.125,"--Well, to begin with, Your Honor, the State constitution expressly designates him a State official."
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1672.779,1673.629,"Mr. Smith, can I ask a question?"
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1673.629,1674.229,Sure.
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1674.229,1686.436,Supposing the policy at issue is that in this county all raids of nightclubs shall be conducted by teams of eight SWAT officers dressed in a certain way and carrying certain arms.
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1693.859,1695.842,"The State legislature, to begin with, if it's--"
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1695.842,1699.127,You mean they'd have to pass a statute to tell him not to conduct the raids--
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1699.127,1701.127,"--If that policy were illegal, he could be impeached by--"
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1701.127,1709.5,"--I'm not saying its legal or illegal, but the question is, who is the final person to decide whether that policy shall be carried out in this particular county?"
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1709.5,1709.85,--If he's--
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1709.85,1712.285,"Under the present state of the law, without any new legislation."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1712.285,1719.707,"--With respect to law enforcement decisions that are discretionary and are wholly legal, he has discretion to make that decision himself."
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1719.707,1727.211,So he could announce that policy and he would be the final authority on the effectuation of that policy within the geographic boundaries of that county.
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1727.211,1733.648,Just as any number of other State officials in Alabama and everywhere else have a certain amount of discretion to set policy for the State--
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1733.648,1734.031,For particular counties?
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1734.031,1735.398,--within certain confines of the law.
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1735.398,1736.983,For particular counties?
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1736.983,1745.923,"Circuit judges in Alabama, district attorneys in Alabama, all unquestionably State officials, are elected locally, their quarters and their equipment are all provided through the county commission."
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1746.273,1750.091,"Yes, but can they make rules for the county that are different from the rules in other parts of the State?"
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1750.091,1761.765,"--Every time a prosecutor makes judgments about which crimes he's going to prosecute or not prosecute, within the bounds of the law, he's essentially setting some kind of policy, and he's clearly a State official doing that within the confines of Chambers County."
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1761.765,1767.769,So you're saying the sheriff is a State official who sets the law enforcement policy within the particular county.
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1767.769,1768.336,I'm not saying that.
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1785.514,1789.202,"Well, what supervision is there at the State level of the particular policy involved in this case?"
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1789.202,1808.763,"--The supervision of this particular policy could occur in the sense that the Governor could direct him to investigate the Capri Club, could also demand a report in the activities that he has been conducting with respect to the Capri Club, and if he didn't get a report that was accurate, he could... that would be an impeachable offense as well, so there is some degree of--"
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1808.763,1812.465,Does the Governor tell him to use nine officers instead of eight?
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1812.465,1819.719,"--As I indicated before, if it's a discretionary decision between two legal options about how to conduct a raid--"
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1819.719,1822.087,The final authority on that is the sheriff?
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1822.087,1822.704,--the State has made a decision to allow some discretion.
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1823.454,1824.873,The final authority on that is the sheriff?
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1824.873,1825.239,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1826.273,1827.741,And that's a matter of policy.
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1827.741,1832.192,It's a matter of policy that he sets for the State at the local level.
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1868.55,1876.738,"If the sheriff ran over somebody in the course of getting to some investigation, who would pay that judgment?"
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1876.738,1881.79,"If he was sued under State law, there would be absolute immunity, because he has State immunity as a State official."
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1882.142,1883.559,There's no tort claims thing?
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1883.559,1884.609,--There's a board.
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1888.296,1892.831,"Could... is there any... you said, if he's sued under State law."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1894.7,1901.204,"Well, there might be a suit... I guess if it was a negligence claim he couldn't be sued under 1983, but... so that would be the only way, Your Honor."
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1901.604,1904.573,"I meant judgments in general, not 1983."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1904.573,1904.856,Yes.
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1904.856,1936.21,"One of the concerns, which we don't know perhaps everything that there is to know about this, is because the district judge was cut off, and since you are the person responsible for bringing this to the Eleventh Circuit, I would like to step back and talk about the legitimacy of bringing the county up before the Eleventh Circuit, and first, do you agree that you could have asked the district judge to certify this question of the county's responsibility under 1292(b)?"
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1936.21,1938.229,Certainly you can always ask the district judge to do that.
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1942.181,1948.352,"If that's so, aren't you just doing an end run around what Congress wanted?"
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1975.252,1983.675,1292(b) applies to the question of whether or not the district court proceeding should be suspended and an appeal should go up to the court of appeals.
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1988.495,1989.745,For another party.
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,1989.745,1991.53,--For another party under a related issue.
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1991.53,2005.588,"So that extent, you do an end run around 12... any time you have a legitimate interlocutory appeal of any party in the case, then it's totally discretionary with the court of appeals, and it doesn't matter what the district court thinks."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2005.588,2009.057,But that's been the rule that this Court has applied in any number of contexts.
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2015.562,2020.966,The... what is the routine rule of this Court with respect to pendent party appellate jurisdiction?
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2027.37,2027.72,--Right.
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2027.72,2041.88,"What is the routine practice with bringing up a party who could never have gotten there on any question on her own, and pending that party without consulting the district judge... the district judge here said, I'm not finished."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2051.235,2061.024,"Your Honor, I'm not aware of any case dealing one way or the other with the question of whether the pendent discretionary jurisdiction of an appellate court can include a claim brought involving a separate party."
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2061.024,2071.565,"Well, if you're not aware, then it can't be the routine practice of this Court to sanction pendent appellate jurisdiction over a party who could not be there otherwise."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2071.565,2109.172,"I would, though, Your Honor, point the Court to an area of the law that was not discussed in either of the supplemental briefs, and that is appeals that used to come to this Court under section 1252, which until 1988 was a statute that authorized direct appeals to this Court from any Federal decision or order, interlocutory or otherwise, holding a Federal statute unconstitutional, and the doctrine that was applied by this Court for decades was that such an appeal not only brings up the issue of the constitutionality of that Federal statute, but brings the entire case up to this Court, and this Court then said that it had discretion in those appeals to decide any issue that was present in that whole case, as the doctrine read."
1994.93-1636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2140.159,2140.809,Nonetheless--
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2157.271,2187.374,"--With respect, Your Honor, the doctrine was that on an appeal from an interlocutory order with respect to one issue, which is what the statute authorized, the whole case comes with it, and there's discretion to go beyond it, which is all we're saying here, that when there's an appeal of one issue in the case, courts of appeals, just as they do in preliminary injunction appeals, just as they do in mandamus situations, as the Court held in Schlagenhof, just as they do... used to under 1252 in appeals here, ought to have some discretion to decide issues that are clearly presented in the record of the case."
1994.93-1636,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2201.784,2202.6,"--Well, you could have asked--"
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2202.6,2203.2,--because of some legal error.
1994.93-1636,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2203.2,2206.985,--Could you have asked for a separate judgment under 54(b)?
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2206.985,2217.858,"Well, Your Honor, the county commission didn't actually have a clear ruling yet on the Monell issue, but if we had had a clear ruling against us on the Monell issue, then there wouldn't have been a judgment to enter, because--"
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2217.858,2218.643,It's just the opposite--
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2218.643,2221.995,"--the claim would have still been pending against the county, so there wouldn't have been anything to certify under--"
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2221.995,2223.863,--The district judge said he wasn't finished with it.
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2227.398,2228.648,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2228.648,2236.004,"So it was not only interlocutory within the case itself, but the district judge said, I'm not even finished with this single issue."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2236.004,2243.758,"Although, Your Honor, the issue is clearly one purely of law, and the district court showed some confusion about that, at one point saying that there was enough to get the trial on the factual question."
1994.93-1636,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2243.758,2244.777,"Well, the district judge--"
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2251.614,2252.947,"No, that's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2281.8,2295.643,"But even if the district judge had said, I think, and I'm not going to change my mind, that this county is liable under 12... under 1983, and now I'm going to hear the case on the merits--"
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2295.643,2296.093,Yes.
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2296.093,2298.162,--you couldn't have gotten a 54(b) order even then.
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2298.162,2302.547,"That's absolutely right, because all he would have been saying is that the claim is legally valid, and we have to go ahead and try it."
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2302.547,2302.93,Right.
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2302.93,2305.066,"So there wouldn't have been anything to get a 54(b) on, that's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2305.066,2307.017,You might have gotten a 1292(b).
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2311.069,2316.206,"Conceivably, although if we were talking about a separate appeal that would have stopped the case in its tracks, there would have been all sorts of issues of practicality there."
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2333.466,2338.803,"But that's a classic case for 1292(b), because it's a different party, and it... isn't it really?"
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2338.803,2340.02,"It could be, Your Honor--"
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2340.02,2344.624,Isn't that the precise case that 1292(b) was designed to provide a solution for?
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2344.624,2349.009,"--Although 1292(b) also has a, you know, a set of standards that have to be met that might not be met here."
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2349.009,2349.376,"Well, sure."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2349.376,2350.861,When you have a different--
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2350.861,2354.58,"That argues to the contrary, it seems to me, because you're bypassing those standards."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2354.58,2366.537,"--The other thing, of course, here, is the county defendant was faced with case law in the Eleventh Circuit which made it perfectly clear that this was a perfectly appropriate thing to do, so I don't think it's fair to sort of criticize the litigation decision which was made to go ahead and--"
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2366.537,2367.387,"Well, we're not criticizing it."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2368.77,2369.003,--Sure.
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2369.437,2370.905,"--either they're right or they're wrong, and we have to decide it that way."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2370.905,2371.122,Sure.
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2386.665,2388.966,"Well, the statute says it's an appeal from a decision."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2398.306,2408.197,"Sure, but that's exactly what 1292(a) says, and this Court has said for decades that when you get a preliminary injunction appeal you can go ahead and resolve the whole case, because it sometimes makes more sense to do that."
1994.93-1636,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2420.338,2428.693,"Well, maybe... maybe that applies only if the issues are necessarily intertwined or antecedent."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2445.453,2446.239,--In nearly every--
1994.93-1636,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2446.239,2456.045,And I think you have to look at the statutes and see whether Congress has allowed the court of appeals to exercise pendent jurisdiction.
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2459.813,2467.567,"--Well, I guess I would say that you should look at the traditional way that the scope of review has been treated differently from the ability to appeal."
1994.93-1636,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2477.772,2480.974,"--Was the courts of appeal pretty split on this issue, actually?"
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2480.974,2503.238,"Well, they've become more split after Abney and begun to move in that direction, but I think, you know, one thing the Court might want to consider in looking at this is that the large number of decisions of the courts of appeals which have continued to try to find some way to broaden their scope of review in these situations because of the really serious practical considerations that come into play when you're a court of appeals judge sitting there, knowing that--"
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2503.238,2509.642,"Yes, but when Congress addressed this issue, it decided it wasn't going to leave it all to the court of appeals."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2539.661,2540.379,"--Your Honor, I--"
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2540.379,2541.846,--and the Congress certainly hasn't.
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2541.846,2565.594,"--I think if you think about it, though, the distinction between pendent claims and pendent parties is much murkier and much less clear in the appellate context than it is at the district court level, because the county was going to be a party to this appeal at least as an appellee, no matter what, and the claim of the county, the plaintiffs against the county was going to get up to the court of appeals sooner or later no matter what, so--"
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2565.594,2566.344,"Later, not sooner--"
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2568.277,2568.546,--Right.
1994.93-1636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2618.127,2625.882,Are there cases where it might be appropriate to piggy-back but where a certification could not be made under 1292(b)?
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2625.882,2632.286,"Well, I think there may be issues where the district court would appropriately say, this is not sufficiently serious or important--"
1994.93-1636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2632.286,2632.752,Would appropriately say?
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2632.752,2633.519,--to merit a 1292(b).
1994.93-1636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2634.086,2635.404,Would appropriately say?
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2635.404,2638.623,"I certainly think that could be true, but at the same time the--"
1994.93-1636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2638.623,2642.725,Then I should think that would be a good reason for saying they shouldn't get up at that point.
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2642.725,2651.581,"--Well, Your Honor, once the case is going up with another appeal, though, there may be lots of practical reasons why the court of appeals would want to reach it, even though it might not satisfy the 1292(b) standards."
1994.93-1636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2651.581,2656.234,But why is the court of appeals' interests significantly different from the district court's interest here?
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2656.484,2675.463,"I think there's just a different standard that should be applied once you're talking about not creating an appeal, but simply what issues ought to be decided now that we've gone to the trouble of having a proceeding go to the court of appeals and at that point the court of appeals is just deciding what state the case should be in when we send it back, what we should tell the district court to do on remand."
1994.93-1636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2680.933,2683.802,"--Mr. Smith, you've mentioned 1292(a) several times."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2722.01,2723.796,"Well, two points, Your Honor."
1994.93-1636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2729.514,2734.216,"But to some extent that merits question is necessarily reached, to some extent at least."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2734.216,2734.566,Right.
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2759.033,2764.835,Are there cases under 1292(a) where a party who could not have appealed is allowed to appeal because another party appealed?
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2764.835,2766.42,"--I've not found such a case, Your Honor."
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2766.42,2768.472,Which is what we have here.
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2768.472,2773.793,"Yes, Your Honor, and if you think that the distinction in parties makes a big difference, then that is clearly a difference."
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2780.78,2783.232,"Why would the county be an appellee, just because it's a party to the litigation?"
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2783.232,2783.765,--Just because it's a party.
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2788.284,2789.019,Yes.
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2789.019,2790.352,"--you know, so that the codefendant might be kept in the case."
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2796.756,2803.862,"Mr. Smith, one of the reasons was the district could have made a difference... you said it's a pure question of law."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2803.862,2804.129,Yes.
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2804.129,2817.019,"But custom and usage counts also under 1983, and perhaps when the district judge said, I'm going to revisit this, my decision is not final, that's what he had in mind."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2838.016,2852.175,"Well, Your Honor, it's clear as a matter of law that they could not do that, that they are not authorized by State law to have any opinion whatever about law enforcement policy, and I don't think that's disputed here, so if such a thing occurred, it would be a violation of law by the county commission."
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2866.235,2870.321,"So when they... don't they audit his books, or... they pay for his office."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2871.923,2882.862,"They have to... they have to pay the money that goes to pay his salary, which is set by State law, and sufficient supplies and material to let him carry out his office, and they have to give him a jail and an office to work in just as--"
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2882.862,2891.818,"Well, do they exercise supervision at least to the extent of making sure that he's not dining at the fanciest restaurant in town and charging the county for that?"
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2894.186,2896.038,--There can be litigation over this issue.
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2906.394,2913.416,"--I mean, does anybody look at his books to see how he is spending the county's money, and who is that somebody who does that?"
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2913.416,2917.552,"I think there probably is... I'm sort of getting into speculation here, Your Honor."
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2924.306,2928.51,"Only stealing, but not acting unlawfully, or in violation of the Constitution?"
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2928.51,2929.526,"Well... I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2929.526,2933.295,But not spending the county's money in violation of the Constitution?
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2933.295,2933.595,Well--
1994.93-1636,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2933.595,2952.975,"If there is a county body, somebody commissioned by the county commission to audit the books... that's my question, is maybe yes, maybe no, but the district judge didn't have a chance to explore any of that because you took it right up to the court of appeals."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2952.975,2965.866,"--Well, Your Honor, the question of whether or not the sheriff is a county official in this case is so clear as a matter of law that it's hard for me to understand how anybody could suggest that the reason to reverse here would be that it was preliminary."
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2974.339,2976.006,"It's so clear we should have denied cert, I suppose."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2976.006,2976.556,"--Excuse me, Your Honor."
1994.93-1636,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2976.556,2978.108,"It's so clear we should have denied cert, I suppose."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2978.108,2980.392,"Your Honor, well... I can understand how--"
1994.93-1636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2995.118,2998.337,"I have a list, say, here, of... there are two things."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,2999.956,3000.756,"Yes, Your Honor."
1994.93-1636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3000.756,3002.308,--It's always possible we'll get to the merits.
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3026.188,3029.908,"If he's a county official, I think it's perfectly clear he's a county policymaker on law enforcement."
1994.93-1636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3030.708,3035.962,"And then... and then if he's a county official, the county commissioners have to pay?"
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3035.962,3036.895,"--I think that's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3036.895,3037.212,Okay.
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3037.212,3038.328,"If the State law held that, that was--"
1994.93-1636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3038.328,3039.844,"All right, then that's how you're arguing."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3039.844,3040.628,--If he's a State official--
1994.93-1636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3040.628,3041.28,I just wanted to know.
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3041.28,3042.113,--I think the Court ought to look--
1994.93-1636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3042.113,3042.98,"If he's a State official, you win."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3046.532,3052.819,"--Well, to be fair... to be fair, Your Honor, I think it's conceivable you could have a State official who in some of his functions is deputized to perform municipal functions."
1994.93-1636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3052.819,3053.088,--Of course.
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3074.834,3075.517,The State constitution.
1994.93-1636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3075.517,3075.884,"Yes, right--"
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3094.579,3098.782,In many of his functions he is supervised by the State officials.
1994.93-1636,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3102.401,3102.751,Good.
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3102.751,3108.905,"--The circuit judges supervise him, the district attorneys supervise him, the State Department of Corrections supervises him."
1994.93-1636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3137.24,3139.09,"Mr. Smith, may I just go back to one point?"
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3156.219,3156.919,--That's correct.
1994.93-1636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3156.919,3171.312,"As he said in Justice Stevens' question, now, if we're going to have raids in this way, with people dressed like this, without prior notice and so on, there's no one in the State that he has to... at the level of State government whose approval he has to get in order to implement that policy."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3171.312,3172.248,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1994.93-1636,2,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3172.248,3172.648,Okay.
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3172.648,3181.686,"I think the State of Alabama, for its good and sufficient reasons, has decided there needs to be a certain amount of discretion over law enforcement functions at the local level, because crime is local and that's where we're going to have it enforced."
1994.93-1636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3181.686,3190.042,"I am puzzled by your answer to Justice Breyer's questions, which seem to accept a dichotomy between State official and county official."
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3220.561,3222.846,"Your Honor, I think it depends on what you mean by county officials."
1994.93-1636,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3234.238,3234.654,For the corporation.
1994.93-1636,2,38319,paul_m_smith,,3234.654,3241.992,"--I think it is possible for State law to set up autonomous executive officials who speak for a particular municipal corporation, if the law very clearly does that."
1994.93-1636,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3259.419,3261.138,"Thank you, Mr. Smith."
1994.93-1636,3,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,3269.225,3301.13,"First, on... let me respond to Justice Ginsburg's question about whether there are any cases with pendant parties bringing otherwise nonappealable claims along with an appealable claim, and we cite in our brief the 1954 case in Chicago and Rock Island Railroad v. Stude, where it was a cross-appeal that the Supreme Court said should be... was properly considered by the court of appeals along with the originally appealable appeal by the cross-parties."
1994.93-1636,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3301.13,3301.613,Same people.
1994.93-1636,3,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,3301.613,3302.965,Same people.
1994.93-1636,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3302.965,3303.798,The same people were already there anyway.
1994.93-1636,3,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,3319.075,3319.375,Yes.
1994.93-1636,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3356.95,3364.123,"Well, one can understand why courts of appeals would be biased in favor of their discretion to the exclusion of the district court."
1994.93-1636,3,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,3364.123,3374.329,"Well, that may certainly be the case, or looking at the case once they have it, they see that the litigation can be advanced by taking and reviewing additional issues."
1994.93-1636,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3375.795,3380.847,"Or, indeed, why we would be biased in that direction as well, I suppose."
1994.93-1636,3,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,3380.847,3391.655,"--Justice Scalia, you asked me earlier about the Eleventh Amendment case law... I mean, the Eleventh Circuit case law regarding the Eleventh Amendment status of a sheriff's suit in an official capacity."
1994.93-1636,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3437.868,3440.535,Who buys the sheriff's patrol cars?
1994.93-1636,3,39954,robert_b_mcduff,,3440.535,3443.47,The county commission.
1994.93-1636,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3494.003,3494.669,"Thank you, Mr. McDuff."
