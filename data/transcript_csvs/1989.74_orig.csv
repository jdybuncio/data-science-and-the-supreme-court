1989.74_orig,1,43071,thomas_e_mccutchen_jr,,1725.124,1725.805,"No, Your Honor--"
1989.74_orig,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1725.805,1727.444,Doesn't there have to be a notoriety?
1989.74_orig,1,43071,thomas_e_mccutchen_jr,,1735.369,1743.135,"--Your Honor, there is no trouble there, because the owners were Savannah people living in Savannah, who owned the land and went to South Carolina to obtain the grant."

1989.74_orig,1,43071,thomas_e_mccutchen_jr,,1792.567,1797.881,"Well, it was brought home to everybody who was around, including the aldermen, to the city council."

1989.74_orig,1,43071,thomas_e_mccutchen_jr,,2120.917,2125.309,"--Well, even if it were considered that way, that is 1955."

1989.74_orig,1,43071,thomas_e_mccutchen_jr,,2161.924,2183.769,"Well, Your Honor, we bifurcated the trial, and the case did start in 1977, and filed the reports, and, Your Honor, I could not go beyond that in saying that it has been a lengthy matter."
1989.74_orig,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2231.252,2237.767,Is Rabbit the one right next to the two described as Barnwell Islands?
1989.74_orig,1,43071,thomas_e_mccutchen_jr,,2237.767,2238.506,"Yes, Your Honor."
