1983.81-2149,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.137,We'll hear arugments next in Solem against Stumes.
1983.81-2149,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,8.407,10.158,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.81-2149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,387.944,389.845,What about the rest of the facts?
1983.81-2149,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,392.328,395.718,--Officer Skadsen came back into the jail area.
1983.81-2149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,397.451,398.322,What did he say?
1983.81-2149,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,401.384,408.357,"--The officer said basically what did you want, Norman, or... I can't recall the exact words, Justice, but words to that effect."
1983.81-2149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,408.357,409.97,And then what happened?
1983.81-2149,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,409.97,415.924,"He said to Skadsen, Officer Skadsen, he said tell them that I am not a vicious killer."
1983.81-2149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,415.924,417.033,Then what happened?
1983.81-2149,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,417.033,418.625,Then--
1983.81-2149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,418.625,421.317,Were there any other admissions at that time?
1983.81-2149,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,421.317,427.732,"--No, other than he was not a vicious killer and he wanted Officer Skadsen to tell others that he was not a vicious killer."
1983.81-2149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,427.732,431.652,"What statements were admitted at his trial, the ones in the car--"
1983.81-2149,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,431.652,432.774,Yes.
1983.81-2149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,432.774,435.315,--And anything prior to that?
1983.81-2149,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,435.315,436.837,Yes.
1983.81-2149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,436.837,437.987,Any of his statements prior to that?
1983.81-2149,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,437.987,440.708,"Well, a description of his statements prior to that."
1983.81-2149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,449.414,450.626,Later when?
1983.81-2149,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,450.626,453.637,"--At the jail, the one we just alluded to."
1983.81-2149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,453.637,455.158,Is that the only one?
1983.81-2149,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,455.158,469.957,"The only one from the prior day of October 1st in the afternoon was he admitted that he had intercourse and when asked the question, what kind of death was this, was it accidental?"
1983.81-2149,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,488.68,493.313,What is your defense of the statements made the day before?
1983.81-2149,0,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,493.313,497.577,"Well, first of all, it is two parts."
1983.81-2149,1,42740,timothy_j_mc_greevy,,1793.007,1797.498,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.81-2149,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1910.142,1914.136,"Well, they knew they had a murder case as soon as they found the body, didn't they?"
1983.81-2149,1,42740,timothy_j_mc_greevy,,1914.136,1924.34,"Well, I suppose one could say, Mr. Chief Justice, that just by looking at the body you couldn't necessarily tell that it was a felonious or a criminal act."
1983.81-2149,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1925.561,1929.753,"Perhaps I couldn't, but a physician could and did, did he not?"
1983.81-2149,1,42740,timothy_j_mc_greevy,,1929.753,1930.754,--That is correct.
1983.81-2149,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1930.754,1934.898,"So, I don't get the point of this ten days that you are talking about."
1983.81-2149,1,42740,timothy_j_mc_greevy,,1934.898,1953.481,"My point is that during the course of the ten days the authorities took hair samples from the victim, from the body of the victim, and from the apartment, from the shower of the apartment, from other areas of the apartment."
1983.81-2149,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1981.751,1985.262,"Well, you lose me."
1983.81-2149,1,42740,timothy_j_mc_greevy,,1993.048,2014.172,"Well, I understood the Attorney General to argue that in cases where you have a confession that is secured very quickly, and I believe he inferred that occurred here, the police, in effect, have a disincentive to put together a case that is based on other than a confession."
1983.81-2149,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2017.434,2040.021,"Do you contend that the statements made when they were 60 to 90 miles away from Sioux Falls, as it was described and is described in the record, that he became emotional and said he wanted to get it out, do you challenge that?"
1983.81-2149,1,42740,timothy_j_mc_greevy,,2040.021,2043.602,Do I challenge the admissibility of those statements?
1983.81-2149,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2043.602,2044.353,Yes.
1983.81-2149,1,42740,timothy_j_mc_greevy,,2046.376,2056.781,"I must say that Mr. Stumes at trial testified that it never happened, that that is part of the record made at the trial."
1983.81-2149,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2069.751,2079.837,"The jury verdict would suggest that they rejected his testimony and believed the officers, does it not?"
1983.81-2149,1,42740,timothy_j_mc_greevy,,2079.837,2081.317,--I would say that that is correct.
1983.81-2149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2166.453,2169.275,This particular question about the polygraph?
1983.81-2149,1,42740,timothy_j_mc_greevy,,2169.275,2172.006,--It was broader than that in the record.
1983.81-2149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2172.006,2178.742,"Well, that isn't the way you stated it and it isn't the way the Court of Appeals put it nor the District Court."
1983.81-2149,1,42740,timothy_j_mc_greevy,,2183.396,2198.256,"I believe in my brief in the citations to the transcript, I believe I refer to the fact that it was a broader request than merely in response to the polygraph question."
1983.81-2149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2198.256,2199.405,On what do you base that?
1983.81-2149,1,42740,timothy_j_mc_greevy,,2199.405,2200.197,Pardon me?
1983.81-2149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2200.197,2205.82,On what do you base that statement that it was a broader question than about the polygraph?
1983.81-2149,1,42740,timothy_j_mc_greevy,,2205.82,2213.833,I believe I base it on a transcript reference and I need to check that right now.
1983.81-2149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2213.833,2216.846,What did the District Court find?
1983.81-2149,1,42740,timothy_j_mc_greevy,,2216.846,2218.979,I believe the District--
1983.81-2149,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2218.979,2222.409,The Court of Appeals purported to rely on the District Court's findings for its statements.
1983.81-2149,1,42740,timothy_j_mc_greevy,,2222.409,2233.629,"--The District Court and the Eighth Circuit, I believe, Mr. Justice, referred only to a request to talk to Steve prior to answering the polygraph question."
1983.81-2149,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3590.788,3593.059,"Very briefly, Your Honor."
1983.81-2149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3632.425,3638.299,"May I ask you, do you read the Edwards opinion itself as purporting to announce a new rule?"
1983.81-2149,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3649.676,3652.448,I believe it is a new rule.
1983.81-2149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3653.089,3654.461,That isn't my question.
1983.81-2149,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3658.992,3660.953,--I believe it did.
1983.81-2149,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3660.953,3664.646,Is there language in the opinion that purports to adopt a new rule?
1983.81-2149,2,36320,mark_v_meierhenry,,3670.139,3679.516,I believe since then that other members of the Court have looked at it... not of this Court but of other courts have looked at it as a new per se rule.
1983.81-2149,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3700.51,3702.844,"Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted."
