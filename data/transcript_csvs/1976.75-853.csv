1976.75-853,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,50.249,53.198,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1976.75-853,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,438.769,456.066,"Mr. Flinn, before you do that, is it not correct that there was also at least representing opinion to an additional item approved, namely the fact that there were other times between your credit division and other purchases of Homes?"
1976.75-853,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,456.066,458.634,"Mr. Justice Stevens, I believe that as correct."
1976.75-853,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,493.449,501.809,Is there not evidence that a certain percentage and I do not remember the figure now of your credit companyâ€™s loans did have a tie-in feature with it?
1976.75-853,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,501.809,504.837,The plaintiff has I think taken the evidence out of record.
1976.75-853,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,535.112,542.229,"Your point, just so I have clear mind, the customer acceptance feature of the proof is the same whether it is this customer or this customer is?"
1976.75-853,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,542.229,548.081,"Mr. Justice Stevens, that is my argument today, yes sir."
1976.75-853,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,933.677,934.339,"Mr. Flinn, let me just interrupt."
1976.75-853,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,942.968,947.427,"I agree, I did not mean to say that there was not a finding that the houses were higher priced."
1976.75-853,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,956.202,957.467,But not the (Inaudible) that many.
1976.75-853,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,957.467,959.755,It makes a great deal with difference Mr. Justice Stevens.
1976.75-853,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1060.916,1071.936,"I must have misunderstood your argument, because I thought you were saying that even if he paid more for the houses and knew it, it really would not make any difference as long as the total package was what the free market would dictate."
1976.75-853,0,35783,macdonald_flinn,,1071.936,1104.605,"That is the second part of my argument, Mr. Justice Stevens that even if, at the time, he entered into the loan arrangements, Mr. Fortner deemed the house overpriced or in any other way noncompetitive, he would in the circumstances of this kind of tie-in situations, have agreed to accept that burden of the tied product only if he concluded that the saving on the allegedly cheaper more favorable tie-in element, the loans at least compensated for that burden that he was assuming."
