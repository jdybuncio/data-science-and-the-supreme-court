1985.85-1377,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.356,The Court will hear arguments first this morning in Bowsher v. Synar and others.
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,13.491,21.311,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-1377,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,210.318,227.446,"Mr. Cutler, if the Comptroller General were removed for any one of the four reasons... I think there are four reasons specified in the statute... is there any review by anyone of that action?"
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,227.446,229.998,"--Oh, it is a law."
1985.85-1377,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,241.122,245.574,Would it be any different from a removal by way of an impeachment?
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,245.574,262.286,"I would suppose, Mr. Chief Justice, that a removal by way of impeachment would... I don't know whether it would be judicially reviewable by this Court, for example, as to whether it complied with the statutory standards."
1985.85-1377,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,433.478,438.882,You feel that the Glidden case is primary authority for your position here.
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,438.882,440.565,"We do, Justice Blackmun."
1985.85-1377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,440.565,467.532,"Well, Mr. Cutler, aren't we guided in determining severability if some portion of the statute is found to be unconstitutional by the expressed intent of Congress, which in this case would indicate that Congress had some fallback position which it articulated should be followed?"
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,467.532,508.276,"There is no question that in the 1985 statute Congress had a fallback provision if any part of the so-called reporting function, using the Comptroller General and acting on the reports of OMB and CBO, were found unconstitutional, but one would never reach that issue if, by examining the 1921 act, one had concluded that the removal provision in the 1921 act was itself unconstitutional and a nullity, particularly since the time of Myers v. the United States--"
1985.85-1377,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,508.276,511.228,"Well, but aren't we reviewing the 1985 act?"
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,511.228,526.238,--You are reviewing the 1985 act on the ground that a presumptively constitutional provision in the 1921 act is incompatible with the delegation of functions under the '85 act.
1985.85-1377,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,569.683,586.359,"Well, what if we did follow your suggestion and decide that the removal provision of the 1921 act were invalid under the Constitution, how would that leave the position of the Office of Comptroller General as to removability?"
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,586.359,595.834,"It would leave it, I would submit, Justice Rehnquist, it would leave the 1921 statute silent on removability."
1985.85-1377,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,595.834,597.85,And what would be the result?
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,597.85,624.984,"And then under this Court's decision in Wiener, if you concluded that the '21 statute had created the Comptroller General as an independent officer of the United States serving for a fixed term of years, you would imply that the President had no right to remove him at will but might have a right to remove him for cause, something this Court has implied in the absence of statutory language but not held."
1985.85-1377,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,624.984,631.923,"If you concluded that the Comptroller General were more like Myers than Wiener, then you would say that the President could remove him at will."
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,631.923,638.827,"If you concluded that he were a purely executive officer, that would be the case, yes."
1985.85-1377,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,638.827,650.219,It seems to me that you really risk interfering with Congress' intent far more when you tamper with the 1921 act than if you adjudicate the 1985 act.
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,650.219,676.786,"I would submit not, Justice Rehnquist because Congress clearly intended in the 1985... the 1921 act to establish the Comptroller General as an independent officer of the United States because he was to receive these administrative functions, like settling the government's account, bringing suits to collect the government's claims, and setting the accounting standards for the government."
1985.85-1377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,790.827,809.639,"Well, Mr. Cutler, the United States argues that the removal power by Congress is beside the point, that this officer may not perform these functions assigned to him unless the President has unrestricted power to remove."
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,809.639,810.806,That is correct.
1985.85-1377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,810.806,812.658,"Now, did the District Court reject that argument?"
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,812.658,815.11,The District Court never reached that argument.
1985.85-1377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,825.132,826.834,"Well, do you think that issue is open here?"
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,827.9,828.4,--I would think--
1985.85-1377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,828.4,830.333,--Would it change the reach of the judgment?
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,830.333,832.202,"--I think it would, Justice White."
1985.85-1377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,863.823,868.858,"Purely executive, and so that they may not be performed by this officer unless the President has--"
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,868.858,870.31,Yes.
1985.85-1377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,870.31,871.727,--power to remove at will.
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,871.727,875.714,"On that argument, they could be performed only by a purely executive officer."
1985.85-1377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,875.714,882.885,"And that... is that a broader... if we affirmed on that ground, would that be a broader relief?"
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,882.885,907.416,"On that ground, yes, we think you would then take over the side with you the Federal Reserve Board which itself makes broad, predictive findings of fact and sets policy, the Federal Communications Commission which you have held determines the course of future public policy when it is issuing licenses and deregulating common carriers, and many other commissions."
1985.85-1377,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,907.416,909.768,But that's not broader relief on this particular judgment.
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,911.387,918.058,"It's a more sweeping doctrine, but should you adopt that doctrine, it would have very serious implications for all of those agencies."
1985.85-1377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,918.058,928.766,"Well, it would foreclose, it would foreclose or make beside the point agreeing with you about the validity or invalidity of the 1921 act."
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,928.766,959.785,"I would... yes, Justice White, if the Solicitor General is correct in that contention, then all the independent agencies except those which are limited to deciding particularized cases based on past facts, what he calls a quasi-judicial function, would be over the side, particularly if you adopt his theory that it is not the removal power in those statutes which would have to be invalidated but the function that is to be performed."
1985.85-1377,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,959.785,965.705,"Mr. Cutler, are there other officers of the United States removable by the Congress?"
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,965.705,973.127,"This is the only officer of the United States who by statute, Justice Powell, is removable by the Congress."
1985.85-1377,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,973.127,973.794,"Yes, by statute, for cause."
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,973.794,977.679,"That is so, for cause, that is right, other than impeachment."
1985.85-1377,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,977.679,981.298,"Mr. Cutler, what about the Federal Reserve Board members?"
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,981.298,987.118,"The Federal Reserve Board members are removable for cause, under their statute, a term that is not defined."
1985.85-1377,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,998.326,1003.647,"Mr. Cutler, do you take the position that the removal power in the '21 act is unconstitutional?"
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,1003.647,1015.804,"We argue that it is not unconstitutional, Justice Stevens, because they never exercise power to remove for cause, which is so difficult to apply and has never happened."
1985.85-1377,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1023.893,1025.762,"Well, no, I understand that, but it's a different argument."
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,1025.762,1026.262,--Right.
1985.85-1377,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1026.262,1031.047,"But I'm just asking independently, would you say the '21 act is constitutional or unconstitutional?"
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,1031.047,1059.483,"If you asked me, I would have great difficulty defending the portion of the '21 act which gives Congress a role in the actual removal process because that seems to fly in the face of the ruling of Myers which was not affected by Humphrey's Executor that Congress cannot participate in the actual process of removal although it may lay down the standards for removal."
1985.85-1377,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1136.566,1145.772,I take it you are then somewhat at odds with your colleagues with respect to the validity of the 1921 provision?
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,1145.772,1155.961,"We would defend its validity perhaps with less enthusiasm than our colleagues, but I think we all come to the same place."
1985.85-1377,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1180.428,1186.999,Are you suggesting that the '21 provision may be just partly or slightly unconstitutional?
1985.85-1377,0,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,1186.999,1205.711,"I am suggesting, Chief Justice Burger, that the removal provision either creates no subservience, in which case it can have no effect on the '85 act except on the Solicitor General's extreme theory, or that it is unconstitutional and has been a nullity since 1921."
1985.85-1377,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1205.711,1239.884,Mr. Ross?
1985.85-1377,1,41941,steven_r_ross,,1239.884,1241.984,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-1377,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1492.381,1503.837,"Mr. Ross, wouldn't you concede that the historic role of the Comptroller General is really that of an employee of the legislative branch, in effect?"
1985.85-1377,1,41941,steven_r_ross,,1511.859,1516.996,--He has been called by those in Congress and those in the judiciary many things over the years.
1985.85-1377,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1575.535,1580.587,"The Comptroller gives opinions, though, on constitutionality of things, doesn't he?"
1985.85-1377,1,41941,steven_r_ross,,1580.587,1582.356,To the Congress?
1985.85-1377,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1582.356,1583.189,Yes.
1985.85-1377,1,41941,steven_r_ross,,1583.189,1587.741,"The Comptroller, as many people, provides Congress with information."
1985.85-1377,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1604.685,1619.545,"Yes, but based on my three years' experience in the Justice Department, my feeling was, you know, that if the executive branch wanted a favorable opinion, you went to the Attorney General; if Congress wanted a favorable opinion, you went to the Comptroller General."
1985.85-1377,1,41941,steven_r_ross,,1624.933,1630.003,I was going to answer that the Congress calls the Comptroller so often because they respect his competency.
1985.85-1377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1630.003,1646.096,"May I ask, in that connection, if his task is to review the expenditure of public funds, I take it he will perform that task upon request by either a congressional committee or an individual Congressman or Senator, is that correct?"
1985.85-1377,1,41941,steven_r_ross,,1646.096,1652.833,He will perform various investigative functions upon request of congressional committees or individual members.
1985.85-1377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1652.833,1654.885,Will he do the same thing upon the request of the President?
1985.85-1377,1,41941,steven_r_ross,,1654.885,1655.952,"Yes, he does."
1985.85-1377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1658.404,1661.872,The same type of investigative checking on disbursements?
1985.85-1377,1,41941,steven_r_ross,,1661.872,1668.545,"He would not issue the same type of report, but he does do work for the... for executive agencies."
1985.85-1377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1668.545,1673.663,What percentage of his work assignments do you suppose eminate from the legislature and what from the executive?
1985.85-1377,1,41941,steven_r_ross,,1673.663,1682.353,"I think the figures that I last saw indicate that he does a great deal of his work for the legislative branch, over 50 percent, but I don't think it is--"
1985.85-1377,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1682.353,1684.721,"Is it over 90 percent, would you say?"
1985.85-1377,1,41941,steven_r_ross,,1684.721,1685.688,--I don't believe so.
1985.85-1377,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1685.688,1691.974,What work does he do for the executive branch specifically?
1985.85-1377,1,41941,steven_r_ross,,1691.974,1698.48,He performs certain audit functions at the request of executive agencies who want to rely on his expertise.
1985.85-1377,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1746.359,1758.501,"Now, Mr. Ross, you take the position that none of the functions assigned to the Comptroller General in the 1985 act are executive functions in nature?"
1985.85-1377,1,41941,steven_r_ross,,1758.501,1772.926,"We take the position that none of the functions given to the Comptroller in the 1985 act are purely executive as that term has been used by this Court, in, example, in Myers or as that term was understood in the first Congress in respect to--"
1985.85-1377,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1772.926,1782.801,You wouldn't concede that there is any executive power component involved in the 1985 act powers given to the Comptroller General?
1985.85-1377,1,41941,steven_r_ross,,1782.801,1793.34,"--Well, clearly, the economic projections are a function which are performed by all three branches on a daily basis."
1985.85-1377,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1795.359,1807.833,"But the bottom line, of course, is picking a figure or figures that will be binding on all agencies of the federal government for purposes of sequestration, for example."
1985.85-1377,1,41941,steven_r_ross,,1807.833,1811.368,"--Well, of course, the figure is determined by the statutory formula."
1985.85-1377,2,35694,michael_davidson,,2454.552,2457.737,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-1377,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2521.679,2523.129,But how was he appointed in the first place?
1985.85-1377,2,35694,michael_davidson,,2523.129,2527.416,"By the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, as is the Comptroller General."
1985.85-1377,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2572.529,2583.753,"That isn't entirely a courtesy, though, on the part of the Comptroller General, because the reason the executive branch authorities seek the Comptroller General's ruling is that they run the risk of being surcharged, don't they?"
1985.85-1377,2,35694,michael_davidson,,2583.753,2596.56,"And the reason that they run the risk of being surcharged is that the Comptroller General inherited under the statute the power of the control of the Treasury, to issue rulings which are binding on the executive branch."
1985.85-1377,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2754.845,2778.044,"If the Solicitor General... or, not the Solicitor General, but if the delegation argument were accepted and we didn't agree with you, would the judgment below be expanded or would that give the plaintiffs additional relief?"
1985.85-1377,2,35694,michael_davidson,,2778.044,2783.18,It would effect the result in this way.
1985.85-1377,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2786.983,2789.268,"Right, right."
1985.85-1377,2,35694,michael_davidson,,2789.268,2790.351,This is an appropriate use of the fallback mechanism.
1985.85-1377,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2798.374,2800.024,So the judgment would we really the same?
1985.85-1377,2,35694,michael_davidson,,2800.024,2801.159,--The judgment would be the same.
1985.85-1377,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2809.147,2809.849,Yes.
1985.85-1377,2,35694,michael_davidson,,2809.849,2822.923,"And it would, of course, render it insignificant if the Congress attempted to correct the statute by providing for the delegation of this authority to any other officer."
1985.85-1377,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3246.548,3253.035,Would you say that that objection was founded on the same objection to the line item vetoes?
1985.85-1377,2,35694,michael_davidson,,3254.352,3258.438,It is a very similar type of concern.
1985.85-1377,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3275.817,3299.849,"Well, what if we took the suggestion that Mr. Cutler suggests, that if the problem with the statute is the removal Power by Congress, which the district court emphasized, do you think that Congress would have passed this statute if it didn't have removal power?"
1985.85-1377,2,35694,michael_davidson,,3299.849,3303.051,I think the evidence is that it probably would have.
1985.85-1377,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3364.006,3373.612,"Don't you run the risk, if the removal provision of the 1921 Act is struck down, that you would leave the office simply removable by the President at will?"
1985.85-1377,2,35694,michael_davidson,,3373.612,3389.454,We agree with the Comptroller General that under this Court's decision in Weiner the Court would look to the functions of the Comptroller General in determining whether it is the kind of function which requires presidential removal at will.
1985.85-1377,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3521.539,3539.083,"Earlier, Mr. Davidson, you had made... at least I got an intimation that judges could make some kind of an appraisal of whether Congress would or would not have passed the '21 Act without the removal privilege."
1985.85-1377,2,35694,michael_davidson,,3543.718,3561.18,"I think it is the judgment that this Court made in Chadha, the legislative veto case, when the contention was placed before the Court that the Congress would not have delegated the authority to the Attorney General to suspend and then cancel deportation without reserving the opportunity to review that decision."
1985.85-1377,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3561.18,3564.716,Do you think that was a key factor in the Chadha holding?
1985.85-1377,2,35694,michael_davidson,,3564.716,3571.472,"Not in its constitutional holding, but in the Court's prior, preliminary ruling that that statute was severable."
1985.85-1377,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3598.289,3598.822,Very well.
1985.85-1377,3,18942,charles_fried,,3605.959,3610.263,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1985.85-1377,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3704.908,3708.443,"Well, Mr. Fried, I'll confess you scared me with it."
1985.85-1377,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3708.443,3708.776,[Laughter]
1985.85-1377,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3708.776,3710.343,So why don't you explain.
1985.85-1377,3,18942,charles_fried,,3710.343,3726.738,"Well, the principal point, Justice O'Connor, is that the powers which are given to the Comptroller General here are so sweeping they affect every nook and cranny of the executive department."
1985.85-1377,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3754.655,3766.13,"Well, that strikes me as kind of a novel doctrine you're espousing, and I can't quite put a finger on that approach in any of this Court's previous decisions."
1985.85-1377,3,18942,charles_fried,,3779.622,3795.299,"The Federal Reserve Board is a good example, because in fact what the Federal Reserve Board does is to determine, as the bank which it is established to be, the interest rate it will charge to its clients."
1985.85-1377,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3836.792,3842.446,"Mr. Fried, you don't challenge the fallback position, do you?"
1985.85-1377,3,18942,charles_fried,,3842.446,3843.462,Not at all.
1985.85-1377,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3843.462,3855.686,"That if this order, instead of being given by the Comptroller General, were based on the recommendation of the Comptroller General and then enacted in a joint resolution of Congress, that then the President would have to obey it."
1985.85-1377,3,18942,charles_fried,,3855.686,3863.69,"Well, the President of course, as this Court has said on numerous occasions, exists to execute the laws."
1985.85-1377,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3863.69,3864.125,Right.
1985.85-1377,3,18942,charles_fried,,3864.125,3867.16,"And this would be a law, and it would be a law which he would to execute."
1985.85-1377,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3868.46,3871.279,"And you don't challenge the delegation, do you?"
1985.85-1377,3,18942,charles_fried,,3871.279,3873.397,"No, Justice Rehnquist."
1985.85-1377,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3904.101,3912.338,"So if these functions had been assigned to the Secretary of the Treasury, you would say it was a perfectly good delegation--"
1985.85-1377,3,18942,charles_fried,,3912.338,3913.04,That would have been--
1985.85-1377,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3913.04,3914.04,--just like you say it is here?
1985.85-1377,3,18942,charles_fried,,3914.04,3917.759,"--perfectly proper, if it had been assigned to the Secretary of the Treasury."
1985.85-1377,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3917.759,3918.759,Or the OBM?
1985.85-1377,3,18942,charles_fried,,3918.759,3922.294,"Or the Director of the OBM, yes, Chief Justice Burger."
1985.85-1377,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4000.005,4004.39,What about the management audits that the Comptroller General conducts?
1985.85-1377,3,18942,charles_fried,,4006.842,4017.716,"Those are very useful, but the position of the executive branch has consistently been that those are not final and determinatively binding on the executive."
1985.85-1377,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4077.755,4100.62,"Are you suggesting, Mr. Solicitor General, that when the Comptroller General exercises that kind of a function he is calling attention as an overseer, calling the attention of Congress so that Congress the next time around on the budgets can deal with the problem that the Comptroller General has pointed out?"
1985.85-1377,3,18942,charles_fried,,4100.62,4117.832,"That is our view of his principal function, as the auditor for the Congress, on behalf of the Congress, as one of the Congressmen in the debates on the 1921 Act said, a watchdog and a critic on behalf of Congress."
1985.85-1377,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4125.319,4132.192,"Well, if you're correct is he still an officer of the United States who must be appointed by the President?"
1985.85-1377,3,18942,charles_fried,,4132.192,4136.727,We make no point of whether he is an officer of the United States.
1985.85-1377,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4331.221,4348.183,"Well, Mr. Solicitor General, would you be satisfied with a judgment that in performing these functions the Comptroller General is a purely executive officer, subject to the removal by the President at will?"
1985.85-1377,3,18942,charles_fried,,4348.183,4355.337,"I don't see how this Court, Justice White, could arrive at that conclusion."
1985.85-1377,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4355.337,4363.007,"Well, you're arguing that performing these functions do make him a purely executive officer."
1985.85-1377,3,18942,charles_fried,,4363.007,4364.193,Justice--
1985.85-1377,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4364.193,4364.576,Aren't you?
1985.85-1377,3,18942,charles_fried,,4365.293,4366.709,"--It is, Justice White."
1985.85-1377,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4394.543,4396.395,I take it you--
1985.85-1377,3,18942,charles_fried,,4401.049,4416.659,"That would go Mr. Cutler's route as to severability, and we have great doubts about that because severability is a matter of divining the intent of Congress in the event that something Congress has done--"
1985.85-1377,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4416.659,4427.533,"So you say that we... you would be satisfied with that judgment, I suppose, but you think that would be an imperfect judgment because that isn't what Congress would have intended?"
1985.85-1377,3,18942,charles_fried,,4427.533,4433.187,"--We would not be satisfied with that judgment, with respect, because we think it would he an incorrect Judgment."
1985.85-1377,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4433.187,4433.737,"All right, all right."
1985.85-1377,3,18942,charles_fried,,4459.755,4478.299,"The 1985 Act was passed under the shadow, under the clear shadow, of the doubts which the executive had always raised about giving executive functions to the Comptroller General."
1985.85-1377,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4548.376,4561.202,"Mr. Solicitor General, if I back up a minute, you paraded quite a few horrible things that could happen if Congress took over the job."
1985.85-1377,3,18942,charles_fried,,4573.26,4574.926,"Oh, no."
1985.85-1377,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4596.206,4599.91,Does that help me at all?
1985.85-1377,3,18942,charles_fried,,4599.91,4602.693,"I think so, I think so."
1985.85-1377,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4621.157,4623.776,I learned that in my first year of high school.
1985.85-1377,3,18942,charles_fried,,4626.243,4636.25,"And it is... well, I think that is what we rely on, that the legislative power is in the Congress, while the executive power is in the President."
1985.85-1377,3,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,4646.956,4658.164,"Mr. Fried, do you say that none of the other powers of the Comptroller General prior to this particular Act were executive powers in essence?"
1985.85-1377,3,18942,charles_fried,,4658.164,4674.041,"Justice O'Connor, it was the position of the executive in Stotz v. Lynn that the power under the Impoundment Act to bring suit was not valid, and for very similar reasons to those that I'm making here."
1985.85-1377,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4902.737,4915.795,"If we agreed with your argument, we would be foreclosed from saying the district court erred in not striking the removal provision of the 1921 Act?"
1985.85-1377,3,18942,charles_fried,,4915.795,4919.43,"--I believe so, Justice White, yes."
1985.85-1377,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4919.43,4922.9,And you didn't cross-petition here or cross-appeal?
1985.85-1377,3,18942,charles_fried,,4922.9,4925.75,"We did not, we did not."
1985.85-1377,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4988.258,5001.916,Mr. Morrison.
1985.85-1377,4,16500,alan_b_morrison,,5001.916,5005.268,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1985.85-1377,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5229.113,5238.052,"But they are at least factual, Mr.... or essentially in the realm of fact, Mr. Morrison, rather than policy that agencies have been given authority to enforce."
1985.85-1377,4,16500,alan_b_morrison,,5238.052,5242.67,"Well, I want to turn to that, and I suppose this is as good a time as any, Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1985.85-1377,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5312.266,5315.801,$30 billion or $60 billion as percentage of what?
1985.85-1377,4,16500,alan_b_morrison,,5315.801,5327.157,"--Well, as a percentage of the entire federal budget, it is close to a trillion dollars, and so far as the portion which is not exempt, it is about $500 billion or $600 billion."
1985.85-1377,4,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5327.157,5330.727,"So you are talking about 10 percent, 5 percent, something like that?"
1985.85-1377,4,16500,alan_b_morrison,,5330.727,5337.547,"The cuts this year were 4.3 percent and 4.9 percent for non-defense and defense, but this is only on a prorated basis."
1985.85-1377,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5492.028,5502.236,"But Mr. Morrison, it is a fact, is it not, that in this particular... the experience we have so far, the congressional estimate, the executive estimate, and the Comptroller's estimate are all pretty close to one another?"
1985.85-1377,4,16500,alan_b_morrison,,5502.236,5507.371,"I think in fairness, Justice Stevens, there are two points to make."
1985.85-1377,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5532.671,5540.777,"Yes, but the fact that they didn't have any consequences, it seems to me, would be more reason to anticipate wider variation rather than coming close to the target."
1985.85-1377,4,16500,alan_b_morrison,,5550.733,5551.299,That is correct.
1985.85-1377,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5660.519,5681.766,"Mr. Morrison, you may have noticed as a member of the bar that over the last 15 years on perhaps four or five occasions Congress has created special judicial panels and authorized the designation to those panels of judges already in office."
1985.85-1377,4,16500,alan_b_morrison,,5707.85,5710.452,"No, I--"
1985.85-1377,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5710.452,5717.106,"--who have no executive authority and no legislative authority, and who are not removable by the President?"
1985.85-1377,4,16500,alan_b_morrison,,5717.106,5731.949,"--Well, I would certainly say that under this Court's decisions that prohibit nonjudicial functions being performed by judges, I would say that a member of this Court or any other court could not perform the functions being performed by the Comptroller General here."
1985.85-1377,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5761.135,5770.657,"Well, you say, you say these are legislative functions, so do you disagree with the Solicitor General that they are purely executive functions?"
1985.85-1377,4,16500,alan_b_morrison,,5770.657,5771.607,No.
1985.85-1377,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5772.693,5773.843,"Well, they can't be both."
1985.85-1377,4,16500,alan_b_morrison,,5773.843,5776.561,"--That is correct, they cannot be both."
1985.85-1377,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5790.654,5791.97,You mean the functions may be--
1985.85-1377,4,16500,alan_b_morrison,,5791.97,5795.558,Must be performed by a person who may not be removed by the Congress.
1985.85-1377,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,5795.558,5795.974,--I see.
1985.85-1377,4,16500,alan_b_morrison,,5806.164,5807.23,They couldn't be removed by the Congress.
1985.85-1377,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5825.692,5834.713,"--But your conclusion would be that if they had made that assignment to these judges selected in that way, it would be just as improper as the one you are now challenging."
1985.85-1377,4,16500,alan_b_morrison,,5834.713,5835.38,"Precisely, precisely."
1985.85-1377,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5835.38,5836.513,And for the same reasons.
1985.85-1377,4,16500,alan_b_morrison,,5836.513,5837.999,Well--
1985.85-1377,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5837.999,5839.182,Or similar.
1985.85-1377,4,16500,alan_b_morrison,,5839.182,5840.015,"--Very similar reasons, yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-1377,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5840.015,5840.632,Similar reasons.
1985.85-1377,4,16500,alan_b_morrison,,5840.632,5841.215,"Yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-1377,4,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6094.728,6096.994,Very well.
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,6107.202,6112.606,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1985.85-1377,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6139.807,6141.473,"Well, why does it... why does that follow?"
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,6143.673,6150.21,"--No, I would like to spend my time on the separation of powers, Comptroller General role, Your Honor, but, but I say--"
1985.85-1377,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6150.21,6157.833,But they could be... they still could be at least quasi-legislative functions and be delegated.
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,6157.833,6159.351,"--Yes, indeed."
1985.85-1377,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6159.351,6162.136,And they wouldn't necessarily follow that they are executive functions.
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,6162.136,6162.652,"Yes, indeed."
1985.85-1377,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6170.04,6172.675,So just because they are delegated doesn't mean that they cease being legislative.
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,6172.675,6174.194,--That's true.
1985.85-1377,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6177.312,6178.696,Then why do you say that they have to be either.
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,6178.696,6179.862,"Well, I don't understand... I beg your pardon."
1985.85-1377,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6220.635,6221.801,"--Well, that's what I was going to get at."
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,6231.574,6240.697,"He is indeed, Your Honor, but he is doing it in large measure by, as I say, fully implementing the law himself."
1985.85-1377,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6271.568,6279.757,"Well, then, absent the removal power by Congress, you would say this 1985 act is all right?"
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,6279.757,6294.683,"Yes, if this were... if we're talking strictly about the separation of powers question, forgetting the delegation argument, I would say there is no violation of the separation of powers if this power is deemed executive and it were given to the executive branch, that's correct."
1985.85-1377,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6294.683,6307.574,"Well, I know, but absent, absent... if there was no provision for congressional removal of the Solicitor General... of the Comptroller General, then this act would be all right?"
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,6307.574,6326.218,"I would like to see what the Office of Comptroller General would be like without removal, but if he were indeed functioning like a truly independent officer, although that's not at issue here, I certainly am not prepared to argue that that would be unconstitutional, Your Honor."
1985.85-1377,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6326.218,6327.634,"Well, the Solicitor General is, as you know."
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,6327.634,6364.157,"Yes, and let me just say about that that I think the question of what kind of an officer could perform these duties is really not at all before this Court, and the reason is that to decide that the President must remove this officer in some way is by definition to decide that he may not be removed by Congress, which is now the fact, and if that is true, then the fallback mechanism that the statute provides should take place because the congressional removal would render the Comptroller General unable to perform these functions."
1985.85-1377,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,6397.147,6402.199,"Let me just ask one question about the removal power which you regard as critical, as I understand it."
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,6418.728,6425.465,"--Yes, Your Honor, I do assume, but the causes here are very broad: inefficiency and neglect of duty."
1985.85-1377,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,6435.17,6441.343,"But surely they could not remove him for, because they disagreed with his policy judgments on estimating rates of inflation or unemployment."
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,6441.343,6443.726,"--I take it they would never characterize it in that fashion, Your Honor."
1985.85-1377,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6445.395,6450.013,Are you suggesting they might regard that as inefficiency or neglect of duty?
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,6450.013,6453.584,--I think the causes are broad enough to include practically anything.
1985.85-1377,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,6477.766,6481.568,"Would you make the same argument if he could only be removed for committing a felony, say?"
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,6481.568,6486.705,"--Well, it would depend a little bit on how reviewable that decision would be, Your Honor."
1985.85-1377,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,6486.705,6488.422,"Well, is this decision reviewable?"
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,6489.407,6491.942,"That's right, and I'm sorry, I don't know the answer to that."
1985.85-1377,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,6496.728,6498.78,"Of the statute would be, but the... but I'm concerned about the exercise of it."
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,6502.382,6509.238,"I have no reason to think that it would be reviewable, Your Honor, and given the fact that it is extremely broad, that is obviously a danger."
1985.85-1377,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6638.602,6644.073,This is true although Congress has never made an effort to exert the authority?
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,6644.073,6645.525,"I believe so, Justice Marshall."
1985.85-1377,5,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,6645.525,6646.608,It's still true?
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,6646.608,6661.785,"Yes, and I would say that whether... the fact that no removal has been attempted is at least as strong an argument that this... that this person knows to whom he is accountable as it is that he not really accountable to Congress."
1985.85-1377,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6672.675,6682.614,"We have been told in briefs and in the oral argument that the Comptroller General has described himself in effect as an arm, an agent of the Congress."
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,6688.435,6696.708,"So far as I know, Your Honor, and no one has pointed to the contrary, although his functions have been variously described, certainly."
1985.85-1377,5,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,6774.458,6786.349,"Do you think in that analysis, do you think it's a more important element of the Comptroller General's independence from Congress' point of view that the President cannot remove him than that Congress can remove him?"
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,6786.349,6804.929,"I absolutely do, Your Honor, and I think they are opposite sides of the same coin, that independence, total independence from the President, in fact, on the spectrum, would be total dependence on Congress, and that the truest independence, as we have argued in our brief, is somewhere between those branches, where each branch has some influence."
1985.85-1377,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,6830.127,6834.864,It sounds to me like you're adopting the Solicitor General's argument that the officer must be removable by the President in order to perform this function.
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,6834.864,6835.947,"I beg your pardon, Your Honor."
1985.85-1377,5,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,6836.414,6844.886,It sounds to me as though you have adopted the Solicitor General's position that this officer must be removable by the President in order for the powers to be delegated to him.
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,6845.62,6846.922,"--Indeed yes, Your Honor."
1985.85-1377,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6854.509,6859.579,"But in any event, he must not be removable by the Congress alone, is that your point?"
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,6859.579,6861.029,"Absolutely, Your Honor, absolutely."
1985.85-1377,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7028.687,7030.822,Done enough with its legislative task.
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,7030.822,7031.705,--Yes.
1985.85-1377,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7035.541,7037.625,So you are arguing that there's an undue--
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,7037.625,7040.86,"--Absolutely, absolutely, Your Honor."
1985.85-1377,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7043.546,7044.379,--Yes.
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,7044.379,7047.414,--This is an alternative ground for upholding the lower court.
1985.85-1377,5,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7047.414,7051.133,"And so it is either... again, it is either... if it isn't legislative, it's executive."
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,7052.652,7053.752,"Yes, that's my argument, Your Honor."
1985.85-1377,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7059.806,7068.661,"I take it there, Ms. Williams, I take it there you are relying on the fact that historically, for 199 years, these functions have been performed by the Congress."
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,7068.661,7072.113,"--To the... yes, absolutely, yes."
1985.85-1377,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7072.113,7074.248,With the cooperation of the President.
1985.85-1377,5,35280,lois_g_williams,,7074.248,7075.165,"Yes, by statute."
1985.85-1377,5,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,7172.379,7173.514,Very well.
1985.85-1377,6,34255,lloyd_n_cutler,,7175.831,7196.694,"With respect to what the Solicitor General has said about the Comptroller General being an officer of Congress, I do not believe that has been the consistent position of the executive or Congress."
