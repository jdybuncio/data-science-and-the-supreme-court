2013.12-930,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.904,"We'll hear argument now in Case 12-930, Mayorkas v. Cuellar de Osorio."
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,7.904,10.689,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-930,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,50.183,57.837,But isn't there -- isn't the effect on the no longer child much more severe?
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,67.443,73.863,"Your Honor, I don't accept the proposition that it would only make a difference of months, although I know Respondents have argued that."
2013.12-930,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,75.163,76.632,"Well, it's not going to be 27 years."
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,76.632,77.199,--I'm sorry?
2013.12-930,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,77.199,78.833,It's not going to be 20 years.
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,78.833,80.033,"No, Your Honor."
2013.12-930,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,87.522,92.724,What about all the time this one child has been waiting?
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,94.51,102.782,"I think it's mistaken to think of a derivative beneficiary as waiting in line and being entitled to credit for waiting in line, for a couple of different reasons."
2013.12-930,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,143.024,143.324,What's that for?
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,143.324,143.976,--I'm sorry.
2013.12-930,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,143.976,147.061,For those of us who don't deal with this as much as you do.
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,147.061,147.661,"I apologize, Your Honor."
2013.12-930,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,149.613,150.68,Okay.
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,150.68,166.956,"So they could be waiting in the (f)(4) line for 15 years, let's say, as a principal beneficiary; and then just as they get -- they're getting up to the front of that line and their priority date is going to become current, they get married to somebody; and the person they get married to has a 17-year-old child at that point in time."
2013.12-930,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,221.109,224.645,So you interpret automatic to include immediate.
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,224.645,236.453,"--Well, I think that if -- if automatically converted, in the context of this statute, if that's triggered by a particular event, then it has to happen as a result of that event, yes."
2013.12-930,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,236.453,241.873,"But your reading of this statute gives (h)(3) a very, very narrow scope; isn't that correct?"
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,252.914,254.18,"No, Your Honor, it does not."
2013.12-930,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,254.18,254.714,All right.
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,269.857,270.709,Right.
2013.12-930,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,270.709,271.509,Benefit sharing.
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,271.509,272.126,Yes.
2013.12-930,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,308.132,311.703,Can you give me an idea of how -- just to follow up on Justice Alito.
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,357.982,359.85,--I don't know what percentage.
2013.12-930,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,359.85,362.136,"Any idea, any rough idea?"
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,395.19,396.34,"Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-930,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,414.401,420.388,"I'm going to let you answer his question, but yes, they had a regulation so why didn't they copy the regulation?"
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,420.388,421.09,Well--
2013.12-930,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,421.09,434.748,"It would have been much, much simpler to say this is limited to F2A beneficiaries than to write it the way they did and say this is to everybody who ages out."
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,434.748,437.95,--There are two reasons I think why they didn't copy the--
2013.12-930,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,437.95,438.802,"Answer him, and then--"
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,438.802,439.386,--Okay.
2013.12-930,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,484.748,489.151,Did you ask -- anything that would give me -- that's the total global picture.
2013.12-930,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,517.136,518.671,You do give the subsets.
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,520.921,521.623,--Yes.
2013.12-930,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,525.742,526.675,--That's F2A.
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,527.776,529.893,"--No, I think F2A is what's relevant."
2013.12-930,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,529.893,531.111,F2A.
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,531.395,531.811,That's what's covered.
2013.12-930,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,547.255,547.621,All right.
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,550.892,552.375,"It varies, Your Honor."
2013.12-930,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,669.719,680.425,Suppose there are two -- suppose there are two lawful permanent residents who are exactly the same except that one has a minor child and one has an adult unmarried child.
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,708.944,709.544,Correct.
2013.12-930,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,709.544,716.617,"But the person would be -- the child would be at a much lower point, right, than the first one?"
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,718.117,720.169,I don't think that's necessarily true.
2013.12-930,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,733.911,734.294,Right.
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,735.344,741.315,"Well, but they would -- yes, I suppose that's true, but the person who ages out would be keeping the original priority date."
2013.12-930,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,753.04,753.506,"Oh, okay."
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,754.908,756.442,--is that that's extremely disruptive to the line.
2013.12-930,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,760.027,768.883,"Ms. Goldenberg, before you do that, could I just ask you to respond to a sort of different hypothesis of what Congress was up to here and tell me what, if anything, you think follows from it?"
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,808.71,809.243,--Right.
2013.12-930,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,821.35,824.652,Do you mean we can't correct congressional mistakes?
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,824.652,833.156,"No, but I think in a situation where the language is ambiguous the agency is entitled to deference, and deference is particularly appropriate in this kind of circumstance."
2013.12-930,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,955.803,958.322,So that -- that's an expectation argument?
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,962.441,971.397,"--Well, I think the idea is that the people who are going to be pushed have had long-time relationships with a lawful permanent resident entitling them directly to family-sponsored immigration."
2013.12-930,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,987.924,990.793,--We don't have numbers on separation from parents.
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1006.22,1009.505,"--Well, I do think that there are sympathetic stories on both sides, but--"
2013.12-930,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1009.505,1016.61,"You can find sympathetic stories all over the place, and I mean -- all right."
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1016.91,1023.097,"--For the reason I gave earlier, though, I don't think it's right to think of derivative beneficiaries as themselves waiting in line."
2013.12-930,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1044.845,1051.082,Is your real quarrel here with the idea of an appropriate category or with the automatic conversion?
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1063.006,1068.626,"I do think you have to look at the phrase as a whole, but I also don't think that that's what Respondents are arguing."
2013.12-930,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1069.745,1070.928,"Well, why isn't it automatic?"
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1070.928,1078.066,"--Well, I think it's not automatic because at the moment -- let me step back and say I think there are two different problems with Respondent's position."
2013.12-930,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1089.59,1095.611,Automatic just means something occurs without anybody having to initiate the change.
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1095.611,1096.48,--That's true.
2013.12-930,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1096.48,1099.847,So why isn't there -- why isn't it automatic here?
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1099.847,1114.857,"Well, I think that, with respect to the issue that I was just talking about, which is the question of whether you can ever convert a petition to -- make a petition by itself required."
2013.12-930,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1194.643,1198.528,"I understand that argument, but that's not the argument that Wang made, is it?"
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1213.538,1214.557,"I don't think that's true, Your Honor."
2013.12-930,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1302.413,1305.197,What do we do with a reasonable reading of the statute?
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1333.317,1333.85,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2013.12-930,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1333.85,1336.002,So that's what they think this statute is about.
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1377.829,1384.566,"I don't think there's a problem with the reason they gave, and I would like to explain why, but even if there were a problem with the reason they gave, I don't think that it would appropriate to send it back."
2013.12-930,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1441.086,1457.865,"--That is strange because I look at (h)(3), which talks about automatic conversion of battered spouses, of widowed spouses, and I think under your reading, you're basically saying Congress was not intending to let those people jump the line."
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1458.465,1459.148,"--No, Your Honor."
2013.12-930,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1459.148,1461.333,Because you have to change names?
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1461.333,1461.917,No.
2013.12-930,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1461.917,1463.185,"Oh, there's automatic--"
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1463.185,1467.236,There -- There is automatic conversion for self-petitioners and their derivatives.
2013.12-930,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1475.159,1483.515,"--So why did Congress need to add (h) -- (h)(4), using exactly the same language that it used for (h)(3)?"
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1483.515,1484.815,"--Well, Congress--"
2013.12-930,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1484.815,1490.169,That they -- that they were entitled to the same benefits of automatic conversion as (h)(3).
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1490.169,1510.249,"--Congress added (h)(4) a couple of years after the Child Status Protection Act, I think, basically just to ensure that battered women, people who are subject to abuse, could get whatever benefit the Child Status Protection Act offered them, even though they already had this other, very good protection that I'm talking about against aging out in Section 1154 (a)(1)(d)(1), (1) and (3)."
2013.12-930,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1529.127,1529.861,So you can have automatic--
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1529.861,1530.329,--Exactly.
2013.12-930,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1530.329,1534.865,--You can have automatic conversion only in the situations that give you other -- other statutes.
2013.12-930,0,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,1534.865,1536.067,If I could reserve the remainder of my time.
2013.12-930,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1537.017,1537.533,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1544.071,1546.588,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-930,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1713.515,1719.586,"Under your view, does automatic conversion cover someone who has to filed a new petition?"
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1719.586,1723.204,--Automatic conversion does not require the filing of a new petition.
2013.12-930,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1728.525,1730.692,"So the way this works, you don't have to file a new petition?"
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1730.692,1731.977,--That's common ground between us.
2013.12-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1737.714,1743.285,"But under -- under her theory, the -- the petition is -- is still coming from the same person."
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1761.163,1764.031,"Well, a couple of points on that, Justice Scalia."
2013.12-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1782.093,1786.379,It would file a petition in that person's name without that person's consent?
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1786.379,1792.698,"Well, the immigration, the ultimate moment of immigration, when the child comes in, cannot happen without the parent's consent."
2013.12-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1795.584,1799.704,And you're saying that this automatically gives the consent of that parent?
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1799.704,1801.054,"--No, I'm not saying that, Justice Scalia."
2013.12-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1801.054,1804.256,"Well, you must be if it can automatically convert."
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1804.256,1827.872,"The conversion can happen to a petition in the F2B category, but in order for a visa actually to be given and for the child to immigrate, first of all, the child would have to provide proof the parent is, in fact, a permanent resident, and would also have to provide an affidavit of support, under a provision that the government cites in its reply brief, agreeing to support the child so that he or she does not become a public charge."
2013.12-930,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1832.642,1833.159,I'm sorry.
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1833.159,1834.075,"--I'm sorry, Justice Kagan."
2013.12-930,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1834.075,1834.661,Please.
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1834.661,1835.894,"Well, I was just going to finish the thought."
2013.12-930,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1852.006,1855.708,"In the usual case, a petitioner has to show a bunch of things, right?"
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1878.656,1880.54,"That's not right at all, Justice Kagan."
2013.12-930,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1906.205,1907.307,Is that for F2A children as well?
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1907.307,1908.007,I think--
2013.12-930,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1908.007,1911.009,"These steps, are they applied to F2A?"
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1911.009,1913.543,"--Derivatives, who age out?"
2013.12-930,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1913.543,1914.577,Not derivatives.
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1917.079,1917.829,"Yes, Justice."
2013.12-930,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1921.547,1925.935,Everything happens at visa issuance moment?
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1925.935,1943.813,"The visa application stage, the officer who is adjudicating the application has to ensure the qualifications of the petitioner to make sure they actually are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident entitled to petition, and the qualifications of the beneficiary to make sure that they have met all of the requirements."
2013.12-930,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1943.813,1946.532,Direct or derivative?
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1946.532,1946.915,Yes.
2013.12-930,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1950.234,1959.756,"So you're saying that these things would happen -- do I understand you correctly, these things or most of these same things would happen in the cases in which the government says there is automatic conversion?"
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,1959.756,1960.941,"Most certainly, Justice Alito."
2013.12-930,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2034.989,2040.31,"Mr. Fleming, to accept that argument, don't you have to accept your understanding of what the appropriate date is?"
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2055.236,2057.586,"Two answers to that, Justice Kagan."
2013.12-930,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2084.053,2088.374,"But let's assume that this is the right date, the one that's actually specified in the statute."
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2090.409,2093.778,"--It is -- well, we don't think that is the right date."
2013.12-930,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2094.545,2096.563,"I know, but can you win if it is the right date?"
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2096.563,2107.769,"--Well, I think at that point, the question then becomes, does the conversion have to happen immediately at that time, or as long as it's converted at some point in the future, are we still interpreting the statute in a harmonious way?"
2013.12-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2230.25,2234.019,But how does -- can I try an example because I think it's easier to--
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2234.019,2234.452,Of course.
2013.12-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2234.452,2235.054,--All right.
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2320.058,2324.545,I'm NOT comfortable referring to Your Honor by your first name or your brother by his first name.
2013.12-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2325.178,2328.897,This is an imaginary -- he spells it with a V.
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2328.897,2332.984,"Your Honor, has it right."
2013.12-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2332.984,2333.367,Okay.
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2334.384,2342.073,"With one tweak, which is, I think you're positing that your brother and his son are outside the country, not going through adjustment of status."
2013.12-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2342.073,2342.59,--Yes.
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2342.59,2344.673,"--where the situation is a bit different, because then--"
2013.12-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2344.673,2345.708,All right.
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2345.708,2346.958,--your brother would become a permanent resident immediately.
2013.12-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2348.292,2348.744,Okay.
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2348.744,2355.731,"But for consular processing, -- I think what would happen is when you go to the consular office--"
2013.12-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2355.731,2356.231,Yes?
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2356.231,2365.753,"--Judge Breyer's application would be accepted and the calculation would be done for the son, and it would be -- all right."
2013.12-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2365.753,2366.371,All right.
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2366.821,2369.323,"You now no longer qualify as a derivative, because you are 24."
2013.12-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2369.323,2369.723,--All right.
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2380.696,2390.404,"What happens then is what can happen already under the agency procedures, which is they deny Joseph's application without prejudice to reapplication within a year, which they can do."
2013.12-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2403.395,2410.282,And doesn't -- doesn't Charles as a lawful permanent resident have to file a piece of paper called the petition--
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2410.282,2411.617,No.
2013.12-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2411.617,2414.686,--in which Joseph is named primary beneficiary?
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2414.686,2416.169,"I mean, we have two arguments on this."
2013.12-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2422.792,2423.525,Yes.
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2423.525,2426.91,--with respect to -- to an F2B petition on--
2013.12-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2426.91,2430.779,"But there is no -- there is no F2B petition, because Charles never filed it."
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2430.779,2431.564,--But that's--
2013.12-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2431.564,2432.698,"I mean, yes; right."
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2432.698,2434.35,--He -- you don't need to a piece -- that's where automatic--
2013.12-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2434.35,2435.333,That's what I want to know.
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2435.833,2436.316,--You don't need to file a piece of paper.
2013.12-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2436.316,2437.802,"--We do all this, and--"
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2437.802,2440.754,"It's done constructively, and that's what automatic conversion is."
2013.12-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2534.798,2545.487,"If I understand you, the -- the parent will be deemed to have filed a petition for admission of this now-adult, right?"
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2545.487,2546.606,That is correct.
2013.12-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2546.606,2550.991,And -- but the parent can withdraw that petition?
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2550.991,2553.01,"If he or she would ever wish to do so, yes."
2013.12-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2558.497,2561.033,All of this flows from the word ‶ automatic ″?
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2561.033,2564.151,"--From the phrase ‶ automatic conversion ″, yes."
2013.12-930,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2651.94,2661.212,"Based on -- another understanding of Chevron is sometimes Congress writes confusing statutes that point in two different directions at once, and then there's a choice."
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2681.743,2697.154,"--I would certainly agree, Justice Kagan, as a general matter that the immigration law is confusing, but I don't think it's any more confusing than other statutes where this Court worked through and found the -- the ultimate provision at issue to be clear on the question at issue."
2013.12-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2884.043,2886.328,"Well, this is all upside down."
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2895.933,2896.633,--That is--
2013.12-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2896.633,2905.789,"You're saying that's not true, that if it can be read the way the court of appeals would like it to be read, we must affirm the court of appeals on it."
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2905.789,2907.074,"--This is a important question, Justice Scalia."
2013.12-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2907.891,2908.474,It sure is.
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2909.793,2921.834,--What I have been -- what I have been trying to note is the fact that what we're talking about here is a statute that the Government is trying to argue is hopelessly internally inconsistent.
2013.12-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2947.199,2953.12,That would depend entirely upon how much weight you want to give to the word ‶ automatically ″.
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,2977.854,2981.806,"This -- I'm not seeking deference to the Ninth Circuit by any means, Justice Scalia."
2013.12-930,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3012.059,3023.716,"Suppose -- suppose everybody knows that for the group that's covered by the Ninth Circuit's opinion, the nephews, that there's going to be a 3 or 4-year wait."
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,3031.389,3053.386,"What -- what fundamentally happens is that the petition gets filed by the U.S. citizen relative, and then after it's approved just by basically checking that the relative is entitled to file that petition, then everybody awaits until the petition -- until the priority date of the beneficiary becomes current according to the State Department lines."
2013.12-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3098.283,3099.849,--Can I ask you a quick question--
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,3099.849,3100.233,--Yes.
2013.12-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3100.233,3102.335,--about your alternative argument with you and Justice Scalia.
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,3111.707,3112.191,Yes.
2013.12-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3112.191,3112.574,All right.
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,3117.578,3118.045,Yes.
2013.12-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3118.045,3121.463,"See, if I lose on that, then look at the second part."
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,3127.601,3128.903,That's -- that is--
2013.12-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3128.903,3131.421,"So, it's either A or B."
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,3145.228,3146.68,--I don't think so.
2013.12-930,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3148.33,3148.849,No.
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,3156.803,3158.088,--I think that's certainly--
2013.12-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3158.088,3162.624,How can you possibly qualify for B without qualifying for A?
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,3169.028,3170.096,--The way the government--
2013.12-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3170.096,3170.73,That's quite impossible.
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,3174.182,3191.376,"--The way the government has been applying this provision since its enactment, for over 10 years, Justice Scalia, has been to require everybody, even the people, the F2A beneficiaries whom the government is now contending are entitled to automatic conversion, it has required them to file to get a new petition filed."
2013.12-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3227.566,3234.422,"Well, all that proves is that you need either automatic conversion or the filing of a separate petition."
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,3238.107,3238.424,Yes.
2013.12-930,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3238.424,3240.226,"--before the B part,"
2013.12-930,1,35804,mark_c_fleming,,3243.594,3250.082,"We don't disagree with that, Justice Scalia, but we have new petitions that were filed as a protective matter in these cases."

2013.12-930,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3417.675,3420.876,What he's saying -- but what he's saying is that's true of everybody.
2013.12-930,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3429.982,3430.982,"No, that's not--"
2013.12-930,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3430.982,3434.184,--until you go to the consular order -- office and apply.
2013.12-930,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3436.236,3441.707,"--It's not true with respect to F2A derivatives, because they have an existing relationship with the existing petitioner."
2013.12-930,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3449.996,3451.729,They can come in before their parent?
2013.12-930,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3451.729,3453.265,"--No, it's not that they can come in--"
2013.12-930,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3453.265,3456.9,"Their parent has to become a citizen and then they can come in, correct?"
2013.12-930,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3456.9,3461.786,"--Yes, Your Honor, but they don't -- to get automatic conversion, they are not relying on that new lawful permanent resident."
2013.12-930,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3541.489,3549.392,"Well, it's not so odd to say they've got a priority date in their pocket when the statute says the original priority date -- they'll retain the original priority date."
2013.12-930,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3549.392,3569.806,"--Yes, but the statute is most reasonably read to say, as all other automatic conversion provisions do, that they retain the priority date if the automatic conversion is possible, so that there's a specific petition being identified that that priority date is going to attach to, and not that you just somehow have a priority date, which is, keep in mind, a filing date that you're just going to kind of hold and walk around with and use it if you want."
2013.12-930,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3569.806,3570.406,Hold or maybe retain.
2013.12-930,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3570.406,3579.531,"Well, but in a situation in which the parent never becomes a lawful permanent resident, that would mean -- that would turn the -- the notion of a derivative beneficiary upside down."
2013.12-930,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3585.0,3585.934,I am so confused.
2013.12-930,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3589.153,3590.219,"--Sorry, Your Honor."
2013.12-930,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3590.219,3601.027,"It's an original date basically to the original petition, meaning there has -- it is that that's being converted."
2013.12-930,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3610.133,3615.121,"But Respondents' argument is that you don't need automatic conversion, that retention of priority date--"
2013.12-930,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3615.121,3617.254,You're talking about his second step.
2013.12-930,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3617.254,3617.737,--It's the -- exactly.
2013.12-930,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3618.773,3619.239,All right.
2013.12-930,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3620.206,3623.458,You just explained exactly why that can't be right because you do need something to attach it to.

2013.12-930,2,22331,elaine_j_goldenberg,,3625.992,3626.426,Exactly.
2013.12-930,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3634.082,3636.867,You can finish -- finish that sentence.
