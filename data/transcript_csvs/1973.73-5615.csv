1973.73-5615,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,20.369,"We’ll hear arguments next in 73-5615, Codispoti and others against Pennsylvania."
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,23.579,24.98,Thank you sir.
1973.73-5615,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,124.633,150.456,"Do you think that the Courts under Illinois against Allen could have bound and gag these defendants as we said they could in Illinois against Allen, and then appoint counsel for them without regard to what they felt about counsel or appointing alternatively counsel as friends of the Court to act for them?"
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,150.456,158.764,"Your Honor, Count Advisers as our Court called them in 1966 were appointed to help these people who were representing themselves as their own counsel."
1973.73-5615,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,178.45,180.637,Did you say it took six weeks to try this?
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,180.637,184.112,"I think it’s about six and a half weeks sir, yes."
1973.73-5615,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,199.652,200.906,Not the contempt trial?
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,200.906,201.813,Not the contempt trial.
1973.73-5615,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,211.298,212.702,They committed several contempts?
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,212.702,215.123,"Contempts, these are the contempts that are currently before this Court."
1973.73-5615,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,215.123,217.765,And we’re involved in this case only with the contempt trial?
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,217.765,220.645,"That’s right, only with the contempt trial."
1973.73-5615,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,249.653,252.562,"Now, is that only Mayberry?"
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,252.562,262.282,"Mayberry was the only petitioner really before the Court directly, although he under the order seem to drag in Codispoti and Langnes with him."
1973.73-5615,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,266.549,268.054,And what happened to Mayberry?
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,268.054,271.349,Mr. Mayberry chose not to go to this Court.
1973.73-5615,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,276.692,277.639,Is he part of this case?
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,277.639,279.059,"No, he’s not Your Honor."
1973.73-5615,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,279.059,280.324,But he was to the --
1973.73-5615,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,280.324,282.425,He was the only party in the first case?
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,282.425,286.767,"Yes, Your Honor, in the first case that we had he was a sole party."
1973.73-5615,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,286.767,289.962,"No, what about this contempt proceeding, was he involved in this?"
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,289.962,290.58,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-5615,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,335.077,337.062,"And Mayberry was again convicted, wasn’t it?"
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,337.062,341.099,Mayberry was again adjudicated in contempt of Court and sentenced.
1973.73-5615,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,341.099,343.376,A sentence comparable of the one than the first?
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,343.376,344.322,"No, Your Honor."
1973.73-5615,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,366.798,368.771,And he had -- didn’t seek review of that?
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,368.771,376.382,He again appealed that sentences to the other ones to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court which this time affirmed pre curiam with judgment of contempt.
1973.73-5615,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,390.859,396.183,But Mayberry will serve his four years and two months whatever it is?
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,396.183,397.068,"Evidently, Your Honor."
1973.73-5615,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,397.068,398.648,"In any event, he didn’t seek review of it?"
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,398.648,400.006,I was court-appointed counsel.
1973.73-5615,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,406.548,408.087,"Well, he is not here?"
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,408.087,409.389,He is not in front of the Court.
1973.73-5615,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,667.607,675.667,"Mr. Dean, the case that you’re (Inaudible) on Mayberry’s behalf we’re talking about 20 to 22 years then to, aren’t we?"
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,675.667,677.422,We’re talking about 11 to 22 years sir.
1973.73-5615,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,679.849,688.285,And did the opinion devote itself at all to jury trials on this issue?
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,688.285,689.864,"No, Your Honor, not directly."
1973.73-5615,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,708.386,714.763,Do you think that there is any significance in our failure to discuss it at all?
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,714.763,721.531,"Your Honor, I think it would be presumptuous of me to try to impute the reasons for this Court as to why they did a particular action in a particular case."
1973.73-5615,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,741.214,748.62,"Incidentally, were there any further contempts citations during the contempt trial?"
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,748.62,750.572,There was one Your Honor.
1973.73-5615,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,787.925,797.147,"Well, I was looking at the material on page 48 and so forth of the record but there was no formal contempt to your man Codispoti?"
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,797.147,802.969,"Yes Your Honor, he was sentenced to six, I believe it was Codispoti was sentenced six months or Langnes."
1973.73-5615,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,828.049,832.534,"Where does he make the request politely, on what page?"
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,832.534,833.965,You mean within here sir?
1973.73-5615,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,835.552,835.844,Yes.
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,835.844,837.684,Or you mean for jury trial and so forth?
1973.73-5615,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,837.684,839.235,"Well, any request that he made politely then?"
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,839.235,855.164,"Alright, on page four of the brief, Your Honor are the -- I am sorry appendix 43, excuse me as where in the appendix it would be for Mr. Codispoti, he starts up here."
1973.73-5615,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,918.218,942.077,"Going back to 43 where you’ve said his conduct was polite, do you regard it as polite conduct when he suggests to the Court that the judge and the prison authorities are engaged in a conspiracy to railroad him, at the bottom of 43?"
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,942.077,948.656,"Well, Your Honor, perhaps that -- alright I will not say that’s the most polite way."
1973.73-5615,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,963.458,967.155,"Yes, we have observed that."
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,967.155,978.061,"But it any event, he does say here on page 47, there is one thing and this is Mr. Codispoti saying, there is one and this is after he has been denied this, “there’s one thing I want to make clear."
1973.73-5615,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1012.081,1019.199,"What part of 47, let’s skip it."
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,1019.199,1022.084,"Yes, sir."
1973.73-5615,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1076.61,1081.515,"Well, are you suggesting we should -- that they should not have been brought into a courtroom?"
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,1081.515,1085.191,"Your Honor, if it were my personal opinion, I feel they are very sick individuals."
1973.73-5615,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1106.281,1129.478,"That was what I had in mind when I was reading pages 46, 47 and 48 in that area when I asked you whether the judge, if he cared to say would’ve been justified in binding and gagging them and then having a lawyer go ahead and conduct the proceedings on the basis of the prior record."
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,1129.478,1134.104,"In the Judge Vandervort proceedings what you’re talking about, I thought the original you’re talking about the Judge Fiok proceedings."
1973.73-5615,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1134.104,1134.605,No.
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,1134.605,1136.949,"I am sorry, Your Honor."
1973.73-5615,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1141.032,1145.017,"Yes, did the judge have any other choice under Illinois against Allen?"
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,1147.9,1153.959,"Not to my direct knowledge Your Honor, no."
1973.73-5615,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1286.804,1287.962,Perhaps in the military.
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,1287.962,1296.424,"[Laughter Attempt] Perhaps in the military but often times do not in the military voluntarily, but at least you haven’t been in the past that was not a matter of choice being in there."
1973.73-5615,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1296.424,1299.513,I have most of mine now.
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,1299.513,1303.666,That’s probably true at this point at least most of them are.
1973.73-5615,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1408.459,1415.081,"But didn’t you argue in Mayberry that that was what should be done there, send it back for trial before another judge?"
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,1415.081,1420.671,"Yes, Your Honor, I did not argue Mayberry originally before this Court, but it is my understanding that was argued and that’s what was done."
1973.73-5615,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1428.243,1430.933,You want another judge and the jury?
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,1430.933,1435.283,Another judge and the jury is what we would like in this particular instance.
1973.73-5615,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1436.178,1441.743,Did Mayberry say anything about this issue?
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,1441.743,1442.108,No.
1973.73-5615,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1443.667,1446.775,"Well, I’m talking about the opinion in our Court, the Court opinion in our Court."
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,1446.775,1447.687,Say anything about this particular --
1973.73-5615,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1447.687,1455.769,We remanded it for a trial before another judge -- judge other than the judge who tried the original criminal trial.
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,1455.769,1456.489,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-5615,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1456.489,1459.883,"And in a public trial, did it say anything at all about the --"
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,1459.883,1460.664,A jury trial?
1973.73-5615,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1460.664,1461.099,A jury trial.
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,1461.099,1461.778,"No, Your Honor."
1973.73-5615,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1461.778,1462.734,One way or the other?
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,1462.734,1465.227,"No, not to my knowledge, they did not say that there was --"
1973.73-5615,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1465.227,1465.759,"That was my recollection, I am sure."
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,1465.759,1468.318,-- it was not to be a jury trial in this particular case.
1973.73-5615,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1468.318,1471.927,I take it.
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,1502.109,1504.388,I am sorry -- I understand exact the exact thrust of your question.
1973.73-5615,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1504.388,1525.314,"Well, I gather your -- basically you say because by imposing consecutive sentences on a number of counts, you get in excess of six months without a jury trial and constitutionally that can’t be done, is that correct?"
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,1525.314,1526.881,"That’s right, Your Honor."
1973.73-5615,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1526.881,1537.94,"And what I’m suggesting is when the other judge gets as he did here a citation with multiple accounts, but were 11 here or something?"
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,1537.94,1539.595,Yes well that it varied among the individual [Voice Overlap].
1973.73-5615,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1539.595,1564.49,"Whatever the number was, isn’t his choice whether to have a jury trial going to require him then and there to decide that no I won’t give a jury trial because what I’ll do if I find guilty on any count is to impose not more than six months sentence on any count and make all sentences concurrent."
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,1564.49,1565.883,Your Honor he can do that.
1973.73-5615,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1569.166,1574.114,But do you suggest he could not do that and deny a jury trial if he decided that’s what he was [Voice Overlap]
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,1574.114,1575.701,"Obviously, he could do that, Your Honor."
1973.73-5615,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1604.562,1636.98,"Well, what I am suggesting Mr. Dean, is I would think sitting as a trial judge but I have to say to myself when I get 10 to 11 counts in the citation, I better have a jury trial since obviously if he is guilty on any substantial number of them, six months may not be enough or say to myself well I would have a jury trial because I will decide now that however many counts I find them guilty, I’ll impose concurrent sentences none in excess of six months."
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,1636.98,1641.571,I will just -- I would think that would be not acceptable approach to the problem.
1973.73-5615,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1643.142,1657.05,"And then I think we -- the subject came up in the Mayberry case that I have forgotten the answer, does Pennsylvania have a statute on obstruction of justice by way of conduct to this kind?"
1973.73-5615,0,29839,john_j_dean,,1657.05,1659.056,"Not of that particular time, no Your Honor."
1973.73-5615,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1664.4,1674.994,"Very well, Mr. Dean."
1973.73-5615,1,39176,robert_l_eberhardt,,1675.883,1678.066,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-5615,2,29839,john_j_dean,,3555.317,3556.55,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-5615,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3634.511,3653.505,"Mr. Dean, what do you think of this one line affirmance of the Supreme Court after as I understand your colleague haven't urged that the non-retroactivity of Bloom required or permitted in any event affirmance of the consecutive sentences."
1973.73-5615,2,29839,john_j_dean,,3653.505,3655.345,I argued the case Your Honor in front of the Court.
1973.73-5615,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3665.109,3670.638,"Well, if that were the basis of the affirmance, have you any comment?"
1973.73-5615,2,29839,john_j_dean,,3670.638,3672.295,That Bloom was not retroactive?
1973.73-5615,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3672.295,3673.793,Yes.
1973.73-5615,2,29839,john_j_dean,,3673.793,3676.239,I just don’t think that’s a correct legal reasoning.
1973.73-5615,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3676.239,3676.294,Why?
1973.73-5615,2,29839,john_j_dean,,3676.294,3680.319,I think it has to be retroactive because it was such a fundamental right --
1973.73-5615,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3680.319,3682.94,But the Stefano held it was not retroactive.
1973.73-5615,2,29839,john_j_dean,,3682.94,3687.096,"Well, let me say this, I used the wrong the choice of words there."
1973.73-5615,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3745.477,3749.774,Do you still have an open-ended -- is it still open-ended on contempt?
1973.73-5615,2,29839,john_j_dean,,3749.774,3753.007,There’s absolutely no maximum sentence on contempt of Court.
1973.73-5615,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3753.007,3760.14,And even if you prevail here I take it the judge would still impose the sentence for the contempts that the jury found to have been committed?
1973.73-5615,2,29839,john_j_dean,,3760.14,3774.186,"Yes, the judge is the one who has absolute discretion over the sentencing and absent a very clear abuse of discretion our appellate courts will not review a sentencing judge's determination."
1973.73-5615,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3774.186,3774.927,Thank you gentlemen.
