2016.16-327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.565,"We'll hear argument this morning in case 16-327, Lee v. United States. Mr. Bursch."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,6.565,14.94,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Jae Lee accepted a plea based on his counsel's assurance he would not be deported."
2016.16-327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,34.49,50.205,"In -- in State courts, do State -- are State courts mandated to follow what we do in the Federal courts under Rule 11; that is to say, before the guilty plea is accepted, to advise the defendant of all of his rights? I'm sure they are."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,50.205,50.61,Yeah.
2016.16-327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,53.22,63.05,"Do -- do they also tell -- advise the defendant that if he or she is an alien, there may be certain consequences to the plea? In State courts, do you happen to know?"
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,63.05,84.92,"I mean, in State courts, every court would have their own version of Rule 11, and so they're going to have some colloquy, and -- and I believe those colloquies have changed somewhat since Padilla. I -- you know, and so one of the problems here, if you look at what happened during the -- the withdrawal of the plea, everyone in the court, including the judge, thought that Mr. Lee was going to remain in the United States after he served his sentence."
2016.16-327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,84.92,88.205,But I -- I don't quite see that in -- in --
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,88.205,89.64,Let -- let me walk you through that.
2016.16-327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,89.64,93.39,"-- at -- at 103 of -- of the Joint Appendix, which is the beginning --"
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,93.39,94.04,Yes.
2016.16-327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,94.04,105.62,"The judge, after advising him of many of his rights, says: Are you a U.S. citizen? No, your Honor. Okay."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,116.8,117.14,Right.
2016.16-327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,133.9,134.34,"Well, except --"
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,134.34,135.295,-- you will not be deported.
2016.16-327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,135.295,154.15,"-- I'm -- I'm not sure how much more the judge can do, and that at least argues for our accepting midway ground of requiring Strickland conspiracy -- Strickland -- Strickland doubt, reasonable -- reasonable probability of -- of success if you go to a jury."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,154.15,167.155,"Well -- well, two -- two points on that, Justice Kennedy. First, with respect to what he heard from the judges, what I would really like the Court to focus on is the sentencing hearing colloquy, which is at pages 124 to 127 of the Joint Appendix."
2016.16-327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,182.01,182.31,"Well, that's --"
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,182.31,182.54,-- and that --
2016.16-327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,182.54,184.22,That goes to deficient performance.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,187.29,205.13,"Well, but -- but the question there, at the colloquy, was whether he was informed at all and how that prejudice -- to kind of combine the response to yours and Justice Kennedy's question, what's the standard that we have here? And we -- we start with the baseline, which is Strickland, is there a reasonable probability of a different outcome, but that was refined by this Court in Hill."
2016.16-327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,213.87,214.19,But is that --
2016.16-327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,214.19,250.875,"On that point, you say the facts here support that -- that conclusion and go through them all, but I don't understand how you'll be able to distinguish any case in the future. You say: Well, here, he's been here a long time, hasn't gone back to South Korea, has he started -- but I think someone who's just arrived might say: You know, this has been my passion my whole life to come to the United States; I don't want to go back. You know, it -- it -- I'm not sure how, at the outset, a judge can simply say: Oh, we don't need to have a hearing in a case like this. It seems to me that there would necessarily have to be a hearing in every case."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,250.875,260.185,"Well, there would at least have to be a 2255 hearing to get those facts on the table. But, Mr. Chief justice, what I want to emphasize is that this is an objective test, not a subjective test."
2016.16-327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,265.01,266.89,"Well, it sounds like a subjective test."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,291.825,304.495,"Well -- well, first, let's talk about an example where you can see where the outcome would be different based on objective, and then let's go back to the facts of this case and show why it's objectively rational here. I -- consider a case where a defendant is new to the country."
2016.16-327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,324.22,326.76,"What does rationality have to do with this, Mr. Bursch?"
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,326.76,327.385,Well --
2016.16-327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,327.385,336.7,"We often get people who come in and say I wasn't told about a plea, and I would have pled guilty."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,347.255,348.92,Yes.
2016.16-327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,348.92,351.5,Rock solid evidence.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,422.98,423.83,Yes.
2016.16-327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,423.83,435.5,"And there's even a one percent chance that I might be found not guilty, or at least found guilty of possession and not something else. I think I'm going to roll the dice."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,435.5,436.25,Exactly.
2016.16-327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,437.55,438.56,It's not irrational.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,438.56,438.99,It -- it --
2016.16-327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,438.99,439.62,But I don't know whether --
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,439.62,444.5,"It's irrational, and it's reasonably probable that that's the decision he would have made if properly informed."
2016.16-327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,444.78,453.86,"I don't think that's -- Mr. Bursch, I don't think that's a manageable standard. I -- I see a number of possible standards that could be used here."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,506.23,506.7,Well --
2016.16-327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,506.7,521.18,"Isn't it -- is it irrational to try to climb Mount Everest without oxygen? I mean, is it irrational to swim with sharks or perform on a tightrope without a net? I mean, I wouldn't do those things, but people do it."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,528.47,528.56,Right.
2016.16-327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,528.56,530.09,-- it's an unmanageable standard.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,530.09,537.53,"Well, I -- I think that the rationality standard, which you articulated in Padilla but not Hill, is supposed to be a low standard."
2016.16-327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,571.01,575.3,"Well, I -- you have very sympathetic facts, but suppose we change the variables a bit."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,578.435,578.79,Yes.
2016.16-327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,578.79,584.925,So you have a much more serious -- the potential for a much more serious sentence.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,598.46,598.75,Well --
2016.16-327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,598.75,601.065,At what point does it become irrational?
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,601.065,615.69,"Well, I think the starting point is the Hill test: Is there a reasonable probability the defendant, given all the objective circumstances, would have pleaded guilty? And once you've satisfied that, then you say, well, was this a rational thing to do? And the Court shouldn't guess in close cases."
2016.16-327,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,640.84,652.9,"Isn't this case, Mr. -- Mr. -- is unlike Strickland in this sense? In Strickland, so it's a trial error and the Court can -- can determine whether it's harmless."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,652.9,653.32,Yes.
2016.16-327,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,653.32,656.0,"But here, the plea is -- is a different thing."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,681.33,682.24,Yeah.
2016.16-327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,709.155,721.31,"But that points to a purely subjective test, which, as I said, is conceptually coherent, but creates a lot of practical difficulties, because then the Court is going to have to try to recreate what the defendant would have done."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,733.015,739.83,"Well, it's not so hard, because under the Federal statute for filing a 2255 petition, you've got to do it within a year."
2016.16-327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,746.335,750.04,"But is that what you're asking us to do, to adopt a purely subjective standard? You say no."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,750.04,751.37,"No, absolutely not."
2016.16-327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,751.37,752.58,What is --
2016.16-327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,752.58,753.09,What is --
2016.16-327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,753.09,753.94,What is your standard?
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,753.94,763.09,"Our standard is the same objective standard you articulated in Hill, and that is whether there was a reasonable probability the defendant would not have pleaded guilty."
2016.16-327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,763.09,763.32,All right.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,767.085,770.79,"Well, we're -- we're -- we're willing to live with the Padilla language that the decision --"
2016.16-327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,770.79,771.07,Well --
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,771.07,772.28,-- can be completely irrational.
2016.16-327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,772.28,783.435,"-- it's the same question differently, but it's meant to be the same question. What is the precise mistake of law that you think that the Sixth -- that the Sixth Circuit -- that Judge Batchelder made?"
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,783.435,783.73,Yes.
2016.16-327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,796.33,797.72,"Well, I'm not sure she did that."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,803.475,805.07,"Well, if you look --"
2016.16-327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,805.07,812.66,"And -- and in particular -- in particular, she said, look, this person would have been faced with a choice."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,875.215,875.47,Well --
2016.16-327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,875.47,878.115,"-- and then tell us the factual differences, why they matter."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,878.115,895.94,"Starting with the -- the legal, on page 4A of the Petition Appendix, that's where Judge Batchelder reaffirms the Sixth Circuit decision in Pilla, P-i-l-l-a, which says: If a defendant is facing overwhelming evidence of guilt, then it's not rational for them to do anything other than to take the best --"
2016.16-327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,895.94,902.015,I thought she said only if the only hope for him is jury nullification.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,902.015,910.51,"Well, she went on about jury nullification, but the test in Pilla that she followed, because it was Sixth Circuit precedent, was you only consider overwhelming evidence --"
2016.16-327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,910.51,910.72,All right.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,910.72,910.89,-- in that --
2016.16-327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,910.89,914.57,So what we -- what you want us to do is to add to what she said.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,922.945,923.77,That's not really --
2016.16-327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,923.77,924.3,No hope for you.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,925.15,926.31,That's -- that's not the point that we're making.
2016.16-327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,926.31,926.76,What is the --
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,926.76,932.615,"The point is you should never focus just on one piece of the circumstances, the likelihood of success at trial."
2016.16-327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,935.765,936.91,Let's consider them all.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,936.91,937.15,And -- and --
2016.16-327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,937.15,942.13,And suppose one of them is there's no hope of success at trial except jury nullification.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,942.13,942.22,Right.
2016.16-327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,943.61,943.71,Right.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,943.71,945.53,-- which are kind of legal and factual.
2016.16-327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,951.46,951.74,Uh-huh.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,951.74,961.085,-- may still choose to invoke their right to trial rather than take certain mandatory banishment from the United States for the benefit of only a 9- to 11-month reduction in their sentencing range.
2016.16-327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,989.83,990.02,All Right.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1001.3,1001.9,We --
2016.16-327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1001.9,1011.18,"We jointly will tell them, the judge, that not -- what would have happened if he'd gotten good advice, is the government would have figured something out to help him."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1019.05,1026.29,"My -- my understanding is that that hasn't happened, that the government took the position that because there was no likelihood of success at trial, game over."
2016.16-327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1033.2,1042.88,But your -- your -- but your -- your rational defendant rule that you suggest sounds almost like a jury question.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1062.96,1070.61,"Well, Justice Kennedy, the -- the reasonable probability and rational bases tests are -- are not our tests; they're your tests in Hill and Padilla."
2016.16-327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1073.26,1073.53,But -- but --
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1073.53,1073.84,-- for many years.
2016.16-327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1073.84,1094.77,"But -- but as Justice Ginsburg pointed out, we have in -- in those contexts, we -- we have -- we have a trial, and -- and Padilla -- Padilla, I understand is different, but -- but it seems to me that your -- you have so many subjective factors that you endanger the system by having second -- second -- second thoughts, people who want the second bite of the apple."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1094.77,1106.37,"But like in any Strickland case, when you consider all the circumstances, you have individualized facts, not subjective facts, but individualized facts that must then be looked at objectively. And -- and let's think about Hill and what happened there."
2016.16-327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1138.52,1145.41,"No -- but I think several times in your brief and here today, you talk about -- you say well, who knows what will happen at trial."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1150.815,1151.35,"Well, but --"
2016.16-327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1151.35,1155.46,"I mean, who knows what will happen? Maybe the jury won't convict because they get -- get it wrong."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1167.815,1176.895,"No -- no, Mr. Chief Justice, I want to draw a bright line, again, between posttrial claims of ineffective assistance and plea-stage ineffective assistance."
2016.16-327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1190.98,1191.09,Right.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1191.09,1191.57,-- and the defendant --
2016.16-327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1191.57,1196.805,But you don't know what would have happened if the attorney had not been incompetent.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1196.805,1197.06,But --
2016.16-327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1197.06,1204.14,"You don't know what would have happened if the attorney hadn't, you know, not called the witness or not presented this evidence, who knows what would have happened."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1204.14,1206.02,But -- but you have this large data set.
2016.16-327,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1218.54,1227.635,"I would have thought that the -- that -- that the difference is more fundamental, which is that usually in Strickland, we are asking what was going to happen at trial."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1227.635,1227.84,Yes.
2016.16-327,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1227.84,1232.045,"And we don't think, well, there was this 1 percent chance that the witness would drop dead."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1233.59,1234.03,Correct.
2016.16-327,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1234.03,1235.47,"But here, the inquiry is different."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1240.08,1240.66,Exactly.
2016.16-327,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1240.66,1259.57,"And the plea proceeding might be very affected by somebody saying, you know, given my ties to this country, given my negative ties to any other country, given the fact that this is only a nine-month difference in prison term, I'm going to roll the dice for that 1 percent chance."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1259.57,1260.07,Exactly.
2016.16-327,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1260.07,1263.82,"And that would be a completely reasonable thing to do, a thing that many people would do."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1263.82,1264.46,Absolutely.
2016.16-327,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1266.835,1273.58,"But the key is that the outcome of the proceeding here is not the outcome of the trial, as it usually is in a Strickland case."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1277.555,1278.08,Exactly.
2016.16-327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1280.41,1281.17,All of that --
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1281.17,1282.98,-- that process -- the due process.
2016.16-327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1282.98,1286.45,-- all of that is true on the facts of this case.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1299.95,1300.27,Yeah.
2016.16-327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1300.27,1303.515,He still has some relatives and friends in Korea.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1313.59,1316.99,"Well, that's the job of the district courts applying all the circumstances."
2016.16-327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1316.99,1317.16,Well --
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1317.16,1317.73,I hate to keep repeating that.
2016.16-327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1317.73,1321.035,"Well, what would you do as a district -- how would you evaluate that as a district court judge?"
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1321.035,1331.66,"Well, the -- the -- the first question I would do is I would ask the Hill test: Is there a reasonable probability that this defendant would not have pleaded guilty? And if I thought the answer to that question was no, then that's the end of the game."
2016.16-327,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1331.66,1332.94,"And that is the Hill test, right?"
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1332.94,1333.06,It is.
2016.16-327,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1333.06,1333.54,We've said that.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1333.54,1333.64,Right.
2016.16-327,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1334.53,1336.0,"I mean, this is not your test."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1336.0,1336.1,No.
2016.16-327,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1336.1,1340.205,This is a test that's staring at me on page 59 of volume 474.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1340.205,1340.9,That's right.
2016.16-327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1340.9,1341.68,"Well, that --"
2016.16-327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1341.68,1342.04,There's always --
2016.16-327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1342.04,1343.83,That's a purely subjective test.
2016.16-327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1343.83,1347.065,There's always -- there's always a set of degrees.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1368.2,1368.77,Correct.
2016.16-327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1371.07,1382.94,"So if -- if there -- if there's a defense that has a 1 percent chance, is that okay, versus one that has a 20 percent chance? Or how do you even measure how rational a potential defense may be --"
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1382.94,1383.41,"Well, the --"
2016.16-327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1383.41,1390.425,-- if the inquiry is how much do we know he would or would not have taken this plea?
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1390.425,1392.995,"We -- we think that is the Hill test, correct."
2016.16-327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1399.72,1400.27,There's no question --
2016.16-327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1400.27,1400.68,All right.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1425.62,1433.16,"Well, I -- I wouldn't say, because it's an objective test, not the mindset of the defendant, but the mindset of a defendant in this particular instance --"
2016.16-327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1433.16,1437.0,"Well, I -- I understand you -- you call your test an objective test."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1437.29,1437.42,Yes.
2016.16-327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1437.42,1445.03,I -- I understand that. But the question is whether or not it isn't so distinct from Strickland as to be unworkable.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1445.03,1447.83,I don't think it's so distinct as to be unworkable.
2016.16-327,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1453.41,1453.56,All right.
2016.16-327,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1453.8,1472.645,"Justice Kagan pointed out that the test that you're asking us to apply is the test that this Court says is applicable at the plea stage. Is there a reasonable probability, but for counsel's error, defendant would not have pleaded guilty, but would have insisted on his right to trial?"
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1472.645,1473.205,Correct.
2016.16-327,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1473.205,1479.76,"That's exactly what we said the standard is, and I think you're just asking us to -- to adhere to that standard."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1479.76,1485.03,"I'm asking you to -- to re-adhere to that standard, but also to reaffirm the Strickland totality of the circumstances --"
2016.16-327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1485.03,1485.19,All right.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1515.73,1516.26,Correct.
2016.16-327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1516.26,1529.94,"And so send it back with the knowledge that sometimes it could be rational for a person to want to go to trial, even not hoping necessarily for jury nullification."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1534.595,1534.9,Yeah.
2016.16-327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1535.56,1544.815,"And so judges go back to the district court, do it over again, knowing that overwhelming evidence is not always the end of the case."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1544.815,1545.05,Yeah.
2016.16-327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1545.7,1546.15,Is that right?
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1546.15,1547.2,"-- that's perfect, with one caveat."
2016.16-327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1547.2,1547.505,Yeah.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1547.505,1549.09,I would not send it back.
2016.16-327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1551.23,1551.96,We can't do that.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1552.74,1553.36,"Oh, yeah, absolutely --"
2016.16-327,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1553.36,1556.33,"I mean, the others, for myself, I don't see how we don't send it back."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1565.32,1569.35,"I -- I think given these extreme facts, you could conclude there's a reasonable probability he would have rejected it."
2016.16-327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1569.35,1572.01,I think the district court said here that this defendant would have gone to trial.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1572.01,1572.54,Absolutely.
2016.16-327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1572.84,1576.09,And what they said was the absolute rule of this circuit is --
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1576.09,1576.3,Correct.
2016.16-327,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1576.3,1585.765,"-- what led this district court judge to say I believe this person would have gone to trial, but this rule doesn't permit me to rule in his favor."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1585.765,1586.91,"That's exactly right, Justice Sotomayor."
2016.16-327,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1586.91,1606.72,"What happens if there's overwhelming evidence that this defendant, that the defendant in the case would have gone to trial if the defendant knew about the deportation consequences, overwhelming subjective evidence, statements before the plea was entered, but also, virtually no chance of acquittal had the defendant gone to trial."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1607.575,1613.18,I think the defendant still gets to assert his constitutional right to trial and can't be deprived of that by ineffective lawyering.
2016.16-327,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1613.18,1615.22,Is there a possibility --
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1615.22,1616.63,"If there are no further questions, I'll --"
2016.16-327,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1616.63,1619.47,"I mean, this is a possession-with-intent-to-distribute."
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1629.89,1630.56,Yes.
2016.16-327,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1630.56,1639.165,And if the -- the defense -- the offense of possession does not carry adverse deportation consequences.
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1654.875,1662.705,"Well, the -- the charges to bring are in the discretion of the prosecutor, and that goes not only to what charges are given to the jury, but also what pleas are possible."
2016.16-327,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1663.09,1669.665,"So if the prosecutor doesn't want to do possession, the -- the trial court can't do it?"
2016.16-327,0,29018,john_j_bursch,,1669.665,1682.56,"The -- the trial can't -- can't force it, but all the -- the guides at the Federal and State level encourage the government to consider deportation consequences, and here the government thought there would be no deportation consequences. I reserve the balance of my time."
2016.16-327,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1682.56,1692.485,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Feigin."
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1692.485,1718.48,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The crux of a Padilla claim is the defendant's contention that if he had constitutionally competent counsel, that counsel could have given him a legitimate chance at avoiding a removal with particular -- avoiding a conviction with particular removal consequences. A defendant can't prevail on that kind of claim if there's nothing constitutionally competent counsel could have done to create that chance."
2016.16-327,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1735.04,1735.195,But you --
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1735.195,1735.81,-- or the like.
2016.16-327,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1735.81,1749.1,"-- you'll agree that there are many possibilities where it would nonetheless be rational for him to choose -- where -- where it would make sense for him to want a longer prison sentence, right? Let's say that there -- he has a serious medical condition."
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1765.21,1766.92,"Well, two points on that, Your Honor."
2016.16-327,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1809.885,1815.8,"Under Strickland, in the typical Strickland case where you're talking about the outcome of a trial, I understand that."
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1824.505,1832.63,"So, Your Honor, I'm not aware of this Court ever accepting a claim that the defendant's counsel was deficient because he didn't get more prison time."
2016.16-327,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1834.53,1834.66,Yeah.
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1861.235,1864.96,I'm not sure what level security is at that facility.
2016.16-327,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1870.115,1879.29,"Well, what is -- what is life like at a minimum security federal prison? I mean, the judge here recommended a particular facility close to Tennessee."
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1884.995,1885.98,"Well, Your Honor, I think --"
2016.16-327,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1885.98,1887.575,"There's visitation, right?"
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1887.575,1918.28,"I think the premise that someone is entitled to counsel who will keep him incarcerated in the United States is not only contrary to anything the courts recognize under Strickland, but also contrary to our criminal immigration laws where incarceration in the United States is the penalty for reentry. I also the -- say -- would want to make clear that there's nothing in the record to suggest that this particular Petitioner, had he known that removal was inevitable for conviction, would nevertheless have opted for a conviction that would give him a longer prison sentence."
2016.16-327,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1918.28,1918.59,"Well, that might --"
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1918.59,1919.4,What we were discussing is the rest --
2016.16-327,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1919.4,1924.285,What about murder? Suppose he thinks he's going to be murdered if he's sent abroad. Same problem.
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1924.285,1924.93,Well --
2016.16-327,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1924.93,1929.19,"But, I mean, I -- the problem is that he -- which you can read Judge Batchelder's opinion."
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1954.78,1961.58,"Well, Your Honor, there's a real disconnect between the claim the Petitioner is bringing and the relief that he's seeking."
2016.16-327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1974.06,1974.22,You see --
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,1974.22,1974.69,-- of dealing drugs --
2016.16-327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1974.69,1976.25,-- that's confusing two things.
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2036.81,2042.78,"That's because, Justice Kagan, I -- I don't actually think that's purely the inquiry we're supposed to be making here."
2016.16-327,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2048.275,2049.27,I'm sorry --
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2049.27,2049.58,-- early in the --
2016.16-327,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2049.58,2050.0,I'm sorry --
2016.16-327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2050.0,2052.2,"This is what -- this is what Hill says, Mr. Feigin."
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2067.08,2068.995,"Well, let me say a few things about that."
2016.16-327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2080.7,2102.94,"So to the contrary, when Hill keeps on going, it says, you know, this -- this defendant didn't care about his parole eligibility, so we shouldn't -- we shouldn't look at the fact that the -- the parole eligibility was a bad deal for him because he didn't care. So the emphasis clearly in Hill is -- is what are the things that would have made a difference --"
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2102.94,2103.52,Well --
2016.16-327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2103.52,2105.145,-- in the plea negotiation?
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2105.145,2111.83,"Your Honor, the particular defendant in Hill didn't even get to the objective part of the inquiry we're discussing today because he failed at the outset."
2016.16-327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2130.9,2142.1,"What Padilla is saying, isn't it, Mr. Feigin, is essentially, look, this is not going to be a case where somebody can just get up and say this is what I would have done and the court has to accept it. No, Padilla says."
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2164.21,2171.58,"Well, with respect, Justice Kagan, I think, as the discussion when my friend was up here demonstrated, I don't think a court can reasonably do that."
2016.16-327,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2226.72,2230.68,What's the windfall? You're entitled to a constitutional trial.
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2283.35,2288.79,"Well, Your Honor, while Dominguez Benitez draws some analogies to Strickland, it's a slightly different test."
2016.16-327,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2288.79,2289.6,It's not an analogy.
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2292.735,2306.495,"I think the Court made clear in Gonzalez-Lopez that the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel actually includes the prejudice itself, which isn't true of the Rule 11 right that was issued in Dominguez Benitez."
2016.16-327,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2316.07,2320.255,So here we have a defense attorney who says: I didn't know the law.
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2327.365,2328.09,Well --
2016.16-327,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2328.09,2333.34,So this is both prejudice in the advice and prejudice in the decision to go -- move forward.
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2333.34,2335.41,"Well, I think you have to also --"
2016.16-327,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2335.41,2335.97,Or not move forward.
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2335.97,2338.75,I think you have to also look whether there was prejudice in the outcome.
2016.16-327,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2394.05,2395.6,So step back a second.
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2434.31,2435.12,"Well, Your Honor --"
2016.16-327,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2435.12,2437.7,And -- and -- and you -- you see how I'm thinking that?
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2437.7,2437.86,Well --
2016.16-327,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2437.86,2442.28,"Because there's a kind of just look to the plea, just look to the plea."
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2500.87,2517.69,"Your Honor, I don't think that's a good reason for under -- for unwinding reliable admissions of guilt when we have a kind of outlier case like this one where the lower courts were certain that he would have been convicted at trial unless jury nullification or some other happenstance occurred."
2016.16-327,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2517.69,2522.87,What is the answer to the lesser-included offense? Was that -- is that out of the picture?
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2522.87,2528.635,"That is also out of the picture, Your Honor. So if I could just briefly recount the evidence here."
2016.16-327,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2540.68,2541.46,"Yeah, I know what the --"
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2541.46,2541.62,Okay.
2016.16-327,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2541.62,2569.71,"-- what the facts are. But isn't it sometimes a prosecutor might say, I have a solid case, the evidence is overwhelming, but this is a nice young man and the jury might be sympathetic, so rather than risk nullification, if you call it that, why not give the jury an opportunity to convict him on the lesser, so at least there will be a conviction?"
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2569.71,2586.7,"Well, Your Honor, there might be cases where a prosecutor might say that, but the question here is whether Petitioner has a constitutional entitlement through the lens of ineffective assistance of counsel to try to seek that kind of result."
2016.16-327,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2591.23,2591.51,Wait a minute.
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2591.51,2591.83,-- inclined to --
2016.16-327,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2591.83,2595.165,He has a constitutional right to effective counsel.
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2595.165,2596.19,And I think that --
2016.16-327,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2596.19,2625.335,"And if he has that right, aren't we depriving him of that right and the right to a trial, both of them guaranteed by the Constitution -- as I keep saying, a plea is not -- to have his attorney try everything that is legally permissible to try? None of these attempts -- and your adversary went on for pages of the variety of different ways for him to have achieved a nondeportation plea as a possibility."
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2627.96,2635.89,"No, Your Honor, not where there's no evidence that there's any -- there was any possibility of a better plea."
2016.16-327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2640.28,2642.34,You don't mean that --
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2642.34,2642.82,-- deals that --
2016.16-327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2642.82,2643.51,-- Mr. Feigin.
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2643.82,2643.97,Huh?
2016.16-327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2643.97,2644.72,You don't mean that.
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2649.8,2651.98,"Oh, Your Honor, I was answering the question about the plea."
2016.16-327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2653.21,2653.45,Of course --
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2653.45,2654.56,-- the question about the trial.
2016.16-327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2654.56,2657.265,"-- there's a constitutional right to go to trial, isn't there?"
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2657.265,2658.48,"There is, Your Honor, but --"
2016.16-327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2658.48,2661.28,Even if there's -- even if there's very weak evidence on your side.
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2661.28,2664.82,"There is, Your Honor, but I think we protect that ex ante much more than --"
2016.16-327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2664.82,2664.99,Well --
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2664.99,2666.51,"-- post, and let me explain why."
2016.16-327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2666.51,2667.18,"Well, let me just --"
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2667.18,2667.35,Okay.
2016.16-327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2667.35,2672.21,"-- finish the question. I mean, you would agree that there's a constitutional right to go to trial, regardless of what the --"
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2672.21,2673.39,"I think I'd have to, Justice Kagan, yes."
2016.16-327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2673.39,2675.67,-- regardless of what the state of the evidence was; right?
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2675.67,2676.45,That's absolutely correct.
2016.16-327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2676.45,2678.44,Which is the question that Justice Sotomayor asked you.
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2701.17,2718.08,"So, Your Honor, I think there's several reasons why we would -- we value the right to go to trial ex ante and not necessarily in the Strickland context, whereas I've suggested I think it's much more outcome-focused. The first is that the touchstone of Strickland is fundamental fairness."
2016.16-327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2730.32,2733.64,Strickland is a very different case in that -- in that way.
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2771.335,2779.7,"Well, Your Honor, we protect the right to go to trial ex ante very closely and allow a defendant to select that result, even when it's foolish."
2016.16-327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2802.31,2818.345,"Well, all you're asking the judge to do is to say that in certain circumstances, it is not beyond the bounds of reasonableness to throw the dice in order to get an outcome -- in order to get -- in order not to be deported from a country where you've lived your whole life."
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2818.345,2823.87,"Well, Your Honor, I don't think the bounds of reasonableness rationality test is a particularly workable standard."
2016.16-327,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2827.98,2832.61,"Mr. Feigin, you know, we're talking about cases like this, the circuits are split."
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2843.185,2845.13,"I don't, Your Honor, but I also --"
2016.16-327,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2845.13,2845.56,There's not a whole --
2016.16-327,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2845.56,2848.315,"I -- I mean, there's not a whole lot of them."
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2848.315,2849.04,"Your Honor, I --"
2016.16-327,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2849.04,2850.41,There's a handful of them.
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2864.64,2880.57,"Well, Your Honor, I can't give you a precise number, but if you search for cases in the Federal and State courts in which, you know, Padilla is cited more than five times, you get about 1500 results. And I think that shows these claims are being brought fairly frequently. And under Petitioner's rule, I don't think --"
2016.16-327,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2880.57,2881.81,How many of them are being granted?
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2881.81,2888.53,"Your Honor, I -- I couldn't give you an answer to that, but I think under Petitioner's rule, many more of them will -- will be granted."
2016.16-327,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2888.53,2889.47,Because defendant --
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2889.47,2891.28,"It means that any time -- I'm sorry, Justice Alito."
2016.16-327,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2891.28,2892.69,"No, I -- finish your sentence."
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2893.135,2906.67,"It means that any time a defendant can subjectively state that he would have gone to trial and the trial judge finds it credible, which I think you could under pretty much any set of circumstances, the Chief Justice pointed out -- I'm sorry, the sentence is getting a little run on, Justice Alito."
2016.16-327,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2906.67,2908.455,"No, no, that's fine."
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2908.455,2927.01,"Then the -- then that defendant will be entitled to relief and will have a new trial, even though that defendant, when he actually faced the choice as to whether he should enter the plea and was balancing that against a trial, didn't have any legitimate chance of prevailing at a trial."
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2927.01,2929.19,His chances were jury nullification --
2016.16-327,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2929.19,2937.765,I -- I understand the argument that the test should be purely subjective. What would this defendant have done? There's language in Hill that supports that.
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2966.86,2972.24,"Well, Your Honor, I think you -- are you proposing a test where you just find the fact --"
2016.16-327,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2972.24,2978.79,"No, I'm not proposing that test, but I'm -- I'm suggesting that that is the consequence of our saying that the test is purely subjective."
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2995.205,2996.49,You mean in this case?
2016.16-327,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2996.49,2998.02,In this case or in any case.
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,2998.02,3002.96,I think you could ask judges to make those sorts of -- of factual findings.
2016.16-327,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3028.46,3037.2,"Mr. Feigin -- Mr. Feigin, routinely papers come in from a Petitioner who says, my lawyer didn't do X."
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3061.18,3061.775,Well --
2016.16-327,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3061.775,3074.26,"It wouldn't change the cases where the defendant comes in and says I would have pled guilty, but the lawyer comes in and says he insisted he was innocent."
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3101.5,3128.38,"So, Your Honor, what we're talking about here is a set of cases where, as the lower courts founds here, the only chance the defendant had at trial was jury nullification or, frankly, some stroke of luck that would collapse the government's case somehow. And in that set of cases, it does not make sense to grant a defendant windfall relief that gives him an opportunity he could never have reasonably expected at the outset. I think the --"
2016.16-327,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3128.38,3144.57,"Well, I still go back to -- to my earlier point, which is the difference between nine years and five and ten years is very big. For nine months and sure banishment? What's so irrational about going to trial?"
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3144.57,3172.1,"Well, Your Honor, as I suggested earlier in my colloquy with the Chief Justice, I think rationality here has its traditional legal meaning, meaning looking at it through an objectively reasonable len -- a lens of objective reasonableness. And I think that makes great sense here because if that were not the case, then I think Padilla's promise that the ruling would not really be opening Pandora's box, but would instead be cabined by the requirement --"
2016.16-327,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3172.1,3185.58,So what do we do -- what do we do with all those defendants who reject pleas with full knowledge and say a rational person must have wanted -- should have taken this case.
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3197.175,3200.46,"Your Honor, we're not saying there's only a rationality test here."
2016.16-327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3226.24,3255.535,"But, Mr. Feigin, again the -- just in your words, objective reasonableness, why can't a judge find as to a defendant that it is objectively reasonable to give up six or eight or nine months for a shot at staying in this country rather than being deported to a place that you don't know and where you have no ties? I mean, you know, if somebody gave me that choice, sign me up. So I think of myself as an objectively reasonable human being."
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3255.535,3270.46,"Well, Your Honor, I think what objective reasonableness means here -- again, I come back to the way the Court uses the term rational that's used in Padilla and the way it uses it to describe, for example, a rational jury, is the application of the law to the facts and what outcome we would have reached there."
2016.16-327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3271.02,3283.245,"It's an objectively reasonable assessment, it's an -- it -- it would be an objectively reasonable choice to exercise my right to a jury trial in that context."
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3293.09,3308.79,"So, Your Honor, if you look at the inquiry that way, I don't think it's acting as any sort of meaningful check at all, because you could always make the argument that, yeah, I would have risked two more years, yes, I would have risked five more years, and I don't know how a court can come in and say, you know what, that's not objectively reasonable."
2016.16-327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3308.79,3315.105,"Well, the court can do it in the way that the Court has done it since 1985 when we said that this was the inquiry under Hill."
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3319.73,3325.35,"Well, Your Honor, I think the circuit conflict that we have here shows that that's not what all courts have been doing."
2016.16-327,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3325.62,3327.55,It's what many courts have been doing for three decades.
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3327.55,3331.85,I'm not saying -- I'm not saying that a court can't try to do that.
2016.16-327,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3359.66,3361.94,This -- this is a little -- little bit different question --
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3361.94,3362.03,Yeah.
2016.16-327,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3362.03,3368.03,-- but assume a petitioner prevails and there can be no trial because the evidence is stale or something.
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3378.42,3384.78,"Right now, there is a final order of removal, but that final order of removal is based on his conviction for aggravated felony."
2016.16-327,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3384.78,3387.74,"My question is, can you do it without the -- without the conviction?"
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3387.74,3391.82,"Without the conviction for an aggravated felony, there would be no basis for the removal."
2016.16-327,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3393.97,3395.51,There has to be a conviction --
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3395.51,3398.37,"It -- to -- to make sure I'm giving you a complete answer, Justice Kennedy --"
2016.16-327,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3398.37,3398.46,Sure.
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3398.46,3410.435,-- he would need to seek some sort of immigration relief from the immigration courts in order to -- in order to not be removed from the United States.
2016.16-327,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3410.435,3416.68,"Well, he would get that, right, if the basis for the removal order was a conviction that's been overturned?"
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3416.68,3419.79,He should be able -- he should be able to seek reopening.
2016.16-327,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3428.51,3437.985,"Could the government still make the -- the case that even though the conviction has been set aside, it has adequate proof and it wants to present proof of the violation in the -- in the deportation hearings?"
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3437.985,3444.62,I don't believe it would do that just because it has evidence that wouldn't be sufficient to convict.
2016.16-327,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3452.415,3458.355,Do prosecutors ever advise the court in open court that this is a deportable offense?
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3458.355,3460.37,I don't know whether they do that.
2016.16-327,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3465.36,3466.18,I know the court asked.
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3466.18,3468.37,The court is required to ask and -- and to advise.
2016.16-327,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3468.37,3477.71,Does counsel -- does -- does the prosecution ever comment in response to that question? It's a colloquy between the defendant and -- and -- and does the counsel ever --
2016.16-327,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3477.71,3479.8,-- prosecutor ever interrupt or intervene?
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3479.8,3485.81,I think it's unlikely that the prosecutor would interrupt a colloquy between the court and the defendant in a Rule 11 context.
2016.16-327,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3485.81,3486.08,Right.
2016.16-327,1,22289,eric_j_feigin,,3486.08,3492.025,"I think prosecutors, of course, have their ethical duties, and if they see some mistake is being made, I'm sure they would speak up."
2016.16-327,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3496.905,3500.12,"Thank you, counsel. Two minutes, Mr. Bursch."
2016.16-327,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3500.12,3508.98,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Two quick things. First, I don't want to lose the point that Justice Sotomayor raised, that this isn't just keep this plea or go to trial."
2016.16-327,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3563.385,3564.29,This is what they say.
2016.16-327,2,29018,john_j_bursch,,3584.51,3586.66,She says that because that was the test.
2016.16-327,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3636.07,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. Case is submitted."
