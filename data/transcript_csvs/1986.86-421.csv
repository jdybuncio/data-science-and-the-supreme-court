1986.86-421,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.934,"We will hear arguments next in No. 86-421, Board of Directors of Rotary International against Rotary Club of Duarte."
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,71.003,73.518,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.86-421,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,282.421,285.045,"But it really doesn't involve the local clubs, does it?"
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,291.964,293.964,"That is... this particular club did, Your Honor."
1986.86-421,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,349.599,351.661,"No, no, no, it doesn't follow."
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,384.181,387.415,I think we have to decide what the Unruh Act applies to.
1986.86-421,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,464.4,473.367,"Why... now you say, jurisdiction over the International is only achieved through the local club?"
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,473.367,475.617,"--No, I'm not saying that precisely."
1986.86-421,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,537.531,541.483,"Yes, but you may be mixing up the statutory and the constitutional questions."
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,563.555,570.427,"I don't think that the International has a constitutional right of association, because the--"
1986.86-421,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,570.427,571.317,"Well, that's your point."
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,577.347,581.612,"--They're asserting this right on behalf of the individual members of Rotary, Your Honor, really."
1986.86-421,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,581.612,584.097,But not on behalf of the individual members of the Duarte Club.
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,584.097,586.097,"No, not on behalf of the individual members of the Duarte Club."
1986.86-421,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,589.158,598.108,Whose freedom of... whose constitutional right to associate together is it that you say protects the International's right to cancel this franchise?
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,598.108,601.373,--Individual Rotarians in individual local Rotary Clubs.
1986.86-421,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,601.373,602.388,"All, other than Duarte?"
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,602.388,603.888,Not all other than Duarte.
1986.86-421,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,650.278,663.802,"California's saying sort of the same thing, that Rotary International is entitled to affiliate only with organizations that don't admit women, but not in California."
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,663.802,665.77,"Well, that's--"
1986.86-421,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,665.77,667.708,"So that, you know, that's fair too."
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,667.708,669.284,--That isn't quite fair.
1986.86-421,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,764.328,769.234,"But Mr. Sutter, maybe that's correct as a matter of logic, but I'm not sure that's this case."
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,777.95,778.262,Yes.
1986.86-421,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,778.262,779.497,And you're arguing--
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,779.497,785.51,"They also held that Duarte did, or they also held that Duarte was subject to the Unruh Act and could not exclude women."
1986.86-421,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,785.51,788.588,"--Well, that may be, but that's dicta, because they're not excluding women."
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,806.317,814.846,I say that it does... that the right of the International turns on the nature of the California clubs.
1986.86-421,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,843.226,845.991,"Well, yes it does, because California has held it does."
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,853.316,854.129,It has held that.
1986.86-421,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,871.592,882.915,"xxx if International doesn't have any members of its own, it's hard to frame a constitutional argument on the right of association for the International, isn't it?"
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,882.915,904.437,"I'm attempting to frame an argument on behalf of the members of the local clubs, because what I say is that this decision inherently carries with it... it's not an express holding in this case... inherently carries with it the decision that no other California Rotary Club may properly exclude women."
1986.86-421,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,967.663,969.054,What's wrong with that?
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,969.054,970.85,What's wrong with that?
1986.86-421,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,970.85,971.475,Yes.
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,971.475,972.475,Nothing.
1986.86-421,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,974.24,977.365,"That would be all right with you, if all the clubs--"
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,977.365,978.537,"I think you have to look at the local clubs, and then find out--"
1986.86-421,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,978.537,982.004,"--if all the clubs of California have to admit women, that's all right with you."
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,982.004,982.614,--No.
1986.86-421,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,983.926,984.942,"Well, I was just wondering."
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,984.942,992.08,"No, my point is not whether all California clubs should admit women or should not, clearly."
1986.86-421,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1019.585,1026.13,"xxx this case, it was voluntary, wasn't it?"
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,1026.13,1027.755,This case was voluntary.
1986.86-421,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1027.755,1030.034,"Where do you get the ""must""?"
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,1030.034,1044.857,"The Roberts case, which is the case that everybody talks about as either being controlling on the law or controlling on the facts... we say it's controlling on our side because of the law; appellees say it's controlling because they think the facts are the same."
1986.86-421,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1117.067,1126.782,"Had they met those tests, we would then had to have proceeded to see whether the international organization or the interstate organization meets that test."
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,1157.209,1179.856,"--Well, Your Honor, every case that there is, that I'm aware of, pending or past, has involved this type of situation where an organization, a dissident group, a dissident member of the organization has concluded to admit women, and then the organization has attempted to enforce the compact."
1986.86-421,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1313.992,1315.617,But that was in construing the statute.
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,1315.617,1321.318,"Yes, but I think the same... the same result applies whether you're construing the statute or the Constitution."
1986.86-421,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1344.683,1345.589,That is a question of California law.
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,1361.381,1361.756,"--They didn't, actually."
1986.86-421,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1368.005,1380.844,"Likewise, if California wants to say that the furnishing of goods and services by a local club under its statute is sufficient to attribute the sale of goods and services to the international, once again, that's a question of California law."
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,1402.539,1403.57,I don't think they got there that way.
1986.86-421,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1437.17,1438.404,--And it is.
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,1440.42,1441.481,"And it is, as a matter of statutory law."
1986.86-421,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1444.449,1449.838,"But the only constitutional issue we have before us is that not that, but rather, the application to the International."
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,1465.004,1465.614,--That is correct.
1986.86-421,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1465.614,1467.753,And suppose you were right.
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,1476.392,1498.476,"My view is that if the local club cannot constitutionally be compelled to comply with the Unruh Act, then International cannot be compelled not to enforce its provision, which permits the local club to do just that very thing, or which requires the local club to do that very thing."
1986.86-421,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1498.476,1504.442,"Why do we get to that question in the case of the Duarte Club, which wanted to admit women?"
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,1510.659,1514.267,It was found to be subject to the Unruh Act.
1986.86-421,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1563.639,1572.401,Is there anything in this record to show that the reason the woman was admitted was because of the California law?
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,1572.401,1575.43,"No, Your Honor, there is nothing in the record to show that."
1986.86-421,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1575.43,1577.805,That's what you're saying.
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,1577.805,1581.413,"No, I don't believe that's what I'm saying."
1986.86-421,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1595.44,1601.797,xxx saying that this club could not be compelled to admit women.
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,1601.797,1606.531,"--Because of the great difference between Rotary Clubs and Jaycees organizations, yes."
1986.86-421,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1606.531,1611.249,So they could expel women or keep them out without violating the law?
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,1611.249,1612.139,That is correct.
1986.86-421,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1612.139,1615.451,And you say International could insist that they do just that?
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,1615.451,1620.934,"As long as that's lawful for them to do, International could insist that they do it without International's violating the law."
1986.86-421,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1631.587,1636.803,"So what's your argument, that the local club doesn't have to live up to California law?"
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,1636.803,1643.832,"Well, I submit that's based on a great number of facts which distinguish this case from the Jaycees case."
1986.86-421,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1716.773,1718.539,"""We"" being the individual clubs."
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,1718.539,1720.459,"--""We"" meaning the individual Rotary Club."
1986.86-421,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1740.156,1745.264,What do you interpret you have to do to comply with the court's order here?
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,1773.377,1782.374,I interpret the court's order here as saying we can't throw the Duarte club out; we have to give them their charter back.
1986.86-421,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1799.43,1807.725,"So you have to make them affiliate with your club in Iowa, assuming Iowa has no law like this, even though Iowa would have no problem about--"
1986.86-421,0,46208,william_p_sutter,,1807.725,1809.301,About having men-only clubs?
1986.86-421,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1873.572,1876.274,"Thank you, Mr. Sutter."
1986.86-421,1,32721,judith_resnik,,1878.446,1883.959,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1986.86-421,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1974.238,1979.628,xxx challenge then the right... their right to... your opponents' right to bring their case here by way of appeal.
1986.86-421,1,32721,judith_resnik,,1984.111,1993.452,"Well, we have challenged... as we believe they started out, this case was not appropriate for appeal, although by the time they worked it to this Court, there may be grounds for appeal."
1986.86-421,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2070.579,2089.447,"Are you suggesting that even if Duarte would not violate the California law if it excluded women, that when it does... when it does have women in it voluntarily, Rotary, as a vast international organization, may not exclude it?"
1986.86-421,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2089.447,2091.992,--I am agreeing with the thrust of some of the comments that the--
1986.86-421,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2091.992,2093.523,"Well, just answer my question."
1986.86-421,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2093.523,2094.351,--I'm sorry.
1986.86-421,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2099.819,2104.38,Even if the local could legally under California law exclude women?
1986.86-421,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2104.38,2107.52,Even if the local could legally exclude women.
1986.86-421,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2114.285,2115.394,Because of the Unruh Act?
1986.86-421,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2115.394,2117.251,"--Yes, the Court of Appeals--"
1986.86-421,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2117.251,2122.438,"And they thought that would be constitutional, also, the Unruh Act as applied to this club?"
1986.86-421,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2122.438,2142.413,"--The Court of Appeals found that both the International and the local, in dicta, was a businesslike organization; and therefore, under California's interpretation of its statute, that both of these organizations had sufficient businesslike attributes so as to be regulated by the State of California's antidiscrimination laws."
1986.86-421,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2190.396,2190.865,So you're saying--
1986.86-421,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2190.865,2192.552,"Sorry, talking too fast."
1986.86-421,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2192.552,2200.534,"--Let's assume for that for some reason or another, this particular local Duarte club was not subject to the Unruh."
1986.86-421,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2200.534,2202.909,I'm saying that I don't want to--
1986.86-421,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2202.909,2203.347,Let's assume it wasn't.
1986.86-421,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2203.347,2203.847,--Certainly.
1986.86-421,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2203.847,2204.689,Just assume it wasn't.
1986.86-421,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2217.388,2224.245,It certainly is violating the California laws and it's constitutional for California to enforce its law against them.
1986.86-421,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2229.665,2230.384,Ms. Resnik--
1986.86-421,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2230.384,2230.821,--Yes.
1986.86-421,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2230.821,2231.54,--let me ask you this.
1986.86-421,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2293.674,2312.932,"Well, not to echo too much your comments in the earlier portion of this argument, California can only enforce its law in California; and the choice is of course open to Rotary, should it choose to withdraw from the State of California, and thereby continue its all-male status, if that would be permitted in other states."
1986.86-421,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2320.82,2322.725,"Well, then, this order doesn't mean what it says."
1986.86-421,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2326.177,2331.457,"The order says that Rotary is forbidden from expelling this club, that's correct."
1986.86-421,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2351.465,2351.949,"Well, that's what they did."
1986.86-421,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2354.76,2358.148,"No, I would disagree."
1986.86-421,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2387.655,2388.936,Unless they choose to withdraw.
1986.86-421,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2388.936,2389.967,--Unless they choose to withdraw.
1986.86-421,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2389.967,2390.857,"And if they withdraw, they don't have to worry about it."
1986.86-421,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2390.857,2391.904,And it is... it is--
1986.86-421,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2391.904,2393.717,"I'm saying, are you sure that this doesn't prevent them from withdrawing?"
1986.86-421,1,32721,judith_resnik,,2393.717,2401.996,"--It is certainly my interpretation of the California Court of Appeals, that the California Court of Appeals did not say, we enjoin you from withdrawing from the State of California."
1986.86-421,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2875.635,2877.806,"Thank you, Ms. Resnik."
1986.86-421,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2879.914,2888.178,"Ms. Johnston, before you start, would you identify the Federal question that's presented by this case?"
1986.86-421,2,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2888.178,2901.455,"The only Federal question in this case is whether there is any provision in the United States Constitution that forbids California, acting in its sovereign power to protect the welfare of its people, from forbidding the type of sex discrimination--"
1986.86-421,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2901.455,2903.064,Was that question raised in the complaint?
1986.86-421,2,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2903.064,2912.107,"--The complaint was filed by Rotary Club of Duarte against Rotary International, alleging that Rotary International violated the Unruh Civil Rights Act."
1986.86-421,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2912.107,2915.7,But was there any allegation of a Federal right involved in the complaint?
1986.86-421,2,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2915.7,2916.528,"No, Your Honor."
1986.86-421,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2916.528,2921.339,Did the Court of Appeals of the State of California decide any Federal question?
1986.86-421,2,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2921.339,2928.336,Only to the extent that it found that the application of Unruh to Rotary International was not unconstitutional.
1986.86-421,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2928.336,2931.383,"The only Federal case it cited, if I remember correctly, was Roberts."
1986.86-421,2,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2937.646,2943.55,"No, it concluded quite the contrary that applying Unruh to Rotary International did not violate any constitutional rights."
1986.86-421,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2943.55,2945.503,But did it make any decision under the Federal Constitution?
1986.86-421,2,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2945.503,2948.627,Only that the application was not unconstitutional.
1986.86-421,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2948.627,2951.237,"Well, I don't want to interrupt your short argument."
1986.86-421,2,36075,marian_m_johnston,,2958.456,2963.814,I believe it did refer to the fact that there were no violations either of the rights of intimate association or expressive association.
1986.86-421,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3009.484,3022.198,"General Johnston, can you tell us how Rotary International can comply with this court order, if it wishes, in those states that do not feel the way California does, to continue as an all-male organization?"
1986.86-421,2,36075,marian_m_johnston,,3022.198,3029.415,--I would certainly agree with counsel for Duarte that the State of California has no intent to try and enforce its law outside the State of California.
1986.86-421,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3042.316,3043.97,"But you are affecting states other than California, then."
1986.86-421,2,36075,marian_m_johnston,,3066.836,3072.584,"--We are not preventing those clubs operating in other states, if that is not unlawful in those other states."
1986.86-421,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3074.569,3075.583,It's not just the clubs operating in the other states.
1986.86-421,2,36075,marian_m_johnston,,3090.953,3101.575,"--Well, in that sense, Your Honor, it's no different than saying that Rotary International doesn't discriminate on the basis of race, even though it's operating in communities where race discrimination may be permitted."
1986.86-421,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3102.247,3112.603,"You acknowledge, then, that as this... that... that this injunction prevents Rotary from doing that; that Rotary cannot get out of California and just say, we'll operate in the other 49 states?"
1986.86-421,2,36075,marian_m_johnston,,3112.603,3118.929,"--Oh, no, it could certainly leave California, if it is no longer a business establishment operating in California, then it wouldn't be subject to California's law."
1986.86-421,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3118.929,3119.429,How can it do that?
1986.86-421,2,36075,marian_m_johnston,,3128.847,3133.299,And I assume that Rotary would not want to leave California because of the number of members that it has.
1986.86-421,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3138.751,3139.547,How can it do that and comply with this injunction?
1986.86-421,2,36075,marian_m_johnston,,3139.547,3149.778,"I don't think this injunction provides anything further than, if it is in the business, doing business in California, that it has to do so in a nondiscriminatory manner."
1986.86-421,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3149.778,3154.698,And doing business in California consists of no more than having a local Rotary Club in California.
1986.86-421,2,36075,marian_m_johnston,,3160.197,3161.244,That's true.
1986.86-421,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3161.244,3176.019,"And wouldn't you say that... that under this injunction, or one that would undoubtedly be forthcoming, that Rotary International could not exclude women delegates who are members of local California Rotary Clubs?"
1986.86-421,2,36075,marian_m_johnston,,3176.019,3176.863,That's correct.
1986.86-421,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3176.863,3191.951,"So they would have to, at the international meeting, unless Rotary wanted to withdraw entirely from California, Rotary would have to admit the California lady delegates into their convention?"
1986.86-421,2,36075,marian_m_johnston,,3191.951,3196.903,They would certainly have to treat women Rotarians from California the same as they treat men Rotarians from California.
1986.86-421,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3198.856,3207.322,"Suppose... how can they withdraw from... can they withdraw from California if they just say, we will no longer have any California local Rotary Clubs?"
1986.86-421,2,36075,marian_m_johnston,,3207.806,3208.837,"They can do that, Your Honor."
1986.86-421,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3208.837,3210.259,And that would comply with this injunction?
1986.86-421,2,36075,marian_m_johnston,,3210.259,3217.273,"That would comply with the California law, because they would no longer be operating in California, so they wouldn't be violating California law."
1986.86-421,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3301.727,3316.971,"Suppose one of these clubs, some other club in California, refused to admit women, and a suit was brought, and it was held that the club had to admit women, under Unruh."
1986.86-421,2,36075,marian_m_johnston,,3316.971,3318.111,"Yes, Your Honor."
1986.86-421,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3318.111,3325.764,Is it possible that it could be held under Unruh that it didn't need to admit women?
1986.86-421,2,36075,marian_m_johnston,,3325.764,3327.077,Not under Unruh.
1986.86-421,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3345.509,3348.227,"But there isn't any Rotary... local Rotary Club that could be of that nature, I gather?"
1986.86-421,2,36075,marian_m_johnston,,3348.227,3353.802,"I don't believe so, if it were operating as Rotary International tells us that Rotary local clubs are supposed to operate."
1986.86-421,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3372.812,3386.136,"But therefore, are you saying at least it's theoretically possible... I suppose you would argue the contrary... that the International Rotary is a business organization covered by the statute even though the local might be constitutionally protected?"
1986.86-421,2,36075,marian_m_johnston,,3386.136,3392.103,It's certainly theoretically possible that there are Rotary... groups calling themselves Rotary that are constitutionally protected.
1986.86-421,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3392.103,3395.446,That are associations that could elect to restrict their membership.
1986.86-421,2,36075,marian_m_johnston,,3395.446,3398.259,And there clearly are many associations which are constitutionally protected.
1986.86-421,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3399.04,3401.553,Is it theoretically possible that all of them are like that?
1986.86-421,2,36075,marian_m_johnston,,3403.913,3404.663,--Theoretically possible--
1986.86-421,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3404.663,3408.269,"--that all of them are like that, and the law would still apply to the International, in your view."
1986.86-421,2,36075,marian_m_johnston,,3408.269,3409.753,"--That's correct, because Unruh requires--"
1986.86-421,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3409.753,3421.202,"Even if one of them... even if one of them... even if one of them, even though it didn't have to, admitted women voluntarily, and Rotary threw them out for it, Rotary as an organization nevertheless could not do that?"
1986.86-421,2,36075,marian_m_johnston,,3421.202,3428.684,"--Because it is depriving women of the opportunity to call themselves Rotarians, and denying them all the benefits that that engenders."
1986.86-421,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3468.935,3470.279,"Thank you, Ms. Johnston."
