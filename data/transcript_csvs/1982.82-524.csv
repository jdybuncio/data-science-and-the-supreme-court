1982.82-524,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,11.901,We'll hear arguments next in Baltimore Gas and Electric against the Natural Resources Defense Council.
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,82.405,88.325,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.82-524,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,291.18,295.568,Does the record show how many meteors there are that big they planned around?
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,295.568,302.065,"--Well, the record shows that such a meteorite hit could be expected on the average once every ten trillion years."
1982.82-524,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,302.065,307.033,So they do not have any record of the most recent one?
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,309.968,320.481,"An earthquake fault, the Commission estimated, would occur at a typical site every 25 billion years."
1982.82-524,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,636.933,652.411,"Mr. Strauss, my feeling about reading the briefs was that it was very much like two ships passing in the night, that apparently each party wanted to follow its own line of analysis and there wasn't too much interaction between them."
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,662.562,669.637,I think the Court of Appeals relied on NEPA for a requirement that is simply not found in NEPA.
1982.82-524,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,669.637,680.712,"Do you understand the Court of Appeals to have had any broader rationale, perhaps I should say more precise rationale, than just the generalized provisions of NEPA?"
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,680.712,684.21,"I don't, Justice Rehnquist."
1982.82-524,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,741.812,743.983,Did the Court of Appeals say that in so many words?
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,743.983,745.827,"No, it did not say that in so many words."
1982.82-524,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,753.558,756.431,Perhaps my questions would be better addressed to them.
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,775.847,776.018,Yes.
1982.82-524,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,776.018,785.56,"In your view, where will that disclosure be made in the environmental impact statements that may be made consistently with the rule?"
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,785.56,795.134,"The environmental impact statement at each licensing stage, at both the construction license and the operating license stage, incorporate--"
1982.82-524,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,795.134,796.805,Table S-3?
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,796.805,801.117,--Table S-3 and the references it incorporates which--
1982.82-524,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,801.117,809.691,"Well, does that mean that the disclosure we are talking about then, in future environmental impact statements is that which we can find in Table S-3?"
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,809.691,812.769,--In Table S-3 and the references it makes incorporating--
1982.82-524,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,812.769,820.905,Then isn't the legal question whether the incorporation by reference of all these other documents is an adequate compliance with the statute?
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,820.905,824.201,"--Well, that is a possible legal question."
1982.82-524,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,826.871,832.197,"I know, but don't we have to be satisfied on that in order to be sure that the statute has been complied with?"
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,832.197,849.956,"That could be a potential challenge raised to this rule or certainly to a subsequent environmental impact statement, but the standards for incorporation by reference in environmental impact statements are necessarily flexible."
1982.82-524,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,862.138,869.854,"Your opponent ends his brief by saying that all that has to be done is to attach a rather short summary that there are, in fact, some risks associated with this."
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,882.755,887.082,The rule does not require any summary to be attached.
1982.82-524,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,887.082,888.316,My question is does it forbid it.
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,894.063,894.766,That is right.
1982.82-524,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,894.766,911.213,"--but does it also forbid the EIS that is issued in connection with a particular license application from including a short summary saying well, the Table S-3 should be understood to reflect certain risks associated with the long-term storage of wastes?"
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,911.213,923.661,My understanding is that the EISs in individual cases are prepared in accordance with Commission regulations and there would now not be any specific regulation telling the staff to summarize--
1982.82-524,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,923.661,925.973,I understand there is nothing telling them to do it.
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,928.175,933.126,"--I do not know of anything specifically prohibiting them from doing it if they did it off their own bat, as it were."
1982.82-524,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,949.541,959.224,"Yes, but the thing is that what you have just said is a lot plainer to the ordinary layman than ever what one would get out of reading Table S-3 if he was not as well informed as you are."
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,959.224,960.864,"Well, I think that is right."
1982.82-524,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,965.269,966.738,And a lot of cross references.
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,966.738,978.264,"--Well, there were cross references in quotations, but I think that accompanying statement lays it out quite clearly, about as clearly as I have laid it out to the Court that there are uncertainties associated here."
1982.82-524,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,981.279,984.308,"I understand, but that is something you have to go to another document to find."
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,984.308,988.557,"That is right, but that, I think, there are two points to be made about that."
1982.82-524,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1000.599,1001.381,To this extent?
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1002.082,1002.988,"Well, they are flexible."
1982.82-524,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1021.887,1022.606,You do not even say that.
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1027.166,1033.539,"--Well, I doubt very much that anyone who is interested in this problem would not know what to do when he looked at that Table S-3."
1982.82-524,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1274.146,1296.605,"Is it your understanding, Mr. Strauss, that in these individual licensing proceedings it is a hearing in which people may be heard, I take it, in opposition to licensing, that one is permitted to argue that this established amount of uncertainty is a reason for not granting the license."
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1299.807,1308.897,"--Well, it would be... The values that are established in the table can be argued about."
1982.82-524,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1308.897,1323.236,"Yes, you cannot relitigate, so to speak, the values in the table, but you can argue that the established figures in the table show sufficient uncertainty that this particular plant ought not to be licensed."
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1323.236,1351.568,"Well, the values in the table reflect such uncertainties that exist usually by, as I said in the case of the gases, by saying we will assume everything is released simply by assuming the worst case and to that extent they already have taken into account the uncertainties, and you would be entitled to say, look, licensing this will cause the release of so many curies of such and such a gas and that will have damaging effects on health and--"
1982.82-524,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1351.568,1356.769,And that to me is a ground that I urge upon you for not granting the license.
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1356.769,1357.254,--That is right.
1982.82-524,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1358.988,1366.374,"Mr. Strauss, is that a fair portrayal of the portion of S-3 that relates to long-term storage of waste?"
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1387.725,1391.833,"Well, the values in the table are to be taken--"
1982.82-524,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1391.833,1396.332,And one of the values in the table is you shall not consider the risk of release from permanent storage.
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1396.332,1399.471,"--The working assumption, that is right, is that solid waste--"
1982.82-524,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1399.471,1403.686,So the answer to Justice Rehnquist's question is that argument would not be open in an individual proceeding.
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1403.686,1405.671,--You would not be able to argue.
1982.82-524,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1409.653,1410.028,Correct.
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1410.028,1410.763,--radioactivity in the environment.
1982.82-524,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1411.497,1418.618,"Your point is that you have made that ruling on a generic basis, and it is to be excluded from the individual proceeding."
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1418.618,1420.962,"--That is right, that ruling, that is right."
1982.82-524,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1420.962,1425.038,How about the wastes other than the solid wastes?
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1425.038,1425.616,"Oh, no."
1982.82-524,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1435.331,1444.14,So and one could still argue for the licensing board the worst case hypothesis that however unlikely it is to occur it is still a reason not to license?
1982.82-524,0,21501,david_a_strauss,,1444.14,1447.747,"Well, the worst case hypothesis is built right into the table."
1982.82-524,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1484.045,1490.136,Mr. Atkeson.
1982.82-524,1,42371,timothy_b_atkeson,,1490.136,1494.589,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1982.82-524,2,21501,david_a_strauss,,2815.992,2820.99,"Mr. Chief Justice, unless the Court has some questions, I have nothing further."
1982.82-524,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2820.99,2823.302,"Thank you, gentlemen."
