1997.97-581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.677,"We'll hear argument next in Number 97-581, Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole v. Scott."
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,17.942,19.594,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1997.97-581,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,62.221,68.346,"Now, let me ask you a question or two, if I may, General Fisher."
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,95.864,96.735,That's correct.
1997.97-581,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,96.735,103.629,"And presumably Pennsylvania can redraft its consent form to cover that, I suppose."
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,103.629,121.401,"Justice O'Connor, Pennsylvania supreme court interpreted the consent provision to mean that, in this case, that Scott agreed to reasonable searches within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and to be reasonable the Pennsylvania supreme court said that the search required reasonable suspicion."
1997.97-581,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,123.423,142.013,"Well, I... to get back to my question, I take it they just said that this form that was signed didn't cover the issue of reasonable suspicion, that all it covered was whether it could be without a warrant, and in the absence of a consent, then, they said reasonable suspicion is still required."
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,142.013,156.745,"--They said that the... their interpretation was that... their reading of the Fourth Amendment was that the... that Scott consented to a reasonable search, and that a reasonable search required reasonable suspicion."
1997.97-581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,157.515,165.521,I'm not sure you're right in saying that the Pennsylvania supreme court based its interpretation of the consent form on its reading of the Fourth Amendment.
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,169.563,178.191,"--Mr. Chief Justice, we argue very strongly that they did, in fact, interpret it based on their reading of the Fourth Amendment, and that is where we disagree."
1997.97-581,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,185.324,199.193,"Well, you... suppose this consent form were redrafted to make clear that the person paroled is consenting to a search without a warrant and to a search without any suspicion whatever."
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,207.25,218.947,"It's... we believe that the Pennsylvania courts would say, based on what they said in this case, that we could not have that kind of consent form, because we believe they have--"
1997.97-581,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,218.947,219.899,--the Fourth Amendment?
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,219.899,222.403,--Because the Fourth Amendment requires reasonable suspicion.
1997.97-581,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,222.403,231.039,"It just wasn't clear to me whether that's what they said, because they could have meant the consent form just didn't cover it."
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,231.039,235.754,"No, Justice O'Connor, we think they said very clearly that the Fourth Amendment requires reasonable suspicion."
1997.97-581,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,235.754,236.135,Where do they say that?
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,240.879,243.533,"Well, they said it--"
1997.97-581,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,243.533,244.051,It's not in this case.
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,244.532,260.524,"--They said it both in the Williams case, but in this case at the... in our petition for certiorari, which contains the opinion of the Pennsylvania supreme court at page 10a, about half-way down that page, the second paragraph."
1997.97-581,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,272.481,276.094,--Because the consent provision did not... did not purport to waive it.
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,277.226,284.661,"Going back to Williams, the Court then said in Williams that you had to have as a matter of Fourth Amendment rights reasonable suspicion."
1997.97-581,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,284.661,291.016,"--Williams really isn't all that clear, because Williams relied on the Arkansas Williams case, which is also ambiguous."
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,295.158,316.172,"Well, we argue, Justice Stevens, that the issue before this Court is whether or not the consent in this case, and whether or not the law of the Fourth Amendment gives parole boards and parole agents such as ours the right to conduct these searches without--"
1997.97-581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,316.172,317.473,There are two questions--
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,317.473,317.712,--Without suspicion.
1997.97-581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,317.712,320.055,"--There are two questions here really, are there not?"
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,329.191,331.232,"That's correct, Your Honor, and--"
1997.97-581,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,331.232,334.054,"--Now, what if we thought the exclusionary rule didn't apply?"
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,334.054,334.304,--Well--
1997.97-581,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,334.304,335.293,Didn't apply.
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,341.177,341.969,--Mr. Chief Justice--
1997.97-581,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,341.969,342.259,--if it doesn't apply?
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,342.259,345.461,"--and Justice O'Connor, I think that there are two separate questions here."
1997.97-581,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,421.702,434.38,One of our concerns with the exclusionary rule in the case of police investigations of crime is that the police have an interest in trying to get a conviction.
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,452.752,458.396,"We think the motives, and we think the role of parole agents is different than police officers."
1997.97-581,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,485.435,489.258,"But you don't think the police officer wants to put somebody in jail unless he thinks he's guilty, do you?"
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,489.258,503.079,"--Certainly he wouldn't, but still there's a different standard, and I believe that this Court has recognized that the principal role of a police officer is to enforce the law, to carry out the law, but the parole agent's job is significantly different from a police officer."
1997.97-581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,503.079,508.101,"Yes, but doesn't the parole agent have a slightly different motivation in this respect."
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,549.368,551.188,"Yes, Your Honor."
1997.97-581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,572.756,592.268,"Well, he wants to rehabilitate those who are not violating conditions, but I... it seems to me he has just as much motivation to recommit those who are violating conditions as the police officer does to arrest and see to the conviction of somebody who is violating a statute in the street."
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,592.268,601.264,"--But so, too, we think that the difference between a formal criminal trial and of revocation proceeding is important in looking at the question of the exclusionary rule."
1997.97-581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,617.046,624.95,"Which means that the significance of illegally seized evidence is more damning in the parole case than it is, perhaps, in the trial case."
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,624.95,626.66,--I don't--
1997.97-581,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,626.66,631.674,"Because as you say, there's no such presumption that the evidence has to overcome."
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,631.674,653.117,"--But the issue before the parole board at a revocation proceeding is whether or not in fact the parolee has conducted himself pursuant to the conditions upon which he was released, and I think the parole board has the right to know all of the reliable evidence which if, in fact, the exclusionary rule were applied would deny that--"
1997.97-581,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,653.117,666.067,"General Fisher, are other rules of evidence relaxed or foregone in a parole revocation hearing as compared with a criminal trial?"
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,683.56,688.833,"--Well, yes, Your Honor, the rules of evidence are relaxed in parole revocation proceedings."
1997.97-581,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,770.856,802.907,"In respect to that, could I ask you, the part that I found most difficult in respect to the question Justice O'Connor asked is on page 9a, in talking about the question of consent, the court cites a... an earlier case and says that there, I guess, if I'm reading it correctly, we concluded that the parolee's signing of a parole agreement giving the officer permission to conduct a warrantless search does not mean... and here they say two things."
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,842.063,870.441,"Justice Breyer, in the court's opinion in the Scott case, from which you read, we believe that a full reading of that opinion, and particularly their holding, makes it clear that they were interpreting what they believed to be a reasonable search, which was that a reasonable search required reasonable suspicion."
1997.97-581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,906.836,922.005,"So in your view if Pennsylvania corrections officials recast this consent and said, I consent to the search not only without a warrant but without reasonable suspicion, the supreme court of Pennsylvania would say, under the Fourth Amendment you can't do that?"
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,922.005,943.05,"That is correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and that is where we find the major disagreement, and we think that the suspicionless search which we believe is permissible under the Fourth Amendment dealing with parolees is very similar to the kinds of searches that this Court has approved before, in the past."
1997.97-581,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,953.205,967.383,"To be more precise, you think the suspicionless search would not violate the Fourth Amendment if the parolee has consented to it, and that if the Pennsylvania supreme court were free to adopt what it though the right reading of that consent form was, it would so interpret it?"
1997.97-581,0,20863,d_michael_fisher,,967.383,967.984,--That's correct.
1997.97-581,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,998.565,999.657,"Very well, General Fisher."
1997.97-581,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1001.149,1014.97,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-581,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1094.444,1109.063,"Yes, but is that realistic, because I don't know how much longer this individual is going to be put away as a result of the revocation here, but I assume that in most States a parole revocation can result in a very substantial incarceration."
1997.97-581,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1138.644,1145.627,"It is certainly... it has some of the same consequences of a criminal trial, namely that the individual is incarcerated."
1997.97-581,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1216.356,1220.069,I think what I had in the back of my mind was this argument.
1997.97-581,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1302.265,1312.709,"I think the two answers we would say to that are, first, individual cases may arise in which the primary or even the only use of the evidence acquired is for parole revocation proceedings."
1997.97-581,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1398.34,1400.901,"Mr. Stewart, can I ask you one question before your time is up?"
1997.97-581,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1409.5,1418.946,"--Our position is that if the consent form is construed to authorize searches without individualized suspicion, that that consent form is consistent with the Fourth Amendment."
1997.97-581,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1438.02,1438.39,So--
1997.97-581,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1438.39,1438.881,--but I think it also means--
1997.97-581,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1438.881,1447.657,"--you would take the view that if it's ambiguous, then, the Michigan v. Long principle applies, and we assume that they were at least pushed in their direction by the Federal Constitution?"
1997.97-581,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1447.657,1474.084,"--I... we assume for purposes of determining whether this Court has jurisdiction to reach the issue obviously, when the Court has two alternative grounds on which it could decide the case, the relative certainty that the Pennsylvania supreme court's resolution of exclusionary rule issue was based solely on Federal constitutional grounds might cause the Court as a prudential matter to decide that that's likely to be a cleaner and more final resolution of the case than deciding the case on the consent issue."
1997.97-581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1474.084,1476.785,What would we do if we disagreed with you on that question?
1997.97-581,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1476.785,1478.808,If you disagreed with us on the exclusionary rule?
1997.97-581,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1478.808,1479.038,Yes.
1997.97-581,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1479.038,1491.415,"If you disagreed with us on the exclusionary rule, then I suppose you would have to determine first whether you had jurisdiction to determine the propriety of the search and, second, if you had jurisdiction whether the search was valid."
1997.97-581,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1491.415,1494.219,You regard both of those questions to be constitutional questions?
1997.97-581,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1494.219,1499.954,"Well, the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule question is... it's a question of Federal law."
1997.97-581,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1583.91,1585.893,"Thank you, Mr. Stewart."
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1587.752,1591.686,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.97-581,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1646.485,1670.882,"In regard to your second point, Mr. Sosnov, we do have several cases that say if a State court in deciding a question before it is mistakenly of the view that its conclusion is required by the Fourth Amendment, then we will... we have jurisdiction to disabuse it of that if we don't think it's required by the Fourth Amendment."
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1670.882,1682.957,"--Correct, if the State felt compelled, and what I'm saying is that the evidence here is not that the State felt compelled, because the Pennsylvania supreme court referred only to a Pennsylvania supreme court decision."
1997.97-581,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1682.957,1687.071,"Yes, but it's true, the portion of the Pennsylvania supreme court in Williams, it's under the subhead Fourth Amendment."
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1687.071,1689.012,"Well, there's another portion of Williams--"
1997.97-581,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1689.012,1689.602,"And then... I know, later--"
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1689.602,1690.554,--There's another portion of Williams.
1997.97-581,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1690.554,1690.824,--And that's--
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1690.824,1691.455,The other portion of Williams--
1997.97-581,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1691.455,1698.409,"--And that's still ambiguous because it refers to an Arkansas case that it says it decided, and that's ambiguous, so the whole thing is pretty ambiguous."
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1698.409,1699.34,"--Well, there's two things about that."
1997.97-581,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1707.505,1713.4,"And that part of it says that in... lots of times our constitution gives greater protection than the Federal does, but not in this case."
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1713.4,1718.946,--And it cites no Federal constitutional law in making the independent constitutional analysis.
1997.97-581,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1725.348,1730.494,"Don't they say in the opinion, this very opinion, that they're not relying on the Pennsylvania constitution?"
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1730.494,1740.658,"--They're not relying on the Pennsylvania constitution in this very case, but in this very case, before they get to the Fourth Amendment issue they're making an independent construction of the State provision."
1997.97-581,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1800.649,1830.308,"But if you did interpret it... I mean, I'm not... I know that you think we shouldn't, but if you did reach the following question, is a random gun search consistent with the Fourth Amendment, I take it on the merits the question would be, if the Fourth Amendment permits random drug searches without consent of persons who have never been convicted of a crime, why doesn't it permit random gun searches with consent of persons who have been convicted?"
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1830.308,1831.26,If the--
1997.97-581,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1831.26,1834.231,I'm trying to focus directly on the constitutional question there.
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1834.231,1835.751,--Aside from consent.
1997.97-581,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1835.751,1836.342,No.
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1870.976,1871.647,I think there--
1997.97-581,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1871.647,1873.7,"Maybe you'll agree that that is constitutional, or maybe you won't."
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1873.7,1873.841,--I think it would--
1997.97-581,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1873.841,1874.141,I don't know.
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1874.141,1874.291,--A two-part answer.
1997.97-581,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1874.291,1874.531,Yes.
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1874.531,1880.676,"First of all, a random search of an individual's home would not be permissible under the constitutional normally."
1997.97-581,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1884.56,1892.995,"But they say no probable cause, no warrant, if it's random, done as a law enforcement measure, with consent by the parolee."
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1897.729,1906.454,"--The answer to that is that this Court should not find voluntary consent, because as this Court has interpreted the term before, it certainly should not abandon that interpretation."
1997.97-581,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1915.53,1920.623,"Are you saying, then, that a parolee can't consent to any of the terms of the parole?"
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1920.623,1921.454,--No.
1997.97-581,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1934.524,1939.316,"Well, suppose you have somebody like Michael Milliken, who is paroled after having some securities fraud."
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1944.479,1945.41,Of course.
1997.97-581,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1945.41,1946.942,That's certainly a violation of the First Amendment.
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1946.942,1954.837,"But it doesn't depend... the validity of parole conditions and probation conditions don't depend on the consent, or a fictional notion of consent of the probation of parolee."
1997.97-581,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1963.583,1975.681,"Well, then what you're saying is that the Pennsylvania parole authorities without calling this a consent form could simply say, here are the conditions under which you must be... which you will... your house will be searched."
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,1975.681,1984.526,"That's correct, but as long as they were constitutional they'd be upheld by this Court, but if Pennsylvania, as in this case, touched an unconstitutional search provision, it should be--"
1997.97-581,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1984.526,1988.099,"Mr. Sosnov, aren't you really talking about notice and not consent?"
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2005.701,2006.503,--That's correct.
1997.97-581,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2006.503,2007.294,"If you violate them, you go back."
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2037.196,2038.715,--That--
1997.97-581,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2038.715,2039.136,--that he was given.
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2039.136,2039.386,--Excuse me.
1997.97-581,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2058.359,2062.112,I still don't see your... understand your response to the Chief Justice's question.
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2074.282,2075.422,--And--
1997.97-581,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2075.422,2083.417,"I mean, and the one no more than the other is consonant with the application of the bill of rights to people who were not on parole."
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2083.417,2086.779,"--This Court would have to determine that each one, whether it was reasonable or not."
1997.97-581,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2096.806,2097.097,Right.
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2097.097,2100.791,That would be totally inconsistent with the reasoning of this Court's decision in Griffin.
1997.97-581,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2140.512,2156.834,"Why is that in the Chief Justice's hypothetical the consent is valid and in the case we have, assuming the consent form is very clear that you consent to searches that are absolutely random and without sufficient... what is the difference in the two cases?"
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2158.694,2161.846,Because in neither case does it depend on consent.
1997.97-581,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2174.825,2176.757,"Well, but suppose you have consent."
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2176.757,2178.767,--The consent would be involuntary.
1997.97-581,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2181.169,2196.969,"I don't see why it's any more involuntary than on a guilty plea situation, where someone says, okay, I'm going to agree... I'm guilty, and I will agree to a prison sentence of 3 years, very coercive."
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2212.523,2213.925,--I'm sorry.
1997.97-581,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2213.925,2225.222,"I want to know why somebody can't consent on parole and say, fine, I would like to be paroled and I will consent to these terms and conditions."
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2233.657,2239.381,"I think the answer, Justice O'Connor, is that there's nothing... this is nothing like the free bargaining process."
1997.97-581,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2280.029,2285.773,"Well, but the parolee can decline it and say, I'll serve my time and when I get out I am free."
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2285.773,2294.389,"If... the parolee has the ability to say no, and Schneckloth said everybody always has the ability to say no."
1997.97-581,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2334.496,2337.728,Is there any shortage of parole officers in Pennsylvania?
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2342.273,2343.993,I'm not aware that there's a--
1997.97-581,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2343.993,2345.485,I'm just wondering--
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2345.485,2345.896,--I can't address that.
1997.97-581,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2346.564,2365.527,"--what is in the back of my mind, which is, is whether it might be reasonable for a State to say we don't have that many parole officers, we'll let more people out of prison on parole, but they give up all their privacy in prison, and we want them to give up some of their privacy on parole, and the reason is that random checking can catch those who have guns or drugs."
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2380.777,2382.87,This Court has never accepted that argument.
1997.97-581,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2428.911,2440.579,You would think that a defendant could agree in a pre-trial plea bargain to accept parole with the condition of suspicionless search.
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2440.579,2443.08,--Possibly.
1997.97-581,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2443.08,2443.451,Release--
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2443.451,2444.489,That's a difficult question to be--
1997.97-581,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2444.489,2449.715,"--Release, but I agree, suspicionless searches pretrial--"
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2449.715,2450.526,--That--
1997.97-581,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2450.526,2451.695,--Do you think there's a question about that?
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2451.695,2454.887,--That... there is a question there.
1997.97-581,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2454.887,2455.218,Why?
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2455.218,2456.379,But it's completely different.
1997.97-581,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2456.379,2456.788,"Well, why?"
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2457.81,2469.337,"Because... because this Court would have to determine whether, considering the invasion of privacy down the line, which is... which is all the people that are on parole as far as... and their families being subjected to unbridled discretion."
1997.97-581,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2477.812,2478.152,"Well, that's very... very odd."
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2484.076,2488.16,"--The key difference... the key difference there, and maybe that is constitutional."
1997.97-581,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2546.49,2547.582,"Well, don't they do that... don't they do that now?"
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2553.245,2553.555,--But--
1997.97-581,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2553.555,2554.307,"--That's standard, isn't it?"
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2554.307,2557.379,"--But there's one restriction, and that's the Fifth Amendment."
1997.97-581,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2566.155,2577.383,"You mean, he can come in and when his parole officer says, well, you know, what have you been doing the last couple of weeks, he can say, well, you know, I'd like to tell you that, but I have a Fifth Amendment right not to tell you?"
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2577.383,2577.604,No.
1997.97-581,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2578.062,2578.262,That's pretty easy.
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2580.595,2581.596,"No, that's not what it means."
1997.97-581,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2588.101,2590.124,"Well, you mean you can say he could--"
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2590.124,2590.324,--or new criminal activity.
1997.97-581,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2590.324,2590.665,--incriminate him.
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2602.125,2604.979,I... I'm relying on Minnesota v. Murphy.
1997.97-581,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2640.612,2650.247,"Mr. Sosnov, may I ask if you would get to the second question, because as I understand it all of this is academic if the exclusionary rule doesn't apply."
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2670.781,2677.537,"The majority of States have ruled, and this Court should rule that the exclusionary rule applies, because it's especially needed in this context."
1997.97-581,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2723.597,2729.171,"Why was the respondent arrested, for what suspected offense?"
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2729.171,2734.394,--He was arrested for... I think it was four violations.
1997.97-581,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2755.918,2761.242,"Okay, so the arrest was not dependent upon the subsequent search?"
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2761.242,2762.944,No.
1997.97-581,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2765.868,2768.119,Why didn't they have suspicion here?
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2768.119,2792.637,"Because the two incidents that I referred to were 5 or 6 months earlier, and the only information conveyed to the searching officer, at page 92a of the appendix, is that one officer said to the other, he may have firearms, and that's all that was communicated, nothing else about a basis for a search, and Pennsylvania has never claimed that there's reasonable suspicion in this case in the lower courts or here."
1997.97-581,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2906.671,2912.478,So a good parole officer has more people reincarcerated than on release.
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2918.171,2919.321,"No, I didn't say good or better."
1997.97-581,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2922.913,2927.395,"Well, I... institutional pressure I assume relates to performance and to merit."
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2927.395,2946.688,"--But performance and merit should be constrained by the Fourth Amendment, so I wouldn't call a good parole officer one who, because of institutional pressures and zeal at doing their job and protecting themselves from possible repercussions if somebody messes up on parole, I would say that's not a good parole officer who violates the Constitution."
1997.97-581,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2949.571,2970.034,"But if being a good parole officer, as Justice Kennedy's question... means keeping your people out on parole rather than reincarcerating them, one would think that the institutional, pressures are in the opposite direction, not to return as many of the people in your charge to prison as possible, but to work with them to keep them out."
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,2970.034,2981.892,"--Some work to keep them out, but the pressures to make sure that they're complying with parole regulations, we're talking about now the pressures as far as individuals who may go into somebody's home with no reasonable suspicion whatsoever."
1997.97-581,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3039.45,3046.483,Who would decide... supposing... what does the Pennsylvania parole board... they have a parole board and they have hearings on revocation.
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,3053.519,3055.85,"--The Fourth Amendment issue, if we had exclusionary rule?"
1997.97-581,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3055.85,3056.04,Yes.
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,3056.04,3060.743,In many juris... in Pennsylvania it would be a hearing examiner or the board itself.
1997.97-581,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3064.656,3068.058,And are the Pennsylvania examiners all lawyers?
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,3068.058,3074.192,"No, they're not all lawyers, but I think that that would not seriously burden the proceedings for... for two reasons."
1997.97-581,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3074.622,3075.684,Have them toss a coin?
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,3075.684,3077.957,--I hope not.
1997.97-581,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3077.957,3085.451,"Well, what is a nonlawyer going to do with some of our rather highly filigreed Fourth Amendment jurisprudence?"
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,3085.882,3098.199,"Well, I think fortunately in this context the hearing examiner would not have the learn the highly filigreed Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, because we would have a single standard, which is not a very high standard of reasonable suspicion."
1997.97-581,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3121.165,3127.019,"But that was the neutral magistrate to issue a warrant, or... it wasn't to ultimately decide the question."
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,3127.019,3131.293,"--Well, but the question had to be decided whether it was probably cause or not to issue a warrant."
1997.97-581,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3139.289,3148.676,"Yes, but that's... a neutral magistrate in that sense is not the same as the person who finally disposes of a case, of a question the way you would have under the exclusionary rule."
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,3156.39,3183.378,"I know that right now there are about eight States that are applying the exclusionary rule either on State constitutional grounds, where they've interpreted it under the Federal Constitution, and not all of them have judges deciding these issues, and there's been no evidence that they've been incapable of making this reasonable suspicion determination as to whether the Constitution has been complied with as far as reasonable suspicion being required for an entry into the home of a parolee and his family."
1997.97-581,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3235.121,3240.236,No worse than the situation that the individual would have confronted if he were still incarcerated.
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,3240.236,3241.976,"--That's correct, but this Court had--"
1997.97-581,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3241.976,3246.999,He would have been subject to invasions upon his privacy without any recourse.
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,3246.999,3247.83,--And--
1997.97-581,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3247.83,3250.371,And this is... this goes along with parole.
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,3250.371,3261.32,"--Well, it hasn't so far, because this Court has never held that a home can be searched on the basis without any reasonable suspicion whatsoever, I think for good reasons."
1997.97-581,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3280.584,3299.907,"Mr. Sosnov, you don't mean it happens so far in the sense of the real world, because you told me it was correct that most States in their parole revocation hearings do not exclude unlawfully seized evidence, so it's true that right now, that this happens all the time, is that not so?"
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,3299.907,3301.558,--That this is happening--
1997.97-581,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3301.558,3301.838,Yes.
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,3301.838,3309.351,"--in some jurisdictions as far as... now, as far as... and that's the... that's why we need deterrence, because these unconstitutional searches are happening."
1997.97-581,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3310.223,3312.376,"I think you've answered the question, Mr. Sosnov."
1997.97-581,2,35101,leonard_n_sosnov,,3314.155,3314.646,--Thank you.
1997.97-581,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3314.646,3315.325,--3 minutes remaining.
1997.97-581,3,20863,d_michael_fisher,,3315.325,3316.396,"No rebuttal, Your Honor."
1997.97-581,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3316.396,3317.017,Very well.
1997.97-581,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3317.017,3321.017,The honorable court is now adjourned until tomorrow at ten o'clock.
