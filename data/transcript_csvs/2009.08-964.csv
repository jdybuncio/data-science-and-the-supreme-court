2009.08-964,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.154,"We will hear argument this afternoon in Case 08-964, Bilski v. Kappos."
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,7.287,18.795,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Federal Circuit's rigid and narrow machine-or-transformation test for all patent-eligible methods should be reversed."
2009.08-964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,89.324,118.407,"Of course, the government says that the -- that the term on which it hangs its hat is the term ""useful arts"" and that that meant, originally, and still means manufacturing arts, arts dealing with workmen, with -- you know, inventors, like Lorenzo Jones, not -- not somebody who writes a book on how to win friends and influence people."
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,136.555,146.16,"--Certainly, ""useful arts"" encompasses industrial processes, manufacturing processes, but it has never been limited just to those types of processes."
2009.08-964,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,166.324,172.061,"Well, if you leave something out, Congress can put it back in, tailoring the protection to what they feel is necessary."
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,191.105,193.807,--Congress has acted in certain circumstances.
2009.08-964,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,214.305,221.209,"But just so you would say tax avoidance methods are covered, just as the process here is covered."
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,239.086,244.757,"They are eligible for patenting as processes, assuming they meet the other statutory requirements--"
2009.08-964,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,244.757,252.994,"So that would mean that every -- every businessman -- perhaps not every, but every successful businessman typically has something."
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,285.096,286.929,"--It is potentially patentable, yes."
2009.08-964,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,286.929,287.095,Okay.
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,315.246,317.096,"No, Your Honor."
2009.08-964,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,319.881,322.816,So how do we limit it to something that's reasonable?
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,346.281,353.868,"--Well, first of all, I think, looking at what are useful arts, it does exclude some things."
2009.08-964,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,368.544,371.496,So why are human activities covered by useful arts?
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,371.496,373.329,--Human activities are covered.
2009.08-964,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,373.329,377.048,"Well, you are saying they are covered, but why should they be?"
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,377.048,382.602,I believe the statute provides for them to be covered by defining them as a process.
2009.08-964,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,401.432,417.857,"Do you think that there is some benefit to society from patenting a method to cure someone that involves just human activity, as opposed to some machine, substance, or other apparatus to help that process?"
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,417.857,418.857,Yes.
2009.08-964,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,418.857,421.44,Do you believe that that was the intent of the patent law?
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,421.44,428.546,"I believe that falls within the useful arts, and I believe that there is an advantage to that."
2009.08-964,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,443.722,446.072,So you are going to answer this question yes.
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,463.517,464.25,Potentially.
2009.08-964,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,464.25,464.683,Okay.
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,483.778,493.3,"I think that we should go back to the first principles that were enunciated in Diehr and other cases, that abstract ideas per se are not patentable."
2009.08-964,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,498.771,503.223,"What -- I'm looking at your claim 1, in Joint Appendix page 19 to 20."
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,538.877,547.082,"--If that was a novel and unobvious method, then it should be patentable, but it's eligible as subject matter--"
2009.08-964,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,547.082,554.403,"Well, but your claim 1 it seems to me is classic commodity hedging that has been going on for centuries."
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,554.403,560.492,"--Your Honor, if that were true, then we should run afoul of the obviousness provision under section 103."
2009.08-964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,565.294,588.54,"But you know that the insurance industry -- the insurance business, as we know it, really began in England in 1680, when they discovered differential calculus, and they had expectancy and actuarial tables, actuarial for life expectancy for shipping, and this really created a whole new industry."
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,611.053,614.755,I think that method would be patent eligible.
2009.08-964,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,635.482,635.732,What -- I'm sorry.
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,645.088,645.671,--That would be one.
2009.08-964,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,645.671,652.592,"You get on the phone and you call the baker, and you get on the phone and you call the grocer and say: I can set up a deal for both of you."
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,652.592,653.158,It could be.
2009.08-964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,658.579,669.619,"And so in the insurance case, it takes a person to go over to the Bureau of Statistics and compile statistics on -- on life -- on life expectancy."
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,669.619,670.802,--That could be.
2009.08-964,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,700.321,711.01,"Isn't that the basis on which the patent law rests in Europe, in other countries?"
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,732.024,733.792,"--I would agree, Your Honor."
2009.08-964,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,741.648,748.218,"But I was talking about -- you said that technology-based, that wouldn't work because there are so many definitions."
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,761.11,0.0,--That's right.
2009.08-964,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,783.206,786.975,Are you suggesting they didn't exist because we didn't give them patents 100 years ago?
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,786.975,787.843,--No.
2009.08-964,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,787.843,793.462,Or they exist because computers have increased--
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,793.462,803.537,"It's very much related to our current economy and state of technology, with computers and the Internet and the free flow of information."
2009.08-964,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,804.353,807.219,"--No, but a patent limits the free flow of information."
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,818.994,822.565,"--Your Honor, I would, because of the disclosure requirement of the patent laws."
2009.08-964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,837.324,842.026,"Even though the public can't use it, right, until the patent expires?"
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,842.026,845.328,"--Until the patent expires, if a valid patent issues on that, yes."
2009.08-964,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,853.148,855.184,May I ask this question?
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,860.354,862.088,I would say it's the Diehr case.
2009.08-964,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,862.088,862.754,Which one?
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,862.754,863.373,Diehr.
2009.08-964,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,864.306,864.79,Diehr?
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,864.79,865.356,Yes.
2009.08-964,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,865.356,866.991,"That's, of course, nothing like this patent."
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,866.991,869.193,"No, it's not, but I think it--"
2009.08-964,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,869.193,870.426,There's language in the opinion.
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,870.426,872.145,--It outlines the general principles--
2009.08-964,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,872.145,872.845,Yes.
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,872.845,878.647,--and also tells us that there are only these specific things that are not included within the subject matter.
2009.08-964,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,878.647,885.717,But is it correct that there's none -- none of our cases has ever approved a rule such as you advocate?
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,885.717,890.086,I don't think this particular subject matter has been ruled on by the Court.
2009.08-964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,903.262,916.003,"You know, you mention that there are all these -- these new areas that didn't exist in the past because of modern business and whatnot, but there are also areas that existed in the past that don't exist today."
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,929.127,930.746,"--They might have, yes."
2009.08-964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,930.746,933.448,"Well, why didn't anybody patent those things?"
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,933.448,937.917,I think our economy was based on industrial process.
2009.08-964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,937.917,939.518,"It was based on horses, for Pete's sake."
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,943.553,946.505,There are also issues with enforcement.
2009.08-964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,970.554,974.358,How old -- how old were those -- those cases?
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,974.358,975.525,They range.
2009.08-964,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,978.191,981.929,"May I ask this general question, too?"
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,988.333,988.583,Yes.
2009.08-964,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,988.583,991.133,Has he written anything on this particular issue?
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,991.133,993.451,He has written a number of things.
2009.08-964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1013.864,1032.409,"In the Diehr case, the Court said that in the end, the abstract idea must be in a process that, oh, implements a proposal that the patent laws were designed to protect, which brings you almost back to the beginning."
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,1032.759,1033.259,It does.
2009.08-964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1033.259,1034.925,--You don't know much from that language.
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,1048.552,1054.922,"The Diehr invention was an industrial process of the conventional type, because it was a method of curing rubber."
2009.08-964,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1071.182,1086.644,"Well, isn't the manipulation of electronic signals a substance that's different in kind from just a method of how to go about doing business or a method of how to approach a particular problem?"
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,1104.772,1107.307,I think there is a difference.
2009.08-964,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1116.746,1123.15,That's exactly what I -- maybe I can get you to inadvertently help by -- a hypothesis you don't like.
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,1187.707,1191.425,--I think the answer is to follow the statute.
2009.08-964,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1191.425,1192.441,"Well, thank you."
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,1196.027,1203.483,"Congress has spoken in broad terms and given us those four categories, and by looking at those, I think that answers the question."
2009.08-964,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1203.483,1206.935,"But it doesn't, because we don't work in a vacuum."
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,1208.635,1208.918,Yes.
2009.08-964,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1208.918,1228.448,"And so it begs the question, because we go around in a circle: What does 1952 that had one set of manufacturing and other items that are technologically tied and this is not?"
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,1235.352,1239.572,"I think that ""process"" is not by itself."
2009.08-964,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1256.349,1258.701,"But the word ""knowledge"" is not used in the act."
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,1261.503,1262.186,No.
2009.08-964,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1262.186,1265.556,It's useful knowledge in relationship to something.
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,1265.556,1274.329,"Practically applied, yes, in the real world, whether that's the exchange of information or electronic data transformation."
2009.08-964,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1297.026,1297.276,"Well, if that's--"
2009.08-964,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1297.276,1303.763,"--But it would be different, it seems to me, than what you are -- let's assume you can't patent an alphabet."
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,1330.977,1334.696,"--That may be, but those signals could also be transmitted."
2009.08-964,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1345.037,1346.387,So you reject -- you reject the substitute.
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,1351.374,1352.791,"--It could be, yes."
2009.08-964,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1371.317,1372.769,--Morse's code was not obvious.
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,1372.769,1374.537,What is that?
2009.08-964,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1374.537,1376.354,"Morse's code was not obvious, and yet--"
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,1376.354,1376.954,"No, it wasn't."
2009.08-964,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1376.954,1386.06,"--As I understand that case, the only thing patented was the use of his code with respect to the telegraph machine that he proposed."
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,1400.002,1403.454,It -- it does say used in connection with telegraphy.
2009.08-964,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1403.454,1404.287,Of his claims--
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,1404.287,1404.587,Yes.
2009.08-964,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1404.587,1407.705,"--that was the only one that was accepted, correct?"
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,1407.705,1407.989,Well--
2009.08-964,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1407.989,1410.389,"The same thing with -- well, Bell's patent was--"
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,1410.389,1417.411,"--In Morse's claims, I believe it was claim 8 was the one that was rejected, and the rest of them were accepted."
2009.08-964,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1423.899,1432.754,"--Let's not skip over that, because the rest of the claim in Bell related to how to transmit over the wire, correct?"
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,1432.754,1442.526,"--His disclosure did, but his actual claim was interpreted as being using undulating current to transmit sound, however that was accomplished."
2009.08-964,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1444.16,1445.395,And that was what was rejected.
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,1445.395,1446.028,--No.
2009.08-964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1458.602,1464.839,"Well, it was -- it was transforming sound into electrical current and then at the other end electrical current back into sound."
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,1468.208,1469.824,--It might have.
2009.08-964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1470.826,1471.893,It clearly did.
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,1471.893,1487.935,"Well, it's not that clear from the Federal Circuit's transformation test whether that would apply or not, because although the Federal Circuit has said transformation of data might qualify, it said it has to represent something physical, something -- a real object."
2009.08-964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1492.756,1496.977,"Sound -- sound is not physical, and electric current is not physical?"
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,1496.977,1499.26,--I think electric current is physical.
2009.08-964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1499.26,1500.095,"Yes, I think so."
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,1500.095,1500.429,Yes.
2009.08-964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1500.429,1501.395,"Sound is, too."
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,1501.395,1504.547,"It can be, but when it's transmitted over a wire, it's not."
2009.08-964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1507.832,1511.117,Sound is not transmitted over the wires.
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,1520.057,1521.507,"Yes, and I would agree--"
2009.08-964,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1521.507,1525.46,I think it clearly -- clearly would have been covered by -- by the test the government--
2009.08-964,0,31176,j_michael_jakes,,1525.46,1530.262,"--I think that's more in the nature of transmission, much like our data transmission."
2009.08-964,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1539.801,1540.47,"Thank you, Mr. Jakes."
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1545.772,1559.114,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me start by following up on the discussion of the Morse and the telephone cases, because it's certainly our view that those would come out the same way under our test as -- as they actually did in practice."
2009.08-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1559.114,1559.914,I certainly hope so.
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1559.914,1560.08,Yes.
2009.08-964,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1622.75,1634.372,"Near -- near the end of your Brief, you argue that -- that the patent here is -- is not -- is unpatentable on the independent ground that it would pre-empt the abstract idea of hedging consumption risk."
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1642.792,1649.214,"--I -- I think we would certainly prefer to win on our primary ground, and let me say a couple of things about that."
2009.08-964,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1736.236,1750.745,"How about if we say something as simple as patent law doesn't cover business methods, instead of what the Federal Circuit has begun to say, which is technology is tied to a machine or a transformation of the substance?"
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1771.04,1774.158,"--I think that would be incorrect, and it would create problems of its own."
2009.08-964,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1806.194,1808.979,No ruling in this case is going to change State Street--
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1808.979,1809.312,--Well--
2009.08-964,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1809.312,1811.931,"--because it wasn't looking at process or the meaning of ""process""."
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1813.231,1827.541,"--Well, again, I think that the invention that was held to be patent eligible in State Street is commonly described as a business method, even though it was held to be patent eligible as a machine rather than as a process."
2009.08-964,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1865.899,1871.885,Also you could say business methods apart from machines are not patentable.
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1872.718,1882.341,"If the Court said that in the limited area of business methods, if there is no machine or transformation, there is no patent eligibility--"
2009.08-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1882.341,1883.007,Suppose you say this.
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1893.129,1893.329,--Yes.
2009.08-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1893.329,1893.829,Okay.
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1948.23,1951.182,Let me take those points--
2009.08-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1951.182,1951.515,Yes.
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1951.515,1951.898,--in the order that you made them.
2009.08-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1951.898,1952.731,Do you see what I'm trying to do?
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,1964.206,1965.872,Let me address those points in order.
2009.08-964,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2046.119,2050.754,"Mr. Stewart, I thought I understood your argument up until the very last footnote in your brief."
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2077.553,2086.207,"--Well, I guess there -- there were two different places, I believe, at which we identified ways in which this sort of hedging scheme might be made patent eligible."
2009.08-964,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2104.417,2104.817,"No, no."
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2111.338,2132.568,"--I think an -- an interactive computer technique, one in which you sign on and can find people without tracking them down specifically, can simply identify yourself on the Website as somebody who is interested in engaging in a particular transaction and a potential counterparty can find you, is different from the Yellow Pages."
2009.08-964,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2171.943,2178.947,"But if you look at your footnote, that involves the most tangential and insignificant use of a machine."
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2183.999,2197.425,"--And all we've said is that it might be enough; that is, hard questions will arise down the road as to where do you draw the line, to what extent must the machine or the transformation be central--"
2009.08-964,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2197.425,2198.709,So you think it's a hard question.
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2214.453,2221.623,"--I think if it's simply using a calculator for its pre-existing functionality to crunch numbers, very likely that would not be enough."
2009.08-964,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2236.032,2241.936,But your footnote -- I don't mean to dwell on it -- it says to identify counterparties to the transactions.
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2258.112,2261.064,"--Again, we are -- we are not saying it would be patent eligible."
2009.08-964,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2291.416,2308.442,"Now, if it veers the other way, which is by saying that we exclusively rely on the machine-or-transformation test, that we're precluding applications of the patent law in those fields, the things we can't imagine."
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2317.983,2321.268,--I guess I would say a couple of different things.
2009.08-964,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2356.172,2356.338,All right.
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2378.501,2394.88,"--Well, I think the Court could say -- could do essentially what was done in Benson and Flook, namely acknowledge that there had never been a case up to this point in which a process had been held patent eligible that didn't involve a machine or a transformation."
2009.08-964,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2422.78,2426.232,"Well, but that -- that goes back to, not 101, but 102 and 103."
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2431.617,2435.069,"--Well, this may or may not be a novel or nonobvious method."
2009.08-964,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2455.398,2466.021,"Mr. Stewart, did you -- did the government put forward this machine-or-transformation test?"
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2470.325,2475.71,"--The Federal Circuit, sua sponte, set the case for hearing en banc."
2009.08-964,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2490.037,2490.988,Tell me what your--
2009.08-964,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2490.988,2491.321,I'm sorry.
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2491.621,2492.121,It did.
2009.08-964,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2493.304,2501.727,"--You did -- and if you read Judge Mayer's opinion, it has a simplicity to it."
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2519.771,2526.258,"I don't know that our test -- I think our test, in a sense, has a shorthand version of that."
2009.08-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2598.52,2601.989,Was the State Street case a machine-or-transformation test?
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2601.989,2603.172,It would--
2009.08-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2603.172,2610.326,"You talk about the State Street case in your brief, and it's complicated because of the Federal statute that followed it."
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2620.117,2621.834,"--Oh, it would come out the same way."
2009.08-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2622.834,2623.034,That's what I thought.
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2625.217,2632.306,"--Well, it was machine -- that is, in State Street Bank, the claim was not to a process within the meaning of section 101."
2009.08-964,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2660.187,2662.389,So what did that -- what did that transform?
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2662.389,2687.956,"--It didn't transform anything, but it would fit -- the transformation part would be irrelevant because the machine-or-transformation test is, in our view, the appropriate rubric to apply in construing the statutory term process, that is, when the person doesn't say, I have invented a new machine, but, rather, says, I've identified a new process for accomplishing things."
2009.08-964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2698.646,2704.2,I don't understand how that can be a patent on a machine if the only thing novel is the process that the machine is using.
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2709.704,2727.999,"--Well, I think what -- the argument that the other side, the person challenging the patent in State Street could have made, but apparently didn't, was the person could have said, of course, the computer is a machine, but a computer programmed with new software to perform different functions is not a new machine."
2009.08-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2739.889,2742.656,"Well, that was one of the reasons I asked you about it, I suppose."
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2752.697,2766.374,"--It was -- the way I would put it is: The State Street Bank analysis of the question that was actually presented to it was correct; that is, the argued was made the programmed computer is patentable as a machine--"
2009.08-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2766.374,2771.341,"How would you come out in the State Street case today, if all of the arguments were made under your test?"
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2771.341,2776.645,"--Well, under our test, we would come out the same way because the computer would be a machine."
2009.08-964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2796.606,2797.006,I'm sorry.
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2802.759,2808.663,--I think the same -- the Federal Circuit's decision in State Street would come out the same way under our test.
2009.08-964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2808.663,2809.597,And you think it should?
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2810.282,2812.849,"Yes, but, again, the point I would emphasize--"
2009.08-964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2812.849,2822.673,"I don't understand why that isn't just the application of a process, which -- which is not itself patentable subject matter, to a particular machine that can use the process--"
2009.08-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2822.673,2823.839,That's -- that's a problem I have.
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2823.839,2826.041,"--Well, I guess -- let me backtrack."
2009.08-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2847.221,2855.977,"So I thought you were saying that the correct argument for the people attacking the patent in that case was to say, this is not a machine."
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2872.487,2872.939,--I don't -- no.
2009.08-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2873.872,2874.055,Okay.
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2874.522,2895.952,"What I was saying is that -- and I guess the -- the first point I would make is, when somebody claims to have invented a new machine, the transformation test really has nothing to do with the inquiry because a -- a better television or a better DVD player can be patented as a machine, even though transformation of matter is no--"
2009.08-964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2895.952,2900.589,"--It's not on a computer, which the only difference from the old computer is it's using a new program."
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2902.541,2911.48,"--Well, but my -- I think -- first, I think you can because I think if you -- if you improved the hardware of the computer in order to enable it to perform--"
2009.08-964,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2911.48,2915.032,"But that patent didn't require any change in the hardware, if I remember it correctly."
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2915.032,2927.84,--But I -- but I think the argument that has been made with success -- and PTO agrees with this -- is that programming a computer by means of software to produce -- to perform new functions can create a novel--
2009.08-964,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2927.84,2933.577,"But then all we do is every example that I just gave, that I thought were examples that certainly wouldn't be patented, you simply patent them."
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2962.429,2977.772,"--Well, first of all the only ruling that we're -- I backtrack a bit, to say, we opposed cert in this case because we recognized that there are difficult problems out there in terms of patentability of software innovations and medical diagnostic--"
2009.08-964,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2977.772,2979.655,You thought we -- you thought we'd mess it up.
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,2979.655,2980.724,--I didn't think you would--
2009.08-964,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3009.791,3014.611,But this case could be decided without making any bold step--
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3014.611,3022.431,"Again, I don't -- I don't think it would be a bold step to say that machine or transformation is the test."
2009.08-964,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3024.233,3027.166,--But even the Federal Circuit didn't say it was the test.
2009.08-964,1,36722,malcolm_l_stewart,,3038.974,3041.807,--And we would -- we would be entirely content with a ruling like that.
2009.08-964,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3197.292,3198.543,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-964,2,31176,j_michael_jakes,,3201.16,3204.947,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-964,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3311.883,3319.804,The -- the physical step that your process involves is picking -- picking up the phone and calling people on both sides of the transaction.
2009.08-964,2,31176,j_michael_jakes,,3319.804,3320.237,It could be.
2009.08-964,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3337.898,3340.8,"Thank you, counsel."
