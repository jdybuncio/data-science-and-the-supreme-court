2014.14-6368,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.565,"We will hear argument this morning in Case 14-6368, Kingsley v. Hendrickson. Ms. Ward."
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,8.565,18.38,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The core of the liberty interest protected by due process is the right to be free from unjustified bodily restraint and harm."
2014.14-6368,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,49.21,63.82,"Well, why isn't the safety of the detainee, why isn't that just a facet of the use of excessive force? I think that's how the district court treated it."
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,63.82,69.535,The -- the safety of the detainee was the stated objective for the use of the force in -- in this case.
2014.14-6368,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,100.8,108.86,"You -- you mentioned the Fourth Amendment now, but as I understand it, the complaint just alleged a due process violation."
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,113.435,114.545,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2014.14-6368,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,138.94,144.7,So suppose you have a detainee being held in a prison population.
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,151.235,152.95,"That's correct, under the --"
2014.14-6368,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,152.95,153.25,All right.
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,172.57,174.035,Yes.
2014.14-6368,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,182.01,191.49,That was my next question. So there can be punishment for simply not -- in order to maintain discipline within the prison population.
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,200.77,206.43,"If it's a pretrial detainee, you -- you can discipline for -- to enforce legitimate objectives."
2014.14-6368,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,208.86,211.95,"You use the word ""discipline;"" I use the word ""punish."" Are they the same?"
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,211.95,213.12,They're not the same.
2014.14-6368,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,223.18,240.445,"And it doesn't matter if the -- if the punisher, so to speak, is simply an individual guard at the prison versus the -- the State, which will run a prison that it knows has these cruel guards."
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,246.125,246.78,Right.
2014.14-6368,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,265.41,269.585,"This is substantive due process you're arguing, right? Not procedural due process."
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,269.585,270.05,Yes.
2014.14-6368,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,270.05,271.33,And it's not the Eighth Amendment.
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,273.135,275.365,"That's right, other than to distinguish --"
2014.14-6368,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,275.365,275.62,Right.
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,275.62,279.005,-- what you can do with a convicted prisoner versus a detainee.
2014.14-6368,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,279.005,288.78,"I just have to tell you, I find it very difficult to understand how it would be a different standard if these same facts occurred, but it was an inmate who was serving a sentence."
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,291.52,297.18,The rationale for why they should be different is it's a -- it's an after-the-fact analysis.
2014.14-6368,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,302.63,303.11,I'm sorry.
2014.14-6368,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,303.81,307.68,But -- but you said that they could be disciplined and now -- and that's --
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,307.68,310.37,I think the -- I think the difference --
2014.14-6368,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,310.37,314.605,You use the -- I -- where am I going to read to find a difference between discipline and punishment?
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,314.605,323.27,I think the difference is punishment is the result of applying the Bell rationally-related test.
2014.14-6368,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,334.715,335.18,But even --
2014.14-6368,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,335.18,349.065,"I'm having a problem with trying to understand why we're talking about a difference between any of the Amendments, the Fourth, the Fourteenth, or the Eighth."
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,401.195,402.12,That's correct.
2014.14-6368,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,402.12,402.86,All right.
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,435.06,435.845,That's correct.
2014.14-6368,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,436.82,439.155,Do you have a different standard than the government?
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,439.155,440.5,"We do, Your Honor."
2014.14-6368,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,440.5,441.13,All right.
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,442.47,443.17,Well --
2014.14-6368,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,443.17,445.08,And explain why.
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,448.26,448.605,I misspoke.
2014.14-6368,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,460.49,463.93,That I -- I understand. I'm just talking about the standard now.
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,463.93,467.105,We -- we are in agreement with the Solicitor General on the standard.
2014.14-6368,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,467.105,479.195,"What if -- what if I don't agree with the Solicitor? Is there anybody here to argue for a different standard? No? We -- we just have to pick between two people who argue for the same standard, right?"
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,479.195,484.01,"I -- I -- I believe the Respondents have a different standard in mind, Your Honor."
2014.14-6368,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,484.01,485.05,Yes.
2014.14-6368,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,485.3,507.655,"Is it possible -- I hadn't thought about it too much -- that you would have different priorities in training, depending on whether you're dealing with people who've already been convicted of crimes and people who are being detained, like, perhaps people who have been convicted tend to engage in particular activity more than people just awaiting trial?"
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,507.655,511.78,I think the detainees can be as dangerous as prisoners.
2014.14-6368,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,533.96,551.64,"Well, I know -- of course you're not going to say you can't act with -- with malice, but it would seem to me if the standards are broader with respect to people who have been convicted, you might tell the officers, look, you have more flexibility with respect to people who are already subject to a conviction."
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,581.03,582.53,That's certainly true.
2014.14-6368,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,598.325,614.15,"I still go back to my question: Why is there a difference at all? What you seem to be suggesting is that gratuitous violence, unnecessary violence, can be directed to pretrial and post-trial detainees."
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,628.98,630.09,We are --
2014.14-6368,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,630.09,631.835,-- against anybody?
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,631.835,635.505,"I think I understand your question, Justice Sotomayor."
2014.14-6368,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,642.63,644.485,But they can't be punished corporally.
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,652.49,652.82,No.
2014.14-6368,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,652.82,655.57,Not -- not in terms of discipline.
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,684.81,689.475,The egregious use force will fail both tests.
2014.14-6368,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,689.475,694.03,"Well, that's what I wanted to ask about."
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,737.89,743.78,Mr. Kingsley's case might be just such an example.
2014.14-6368,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,763.895,787.445,"Well, in a case where there's -- where the jury thinks that there was force that was objectively unreasonable, and in particular, if it's a -- if it's a 1983 claim or a Bivens claim, where the officer has qualified immunity, it doesn't seem to me that there are going to be very many cases where the difference between these two standards will result in a different outcome."
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,788.085,790.13,I think you are wrong.
2014.14-6368,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,816.649,830.015,I don't see how you could use excessive force -- unreasonably excessive force and be acting in good faith.
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,830.015,835.78,"Well, there's the issue -- the issue of qualified immunity with respect to mistake of law."
2014.14-6368,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,845.74,849.45,But no -- but we're asking what the standard ought to be.
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,853.565,854.18,Yes.
2014.14-6368,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,854.18,866.905,"And as of this point, I do not know why the standard should be different for convicts as opposed to pretrial detainees, other than for purposes of rehabilitation."
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,883.95,888.96,It's -- it's -- using the objective test for a pretrial detainee is faithful to the Constitution.
2014.14-6368,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,911.94,917.885,"But -- but Ms. Ward, you've said a few times that we're supposed to be looking to see whether something counts as punishment."
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,947.4,948.22,Yes.
2014.14-6368,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,962.14,965.73,"Yes, but you -- you -- you brought punishment into this discussion."
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,977.78,979.97,"No, that is the -- that is the criteria."
2014.14-6368,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,979.97,981.1,"I don't understand it, either."
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,1138.225,1150.19,"The Fourth Amendment doesn't require any inquiry into the subjective state of mind. And the Fourth Amendment test, in the case of a police officer on the street, does the job adequately."
2014.14-6368,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1173.31,1206.66,"At least in a prison, I would think a prison guard would have a pretty tough time thinking that if this person is in prison because he's been convicted of a crime, I can try to control his riotous behavior as long as I reasonably believe that what I'm doing is correct, even if it turns -- but now I have a totally different standard, where this person's in the same cell, doing the same thing, but he hasn't yet had his trial."
2014.14-6368,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1213.07,1213.87,Can I --
2014.14-6368,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1213.87,1215.55,What's the answer to that?
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,1215.55,1220.2,"It's okay for the standards to be different, because it's more faithful to the Constitution."
2014.14-6368,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1227.58,1237.905,Can I -- I'm still struggling because we're trying to create boxes in a way that makes no sense to me.
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,1291.91,1292.325,Yes.
2014.14-6368,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1292.325,1295.685,But that's very different than this situation.
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,1339.685,1340.35,Yes.
2014.14-6368,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1340.35,1351.26,So I keep saying why are we thinking about the necessity to impose subjective standards or any other standards or that they have to be different?
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,1351.26,1353.49,I see that I have used my time.
2014.14-6368,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1353.49,1353.63,Yes.
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,1353.63,1355.3,And can I respond --
2014.14-6368,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1355.3,1355.8,Sure.
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,1355.8,1356.22,-- briefly?
2014.14-6368,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1356.22,1357.69,We'll -- we'll give you an extra minute since --
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,1357.69,1358.08,Thank you.
2014.14-6368,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1358.08,1359.745,-- the Court intruded on your time.
2014.14-6368,0,56183,wendy_m_ward,,1359.745,1367.46,Thank you. The Court could decide that the standard for all excessive force cases should be an objective standard.
2014.14-6368,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1391.99,1398.51,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Bash."
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1398.51,1424.455,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If there's one point I would like to convey to the Court this morning which I think is responsive to a number of questions that were asked in the opening presentation, it's that there are two relevant differences between the standard we're advancing and the standard Mr. Clement is about to get up and talk about. One goes to what sort of purpose is required, and the other goes to how you establish that purpose. On the first, Mr. Clement says it is malicious and sadistic intent."
2014.14-6368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1470.06,1471.73,"This is a due process case, right?"
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1471.73,1471.865,It --
2014.14-6368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1471.865,1476.005,"It's not a Fourth Amendment case, and it's not an Eighth Amendment case; is that right?"
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1476.005,1476.59,That's correct.
2014.14-6368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1477.12,1479.615,It's just that you want to bring into the due process analysis --
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1479.615,1482.645,"Justice Scalia, you characterize it as substantive due process, and --"
2014.14-6368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1482.645,1482.8,Yes.
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1482.8,1486.53,"-- I think a couple cases have talked about it like that, but it's not exactly substantive process."
2014.14-6368,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1520.97,1527.67,And -- and your -- your standard in this case as to the pretrial detainee is that he is entitled to what protection?
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1527.67,1528.53,He is --
2014.14-6368,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1528.53,1529.26,What is your standard?
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1529.26,1549.8,"It -- it's exactly what Justice Rehnquist said for this Court in Bell, which is that either an intent to punish, which I take to be shorthand for an intent to achieve objectives that are -- are not reasonable -- reasonable at that point for that person's status in the system, or, objectively, there's no reasonable relation between the use of force and those objectives."
2014.14-6368,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1549.8,1562.01,"Wait, wait, wait, wait. The first one, that's the -- I mean, now you've run -- just run -- I could say the objective part has to be objectively unreasonable force."
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1575.41,1575.52,No.
2014.14-6368,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1577.06,1577.25,No.
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1578.18,1578.36,It -- it is --
2014.14-6368,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1578.36,1589.71,"-- even though this man, the defendant, is completely innocent, it wasn't his fault in the slightest, he wasn't even negligent, the guard is nonetheless liable."
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1595.24,1596.905,"Because, Justice Breyer, that's not what we're saying."
2014.14-6368,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1596.905,1597.09,All right.
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1597.09,1600.35,I think the premise of the question conflates two different types of intent.
2014.14-6368,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1606.59,1607.51,Obviously --
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1607.51,1607.66,-- or if --
2014.14-6368,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1607.66,1610.31,"-- you have the intent to do the act, that obviously --"
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1610.31,1610.53,But -- but --
2014.14-6368,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1610.53,1611.1,-- isn't the problem.
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1611.1,1612.87,-- that was the premise of your question about --
2014.14-6368,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1612.87,1613.02,No.
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1613.02,1613.53,-- if you think it is --
2014.14-6368,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1613.53,1613.74,-- it isn't.
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1613.95,1615.49,"Well, the Taser gun question -- I mean --"
2014.14-6368,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1615.49,1616.7,Can I ask my question?
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1616.7,1617.225,Yes.
2014.14-6368,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1617.225,1620.76,It is objectively unreasonable.
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1657.18,1658.48,"Well, let -- let me describe how --"
2014.14-6368,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1658.48,1659.65,I want to know what your view is on that.
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1659.65,1662.06,"My view is this: One, it has to be an intentional act."
2014.14-6368,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1662.85,1663.5,"Well, that's --"
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1663.5,1664.62,"And -- well, and intent --"
2014.14-6368,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1664.62,1667.495,Do you mean -- do you mean -- just to -- you mean voluntary?
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1667.495,1668.34,"Well -- well, not --"
2014.14-6368,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1668.34,1671.675,Not -- not a -- a mistake with a Taser or gun?
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1671.675,1672.73,And it -- no.
2014.14-6368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1732.69,1736.695,Why is this different for inmates as -- as opposed to detainees?
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1736.695,1738.65,Because what the Due Process Clause --
2014.14-6368,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1738.65,1741.15,What's the test for inmates? You -- you don't apply the same test.
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1741.15,1752.24,"The malicious and sadistic intent test that Mr. Clement is asking you to apply to pretrial detainees. But remember, this would probably not only attain to pretrial detainees, certainly not only pretrial detainees in mixed populations."
2014.14-6368,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1763.93,1770.755,Do you agree that the pretrial detainee can be deprived of -- of privileges because of bad behavior that's disruptive to the confinement?
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1770.755,1771.27,Yes.
2014.14-6368,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1785.99,1796.42,Why wouldn't -- why wouldn't persons who were being arrested and persons who have been convicted and are incarcerated have the same due process rights as detainees?
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1796.42,1800.48,Because the Due Process Clause permits the punishment of people who are convicted.
2014.14-6368,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1808.19,1825.38,"So it's -- so it's okay to use excessive force in the case of a prisoner, somebody who has been convicted? I mean, the question here is did -- what did the polices -- was it objectively unreasonable to use the extent of force that was used in this case."
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1831.96,1844.875,"Well, it probably almost always violate the Eighth Amendment if there was an actual intent to punish, and the punishment was carried out by the use of force. But I think often what we're talking about is these cases on the margin, where the officer maybe had mixed motives or whatever."
2014.14-6368,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1852.97,1863.975,"Can you give us an example of what a guard could do to an inmate and a guard could not do to a pretrial detainee, other than for rehabilitation purposes?"
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1863.975,1867.72,I don't think the use of force as discipline is ever appropriate.
2014.14-6368,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1882.29,1887.225,"Well, I think it's pretty unusual, isn't it, to have a pretrial detainee in a maximum security prison?"
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1887.225,1887.75,No.
2014.14-6368,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1892.8,1897.33,"And you come up with a hypothetical, I think, is quite unrealistic, so I'm not sure it's responsive."
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1897.33,1899.78,I didn't mean to come up with a hypothetical.
2014.14-6368,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1899.78,1902.63,I'm even not sure why that's right.
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1908.96,1910.93,That -- that's -- that is certainly --
2014.14-6368,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1910.93,1916.25,"So if you walk by a prisoner and, you know, I want to establish discipline so I can freely kick them any time I want?"
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1916.25,1917.765,That's certainly not what we're saying.
2014.14-6368,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1936.73,1960.905,"Mr. Bash, would you explain? I mean, you agree that it's only the objective standard, use of excessive force, but then your bottom line is the same as the Respondent, that is, you think that this -- this verdict should hold and it should not be any new trial."
2014.14-6368,1,29118,john_f_bash,,1967.96,1973.62,"I would take the Court to page 277 and 278 of the Joint Appendix, which lists the pertinent jury instructions."
2014.14-6368,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2009.905,2014.605,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement."
2014.14-6368,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2014.605,2047.47,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court should adopt the subjective test fashioned by Judge Friendly in Johnson against Glick in addressing a due process claim for excessive force by a pretrial detainee. This Court has already adopted that standard in the Eighth Amendment context for convicted prisoners, and both doctrinal and practical reasons strongly suggest that it should apply the same test in the due process context in which that test originated, and the contrary propositions are simply not compatible with this Court's precedents."
2014.14-6368,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2047.47,2053.745,"In Johnson and Glick, the bottom line was that there was reliability; isn't that so?"
2014.14-6368,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2053.745,2055.22,"No, Justice Ginsburg."
2014.14-6368,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2090.89,2099.81,"But if we look at this -- this case, the conduct was deliberate, using the Taser was deliberate."
2014.14-6368,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2115.32,2127.09,"So the question is: Is this a good faith effort to try to get these handcuffs off, or is this somebody who's acting simply to punish the -- the detainee? And I think that's what the good faith test really gets to."
2014.14-6368,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2130.02,2132.34,"Well, let's put the nub of the issue here."
2014.14-6368,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2169.495,2179.91,"Well, I suppose that if the jury actually credited Petitioner's versions of events, they might be able to find liability under the Johnson v. Glick standard."
2014.14-6368,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2189.39,2204.27,Let's go back to -- that's why I keep trying to go back to what is the -- what are the -- under what circumstances and how does your test get to the gratuitous use of violence or the excessive use of violence where it's unnecessary?
2014.14-6368,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2204.27,2216.6,"Well, I think it gets to it in a way that provides a degree of deference to the difficult decisions that the guard has to make, which is it recognizes that unlike the arrest context in other situations, prison environment's different."
2014.14-6368,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2220.39,2222.12,But that instruction is going to be given anyway.
2014.14-6368,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2222.12,2222.57,What's that?
2014.14-6368,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2222.57,2228.75,"Under -- under the Bell v. Wolfish case, that presumption was given anyhow."
2014.14-6368,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2228.75,2247.01,"Well, but I -- I don't -- I mean, I think there are real differences between the instruction, and if you look at -- the clearest way to illustrate this is if you look at Joint Appendix page 78 and you look at the instruction that was offered by the Petitioners below, it flat out says you can't take into account the good faith intent of the officer."
2014.14-6368,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2300.99,2315.885,"Well, that's true -- you know, what you say is equally true where you're running a jail, isn't it? And it's equally true where the person in the jail is -- has been convicted or hasn't been convicted."
2014.14-6368,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2354.305,2363.81,"Well, I think the punishment standard applies in both cases, Justice Breyer, because the relevant constitutional text has been interpreted to require punishment."
2014.14-6368,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2365.14,2383.455,"But suppose you brought a lawsuit under the Due Process Clause? I mean -- and there are instances where people are seized in jail, so it was under the Fourth Amendment. I mean, why is punishment in these other situations? I can't figure that one out."
2014.14-6368,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2397.87,2414.25,"Well, obviously, if you adopt, as this Court has in the Eighth Amendment context, the understanding that punishment inherently requires some subjective mental state, the lowest available mental state is recklessness and under that standard, which the jury clearly was instructed under, we would prevail."
2014.14-6368,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2489.44,2491.705,Why is that? Why don't you tell us why that's so?
2014.14-6368,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2491.705,2493.89,"Well, I'll -- I'll tell you why that's so."
2014.14-6368,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2535.12,2536.64,"Mr. Clement, sorry."
2014.14-6368,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2596.965,2599.24,"Justice Kagan, there is a place for that in the doctrine."
2014.14-6368,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2657.88,2660.31,"So that might be, but let's take another comparison."
2014.14-6368,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2705.44,2709.715,I think because the fact of incarceration really is a game-changer.
2014.14-6368,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2757.71,2766.39,I still find it very hard to understand how use of force can be excessive without being at least reckless.
2014.14-6368,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2788.37,2793.99,I think often it will be. We're not here to defend the recklessness instruction as the platonic sort of form.
2014.14-6368,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2872.23,2885.585,"But you're giving -- you're -- you're loading the deck completely, because you're instructing the jury first to give the police officers deference, and then you're now giving them an instruction that assumes that whatever they do is okay."
2014.14-6368,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2885.585,2886.97,I don't think so.
2014.14-6368,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2887.25,2903.735,"I mean, there's no -- there's -- by adding that kind of subjective intent that you want, maliciousness and wantonness, which are not -- are only one part, as your -- as the Assistant Solicitor General said, only one part of the Johnson test."
2014.14-6368,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2903.735,2905.09,But -- but if I -- if I could --
2014.14-6368,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2905.09,2909.255,You're -- you're -- the way you've articulated in your brief has really loaded the deck completely.
2014.14-6368,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2909.255,2918.23,"Well, in -- in fairness, and to correct the Assistant Solicitor General, the instruction we asked for, which is at Joint Appendix 65, it has all of the Johnson factors."
2014.14-6368,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2950.645,2958.575,"Bell v. -- Bell v. Wolfish, the first part of the application section of that opinion goes to whether there's an intent to punish."
2014.14-6368,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2973.78,2977.92,"Well, I think alternative ways to prove a punitive intent."
2014.14-6368,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3013.37,3029.94,"Am I right that the pattern instruction in -- in this case, the pattern instruction asked only the excessive force question, asked the jury to decide whether the force was excessive in light of the particular facts and circumstances?"
2014.14-6368,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3029.94,3031.76,"Well, okay."
2014.14-6368,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3075.36,3084.11,"Mr. Clement, why not look at it this way? I mean, you said -- and it's really the basis of your argument -- that being in an institutional setting is the game-changer."
2014.14-6368,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3134.735,3136.61,"Well, a couple of responses, Justice Kagan."
2014.14-6368,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3159.8,3172.865,"I would think that the jury would give a lot of deference to prison officials, in part because they are unfamiliar with the circumstances. And folks will come in and will say, you know, here's -- I think that there's -- that -- that that will be the natural tendency."
2014.14-6368,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3172.865,3180.81,"I mean, I hope you're right for the sake of my clients, but I think that tendency is going to be embodied much more if you let them take into account good faith."
2014.14-6368,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3301.93,3302.38,But if you really --
2014.14-6368,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3302.38,3302.96,-- which is there's no intent --
2014.14-6368,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3302.96,3303.2,-- if you really --
2014.14-6368,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3303.2,3304.01,-- other than to cause harm.
2014.14-6368,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3304.01,3314.745,"-- want to take the Judge Friendly test -- and I guess you've talked about this before, but it is a multifactor test where the question of sadisticness is counting as a plus factor, a thumb on the scales."
2014.14-6368,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,3325.22,3371.045,"I don't think that's the right reading of it, which is I think the ultimate question under that test, and that's certainly the way it's been applied by this Court in the Eighth Amendment context, and you see that in this pattern jury instruction that we propose. The ultimate test is, is this a good faith effort to maintain order, or is this an effort to inflict punishment just for the sake of punishment? And then the rest of the factors inform that as, of course, they always would. And I think one way of thinking about the question before the Court in this case is that this Court has already borrowed the -- the Johnson v. Glick factors that were due process factors -- they've already borrowed them and used them in the Eighth Amendment context. And the question in this case is should they take that due process test and apply it in a due process case? And that doesn't sound like a difficult question, and I really don't think it is."
2014.14-6368,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3404.91,3410.08,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Ward, 4 minutes."
2014.14-6368,3,56183,wendy_m_ward,,3410.08,3414.62,Thank you. Justice -- Justice Kagan got it exactly right.
