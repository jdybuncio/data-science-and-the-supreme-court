1969.63,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,12.147,United States against Webb and others.
1969.63,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,13.905,19.898,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.63,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,244.966,248.46,"Mr. Solicitor General, you said that was (b) (4) or (d) (4)?"
1969.63,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,248.46,249.68,That is (b) (4).
1969.63,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,249.68,250.537,Thank you.
1969.63,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,250.537,265.852,3121 (b) (4) contains a negative pregnant that Americans employed on American owned vessels are covered.
1969.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,500.686,517.167,"Mr. Solicitor General, as I read this now under your guidance, I gather that we come right down with respect to both taxes to the definition of employee in each case, don't we?"
1969.63,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,528.714,558.997,"I think -- I think that's exactly it except that I would say that this definition comes as a piece of a mosaic which also includes some references to fishing and ships and boats of more than ten tons and thus, it is perfectly plain that Congress did not intend to exclude employment on the ship such as are involved in this case."
1969.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,558.997,559.228,Right.
1969.63,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,559.228,571.942,But I fully agree that a large part of the problem before the Court is the application of this common law test specified in the statute to the facts of this case.
1969.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,571.942,576.781,And the test of the definition of the word employee?
1969.63,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,576.781,580.542,The determining whether these people are employees.
1969.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,580.542,585.658,Under 3121 (d) and under --
1969.63,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,585.658,586.154,3306 --
1969.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,586.154,592.796,"3301 (i), (b) (i)."
1969.63,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,592.796,593.691,Yes Mr. Justice --
1969.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,593.691,595.012,Thank you.
1969.63,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,595.012,600.629,"Now, this case was tried before the District Court without a jury."
1969.63,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,805.222,815.694,I suppose Mr. Solicitor General that it could also be argued that that flexibility also gave the master of the vessel quite a bit of control in --
1969.63,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,815.694,825.723,Inevitably Mr. Chief Justice and that of course I suppose is inherent in the post of being the master of a vessel while it is at sea.
1969.63,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,825.723,833.734,"Well, I was thinking in terms of his power to terminate the contract at the end of any voyage --"
1969.63,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,833.734,840.557,"Yes, I suppose any employee ordinarily can quit at any reasonable time."
1969.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,845.394,847.79,What is tenure of the trips typically?
1969.63,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,849.708,853.709,The trips were ordinarily one day in the Gulf.
1969.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1732.068,1736.641,Is there any chance that the crew would be -- the members of the crew would be employees of the captain?
1969.63,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1736.641,1738.898,"I suppose so, I don't know."
1969.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1743.69,1743.806,That they'd be probable.
1969.63,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1743.806,1750.096,-- that they would be self employed and pay their own tax which seems to me to be quite unrealistic.
1969.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1750.096,1757.356,"I think if they're not employees of these respondents, they would be employees of the captain, is that right?"
1969.63,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1757.356,1760.838,That could be but that isn't the way the captain thinks of it.
1969.63,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1761.338,1761.488,"He wouldn't like it, I suppose?"
1969.63,0,22386,erwin_n_griswold,,1761.488,1769.158,-- maintain employment records and carry on relations with the union and things of that kind.
1969.63,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1856.97,1861.494,"Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General."
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,1873.778,1878.428,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1969.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1916.26,1916.505,Do you --
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,1916.505,1917.065,Yes sir.
1969.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1917.065,1917.569,Excuse me.
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,1935.67,1938.812,A mixed question of law in fact I believe Your Honor --
1969.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1938.812,1942.145,"Well, what if it is?"
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,1944.227,1967.064,"Well, Your Honor, I would say that on review that where a statute would preclude the decision of the District Court, I would say that would be a question of law and reviewable on appeal where the statute would preclude the decision."
1969.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1989.29,1999.905,"What that means is that the court accepts the historical facts found unless they're clearly erroneous, but then it's a question of law as to whether they meet the standard?"
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,1999.905,2001.161,That's correct.
1969.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2001.161,2009.079,So there is no clearly erroneous rule in reviewing that conclusion of the fact.
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2009.079,2013.45,"I don't see how it could be there, no Your Honor, that's correct."
1969.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2156.942,2159.918,"You mean the provision, you mean groceries and foods?"
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2159.918,2162.226,"Groceries, yes, Your Honor."
1969.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2162.226,2168.466,And those were deducted from his share of the take?
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2168.466,2170.302,"No, he paid those out of his own pocket."
1969.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2170.302,2170.979,"Well, that's what I mean."
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2170.979,2173.148,"Oh, yes."
1969.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2173.148,2179.7,"But the old -- if no fish were caught, the captain was out at the groceries?"
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2179.7,2180.834,That's right.
1969.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2182.716,2184.856,So he took the risk of loss and --
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2184.856,2185.779,That's correct.
1969.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2185.779,2186.599,--in this enterprise?
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2186.599,2188.054,Yes Your Honor
1969.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2188.054,2189.702,Only for the groceries?
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2189.702,2193.728,Groceries or that would be all.
1969.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2193.728,2195.548,Because fuel and other things --
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2195.548,2198.485,"No, those were all paid by the owners."
1969.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2198.485,2208.544,"But the captain -- and also, I suppose that the -- that the -- well, the crew members were paid also when the fish were caught weren't they?"
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2208.544,2209.092,That's correct.
1969.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2209.092,2209.612,Okay.
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2209.612,2214.109,"Your Honor, just to bring that up, the crew members are paid out of the pocket of the captain."
1969.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2214.109,2217.362,Oh yes but only if fish -- he didn't owe them anything unless they caught some fish?
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2217.362,2218.445,That's correct.
1969.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2237.775,2238.305,To the owner?
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2238.305,2239.109,To the owner.
1969.63,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2239.109,2241.055,And then the owner sold to the plant.
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2241.055,2243.297,The owner and the plant had another arrangement or some kind.
1969.63,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2330.081,2335.652,"Well, did he promise to fish it beyond a single voyage?"
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2335.652,2343.969,"Yes, I would say that it was contemplated here that they would take it for the season which was about four to five months or six months depending where they were."
1969.63,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2343.969,2346.69,But terminable at will by either parties?
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2346.69,2368.496,"Yes, but as a practical matter if the Court please, if the boat is equipped and ready to go and there are plenty of fish out there and the captain has his organization, I cannot imagine that an owner would just willy nilly fire a captain and leave a profitable venture sitting at the dock."
1969.63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2442.996,2447.749,Who fixed the terms of this amount of money for the crew?
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2447.749,2456.482,"Your Honor, the amount of money was issued in a pay scale by the owners."
1969.63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2505.886,2508.18,Who hires and who fires?
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2508.18,2508.625,The owners--
1969.63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2508.625,2509.746,The captain hires?
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2509.746,2510.21,Pardon?
1969.63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2510.21,2510.95,The captain hires.
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2510.95,2512.841,The captain hires the crew entirely.
1969.63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2512.841,2514.198,Can the owner fire?
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2514.198,2515.456,"No Your Honor, absolutely not."
1969.63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2517.004,2519.238,He can't fire any member of the crew?
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2519.238,2523.032,"Well, the Court so found and it has never happened."
1969.63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2526.411,2528.857,But he could fire the captain?
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2528.857,2530.512,"Well, Your Honor, let's put it this way."
1969.63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2545.789,2549.71,Well let's suppose he caught him stealing money during the --
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2549.71,2549.796,Well --
1969.63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2549.796,2550.726,Can he get rid of him?.
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2550.726,2557.608,"Your Honor, I would hope he would and I couldn't -- I don't see how that would turn him into an employee."
1969.63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2557.608,2563.612,Well I mean why would he be interested in whether they steal and not if he is an independent contractor?
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2563.612,2566.993,Well I'm afraid I don't follow that.
1969.63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2566.993,2571.862,"Well, you say it's completely independent that the owner pays and he hires and he fires --"
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2571.862,2571.935,That's correct.
1969.63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2571.935,2573.805,--and pays him out of his own pocket?
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2573.805,2575.288,Yes sir.
1969.63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2575.288,2578.326,"Well, how could he steal from himself?"
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2578.326,2583.865,"I don't think he could, but if he was just a thief at heart and stole something else, I'd imagine he'd get rid of him."
1969.63,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2583.865,2588.124,"Oh, I see."
1969.63,1,31471,joseph_j_lyman,,2588.124,2598.034,"It was open for the District Court here to hold that for the purposes of this two Acts, that fisherman could very well have been employees of the owners."
