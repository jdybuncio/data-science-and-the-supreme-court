1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,65.82,69.294,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-2024,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,224.401,231.191,"But now they don't mean that ordinance to make it multi-racial, do they?"
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,231.191,253.026,"Well, Your Honor, our contention is that the home builders and other private builders and entities have actually made proposals in the form of housing construction which would be within a range which can be purchase by low and moderate multi-racial persons."
1974.73-2024,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,275.978,283.254,Behind acquire is that a concrete zoning application refusal in this record?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,283.254,286.003,"There are numbered instances, Your Honor, of attempts --"
1974.73-2024,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,286.003,289.32,These specific cases with the parties involved --
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,289.32,289.973,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-2024,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,289.973,290.626,-- your clients here?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,290.626,293.255,"Yes Your Honor, and let me clarify that."
1974.73-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,391.242,396.116,"Did Penfield Better Homes, the one that you mentioned, had a plan denied?"
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,401.446,402.278,They did not.
1974.73-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,423.656,431.494,How long before the filing of this suit in the District Court had the Penfield Better Homes application been turned down?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,432.692,433.375,"It does, Your Honor."
1974.73-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,471.718,473.688,Is Metro-Act a builder?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,473.688,476.742,Metro-Act is a civic organization.
1974.73-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,476.742,477.694,Is it a builder?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,477.694,478.622,It is not a builder.
1974.73-2024,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,502.033,507.183,"If you prevail here, what type of remedy do you envisage?"
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,507.183,517.866,"Well, the complaint asked for a declaratory judgment that the zoning ordinance is racially discriminatory and therefore, illegal and unconstitutional."
1974.73-2024,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,534.261,536.866,So you think the -- is it only the standing issue here?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,538.064,540.393,"This -- this Court has only the standing issue, Your Honor."
1974.73-2024,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,540.393,545.004,"So if the court was wrong below, it would still have to rule on whether there was cause of action, do you?"
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,545.004,550.543,"Well, I think that the court would have two choices in terms of dealing with this case."
1974.73-2024,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,587.657,599.483,"Are you suggesting that on this record, we could make the determination, tell the Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit with the complaint stated a cause of action?"
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,599.483,605.95,I think the record would permit this Court to remand with directions.
1974.73-2024,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,613.884,618.256,You think that there is an issue here of justiciability as well as standing?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,618.256,619.567,"I don't think, Your Honor."
1974.73-2024,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,657.08,671.176,This is why I asked you about the type of remedy you envisaged that in part of your answer was I take it that you would expect judicial enforcement of a -- the drafting of a new ordinance.
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,671.176,690.451,"Well, I think, Your Honor that in a case of racial discrimination, such an order directing affirmative relief, it has been a part of a District Court handling of the case, I think it would be appropriate here."
1974.73-2024,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,706.2,710.565,It went off on the ground also that you can think did not state the cause of action.
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,710.565,712.96,"That the District Court only Your Honor, the Second Circuit."
1974.73-2024,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,712.96,719.727,"Therefore, I was expecting starting from this Court, that to say that it does state a cause of action before there could be a charge?"
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,719.727,724.062,That's correct.
1974.73-2024,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,724.062,725.829,We'll resume there after lunch.
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,725.829,736.991,Okay.
1974.73-2024,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,736.991,740.728,You may continue.
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,740.728,746.321,"The Town of Penfield, New York is virtually a 100% white population."
1974.73-2024,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,777.915,782.131,Penfield immediately contiguous to Rochester?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,782.131,782.664,It is.
1974.73-2024,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,787.508,793.317,So that the joint from Rochester to the Penfield one would not be aware that there's --
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,793.317,793.61,Not at all.
1974.73-2024,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,793.61,794.209,-- not the same place.
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,794.209,805.287,"It's an entire metropolitan area, persons work and live in both Penfield and Rochester; totally interchange a population, Your Honor."
1974.73-2024,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,805.287,811.808,"And what's the zoning generally of the Penfield, does it include industrial and commercial zoning as well as residential?"
1974.73-2024,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,854.643,856.919,That would include the cost of land acquisition?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,856.919,859.907,That would include the cost of land.
1974.73-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,859.907,863.5,"What is the land limitation, Mrs. Baldwin?"
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,863.5,864.332,In --
1974.73-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,864.332,868.165,The minimum lot size?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,868.165,872.919,"In terms of minimum lot size, it's roughly 20,000 square feet, Your Honor."
1974.73-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,872.919,874.536,Half an acre?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,874.536,877.53,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-2024,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,894.411,896.171,Who are the experts?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,896.171,904.016,The experts are city planners who have filed an affidavit on behalf of the petitioners.
1974.73-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,907.064,910.711,What other qualifications could tell Penfield what they ought to have?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,910.711,919.537,"Well, these are persons who actually are involved in drafting of ordinances, involved in the study of zoning ordinances."
1974.73-2024,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,952.463,954.343,Who are these experts?

1974.73-2024,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1020.465,1025.998,And their expertise in the Constitution is what?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1025.998,1027.368,Their --
1974.73-2024,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1027.368,1030.512,Or should I say if any.
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1030.512,1036.854,They examine this ordinance from the standpoint of the health and safety factors --
1974.73-2024,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1036.854,1038.351,They don't have to be judges.
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1038.351,1042.243,They don't have to be experts in the Constitution.
1974.73-2024,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1042.243,1054.244,Are you suggesting that there is something inherently wrong or undesirable for people who want to have a lot that's a half acre or an acre or two acres on which they rear their families?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1054.244,1055.771,That is not inherently wrong.
1974.73-2024,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1056.543,1060.496,What do the people do want that kind of space?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1060.496,1069.532,"Well, there's nothing in this case that would prevent those persons freely owning that kind of property."
1974.73-2024,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1101.22,1106.963,Any of the single family homes owned by members of a racial minority?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1106.963,1112.915,"The record doesn't address itself to that specifically, Your Honor."
1974.73-2024,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1152.098,1163.799,"I gather, it's not suggested that a one -- a member of racial minority who can afford it, even one of the most expensive of the houses is precluded from building or buying one --"
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1163.799,1164.152,Well --
1974.73-2024,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1164.152,1165.559,-- by the ordinance.
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1165.559,1167.948,"No, not on its face."
1974.73-2024,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1194.652,1196.562,The class is just to minority groups.
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1200.634,1206.556,"Well, Your Honor that is the practical effect of this ordinance."
1974.73-2024,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1206.556,1211.646,"Aren't they -- weren't -- white and the black of same income have the same problem, wouldn't they?"
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1211.646,1212.658,"Well, --"
1974.73-2024,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1212.658,1216.155,-- boarding a house such only they can do?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1216.155,1218.191,"Arguably so, Your Honor."
1974.73-2024,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1219.023,1221.209,"Arguably is -- well, tell me why it isn't so?"
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1221.209,1231.323,"Well, in the last analysis, our allegations are the ordinance is aimed at minorities, blacks and Spanish Americans and in fact, the studies of its applications --"
1974.73-2024,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1231.323,1231.976,That is what I asked you.
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1237.868,1244.814,"Yes, but the impact of the ordinance is on the racial minority, the black and the Spanish Americans."
1974.73-2024,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1244.814,1247.898,Why is the impact on them anymore than on a poor white?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1247.898,1258.266,"Well, those are the persons who are predominantly seeking this housing and against which the ordinance primarily excludes."
1974.73-2024,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1258.266,1263.236,What evidence do you have that the blacks or the poor blacks and not poor whites were excluded?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1263.236,1279.192,"Well, the first evidence, Your Honor, is the housing study of Monroe County which was conducted 1970 which indicated that the primary motivation for the exclusion of this type housing is to exclude blacks."
1974.73-2024,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1289.308,1299.482,"I take it you say that in any event, the allegation and all we have is the allegations and if the standing is established and you got the burden of proving that."
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1299.482,1301.003,"Certainly, Your Honor, that's precisely the --"
1974.73-2024,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1301.003,1306.446,"Under the rules, do you regard that is well pleaded fact or is it a conclusion?"
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1306.446,1308.602,"Well, those are the allegations, Your Honor."
1974.73-2024,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1308.602,1311.051,"Well, is it a well pleaded fact --"
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1311.051,1311.231,Yes.
1974.73-2024,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1311.231,1311.974,-- under the rule?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1311.974,1314.752,That -- that the motivation is --
1974.73-2024,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1314.752,1317.237,Is it not an opinion?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1317.237,1326.429,"No, I think it's a matter of fact which evidence can be adduced."
1974.73-2024,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1326.429,1331.699,"Are there any Negro that can buy $21,000.00 houses in Rochester?"
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1334.507,1337.711,"No, Your Honor, no."
1974.73-2024,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1337.711,1342.615,"Well, yes, there are, are there not in the Rochester community?"
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1342.615,1346.388,"That could by to accounts costing $21,000.00 if that was the question."
1974.73-2024,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1346.388,1348.388,In Penfield?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1348.388,1350.244,In the City of Rochester was questioned.
1974.73-2024,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1350.244,1352.699,"No, no, in this town right here."
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1352.699,1353.328,In Penfield?
1974.73-2024,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1353.328,1354.945,Yes.
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1354.945,1358.472,"There again, I don't think the record speaks particularly to that question, Your Honor."
1974.73-2024,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1358.472,1365.412,"Well, is there anything in the record that shows that there's no Negro in the Rochester area that can afford the $21,000.00 house, the answer is no."
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1365.412,1365.951,No.
1974.73-2024,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1365.951,1369.334,"Because if it was in the record, it wouldn't be true."
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1369.334,1369.903,Right.
1974.73-2024,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1369.903,1377.987,"So, it is true that the fact that $21,000.00-limit does not exclude all Negroes."
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1377.987,1379.029,"Not all, no, Your Honor."
1974.73-2024,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1379.029,1381.179,It does not.
1974.73-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1381.179,1405.484,"Mrs. Logan-Baldwin, supposing that we were to rule in your favor on standing in the Second Circuit or the District Court were to rule on your favor on the constitutional question, as a result of that ruling, would there be any identifiable parcel of land or building that would be then available for your clients?"
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1405.484,1406.76,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1407.503,1411.15,Can you tell us from the record what the parcel would be?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1411.15,1420.006,"Well, the record has a report of the Town of Penfield which examines its total land area."
1974.73-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1420.006,1424.437,I mean simply as a result of the ruling that I've describe.
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1429.078,1434.348,"Well, yes Your Honor, there have been several proposals that we've talked about."
1974.73-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1435.18,1437.456,Are they still pending?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1437.456,1444.845,There are some so-called Plan Unit Development proposals that are in some stage of being processed.
1974.73-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1444.845,1449.011,But it -- does the person own the land or have an option on the land?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1449.011,1456.007,"In the case of Plan Unit Developments, there is actually ownership or options and those could proceed."
1974.73-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1505.693,1511.951,"Well, doesn't it grant a special use permit to give a Plan Unit Development under the Town of Penfield?"
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1511.951,1516.167,"Well, there's a special -- an especially cumbersome process you might say."
1974.73-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1516.167,1520.023,"You can surely answer that yes or no, can't you?"
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1521.221,1523.011,"Yes, I think that's a special use."
1974.73-2024,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1523.011,1530.077,And then what you're complaining about is that the board refused to grant a special use permit?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1530.077,1536.065,"Well, they have not processed completely these Plan Unit Development applications."
1974.73-2024,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1551.002,1586.778,"On the thesis that you advanced here, I suppose that if there were an area in an 20 miles or 30 miles out of a large city which was laid out for minimum 10-acre lots, 10-acre tracks for people who wanted to have a lot of space and perhaps ponies for their children and what not, that would be vulnerable to the constitutional attack you made as soon as the low income housing began to press up against that."
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1586.778,1590.934,"Well, Your Honor again, I don't think that case reaches this."
1974.73-2024,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1591.946,1595.383,The difference in principle from what you're advocating here?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1595.383,1596.012,No.
1974.73-2024,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1607.617,1621.683,"Well of course, if 10,000 -- if 20,000 square feet can be made out as exclusionary, then 10 acres very clearly would be more exclusionary, would it not?"
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1621.683,1623.542,"Well, yes."
1974.73-2024,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1653.236,1660.535,"The sign that said minorities with less than $21,000.00 are not allowed?"
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1660.535,1662.691,"Well, again Your Honor --"
1974.73-2024,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1662.691,1665.559,Are you on the racial point or the money point?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1665.559,1667.984,"Well, Your Honor, we're on the racial point."
1974.73-2024,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1688.457,1693.301,"Can a white person build anything out there for less than $21,000.00?"
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1693.301,1694.14,No.
1974.73-2024,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1694.14,1695.631,Nobody had.
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1695.631,1698.146,It is -- it's totally exclusionary.
1974.73-2024,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1699.697,1702.446,Are there any Negroes out there at all?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1702.446,1703.368,At all?
1974.73-2024,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1703.368,1704.637,You said there was so.
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1704.637,1706.692,There are 60 according to the census.
1974.73-2024,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1706.692,1706.896,Are they --
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1706.896,1709.375,"60 out of 23,000."
1974.73-2024,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1709.375,1712.309,Are they living in the homes?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1712.309,1718.177,"The record doesn't show where those 60 and who those 60 are, Your Honor."
1974.73-2024,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1718.177,1719.136,May I ask a question?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1719.136,1720.328,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-2024,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1720.328,1726.879,"At the time they complaint was filed, Mr. Ortiz worked in Penfield?"
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1726.879,1728.34,That's correct.
1974.73-2024,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1728.34,1733.819,"In May of that year, he gave that job up for one reason or another."
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1733.819,1736.005,Yes.
1974.73-2024,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1736.005,1740.52,Do any of the present plaintiffs worked in Penfield?
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1740.52,1744.281,Mr. Ortiz was the only person who worked in Penfield.
1974.73-2024,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1760.946,1761.15,Very well.
1974.73-2024,0,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,1761.15,1764.887,Thank you.
1974.73-2024,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1764.887,1766.138,Mr. Hartman.
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,1766.138,1771.647,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1974.73-2024,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1865.149,1866.161,Including individuals?
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,1866.161,1870.377,"Individual plaintiff, yes Your Honor, which I'd like to treat first."
1974.73-2024,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2283.616,2300.383,Is the record clear one way or another as to whether one of the reasons that this organization was turned down was because it wanted to build houses on lots that were smaller than provided for in the zoning ordinance?
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2300.383,2303.251,"The decision is in the record, Your Honor, yes sir."
1974.73-2024,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2309.658,2315.886,"Well, I know but you still haven't answered my question I gather."
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2315.886,2323.724,I don't know that it's because of they wanted to build a housing of a greater density and would ordinarily be allowed.
1974.73-2024,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2324.922,2329.048,"Well, what was the basis for saying that their project wouldn't be consonant with the surroundings?"
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2329.048,2338.862,I think because it was for higher density multifamily housing in a area that was surrounded by residential single-family now.
1974.73-2024,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2338.862,2339.82,Is that clear in the record?
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2339.82,2340.868,"It should be clear in the record, Your Honor."
1974.73-2024,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2340.868,2369.885,"Well now, if an organization applies for variance to build other than a single-family dwellings on lots of specified size and it's turned down and it -- I suppose it would have had at that point to say standing to litigate in the state court as to whether the zoning board decided correctly."
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2369.885,2373.508,It has two methods it can use in New York state courts.
1974.73-2024,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2388.847,2390.518,"Well, it would have a personal stake here?"
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2390.518,2391.231,"Oh, yes."
1974.73-2024,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2392.243,2399.033,"What across the street with federal court had said that, I've been heard here by zoning ordinance that's unconstitutional?"
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2405.525,2412.601,"He may have standing in the federal court if he raises a federal constitutional issue, certainly."
1974.73-2024,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2430.094,2433.088,"Not racially discriminatory reasons, but because --"
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2433.088,2433.837,"Well, the federal --"
1974.73-2024,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2433.837,2438.262,-- because I wanted to build higher density housing in the zoning --
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2438.262,2440.059,"No, then he would not have standing."
1974.73-2024,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2441.999,2456.161,"I know, but he turned -- he was denied of his permit for that reason, and he goes and says “the zoning ordinance is unconstitutional, and two have denied me, this is unconstitutional”."
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2457.592,2462.083,"Well, he would if he raised the valid constitutional question under the Federal Constitution."
1974.73-2024,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2471.305,2473.964,"Well, I gather your argument anyway is he didn't do it."
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2473.964,2474.407,He didn't do it.
1974.73-2024,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2474.407,2477.581,"That this association of which Penfield was a member, that's he attempted to do it, is that it?"
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2477.581,2480.12,"Right, that's correct, that's correct Your Honor."
1974.73-2024,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2480.12,2491.342,Aren't your little confusing standing with valid defense to the constitutional claim in answer to Justice White's question.
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2501.276,2504.27,"Yes, yes Your Honor, they are separate."
1974.73-2024,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2519.21,2531.126,"You're saying that if Penfield Homes had gone over to the federal court right after they were denied and said this particular application was denied for this reason, they would have standing?"
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2531.126,2532.257,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-2024,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2532.257,2534.115,Regardless of the merits that are constitutional --
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2534.115,2548.6,"That's right, they would have standing in that case, but in this record, there is no instance of that and I say an associate -- can an association -- there are association case have been brought and it's been sustained and association can bring a case in certain circumstances."
1974.73-2024,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2562.427,2572.451,"In this connection, now that we've already interrupted you, there is this paramount of talk in some of the amicus briefs about Title 8 of the ‘68 Act."
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2572.451,2572.744,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-2024,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2572.744,2576.936,Is there any allegation whatsoever in the complaint about Title 8?
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2576.936,2578.134,Not to my reading of the complaint.
1974.73-2024,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2578.134,2583.098,Was it considered by the courts below?
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2583.098,2588.577,"Not to my knowledge, Your Honor."
1974.73-2024,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2674.053,2677.706,(Voice overlap) to what members?
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2677.706,2680.993,"Any -- well, Metro-Act, there's a lot of people who were interested in housing."
1974.73-2024,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2688.718,2691.676,But it's an organization of individuals?
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2691.676,2692.245,"Yes, Your Honor."
1974.73-2024,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2692.245,2692.808,Not of association --
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2692.808,2696.155,"No, no, council is of associations."
1974.73-2024,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2716.754,2729.392,"-- for permission to buy and develop his own home below $21,000.00 and it has been denied, do I understand you to say they have a right of action?"
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2729.392,2731.272,"No, I said he -- if he'd applied --"
1974.73-2024,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2731.272,2734.925,"Well, you said this group has a right or action."
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2734.925,2736.745,I said that group doesn't have a right of action.
1974.73-2024,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2736.745,2738.961,Didn't you say that the group -- what's the name of it --
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2738.961,2740.362,"Oh, that Penfield Homes."
1974.73-2024,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2740.686,2741.135,Yeah.
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2741.135,2744.662,If Mr. -- I said that they would have standing if they --
1974.73-2024,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2744.662,2746.572,But was Ortiz has standing.
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2746.572,2753.908,"If he made an application on a specific parcel to build the particular home and he was denied, he would have standing."
1974.73-2024,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2753.908,2757.794,Why does he have to have a particular parcel?
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2757.794,2760.758,"Well, a particular application could be a tenant for an apartment."
1974.73-2024,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2764.83,2769.142,So you deny him standing because he didn't first go to the zoning board.
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2769.142,2769.914,That's right.
1974.73-2024,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2793.118,2801.802,"Well, what you say is that if it doesn't buy the land, he has no cause of action, and if he does buy the land, he might have a cause of action."
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2801.802,2806.167,"No, I say if he buys the land, he has a cause of action after he has applied for the relief."
1974.73-2024,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2806.167,2809.161,But he has put a whole lot of money for that.
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2809.161,2812.365,"But Metro-Act doesn't have to put up money for that, Your Honor."
1974.73-2024,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2812.365,2815.233,We'll talk about Ortiz for the time being.
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2818.018,2819.18,That's correct.
1974.73-2024,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2837.132,2841.204,You can't do that without owning a piece of land.
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2841.204,2843.001,I would think so.
1974.73-2024,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2843.001,2844.672,He could make the application.
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2844.672,2852.031,"I see no reason actually and I tell you, if he's denied a hearing on the application; that might give him some kind of standing."
1974.73-2024,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2852.031,2852.929,Mr. Hartman.
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2852.929,2853.858,"Yes, yes Your Honor."
1974.73-2024,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2853.858,2861.187,Will you describe briefly the procedure in Penfield for one who wants to build the house?
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2864.421,2870.313,He applies for -- he first had to submit a site plan if it's more than one house or subdivision plan to the planning board.

1974.73-2024,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2930.937,2937.693,How broad is a jurisdiction to grant variances?
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,2937.693,2942.033,It's discretion -- great deal as discretionary.
1974.73-2024,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3024.519,3028.345,Does the ordinance permit an option or to make any application for variances?

1974.73-2024,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3324.432,3343.588,"Suppose I go at Penfield, and I shop for a house and read the papers, look at the advertisements, talk to the dealers, and I just discover there is not house in found that I can afford because there's just not kind of housing around."
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,3351.965,3352.444,That's right.

1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,3379.493,3380.9,I don't think you have it.
1974.73-2024,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3382.637,3386.104,"But if you did, some of these individuals would have here?"
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,3386.104,3386.883,"Excuse me, Your Honor."
1974.73-2024,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3387.655,3391.787,"If that would suffice for standing, then some of these individuals would have standing."
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,3391.787,3393.344,"I don't know, I don't think they've gone that far."
1974.73-2024,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3393.344,3394.781,They didn't even go to Penfield.
1974.73-2024,1,30944,james_h_hartman,,3394.781,3396.299,That's right.
1974.73-2024,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3417.141,3420.818,I know what had happen to that cause of action.

1974.73-2024,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3425.602,3428.472,May I ask the question.
1974.73-2024,2,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,3440.093,3442.249,Thank you.
1974.73-2024,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3442.249,3449.22,Are you serious about that you want an injunction compelling the city council to enact the law?
1974.73-2024,2,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,3449.22,3453.974,"Your Honor, I think again, the question here is standing."
1974.73-2024,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3480.037,3483.061,There are some cities without any zoning laws at all.
1974.73-2024,2,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,3483.061,3484.738,"That would be true, Your Honor."
1974.73-2024,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3484.738,3486.888,"Houston, Texas."
1974.73-2024,2,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,3486.888,3492.032,I think again the focus and the question for this Court is standing.
1974.73-2024,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3531.152,3536.179,I understand that Ortiz did try to put up anything at all.
1974.73-2024,2,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,3536.179,3537.496,"No, that's not correct."
1974.73-2024,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3546.538,3551.658,Board at Penfield or any other place in the state did he apply for relief.
1974.73-2024,2,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,3551.658,3554.772,"Well, he didn't go to the Zoning Board of Appeals, he look for houses --"
1974.73-2024,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3554.772,3556.862,Did he apply to any state board?
1974.73-2024,2,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,3556.862,3558.383,Not any state board.
1974.73-2024,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3558.383,3560.413,City board or any other official?
1974.73-2024,2,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,3560.413,3561.724,"No, and no ordinance --"
1974.73-2024,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3561.724,3564.622,Is that true it's been implied to any official of any kind?
1974.73-2024,2,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,3564.622,3573.724,And no ordinary individual would have any relief to go to Zoning Board of Appeals to ask them to give him a particular house or anything like that.
1974.73-2024,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3606.581,3616.964,"(Voice Overlap) Again, Mrs. Baldwin, I think you have said indirectly that there are folks here who own or have options upon."
1974.73-2024,2,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,3616.964,3621.725,"There have -- there are in the record, builders applications --"
1974.73-2024,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3621.725,3625.581,That is among the plaintiffs in this suit or the applicants for --
1974.73-2024,2,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,3625.581,3629.234,They are members of organizations who are plaintiffs Your Honor.
1974.73-2024,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3630.905,3632.725,Can you name particularly?
1974.73-2024,2,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,3632.725,3645.959,"The Penfield Better Homes is a member of the Housing Council which is a plaintiff, and Rochester Home Builders have constructed 80% of the housing in the Town of Penfield over the last 15 years."
1974.73-2024,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3645.959,3651.163,Does that one owned or have options upon land in the county?
1974.73-2024,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3686.775,3689.613,How about any of the individual plaintiffs.
1974.73-2024,2,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,3689.613,3696.889,The individual plaintiffs again are represented through associational efforts.
1974.73-2024,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3697.452,3705.47,"But do some of them, some of the individuals whether represented parties or represented by other parties?"
1974.73-2024,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3717.225,3725.847,"Does Rochester Home Builders itself engaged in construction, or is it a trade association whose members engaged in construction?"
1974.73-2024,2,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,3725.847,3741.097,"It is primarily trade association whose members engaged in construction, but it has as its purpose which is set forth in the record to facilitate the construction of housing for the entire community including low moderate income housing."
1974.73-2024,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3741.097,3749.66,"Well, you say it's primarily on an association -- does it secondarily engaged in construction itself?"
1974.73-2024,2,21957,emmelyn_logan_baldwin,,3749.66,3757.085,"No, Your Honor, not to my knowledge and I don't think the record discloses that it has."
1974.73-2024,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3757.085,3758.971,The case is submitted.
