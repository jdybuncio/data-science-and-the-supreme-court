2018.17-5554,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.72,"We'll hear argument first this morning in Case 17-5554, Stokeling versus United States. Ms. Bryn."
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,8.72,28.28,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Since the invalidation of the residual clause in 2015, the only way for a state robbery offense to qualify as an ACCA violent felony is if it has violent force as an element."
2018.17-5554,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,36.4,50.04,So your -- your position is no robbery conviction in Florida counts under the Armed Career Criminal offense? A robbery in Florida is out entirely?
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,50.04,51.96,Because of the categorical approach.
2018.17-5554,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,57.8,58.84,I'm sorry.
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,67.88,78.2,"In the Florida statute, yes, because armed robbery in Florida does not require using or brandishing or displaying or even representing that one has a weapon."
2018.17-5554,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,128.2,139.68,"I actually tried that, holding, since I knew this was -- this was your most -- this was your most important case, and I held on to a dollar bill and asked each of my law clerks to try to pull it out of my hand."
2018.17-5554,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,152.92,155.72,"-- a lot of force, more than you might think."
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,155.72,175.24,"I don't think, Your Honor, that it requires a substantial degree of force as this Court defined that in Curtis Johnson using the adjectives, all of which connote actual violence, which are severe force, extreme, furious, vehement, strong, and powerful force. Clearly, there is some force involved."
2018.17-5554,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,175.24,183.6,"Well, it also said -- it also said -- and this, of course, is the language your friend on the other side stresses -- capable of causing physical pain or injury."
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,189.68,216.64,"The -- the phrase ""force capable of causing pain or injury"" has to be understood in context, and it is explaining violent force in the context of a violent felony definition. The Court emphasized the word ""violence"" by italicizing it, and then the Court gave all of these ordinary dictionary definitions of ""violence"" or ""violent"" which are extreme force, vehement, furious force. So I --"
2018.17-5554,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,216.64,223.2,"Do you think that -- do you think that shoving, grabbing, and pinching count as physical force under ACCA?"
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,223.2,228.08,"Your Honor, the determination under ACCA cannot be made in a vacuum."
2018.17-5554,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,252.76,256.88,"Well, I thought under the categorical approach, you have to look at the category."
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,260.0,260.16,"Well, they have --"
2018.17-5554,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,260.16,266.52,"Does pinching, for example, constitute physical force sufficient to -- to activate ACCA?"
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,266.52,271.8,The categorical approach actually does not require you to look at a category.
2018.17-5554,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,279.72,285.32,"I'm sorry, we used the example of a tap on the shoulder not being sufficient force."
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,288.64,289.12,Right.
2018.17-5554,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,289.12,296.0,"Is a pinch, an ordinary pinch -- let's not talk about an extraordinary -- (Laughter.)"
2018.17-5554,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,296.0,300.52,-- pulling of the ears that a parent might sometimes do.
2018.17-5554,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,304.56,311.72,"Is that sufficient force? If we said a tap on the shoulder couldn't be, why could a pinch be?"
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,311.72,318.6,I -- I think the -- the answer is looking at the -- the other side of the equation from what a substantial degree of force is.
2018.17-5554,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,334.36,334.44,You've --
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,334.44,335.2,I don't think a pinch --
2018.17-5554,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,335.2,358.76,"-- you've said the reasonable -- and I do understand your point, which is, from personal experience, if you tap an injured shoulder, it could cause injury. It's capable of causing physical pain and injury. But we said, in the normal course of circumstances, a tap on the shoulder would not -- is not capable of producing injury."
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,359.2,360.4,Nor would a pinch.
2018.17-5554,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,360.4,361.4,I'm sorry? What?
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,361.4,363.48,Nor would a pinch in normal circumstances.
2018.17-5554,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,363.48,364.44,And that's the point.
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,375.8,382.56,The -- the reason that we have articulated reasonably expected is to contrast with an outlier case.
2018.17-5554,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,398.2,398.88,"Well, this has --"
2018.17-5554,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,398.88,425.16,"Ms. Bryn, I wonder if you could say a bit more about this reasonable expectation standard, because I'm not sure it does all that much that's different from what the government's standard does. I mean, if you take something like grabbing money out of a hand and say could that reasonably be expected to cause pain or injury, well, maybe some injury, maybe a bruise, maybe a little scratch, maybe a little cut. And, similarly, even a pinch."
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,436.6,450.24,"Because I think the categorical approach requires you to look at real cases, and our real cases involve this minimal pulling or tugging action that resulted in no pain or injury."
2018.17-5554,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,451.92,477.32,"That -- that could be in a particular case, but don't you have to take the conduct in -- in general? And particularly Justice Alito's question about pinching, there are some people who have thin skin and bruise very easily, and a pinch would probably be sufficient to cause bruising, actual injury."
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,477.32,477.6,Right.
2018.17-5554,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,522.96,524.4,But my question wasn't that.
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,559.44,595.6,"So that's why we -- we have said, number one, that whether there is an actual pain or injury in the actual reported cases, what has been prosecuted by the state? Has the state prosecuted for no injury or for exceedingly minor injuries? In Florida, they prosecute for no injury. So even though it is possible to hypothesize a case where the same conduct might cause injury, I mean, we think those are outlier cases because the real cases that resulted in prosecution in our state have not resulted in injury."
2018.17-5554,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,595.6,596.0,How -- how --
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,596.0,597.12,We're not saying it can never happen.
2018.17-5554,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,597.12,611.08,-- how -- how then would you -- you -- would you describe an ACCA qualifying physical force? Can you give us your definition?
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,611.08,611.4,Yes.
2018.17-5554,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,635.24,660.2,"In Taylor, the Court said that the revision of ACCA to include the elements clause expanded the predicate offenses beyond just robbery and burglary. But we are told that your reading of the statute would knock out robbery offenses in 30 to 40 case -- in 30 to 40 states. What is your response to that? Does that seem -- does it seem likely that that's what Congress was intending to do?"
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,660.2,663.4,"Well, there -- there are two parts of that question."
2018.17-5554,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,690.36,696.84,"So your answer -- your answer is that they thought that robbery was going to be covered by the residual clause, is that right?"
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,696.84,700.84,They wrote language that would have covered it under the residual clause.
2018.17-5554,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,705.8,723.92,"Counsel, I'm stuck there too, because if Congress uses the word robbery, we wouldn't normally think that it's excluding more than half the states' statutes that are defining robbery. That -- that -- that just seems like a strike against the statutory reading you're asking us to adopt."
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,728.32,728.76,"Well, it --"
2018.17-5554,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,728.76,732.68,-- and we've said it used it in the ordinary sense at the time of adoption.
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,740.0,742.48,"Well, again, two answers to that question."
2018.17-5554,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,778.32,779.44,"Well, how many states do you think --"
2018.17-5554,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,779.44,781.2,I don't understand your --
2018.17-5554,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,781.2,805.76,"-- how many states do you think will be knocked out? Because, I mean, Florida seems as though it's out of luck because both -- it can't pick up under armed robbery what it loses under unarmed robbery for the reason that you said earlier. Presumably, there are other states in which armed robbery would count as -- as a -- as -- as under the -- this clause."
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,815.56,817.68,I -- I would say four or less.
2018.17-5554,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,817.68,818.32,Four or less?
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,818.32,819.48,I would say four or less --
2018.17-5554,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,819.48,820.28,Why is that?
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,820.28,836.64,"-- would have no form of robbery because there are, first of all, just from my review, and I'm not an authority on every state, but from my review, there are not many states that have the trifecta that Florida has. And let me say what that is."
2018.17-5554,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,881.8,891.72,"Well, in how many states would common law robbery, would simple robbery, not armed robbery or an aggravated form of robbery, be knocked out by your understanding of the statute?"
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,891.72,895.68,"So, again, it -- it's -- it's hard to give an actual number."
2018.17-5554,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,921.24,928.4,"So you think that in -- in applying the categorical approach here, it's necessary to look to the cases that are prosecuted?"
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,928.4,929.16,"Yes, I think --"
2018.17-5554,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,929.16,935.88,"To -- you have to look to -- to -- beyond the statute, you have to look to prosecutorial policies and practices?"
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,935.88,946.64,"That -- that's what the Court said in Duenas-Alvarez, to determine if a statute can be or has been applied to non-violent, non-generic conduct or in an overbroad way."
2018.17-5554,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,950.44,956.56,"Well, even if the statute on its face includes that kind of conduct?"
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,956.56,961.36,"The statute -- well, first of all, the Florida statute on its face does not even include resistance."
2018.17-5554,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1044.84,1066.28,"Counsel, let's say we -- we disagree with your understanding of Duenas, and we think that if it's clear on the face of a statute that conduct is encompassed. Under the elements approach in Taylor, then that's how we would define it. Does that alter the number of states that you think would be knocked out under your approach?"
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,1066.28,1085.24,"Well, I've already knocked out, I -- I believe, at least 10 states on -- in my approach by reporting in our appendix the full language of the statute that the government excerpted out of its own appendix. So statutes which make clear on the face of the statute that violence can be contact."
2018.17-5554,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1132.24,1145.04,"But -- but, counsel -- counsel, in Curtis Johnson, you rely heavily on the general statements of the Court, but the application of those general statements was to something very specific: battery and a mere tap on the shoulder."
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,1167.32,1178.72,Because what the Court did before applying the standard to the statute -- to the Florida battery statute was to definitively construe the words that --
2018.17-5554,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1178.72,1179.56,"Well, but it -- but it's --"
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,1179.56,1183.56,-- Congress used in the elements clause. Go ahead.
2018.17-5554,0,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,1183.56,1188.88,"But it -- as you point out, it's -- it's a bit general, those statements, that language."
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,1214.88,1223.64,"Your -- Your Honor, I -- I disagree with that, because I believe that the standard the -- the Court set forth was a violent felony definition."
2018.17-5554,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1294.4,1297.16,But the statutory term is physical force.
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,1297.16,1298.24,Right.
2018.17-5554,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1298.24,1331.4,"And in the ordinary understanding of that, force sufficient to overcome resistance would be physical force. The holding in Curtis Johnson was what Justice Kavanaugh described, battery -- the touching that is necessary for a battery is not physical force; any unwanted touching satisfies common law battery. Now, if we go beyond that, you have -- it would be necessary to quantify the degree of physical force that's required, like how many pounds per square inch."
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,1334.36,1341.44,"The -- the standard that the Court set in Curtis Johnson, I believe, is a substantial degree in force and as --"
2018.17-5554,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1341.44,1343.72,So what is a substantial degree of force?
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,1343.72,1352.44,"So the -- as the Chief Justice stated in -- most recently in Dimaya, that substantial standards are found all through the law."
2018.17-5554,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1354.52,1357.04,How many votes did that get in Dimaya? (Laughter.)
2018.17-5554,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1357.04,1358.96,Not five. (Laughter.)
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,1358.96,1361.52,The -- the majority in Dimaya --
2018.17-5554,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1361.52,1363.16,The majority agreed with that point.
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,1363.16,1372.32,"Yes, the majority in Dimaya actually said that ""substantial"" is not a difficult term to apply at all when it's being applied to real-world conduct."
2018.17-5554,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1388.32,1392.84,"Well, do you think there could not be substantial force unless it actually causes pain or injury?"
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,1392.84,1395.0,"No, I'm not -- I'm not saying that either."
2018.17-5554,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1411.0,1413.88,But you think this depends on a case-by-case determination?
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,1413.88,1414.92,No.
2018.17-5554,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1428.12,1433.8,But you -- you have to hypothesize a particular type of robber and a particular type of victim.
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,1469.04,1469.68,Well --
2018.17-5554,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1469.68,1475.56,So I have no idea how to imagine that the -- the typical robber and the typical victim.
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,1475.56,1476.28,"Well, I can't --"
2018.17-5554,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1476.28,1478.0,Who are these people? Can you describe them for me?
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,1478.0,1483.84,I -- I don't think that our test or the standard requires imagining a typical victim.
2018.17-5554,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1491.84,1492.24,Okay.
2018.17-5554,0,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,1499.6,1504.84,Someone that doesn't have any of those unique characteristics that you just described.
2018.17-5554,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1573.64,1580.92,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Liu."
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1580.92,1591.72,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: For centuries, the common law has provided a basis to distinguish violent takings of property from non-violent takings."
2018.17-5554,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1639.2,1662.28,"Mr. -- Mr. Liu, could I just ask what you understand the Florida cases to be saying? So I'll give you a hypo to elucidate that. So I'm walking down the street and I'm carrying a handbag with a strap over my shoulder, and, as everybody knows, the way you carry that is you essentially grab on to the strap."
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1677.16,1677.92,It -- it depends.
2018.17-5554,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1687.92,1689.48,"No, I want -- well, you can illustrate it, sure --"
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1689.48,1690.24,"Well, I -- I think the --"
2018.17-5554,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1690.24,1691.84,"-- but, I mean, I want an answer to my hypothetical."
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1691.84,1707.68,"-- I think the facts you described are not too different from the facts of Rigell, and I think that is a case where the Florida courts did conclude that the force used was sufficient. There, the -- the -- the victim had a bag on his shoulder -- on her shoulder."
2018.17-5554,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1718.6,1719.08,"Yeah, so --"
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1719.08,1720.64,And the purse -- the strap of the purse --
2018.17-5554,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1720.64,1727.28,"-- I was actually taking that out, because, you know, I'm -- I'm -- I'm holding on to the bag, so you're going to need some force to get it."
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1732.56,1734.04,Yes.
2018.17-5554,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1734.04,1735.08,Okay.
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1741.68,1764.32,"I don't -- I don't think so. And I'll give you a case that illustrates that. A case called RP, which is cited in the Robinson case -- that's sort of the seminal case -- involves someone who grabbed a camera that was hanging off someone's shoulder, and that did not rise to the -- to the level of force necessary for robbery. And the difference between the two cases is the added element of violence."
2018.17-5554,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1766.64,1766.84,Right.
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1796.48,1808.84,And I think what's important to remember about even that case is that there is force on the one hand being applied by the victim which is being met by force on the other being applied by the defendant.
2018.17-5554,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1813.88,1814.76,But the problem is --
2018.17-5554,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1814.76,1816.84,"Yeah, I mean -- I'm sorry."
2018.17-5554,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1816.84,1818.48,I'm sorry.
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1841.08,1842.52,I don't think that's --
2018.17-5554,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1842.52,1844.44,-- that's the slightest force.
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1844.44,1864.84,"Well, but I think what's -- what's important to keep in mind -- I guess this finishes my answer to Justice Kagan -- is that what is inherent in the offense every time it occurs in Florida is this violent contest over a piece of property. And I think it's natural to conceive of the force necessary to prevail in such a contest as force capable of causing --"
2018.17-5554,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1864.84,1867.48,But that's not the words the Court has used.
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1887.12,1895.0,"Well, I think it's true that what -- that the -- that the resistance can be of any degree, but I think you have to view that resistance --"
2018.17-5554,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1895.0,1897.4,So the force can be of any degree?
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1897.4,1902.6,"Well, but I think what's key is -- is the context in which that interaction is occurring."
2018.17-5554,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1909.92,1916.0,"No, because what you have is slight force over slight -- slight resistance and slight force to overcome it."
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1916.0,1916.2,"Well, you're -- you're --"
2018.17-5554,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1916.2,1933.16,"How do you get past that into that it's a tug of war? I mean, some people grab you by your arm and you just pull it away, and it doesn't necessarily have to be a very forceful pulling away."
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1933.16,1941.96,"Well, this -- this sort of interaction where force is met by force has been understood by the common law since Blackstone as being violent."
2018.17-5554,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1941.96,1969.88,"But we have to deal with the Florida statute and how that -- how the Florida court, Supreme Court, understands the use, what -- what violent force is, what -- what its own statute requires. And the Florida Supreme Court has used words like robbery can be committed with any degree of force."
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,1974.68,1983.8,"Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think that quote comes from a case called McCloud from 1976 -- I mean from 1972."
2018.17-5554,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,1997.96,2015.0,"Well, counsel, I'm not sure that quite solves the problem, though, because the statute on its face says not just force or violence or assault, but it says ""or putting in fear."" That is sufficient to constitute robbery in Florida."
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2015.0,2015.44,Right.
2018.17-5554,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2015.44,2045.32,"And Robinson I'm not sure helps you very much because I think it's susceptible to a reading of saying, in the cases of purse snatching where force is alleged as the mode for creating a robbery, then you need whatever -- whatever you've been talking about with Justice Kagan and Justice Sotomayor. But I don't read Robinson as suggesting force is the only way of establishing robbery under Florida or doing anything to eliminate the disjunctive language of ""or putting in fear."""
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2045.32,2046.12,Justice Gorsuch --
2018.17-5554,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2046.12,2047.36,What do I do about that?
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2047.36,2050.24,"-- in Florida, there are two ways to commit robbery."
2018.17-5554,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2067.92,2070.48,I -- I don't care what Petitioner has challenged. (Laughter.)
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2070.48,2071.04,And that's --
2018.17-5554,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2071.04,2075.76,I'm asking you why isn't that a problem under Taylor for the government in this case?
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2075.76,2082.64,"Because the Florida courts have construed ""putting in fear"" to mean a fear of bodily injury."
2018.17-5554,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2083.16,2087.96,"But fear of force is not the same thing as force, right?"
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2087.96,2089.08,That's -- that's correct. So we look at the text --
2018.17-5554,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2089.08,2090.12,So why don't you lose?
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2090.12,2106.32,So we look at the text of the Armed Career Criminal Act and it says: Any -- any felony offense that has as an element the use or threatened use of force. And that's why there hasn't been any debate about why the putting in fear prong satisfies the elements.
2018.17-5554,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2106.32,2112.32,So you think the putting in fear prong is always and can only be accomplished by threats of force?
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2112.32,2114.44,"By -- exactly, by threats of putting --"
2018.17-5554,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2114.44,2119.52,Do you know that -- do we know that's right? Is there any evidence that that's right?
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2119.52,2126.84,"Well, that -- that is how the statute has been construed, as -- as applying to threats to cause bodily harm."
2018.17-5554,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2126.84,2130.72,By -- by what -- what authority? Robinson isn't -- Robinson doesn't do that.
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2130.72,2136.12,It's a case we cite in the beginning of our argument section called Baldwin versus State that gave that interpretation.
2018.17-5554,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2160.28,2180.72,"Mr. Liu, could I ask before you do that, you keep referring to the common law, but I had thought that the whole structure of the Curtis Johnson opinion is to say, well, we have this common law definition, but it's in the context of a statute which is trying to identify violent felonies."
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2207.12,2209.92,"Well, I think it's relevant for a number of reasons."
2018.17-5554,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2231.96,2233.12,It didn't reference it.
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2237.12,2241.2,And I -- and that's why I -- I think I would return to what I was saying earlier.
2018.17-5554,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2293.92,2335.28,"I guess the ordinary English view is something like, look, when I'm walking down the street and somebody puts a -- a gun in the air and says give me your money, that I know, I understand to be a violent offense. But, when I'm walking down the street and somebody grabs my handbag, I'm not happy about that, but it's -- it just doesn't have that violent aspect of it in ordinary language that I think, you know, beating somebody up does, putting a gun in their face does. And this is a -- a state that defines robbery so broadly that you tell me it basically includes every bag snatcher."
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2335.28,2348.64,"Well, I guess -- I guess what I would say to that is whether -- whether -- you know, what I would say is the key point is what Congress thought, and I -- and I think all the indications are that Congress regarded this as violent."
2018.17-5554,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2348.64,2359.16,"But what is the ""this"" that Congress thought? I mean, in all of these cases, we have to look to whether the state has defined its crime more broadly than the basic offense."
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2359.16,2365.64,"Well, the idea that Florida here is somehow an outlier among common law jurisdictions is just not correct."
2018.17-5554,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2385.88,2389.2,But that was through the residual clause? The --
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2389.2,2390.36,"No, Your Honor."
2018.17-5554,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2419.32,2435.2,"But -- but Curtis Johnson says substantial degree of force, as Justice Kagan points out, and how are we supposed to deal with that language in the Curtis Johnson opinion if we're trying to follow Curtis Johnson strictly?"
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2435.2,2452.36,"Well, Justice Kavanaugh, the force used -- the type of force involved in a Florida robbery or any common law robbery is substantial in two ways Curtis Johnson itself found relevant. The first is this kind of force is force capable of causing physical pain or injury."
2018.17-5554,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2460.36,2469.68,"Could -- force capable of causing physical pain or injury, I mean, it touches capable of causing physical pain or injury when done in the wrong context."
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2491.52,2495.36,"Well, we -- we -- it appears there's common ground here."
2018.17-5554,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2523.44,2524.04,"But, I'm sorry --"
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2524.04,2525.28,-- for centuries.
2018.17-5554,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2525.28,2545.4,"-- you keep using the word ""fight."" But the statute just says the least resistance met by the least force. That's not a fight in my dictionary. The fact that somebody has something and pulls back and you just walk away with it, that's not substantial force."
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2545.4,2558.12,"Oh, it -- it -- it is, because whatever the resistance, the form the resistance that the victim is providing, is being physically overpowered by the defendant. And --"
2018.17-5554,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2558.12,2578.12,"But how does that define it as a substantial force? Even as capable of producing injury, if the example that the Chief used, an elderly victim, just simply can be overcome with no -- virtually no force whatsoever?"
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2578.12,2579.44,"Well, I don't -- I don't --"
2018.17-5554,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2579.44,2583.4,"Then that's not capable of causing injury, even in an elderly person?"
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2583.4,2597.88,"Again -- again, the force shouldn't be measured in some quantitative respect, like foot pounds or force meters. Force does have to be evaluated in the context. And so, yes, in some cases, the degree of resistance may be small."
2018.17-5554,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2597.88,2598.28,All right.
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2621.36,2621.92,Right.
2018.17-5554,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2634.76,2637.2,"No, victim goes over, pickpockets --"
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2637.2,2637.32,Oh.
2018.17-5554,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2637.32,2637.72,I'm sorry.
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2650.36,2650.72,No.
2018.17-5554,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2651.28,2652.16,So what do you think --
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2652.16,2655.64,"-- for one thing, the resistance has to come from the victim to overcome --"
2018.17-5554,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2655.64,2657.8,Not the way I read the statute.
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2667.4,2667.88,Right.
2018.17-5554,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2672.08,2673.72,But it has to be directed at the victim?
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2673.72,2675.2,It has to be directed at --
2018.17-5554,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2675.2,2676.56,If there's a Florida case --
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2676.56,2676.76,Right.
2018.17-5554,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2676.76,2679.28,"-- to the contrary, then do you lose?"
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2679.28,2687.96,"No, because what the ACCA cares about is the use of force without regard to who it's directed against."
2018.17-5554,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2687.96,2697.92,What -- what -- what ACCA cares about -- in Curtis Johnson said we have to determine meaning in context -- they wanted to keep off the street people who were likely to use a gun.
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2697.92,2698.28,Right.
2018.17-5554,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2698.28,2708.76,"And at a broad -- the broadest level, is somebody who engages in a purse snatching with -- with some degree of resistance, is that person -- do you look at that and say, well, that person's likely to use a gun?"
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2708.76,2719.92,"Well, Congress thought so. We know that because Congress adopted this very definition of ""robbery"" in the '84 Act. Robbery, common law robbery, was an original ACCA predicate."
2018.17-5554,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2726.52,2732.8,Why does burglary end up as an enumerated crime and robbery does not when Congress changed the Act?
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2732.8,2752.72,"Because it wasn't necessary to enumerate robbery, given that Congress was taking an element of robbery and making it the basis of the elements clause. By contrast, there was a lot more doubt about whether the ACCA -- the new ACCA without a specific reference to burglary would have covered burglary."
2018.17-5554,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2813.32,2824.08,Ms. -- Ms. Bryn says that her understanding of what Curtis Johnson requires would have a minimal effect on the robbery statutes of the states.
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2826.12,2826.56,No.
2018.17-5554,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2859.04,2868.36,"When you say ""knocked out,"" do you mean everything is knocked out or only the basic robbery offense is knocked out, but that leaves aggravated robbery offenses?"
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2868.36,2885.84,"I say only the basic robbery is knocked out, but I think that's the right focus because we know from the '84 Act Congress was concerned about keeping in basic robbery. You look at the definition in the '84 Act, it's not armed robbery, it's not aggravated robbery; it's simple common law robbery."
2018.17-5554,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2885.84,2888.6,"Let -- let's put that aside for the moment, say we disagree with you."
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2898.0,2899.56,Basic robbery statutes?
2018.17-5554,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2899.56,2899.6,No.
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2900.84,2904.92,"Basic or aggravated, it's -- we don't have the exact number."
2018.17-5554,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,2928.48,2932.96,"But, if they did qualify, then how many states are affected?"
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2932.96,2934.28,I don't have an exact number.
2018.17-5554,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2961.84,2982.88,"The -- the problem I -- I have with that, counsel, and hopefully you can help me with this, is you keep coming back to the -- the -- the belief that Congress wished to or intended to keep in common law robbery in its simple form, but Curtis Johnson expressly rejects the common law definition of force."
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2982.88,2983.52,"No, it --"
2018.17-5554,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2983.52,2983.8,So --
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2983.8,2985.84,-- it rejected the common law definition of force --
2018.17-5554,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2985.84,2986.8,-- what do we do about that?
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,2986.8,2997.76,"-- that came from a misdemeanor offense. What was key in Curtis Johnson was that the key term being defined was ""violent felony."" And so Justice Scalia said it would have been a comical misfit, a mismatch --"
2018.17-5554,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,2997.76,3008.36,"Well, as the dissent pointed out and -- and the majority acknowledged, the misdemeanor/felony line at common law simply meant: One, you're put to death, and the other you're put in prison."
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3017.32,3018.68,"No, robbery was a --"
2018.17-5554,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3018.68,3019.4,-- often.
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3019.4,3022.36,-- robbery was a felony at common law.
2018.17-5554,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3022.36,3023.4,Often it was.
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3041.44,3056.04,"Well, I -- it -- it's not true that Curtis Johnson rejected this -- this -- this definition of ""force."" The definition of ""force"" that Curtis Johnson rejected was one that could be satisfied by the merest touching. And common --"
2018.17-5554,1,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,3056.04,3058.32,Which we acknowledged was the common law definition.
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3058.32,3071.6,"Was the common law definition that came from the misdemeanor offense of battery. Common law robbery, which has a felony definition of force, force overcoming resistance, cannot be satisfied by the merest touching."
2018.17-5554,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3088.52,3106.4,"What do you -- what do you do with the express statement in Curtis Johnson that the word ""violent"" in 924(e)(2)(B) connotes a substantial degree of force?"
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3106.4,3107.8,We -- we have three responses.
2018.17-5554,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3119.4,3144.12,"This really has -- sounds like we're overruling Johnson and reintroducing into the categorical approach this whole notion of what's the normal situation.

2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3144.12,3144.64,And -- and I --

2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3150.48,3155.08,And Curtis Johnson didn't adopt a quantitative measure of force.
2018.17-5554,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3164.16,3166.64,And you're not going to even get to pain --

2018.17-5554,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3166.72,3167.24,-- and suffering.
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3167.24,3170.32,-- but Curtis Johnson made clear that that wasn't the right inquiry.
2018.17-5554,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3194.4,3225.0,"But isn't the standard force sufficient to overcome resistance a quantification? That's a way of quantifying how much force is necessary. So the -- the force that is required for a battery, the merest touching, is -- is not enough, but there has to be a substantial amount, a quantifiable amount, and the quantification is the amount of force necessary to overcome resistance. If you don't adopt that, then I do think you have to get to foot pounds or something like that."
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3225.0,3243.16,"Well, no, that -- that's sort of -- I think I'm agreeing with you more than disagreeing, Justice Alito. I -- I -- I don't think we should measure force in terms of some statistic or -- or -- or, you know, exact degree. I think -- I think the force used has to be understood in context."
2018.17-5554,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3258.36,3273.32,"I guess, Mr. Liu, the problem I'm having in a nutshell is you keep on referring to this as a physical struggle over property, but at the same time, you tell me that if somebody snatches a bag off my shoulder, it's -- it counts as robbery --"
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3273.32,3273.44,"Well, I --"
2018.17-5554,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3273.44,3278.08,"-- under Florida law. And, to me, that is not a physical struggle over property."
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3293.52,3316.88,"And, Justice Kagan, I -- I think we just disagree about what's covered by state law then because I don't think a simple purse snatching or pickpocketing -- those things were the very reason -- was the very reason for Robinson. Robinson, the Florida Supreme Court case, the very reason for it was to clarify that those sorts of things are punished as theft, as larceny, as sudden snatching --"
2018.17-5554,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3316.88,3319.88,But I go back to what your answers to my first questions were.
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3329.2,3329.4,But --
2018.17-5554,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3329.4,3333.28,"And I say that's every bag snatching in America, save a few."
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3333.28,3339.48,"Well, but I think only in a case where there is actual victim resistance, physical resistance to the taking."
2018.17-5554,1,17766,brett_m_kavanaugh,scotus_justice,3358.48,3396.32,"But -- but, counsel, can I -- I say one thing on Curtis Johnson there, which is it says violent force. And if I -- if it stopped there, I think you might have an issue, but then it says ""that is force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person."" And ""capable of"" seems to me much different from what we usually, as Justice Kagan would say, think of as violent force. So maybe -- maybe there's something in Curtis Johnson itself, we've talked a lot about it, but in that one sentence, it says ""violent force"" and it says something else that seems intention with violent force."
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3396.32,3398.64,"Mr. Chief Justice, may I answer?"
2018.17-5554,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3398.64,3399.2,Certainly.
2018.17-5554,1,62593,frederick_liu,,3399.2,3404.28,I think the capable language is a gloss on violent.
2018.17-5554,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3419.64,3425.72,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Bryn, you have four minutes remaining."
2018.17-5554,2,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,3425.72,3432.24,"Thank you. Your Honor, at common law, no physical resistance was even required for robbery."
2018.17-5554,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3554.16,3565.16,"Well, the residual clause referred to ""capable of causing"" -- I'm sorry -- ""a serious risk of physical injury."" So how would common law robbery come within that?"
2018.17-5554,2,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,3565.16,3577.92,"It -- it -- it -- just by the possibility of a confrontation afterwards, which was the way -- which was the standard this Court used for the residual clause crimes, which swept in pickpocketing --"
2018.17-5554,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3577.92,3579.32,"I'm sorry, you think that --"
2018.17-5554,2,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,3579.32,3580.52,-- and all these offenses that Congress --
2018.17-5554,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3580.52,3586.08,-- you think that common law robbery involves a serious risk of physical injury?
2018.17-5554,2,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,3586.08,3586.4,No.
2018.17-5554,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3587.12,3590.8,"Then how would it fall within the residual clause, which is what you just said?"
2018.17-5554,2,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,3590.8,3593.44,"I'm -- I'm -- I'm not saying that, Your Honor."
2018.17-5554,2,63039,brenda_g_bryn,,3645.36,3646.2,Thank you.
2018.17-5554,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3646.2,3647.12,"Thank you, counsel."
