1978.78-808,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,66.072,We'll hear arguments next in Califano against Boles.
1978.78-808,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,66.072,66.732,Mr. Chief Justice --
1978.78-808,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,66.732,71.016,We'll just – we'll wait for the – we'll wait for this crowd to clear.
1978.78-808,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,71.016,90.241,I'm sorry.
1978.78-808,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,90.241,93.898,"Mrs. Shapiro, I think you may proceed when you're ready now."
1978.78-808,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,93.898,96.904,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-808,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,585.565,593.996,What if we -- what if statute was -- purpose of the statute was to benefit to the children?
1978.78-808,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,593.996,595.491,"Well, if you --"
1978.78-808,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,595.491,601.66,And this is a discrimination against the illegitimate?
1978.78-808,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,601.66,620.862,"Well, if -- as long as this is a -- as long as you recognize that this is a benefit that is paid to the mother in recognition of a likelihood of support, then the answer is clear --"
1978.78-808,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,620.862,622.09,That's agreeing with you?
1978.78-808,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,622.09,622.435,Yes.
1978.78-808,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,622.435,623.476,That's agreeing with you.
1978.78-808,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,624.285,636.898,"If -- if you feel that the case involves an intent to discriminate against illegitimate children, then we lose."
1978.78-808,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,637.687,640.946,Except on the prospected payments?
1978.78-808,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,640.946,646.132,"Well, the class action in the retroactive payments, yes."
1978.78-808,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1018.254,1025.992,"Is that true in the case of adding a divorced wife to the widow when the classes increase, is that same applied?"
1978.78-808,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1026.098,1028.084,It's the same principle applies.
1978.78-808,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1037.483,1043.757,"But in this benefit scheme, if you have a widow with the child and a divorced wife with a child --"
1978.78-808,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1043.757,1043.902,Yes.
1978.78-808,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1043.902,1046.698,-- you divide the maximum four ways instead of it less worth?
1978.78-808,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1046.698,1047.369,That's right.
1978.78-808,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1047.369,1049.509,I see.
1978.78-808,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1049.509,1059.555,"But -- and Congress concluded that in that situation, they were willing to make that that division."
1978.78-808,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1076.559,1100.856,"If the Court will disagree with you and agree with the lower court on the basic issue of whether the larger class should be further enlarged to include unmarried -- persons who never married the wage earner who have children by the wage earner, you then have a kind of a tricky job of rewriting the statute it seems to me because not starts out the widow on the every surviving divorced mother."
1978.78-808,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1127.531,1128.875,"No, we don't."
1978.78-808,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1137.331,1141.0,"There's another cases that construed mother, to mean mother and father or I don't know --"
1978.78-808,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1141.0,1141.547,That's true.
1978.78-808,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1141.547,1142.96,"But here, I don't know what should do."
1978.78-808,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1147.626,1169.892,What the District Court said was you can't apply the statutory requirements only in the case of illegitimate children living with -- and their mothers who were denied benefits that get just kind of by main force in awkwardness pulled out that group and said that group gets benefits.
1978.78-808,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1169.892,1172.253,And you don't question the power of the court to have done that?
1978.78-808,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1174.071,1174.806,"No, we don't."
1978.78-808,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1180.065,1183.78,I understand and that they said they run on the merits and that sovereign immunity point to the others --
1978.78-808,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1183.78,1183.992,"Yes, yes."
1978.78-808,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1183.992,1184.952,-- but I just want to focus on that --
1978.78-808,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1184.952,1185.829,That's -- that's right.
1978.78-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1185.829,1211.787,"But even if the court is right on the merits that this is a non-constitutional legislative scheme, could not be argued following up my brother Stevens that that would be the end of the court's functions, not to rewrite the statute to give benefits to other people, but simply to say this is what Congress has enacted as constitutionally invalid."
1978.78-808,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1211.787,1212.29,That cert --
1978.78-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1212.29,1213.361,But you do not --
1978.78-808,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1213.361,1214.668,It would be an option.
1978.78-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1220.366,1221.231,"Of course, it would be."
1978.78-808,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1223.18,1223.314,Yes.
1978.78-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1223.314,1227.388,And this is not the end of the court's function eventually.
1978.78-808,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1227.388,1249.047,It's -- it's not the way this Court has felt their function was -- that that was the end of their function in cases like Wiesenfeld or Goldfarb which -- in which they found that the statute was unconstitutional and expand at the benefits.
1978.78-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1249.047,1252.648,"Well in any event, you don't question the remedy in this case as I understood you --"
1978.78-808,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1252.648,1253.165,"That's right, that's right."
1978.78-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1253.165,1254.791,-- to my brother Stevens' question.
1978.78-808,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1254.791,1256.692,"Yes, that's right."
1978.78-808,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1256.692,1259.217,And you don't get there if you're right on the merits.
1978.78-808,0,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,1259.217,1264.611,That's right.
1978.78-808,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1268.214,1274.632,Very well.
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,1276.486,1280.331,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.78-808,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1381.41,1390.22,"But isn't the difference between the class is this depends on marriage, not only legitimacy?"
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,1390.22,1393.525,That is almost invariably the case in all --
1978.78-808,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1393.525,1396.696,"Well, will you bring up some examples here."
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,1429.625,1431.041,Under those unusual circumstances --
1978.78-808,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1431.041,1436.648,"Well, unusual -- you call them unusual, no more unusual than the one you dreamed of."
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,1436.648,1437.273,"Well, I'm not --"
1978.78-808,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1437.273,1439.305,"Well anyway, the answer is yes --"
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,1439.305,1441.124,The answer is yes that under those circumstances --
1978.78-808,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1441.124,1442.247,The mother gets --
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,1442.247,1448.308,"The wife who has a child of a -- her husband, but it's not around would receive benefits."
1978.78-808,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1448.308,1452.196,"So, the line isn't drawn on illegitimacy?"
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,1452.196,1468.619,The line is drawn illegitimacy if we define the class Mr. Justice White which is the class is children living -- the general classification is children living with their mother which encompasses almost all children.
1978.78-808,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1501.54,1507.8,"Then, you're using your definition of a class in effect to explain how the statute operates."
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,1513.707,1520.409,The statute -- the definition of a class in some respect was narrower in every possible application of the statute.
1978.78-808,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1541.189,1545.252,I just gave you some illegitimate children who were not excluded from this benefit.
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,1545.252,1545.986,That's correct.
1978.78-808,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1545.986,1558.965,"And any man who's been living with a woman and they're not married and she dies and they have had children, it could very usually end up in the situation I just mentioned."
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,1558.965,1559.553,That is correct.
1978.78-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1740.548,1756.151,"I understand you correctly, you're saying that this statute what you consider a constitutional defect in the statute would be cured if the mother, the unmarried mother were given the opportunity to prove that at the time of the wage earners death, she was receiving the support of the wage earner."
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,1756.151,1759.736,I believe that that is the holding of the Lucas case.
1978.78-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1759.736,1782.174,"Now, if you concede that and if there were empirical evidence that Congress considered and I don't know whether there is or not that that's true and only 2% of the cases of unmarried mothers, most unmarried mothers who've not been living with the wage earner for a matter of years prior to his death are not then receiving a support, then I would think you have to admit that this classification was irrational classification."
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,1782.174,1786.559,"We would not concede that Your Honor, as long as the touchstone was illegitimacy."
1978.78-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1786.663,1789.917,But the touchstone isn't -- the touchtone is marriage.
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,1818.288,1818.5,"Your Honor, --"
1978.78-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1818.5,1819.869,As I remember the pleadings.
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,1819.869,1839.771,"The pleadings don't allege that because the case came up on a review of the determination of the Social Security Administration because of the marriage requirement, any question of support became irrelevant, and therefore no evidence was submitted in the administrative process."
1978.78-808,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1855.292,1858.85,"But would have been relevant in the District Court, would it not?"
1978.78-808,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1877.651,1887.804,"At least, you would have to make some effort to show that Congress was quite irrational and then ever having thought what the Government suggests a thought about it."
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,1887.804,1891.292,"Well, I think there two answers to that."
1978.78-808,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1906.848,1911.885,"If you can suggest -- if you can -- if you're right on that, the Government concedes you win, I take it?"
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,1911.885,1913.479,I think that's correct.
1978.78-808,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1913.479,1918.815,"If -- if you can spell out of legislative history, a purpose to discriminate against illegitimate children."
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,1918.815,1919.874,"Yes, I would like to do that Mr. --"
1978.78-808,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1919.874,1924.496,Would you -- but I take your total argument.
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,1933.066,1934.588,"Yes, but -- that is correct."
1978.78-808,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2127.849,2134.062,When was the divorced former wife and children put into the statute?
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2135.59,2142.434,"I believe that was during the -- I don't recall the date, Your Honor, I would --"
1978.78-808,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2142.434,2144.708,But was an addition wasn't it? (Voice Overlap)
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2144.708,2146.527,That was an addition to the --
1978.78-808,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2146.527,2147.82,The later addition.
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2147.82,2149.862,-- the illegitimate children and so on.
1978.78-808,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2152.611,2153.82,Yes.
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2154.948,2155.592,The original widow.
1978.78-808,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2160.774,2166.56,Right.
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2166.56,2171.989,"Chief Justice, I was advised by the clerk that you would take a recess at this time."
1978.78-808,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2172.764,2175.217,"At 12 o'clock, you --"
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2175.217,2176.069,"Oh, I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1978.78-808,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2176.069,2177.368,12 o'clock.
1978.78-808,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2177.368,2179.144,"Your light will go on, don't worry."
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2179.144,2179.294,I see.
1978.78-808,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2179.294,2183.821,And we will run.
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2183.821,2189.752,The -- I just like briefly to comment on the Wiesenfeld case.
1978.78-808,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2198.167,2216.018,We'll resume at that point at 1 o'clock.
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2219.477,2226.246,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.78-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2327.003,2333.803,May I go back again the discrimination there was concededly against husbands as opposed to wives.
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2337.86,2347.255,"The discrimination was against woman workers because on their depth, their children loss the opportunity for the care of parent."
1978.78-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2347.255,2351.102,But the victim of the discrimination was the parent.
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2351.102,2360.253,I believe that the holding of the court is that the victim under discrimination was a child because the child lost the opportunity for the care of the parent.
1978.78-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2360.253,2362.76,You don't think it was the sex discrimination case at all?
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2362.76,2363.536,"Yes, it was Your Honor."
1978.78-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2364.227,2368.224,But the only sex -- the difference in sex was at the parent level.
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2371.55,2376.544,"That -- that is correct, but the sex discrimination was against the woman worker, not against the --"
1978.78-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2376.544,2383.507,But there was an irrational sex discrimination because they purported to justify it on the basis and the different status or the different children.
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2388.364,2392.699,"That's correct, but was the working -- I mean it's the working parent that was being discriminated against --"
1978.78-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2392.699,2393.0,Alright.
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2400.465,2400.688,No --
1978.78-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2400.688,2401.76,-- who is not --
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2401.76,2408.752,"That would be the case if you accepted the Government's notion of what the statute is all about, the mother's benefits."
1978.78-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2432.694,2433.84,"Well, what happen the --"
1978.78-808,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2433.84,2434.183,Excuse me.
1978.78-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2434.183,2436.558,"Yes, go ahead, Mr. Justice."
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2442.965,2450.743,"Even in statutory sense because in order for this benefit to be payable, the mother must have the child in her care."
1978.78-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2481.391,2487.647,Can it be if the mother took the money and spend it on clothes or alcohol or something like that?
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2487.647,2494.44,There is no -- certainly no remedy under federal law in that case that might be problems with the state law.
1978.78-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2504.936,2507.774,But she's a trustee for the child of those benefits.
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2511.06,2516.828,I -- I don't believe there's any specific legal requirement that she do that.
1978.78-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2519.068,2524.398,The child would have no claim if she took all that money and spend it on clothes for herself.
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2524.398,2524.702,"Well Your Honor, I think --"
1978.78-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2524.702,2525.484,I don't think there's a legal difference between the two.
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2525.484,2527.126,I can't say that the child would have no claim.
1978.78-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2536.93,2543.067,"Supposing the child is independently wealthy, maybe inherited a lot of money from somebody."
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2543.067,2543.483,The child --
1978.78-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2543.483,2549.103,"Still that you know, that the financial, the poverty isn't the test of whether they get benefits if I remember it correctly, isn't it?"
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2549.103,2550.69,Poverty is not a (Voice Overlap) --
1978.78-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2550.69,2558.024,"You could have and independently wealthy child, it might be 15 years old, maybe a very successful newspaper author or something, and he doesn't need the money."
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2562.023,2571.848,"Well, if the child actually has income from earnings which exceed the earnings maximum, the benefits for the child would be reduced to."
1978.78-808,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2583.966,2592.782,Your case wouldn't be really -- wouldn't be any different would it if you just said this was intended to benefit both the mother and the child?
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2598.111,2600.97,It were -- I would think that that it would be the same because --
1978.78-808,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2600.97,2605.917,Just to why get into big argument about whether it was intended to benefit the mother at all.
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2618.269,2620.692,"I think that's correct, Mr. Justice White, I agree with that."
1978.78-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2832.388,2839.527,I understand the Government to be arguing that it doesn't matter if administrative convenience but rather that this is a large class of persons.
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2851.863,2851.945,Well --
1978.78-808,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2851.945,2871.052,"Isn't -- I don' think it's a matter of administrative convenience because there are a lot of people who might be able to prove they were getting support, a grandmother or a third cousin or a good friend or something, but wouldn't be eligible for Social Security simply for that reason because the Social Security System operates on a bunch of rules that large classes are defined in terms of probabilities."
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2871.052,2878.599,"That's correct, but the difference between third cousins and grandmothers and so on and illegitimate children is of constitutional significance."
1978.78-808,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2980.778,2983.304,That's based on 1331 isn't it?
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2985.422,2993.272,We would submit that we can obtain it either on 1331 if the 205 (h) is not a bar to that.
1978.78-808,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2993.272,2996.829,"I think, didn't we hold in Salfi that it was a bar?"
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,2996.829,3004.383,"In Salfi, the court -- it's not involved a decision which ordered the payment of benefits to all members of the class."
1978.78-808,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3004.383,3008.608,And then we said you couldn't bring that under 1331 by reason the preclusionary provisions?
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,3008.608,3009.463,That's correct.
1978.78-808,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3046.229,3051.892,"Well, lots of people need the jurisdiction of federal courts, but they don't get it because Congress hasn't given it too."
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,3051.892,3060.909,"That's correct, but here, Congress has provided in 1331 for federal court jurisdiction in constitutional claims."
1978.78-808,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3100.759,3103.908,Those two arguments are mutually inconsistent to that.
1978.78-808,1,28131,herbert_semmel,,3106.765,3108.618,That -- that is correct.
1978.78-808,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3111.091,3116.545,"Do you have anything further, Mrs. Shapiro?"
1978.78-808,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3116.545,3125.29,"First, just as a matter of clarification of the child's benefit must be used for the child."
1978.78-808,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3133.806,3135.928,"Before you leave that, what about the mother's benefit?"
1978.78-808,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3135.928,3139.7,"Well, the mother's benefit is for her own use, and she can use it as she wishes."
1978.78-808,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3139.7,3142.26,I see.
1978.78-808,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3142.26,3149.317,I may have misunderstood Mr. Justice White's question to me earlier.
1978.78-808,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3182.713,3190.485,"Mrs. Shapiro, suppose the statute said that mothers of illegitimate children do not get these benefits but mothers of legitimate children do."
1978.78-808,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3190.485,3193.241,"Well, then --"
1978.78-808,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3193.241,3194.622,Would your position be the same?
1978.78-808,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3200.211,3204.363,"Then, if then -- then you're saying it would be intentional discrimination --"
1978.78-808,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3204.363,3205.436,"Yes, exactly."
1978.78-808,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3206.856,3206.997,"Yes, that's what I --"
1978.78-808,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3206.997,3210.337,"-- with that kind of thing, you wouldn't agree it was illegal (Voice Overlap)."
1978.78-808,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3210.337,3212.893,If it's an intentional discrimination against illegitimate children.
1978.78-808,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3212.893,3219.637,And I take it as part of your -- part of the submission of your colleague on the other side is that that's what the exactly what the statute is.
1978.78-808,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3219.637,3220.444,Yes.
1978.78-808,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3222.063,3223.086,I know you disagree with that.
1978.78-808,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3223.086,3224.296,Yes.
1978.78-808,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3254.832,3261.172,"Well, it might be almost as good as married if you're non-married, wouldn't it?"
1978.78-808,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3261.172,3261.887,"Well, no."
1978.78-808,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3261.973,3267.608,"I mean, certainly you know that -- there's no -- not a very perfect fit in any of these classification?"
1978.78-808,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3267.608,3268.132,That's true.
1978.78-808,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3300.699,3306.117,"Mrs. Shapiro, I am somewhat puzzled by your concession that intent makes any difference."
1978.78-808,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3336.319,3360.678,"Well, the problem is if it's the intent to discriminate or whether it simply a disparate effect of the use of a perfectly proper method of distinguishing between people who are likely to have been supported and people who weren't."
1978.78-808,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3360.678,3366.02,"Well, it's always an intent to discriminate if you say that class A gets benefits and class B doesn't get benefits."
1978.78-808,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3380.667,3380.971,No.
1978.78-808,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3391.476,3393.245,"In both cases, I assume they were."
1978.78-808,2,28176,harriet_s_shapiro,,3393.245,3393.54,Okay.
1978.78-808,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3421.3,3422.027,Very well.
