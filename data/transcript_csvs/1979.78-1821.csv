1979.78-1821,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,6.765,"We will hear arguments first this morning in 78-1821, United States v. Mendenhall."
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,12.202,15.434,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1821,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,110.155,113.96,You mean preceding the search?
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,113.96,124.12,"The initial encounter in the airport concourse took about two or three minutes, and then the further events in the DEA office took another five to ten minutes."
1979.78-1821,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,124.12,126.05,Including the search?
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,126.05,131.377,I believe that is what the evidence was.
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,159.117,169.7,"Mr. Frey, do you think that when you say there was a reasonable suspicion from the outset, are you talking in Terry terms or not?"
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,169.7,171.776,The District Court I think was talking in Terry terms.
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,171.776,175.309,How about you?
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,175.309,185.413,"Well, I intend to devote most of my argument to the question of whether this was a Terry stop and if so whether the quantum of suspicion was sufficient to --"
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,185.413,187.516,"For the moment, you are telling us what the District Court held?"
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,187.516,190.628,"I am telling you what the District Court held, that's correct."
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,200.414,210.521,So you don't think that at the time they first spoke to her that they had a right to pat her down?
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,210.521,219.362,"No, I don't think they had a right to pat her down and frisk her but that relates to the reasonable perception that she might be dangerous, which I don't think they had."
1979.78-1821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,219.362,224.337,But it also depends on whether there was a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,224.337,231.601,"It does and I do think they had a right to detain her at the time they first spoke to her, that is to stop her."
1979.78-1821,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,236.069,240.473,"You rely on the Mimm standard, do you?"
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,240.473,279.167,"No, I intended to rely on Martinez-Fuerte for that proposition, because in Martinez-Fuerte, as I will get to, the Court suggested that the quantum of suspicion that was needed for a roving patrol stop in Brignoni-Ponce was not necessary for a referral to the secondary inspection area for questioning in Martinez-Fuerte, and I think -- while I think they had enough suspicion to meet the normal Brignoni-Ponce standard in this case, I think the minimal nature of the intrusion required even less suspicion than that."
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,279.167,283.037,"In other words, there is a standard below Terry that you rely on for that?"
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,283.037,294.651,"Well, it is difficult to say whether Terry -- Terry enunciated a standard on the facts of Terry and held that what was known to the officer justified the action that he took in Terry."
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,313.369,324.842,You are taking the position -- I don't want to take too much of your time -- you are taking the position that something less than Terry can in some circumstances justify a detention against the will of the person detained?
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,324.842,337.843,"Well, I am saying that the kind of encounter that incurred in the airport between the agents and respondent Mendenhall, which we first contend was not a seizure of her person at all --"
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,337.843,338.361,I understand that.
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,338.361,358.727,"-- if the Court disagrees with that contention and holds that it is a seizure, I am contending next that some suspicion that might not justify the stop of an automobile or a frisk would justify going up to somebody and asking them questions as was done here."
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,365.979,366.682,I understand.
1979.78-1821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,366.682,375.165,"Mr. Frey, you've been here often enough so that you will understand this question may be repetitious."
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,389.476,390.748,Not a seizure of the person under the Fourth Amendment.
1979.78-1821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,390.748,393.24,Not a seizure of the person under the Fourth Amendment.
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,393.24,394.337,That is our first contention.
1979.78-1821,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,394.337,404.771,Are you contending -- I will move now into the drug office -- are you depending on her consent to a search?
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,404.771,424.248,"We are making two alternative arguments, either of which would justify a reversal of the Court of Appeals decision, the first that it was supported by her consent and therefore did not have to meet other Fourth Amendment requirements, and the second that it did satisfy the requirements of the Fourth Amendment, assuming that the consent was not sufficient."
1979.78-1821,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,424.248,427.082,Why do you need the second one if you have the first one?
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,427.082,430.24,"Well, I'm not sure that you will agree with the first one and therefore --"
1979.78-1821,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,430.24,433.261,"What you really want to do is extend it a little, don't you?"
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,433.261,434.737,I'm not sure I understand.
1979.78-1821,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,434.737,440.001,You want to extend it beyond consent.
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,440.001,440.641,"No, our --"
1979.78-1821,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,440.641,446.284,So that somebody else who doesn't consent will be forcedly held.
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,446.284,446.406,No.
1979.78-1821,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,446.406,447.849,Isn't that what you want us to do?
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,447.849,451.385,I believe that what you would do logically would be to first --
1979.78-1821,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,451.385,453.693,"Well, why would we have to do the second one?"
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,453.693,459.41,You don't have to reach the second issue if you agree with us on the first with regard to the move to the office.
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,470.099,471.871,You were telling us what the District Court did --
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,471.871,472.465,That is our argument.
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,472.465,476.498,-- and you were half-way through that and you haven't even got to the Court of Appeals yet.
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,476.498,479.944,That's correct.
1979.78-1821,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,484.253,488.313,It doesn't matter to me.
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,488.313,503.624,"We are not insisting that you reach the second issue about whether this would be permissible in the absence of her consent, but if you find that there was not a valid consent then we do present that second issue for your decision."
1979.78-1821,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,572.701,579.431,And the facts were she was the last off the airplane and then she went to the American Airlines counter --
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,579.431,580.159,"Well, I would also --"
1979.78-1821,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,580.159,583.764,-- and it was there that she was --
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,583.764,590.441,"Well, I can get into that some detail, if you would like."
1979.78-1821,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,640.012,642.189,"Well, her baggage was checked through to Pittsburgh, wasn't it?"
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,642.189,644.23,We don't know whether she had any baggage or not.
1979.78-1821,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,644.658,647.27,"If any, I mean she was enroute to Pittsburgh."
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,647.27,652.898,I am telling you what occurred.
1979.78-1821,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,691.801,693.052,"Well, American doesn't fly between --"
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,693.052,701.07,Does it show as to what carries she was booked on as far as the rest of her tickets were concerned--
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,701.07,706.94,The record does not clearly show what carrier.
1979.78-1821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,712.353,718.024,"That is the issuing carrier, but American Airlines doesn't fly from Detroit to Pittsburgh."
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,718.024,737.868,"Well, you say that and I accept that as true, but I'm not sure what the significance of that is in terms of -- the question is not whether the agent was right that she had originally been booked on American Airlines to Pittsburgh."
1979.78-1821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,738.976,742.344,"Well, there was an agent at that airport, wasn't he?"
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,742.344,744.258,"That's true, but one would presume that --"
1979.78-1821,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,744.258,748.18,One would presume that they would know where the various airlines went to.
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,748.18,751.064,I'm not sure that that is a fair question to presume.
1979.78-1821,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,786.132,787.454,Then what happened?
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,794.716,809.032,"And then the ticket agent gave her a boarding pass for the Eastern flight, she started down the concourse and at that point the agents came up to her and said we're federal agents, would you please show us your --"
1979.78-1821,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,809.032,810.89,And that was the first time there was a direct --
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,810.89,811.929,That was the first contact --
1979.78-1821,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,811.929,812.952,-- communication with her?
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,812.952,815.667,That's correct.
1979.78-1821,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,815.667,818.364,As she was going down toward the gate --
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,818.364,819.313,Down the concourse.
1979.78-1821,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,819.313,821.688,-- toward the Eastern gate to Pittsburgh?
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,821.688,826.358,That's correct.
1979.78-1821,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,871.166,874.658,They had reasonable suspicion that she was armed?
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,874.658,874.78,No
1979.78-1821,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,874.78,876.736,That is what Terry has to do with.
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,876.736,881.064,"Well, let us say Prignoni-Ponce reasonable suspicion."
1979.78-1821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,936.73,947.665,"Well, what did the Court of Appeals do with Judge DeMascio's finding that before the actual search was made there was probable cause?"
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,950.194,954.155,"Well, I think it is plain that they disagreed with it."
1979.78-1821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,957.382,958.679,"Well, cryptic is the word I would use."
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,958.679,981.327,"Well, perhaps -- and it is difficult to tell, but I think one can only conclude that they did not agree with his finding that there was probable cause and that I think essentially is -- it is not something we have contended here because in our view it is not -- probable cause is not necessary for what occurred."
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,981.327,986.064,Do you have a view on whether there was probable cause?
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,986.064,1014.286,"At the time of the search, I think it is quite arguable, because at the time of the search of her person which disclosed the heroin, they not only knew that she had been traveling under one alias coming back from Los Angeles but that she had traveled on yet a different alias and going on yet a different carrier going out from Pittsburgh to Los Angeles which I would suppose is consistent with an evasive pattern that drug couriers --"
1979.78-1821,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1014.286,1018.496,"From your answer, I don't know what your view is, whether there was probable cause or not."
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1018.496,1023.002,"Well, I haven't really thought about it in the course of preparing the argument."
1979.78-1821,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1023.002,1029.309,"Well, have you thought whether, even if there was, whether the search was justified without consent?"
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1029.309,1031.291,If there was probable cause?
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1031.291,1032.74,"No, no --"
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1032.74,1034.957,"That is the same question, isn't it?"
1979.78-1821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1035.535,1036.665,"No, no."
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1046.499,1055.734,"The search would be okay if the detention at that point was not a fruit of a prior Fourth Amendment violation, in which case there would be a separate issue."
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1055.734,1059.5,What was the emergency?
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1059.5,1062.019,What was the emergency in terms of searching her person?
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1062.019,1066.65,Yes.
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1066.65,1074.681,"Well, they would have probable cause to arrest her if they had probable cause to search her, and the search could be made incident to an arrest."
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1074.681,1076.634,"Well, they never arrested her, did they?"
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1076.634,1081.1,"Well, I'm not sure that that would be necessary to sustain the search."
1979.78-1821,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1081.1,1093.873,So you say that you just don't ever reach any of those questions because you don't care to have to decide the --
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1093.873,1099.455,We rely -- we don't ask you to decide whether this was supportable as a probable cause search.
1979.78-1821,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1126.005,1130.321,"Even if consent was voluntary, it might be the product of an illegal detention?"
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1130.321,1130.959,It might be.
1979.78-1821,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1146.824,1150.665,"Of course, your view really is that there was no detention at all, isn't it?"
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1150.665,1155.042,Our view is that there was no detention at the initial encounter.
1979.78-1821,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1155.042,1157.288,Even in the office there was a detention.
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1157.288,1165.244,"Well, I have thought about that and I am not sure what the answer is."
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1175.644,1187.258,"The very word ""detention"" implies being held against somebody's will, and if she went voluntarily along with them to the office and voluntarily consented to the search and so on, there was no detention whatsoever --"
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1187.258,1189.653,"Yes, sir, I think that is our position."
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1189.653,1191.191,-- within the dictionary meaning of that word.
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1191.191,1200.256,Although that then raises the question which I had not planned to get into of their subjective intention to detain her as she attempted to leave.
1979.78-1821,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1200.256,1205.598,Did the agent testify that if she had attempted to leave he would have stopped her?
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1205.598,1210.263,He did testify -- are you talking about when she had consented to the search?
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1210.263,1212.403,What you are talking about right now.
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1214.691,1220.608,"Well, in the corridor the testimony is quite ambiguous as to the point at which he would have stopped her had she --"
1979.78-1821,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1220.608,1223.137,But did he say that?
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1223.137,1230.395,I think it is clear from the testimony that once he found out she was traveling under an alias he would have stopped her had she attempted to leave.
1979.78-1821,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1234.368,1237.09,This is a well trained witness.
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1243.767,1244.307,He is a --
1979.78-1821,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1244.307,1248.615,"Well, can't I take what he says as being a fact in truth?"
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1248.615,1257.342,I take it as a fact that he would have stopped her once he found out she was traveling under an alias had she tried to leave.
1979.78-1821,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1257.342,1261.123,"Well, what exactly did he testify to?"
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1261.123,1277.968,"Well, the testimony -- the particular testimony that we are adverting to now was given on cross examination in response to what seems to me a somewhat ambiguous question."
1979.78-1821,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1306.503,1313.438,Well couldn't the U.S. Attorney on redirect straighten that out?
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1313.438,1313.982,"Yes, of course."
1979.78-1821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1335.008,1343.287,"Well, Mr. Frey, in the office when the officer advised her that she need not consent to the search, he --"
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1343.287,1344.931,"He did advise her that, yes."
1979.78-1821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1344.931,1357.092,I suppose that is either directly or indirectly an assertion or an opinion that he didn't have probable cause to arrest.
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1357.092,1367.175,"No, not at all, not at all, since I think the normal practice and the proper practice is to seek consent even if you do believe you have probable cause."
1979.78-1821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1367.175,1373.076,"I know, but if you arrest you don't have any right to refuse to search."
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1373.076,1388.196,"But you could tell somebody that they have a right to refuse a search in an effort to insure that you have secured the voluntary consent even though if they say I refuse you could then say well, I have decided that I am going to arrest you and search you."
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1388.196,1393.895,"So all his advice was that if you don't want to be searched, I won't search you?"
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1394.311,1395.445,He was saying --
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1395.445,1395.789,I thought he was saying.
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1395.789,1398.384,He was saying do you consent --
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1398.384,1403.718,"I thought you were saying that he was telling her she had a right to refuse, the legal right to refuse."
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1403.718,1405.516,"Exactly, yes."
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1407.91,1408.33,Right.
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1408.33,1415.015,"-- and we don't know if she had said no, I refuse, what would have happened."
1979.78-1821,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1415.015,1421.574,"Conceivably one alternative would be then sit down, young lady, until we get a warrant."
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1421.902,1429.786,"If the officer thought he had probable cause to search he, he might very well then have sought a warrant in order to do it."
1979.78-1821,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1435.889,1438.786,"Mr. Frey, do I misunderstand the record?"
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1443.582,1446.99,There are two different findings of consent by the District Court.
1979.78-1821,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1463.701,1469.586,Is there evidence in the record that she was asked for an additional consent in the office?
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1469.586,1471.046,"Yes, absolutely."
1979.78-1821,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,1471.046,1471.496,I missed it.
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1471.496,1473.205,It is quite clear.
1979.78-1821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1602.571,1623.295,"Mr. Frey, I take it your basic position is that an officer could just at random pick out somebody in an airport and do exactly -- and the same events that happened here transpired and you would say there was no violation of law."
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1623.295,1629.414,"Well, I think that is our position, that there would not be a seizure but I do think --"
1979.78-1821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1629.414,1634.791,And no violation of the Fourth Amendment in any of these -- as a result of any of these events --
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1634.791,1638.91,We are talking only about walking up to somebody and asking them a couple of questions and for identification.
1979.78-1821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1638.91,1641.774,And then asking them into the office --
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1641.774,1643.358,If they consent.
1979.78-1821,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1643.358,1644.309,Which you say they did
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1644.309,1645.574,We are --
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1645.574,1648.805,"Then the search, which you say there was consent to."
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1648.805,1651.822,"Well, that would clearly be a search."
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1651.822,1652.992,"Yes, but it was consent to."
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1652.992,1655.626,"I understand, that would be --"
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1655.626,1658.484,Any citizen would have no --
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1658.484,1658.812,Well --
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1658.812,1661.719,"-- If these same things happened to any citizen, there would be no violation of the Fourth Amendment."
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1661.719,1670.803,"Well, I think there is a difference because -- the difference is that when you come to a search, you are talking about an action which is in fact governed by the Fourth Amendment."
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1670.803,1672.552,"Yes, but you say there was consent."
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1672.552,1672.994,That's right.
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1677.003,1680.051,"Well, your position is that it does not violate the Fourth Amendment."
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1680.051,1694.109,"Well, I think there is a difference between saying that a particular incident does not implicate the Fourth Amendment and saying that an incident does not violate the Fourth Amendment, and in the one case I would say it is not implicated and the other not violated."
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1694.109,1705.519,"Then in any event, the answer to my question is any citizen picked out at random would not have had his Fourth Amendment rights violated by these events?"
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1705.519,1709.844,Had he agreed to cooperate right down the road --
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1709.844,1709.899,As happened here.
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1709.899,1710.67,-- as happened here.
1979.78-1821,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1710.67,1712.289,As you say happened here.
1979.78-1821,0,15933,andrew_l_frey,,1712.289,1720.657,"Now, let me just -- I just want to emphasize again Martinez-Fuerte because I don't think we made this point quite clear in our brief."
1979.78-1821,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1774.963,1777.326,Mr. Karfonta.
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,1777.326,1780.341,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2002.622,2016.503,You say there was no right or power on the part of the officers to ask her questions and ask to see her ticket in the circumstances that existed here?
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2016.503,2035.198,"Your Honor, I believe that under Brown v. Texas it is clear that when they asked to see her driver's license, required her to answer questions and then required her to give them her airline ticket, that she had been seized within the Fourth Amendment."
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2035.198,2036.996,You say required her.
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2036.996,2038.993,Yes.
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2038.993,2052.616,The Court has said on a number of occasions that officers may ask you questions quite freely of citizens and citizens have a right to refuse to answer if they want to.
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2052.616,2076.929,"That's correct, but I believe that this Court unanimously held just last term in Brown v. Texas that when the officers detained the appellant for the purpose of requiring him to identify himself, they performed a seizure of his person subject to the requirements of the Fourth Amendment."
1979.78-1821,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2079.005,2095.777,"Well, is there a difference between saying come over here, I want to ask you a few questions, and simply coming up to person and saying what's your name?"
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2102.399,2104.475,"I think there is, Your Honor."
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2128.055,2130.716,"Well, when do you become adversary?"
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2130.716,2133.953,I believe in this case it was adversary from the beginning because --
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2133.953,2138.931,Is that because of something that was in the officer's mind or is it something that was in her mind?
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2138.931,2144.693,"I believe that it would be in the officer's mind, in her mind and also the objective circumstances."
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2144.693,2155.595,"Of course, there was certainly some tension in her mind because she knew she had heroin, but the officer didn't know that she had heroin."
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2155.595,2170.461,"Well, I think that in terms of looking at the consent issue, that Schneckloth indicates that in determining consent you have to consider the vulnerable subjective state of mind of the person from whom consent is being sought."
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2170.461,2184.003,"You mean if the person in fact has a packet of heroin on their person or in a package in their possession, then that gives them some special category?"
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2184.003,2185.221,I don't believe so.
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2187.732,2189.822,When you suggested vulnerability --
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2189.822,2191.626,"Yes, Well, I --"
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2191.626,2199.523,-- I suppose a person who has got a packet of heroin does indeed feel somewhat vulnerable.
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2199.523,2200.243,"That's true, Judge."
1979.78-1821,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2228.107,2248.173,"Mr. Karfonta, supposing the police are investigating a dead body they found on a lawn in front of somebody's house and they see a neighbor looking over and the policeman simply calls over and he says do you know anything about this, is that a detention or arrest or Terry stop?"
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2248.173,2251.617,"No, I don't believe it is."
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2251.617,2274.086,"Suppose the neighbor comes over to the scene that Mr. Justice Rehnquist has described, and then the police officer says will you please Just wait here for a few minutes, I want to ask you some questions -- arrest, detention?"
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2274.086,2277.565,"Probably not arrest or detention, but --"
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2277.565,2296.649,"Suppose then the person began to go away and the officer said I want you to stay here, there has been a homicide, and I want you to stay here as a material witness -- arrest?"
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2296.649,2297.828,Probably.
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2297.828,2306.231,Probably arrested then.
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2306.231,2319.578,"As I was first discussing, in Dunaway v. New York the Court held that freedom of movement is a controlling factor in determining the point of arrest."
1979.78-1821,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2444.719,2457.469,"The District Court found that there was consent, that she voluntarily went to the office and that finding was in no way disturbed by the Court of Appeals, as I read the record."
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2457.469,2459.502,"Well, I would answer that --"
1979.78-1821,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2459.502,2462.039,Am I mistaken about that?
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2462.039,2467.669,"I would say on the second point you are mistaken in the sense, that they said there was no consent to the --"
1979.78-1821,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2467.669,2470.776,To the search.
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2470.776,2473.765,"You're right, Judge, Your Honor, but --"
1979.78-1821,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2473.765,2474.567,Am I mistaken or not?
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2474.567,2476.247,"No, you're not."
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2518.041,2531.092,"Suppose as you are leaving the court room today one of the officers approaches you and says, ""Mr. Rodak, the clerk of the court would like to see you for a few minutes,"" what do you think your situation is?"
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2534.197,2535.696,"No, I don't think so."
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2535.696,2545.454,"If you go there, to his office and the secretary says, ""Well, Mr. Rodak is on the telephone, will you sit down and wait for five minutes,"" are you detained?"
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2545.454,2551.208,I don't think this is the kind of adversarial confrontation between a police officer and a citizen --
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2551.208,2557.37,Is that perhaps partly because you know that you have no heroin on you or no contraband of any kind?
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2557.37,2565.555,"No, that question is like when did you stop beating your wife."
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2565.555,2566.067,Not at all.
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2576.922,2595.19,"On the other hand, if one of the DEA agents, some of whom I know, came up to me and said we want you to go into this little room off the corridor here, away from the court room and we're going to have a little talk with you about some of the things you said, I would be a little apprehensive."
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2610.008,2622.441,"Would you consider it adversarial if the particular citizen has no contraband, no drugs, no firearms or --"
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2622.441,2639.646,"I thing that is the entire part of the defense's contention in this case, is on the kinds of factors, this person was stopped and then arrested, it could apply to the search of anyone anywhere on just basically nothing."
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2647.858,2655.525,Do you think the Court of Appeals set aside or disturbed the finding of consent to the search in the drug office?
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2655.525,2657.246,I definitely do.
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2657.246,2660.153,By direct statement or by inference?
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2660.153,2671.455,I believe what the Court of Appeals said was that there was no consent to the search in this case within the meaning of United States v. McCaleb.
1979.78-1821,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2711.714,2715.518,And was traveling under an assumed name.
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2715.518,2719.405,"I was speaking of the point of the initial search, Your Honor."
1979.78-1821,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2827.1,2855.478,"What if in this case she had been booked from Los Angeles to Minneapolis, she immediately arrives in Minneapolis, goes to the counter of an airline that has a flight from Minneapolis to New York and switches her ticket or perhaps buys a ticket from Minneapolis to New York, and the agent says that's unusual because you could have easily booked directly out of Los Angeles to New York without going to Minneapolis."
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2859.827,2880.035,"Well, Judge, Your Honor, I believe that you have to consider everything that the agent actually knew and in our brief we contend that the profile itself does not arise reasonable suspicion and none of the Courts of Appeals have held it has."
1979.78-1821,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2880.035,2887.972,You think nothing short of probable cause then is sufficient to even warrant further interrogation?
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2887.972,2904.68,"No, I believe that when there is reasonable suspicion and there are Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals cases that have found reasonable suspicion, but then a proper stop, an investigatorial stop and reasonable suspicion is proper."
1979.78-1821,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2904.68,2918.503,But you don't think that any rather strange conduct in airline routing and sudden changes of destinations are permissible factors in a profile?
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,2918.503,2918.958,"Oh, yes."
1979.78-1821,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2999.428,3003.578,"If you are right, what could have been done in Pittsburgh?"
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,3008.133,3023.282,"That's correct, Your Honor, but I used the example of the United States v. Oates, when they got to Pittsburgh, a bulge mysteriously appeared, that he had talked with a known narcotics dealer, the traveling companion was a known narcotics addict --"
1979.78-1821,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3023.282,3029.724,"But in this case you are suggesting, well, it is very easy, the government just could have wired ahead or telephoned ahead to Pittsburgh."
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,3047.481,3048.209,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3052.933,3076.343,"You mean, for example, if they got to Pittsburgh they might have telephoned Pittsburgh and said watch this woman when she gets off; if, one, she is last to leave the plane, and, two, she looks nervous, and, three, she doesn't in fact have any luggage to pick up, then stop her and arrest her, something like that?"
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,3076.343,3077.624,"No, no."
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3077.624,3085.854,"Well, what are the additional factors that you suggest might supplement what Mr. Justice Stewart just put to you?"
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,3085.854,3088.058,I am indicating --
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3088.058,3090.384,You said some other factors might show up.
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,3090.384,3099.949,"I guess I am indicating that since those are the same factors we have in Detroit, and since I don't feel that those factors have very much value, that those factors occurring twice would not have been --"
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3099.949,3107.888,"Well, why don't you take the three that I have just mentioned, suppose they did occur, the agent found in Pittsburgh she was the last to leave the plane, as she had been before --"
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,3107.888,3109.379,Right.
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3109.379,3133.064,"-- and that she did not have any luggage, in fact even though that is quite a long trip to be without luggage, and third, she acted in a very nervous manner in the same way the telephone call had described her conduct previously, do you think those might finally reach a point where it would cross over the line?"
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,3133.064,3134.663,"Not to raise reasonable suspicion, no, I don't."
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3134.663,3139.104,And what was the point of your suggestion that they wait until they get to Pittsburgh?
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,3139.104,3151.78,"The point of my suggestion was that very often in continuing an investigation additional factors do turn up and sometimes they don't, and then you cannot proceed to detain a citizen."
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3151.78,3172.353,"Well, you said one of them would be that if on arrival in Pittsburgh she was met by a person known to the Pittsburgh agent as a drug dealer, of course, there you are so far over the line that you are leaving no room for any analysis at all, are you?"
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,3172.353,3173.713,I don't believe that is true.
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3226.226,3230.593,When they are getting on or when they are getting off?
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,3230.593,3243.812,"As far as I personally, I would say that would be from the time I leave home until the time I arrive at my destination away from the airport."
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3463.824,3467.693,Does the record show how much of a layover there was between the two flights?
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,3467.693,3469.886,"No, it does not."
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3469.886,3475.033,"There we don't know whether she was under pressure of the time or not, do we?"
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,3475.033,3476.101,We do not.
1979.78-1821,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3526.817,3542.411,"Mr. Karfonta, before you sit down, you take the position that had she refused -- that the record shows that if she had refused to go to the office, that the officers would have required her to do, that they had intended to detain her."
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,3552.576,3555.228,(Inaudible)
1979.78-1821,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3555.228,3561.293,You do say that she didn't realize until that happened that she was going to be -- that there was going to be a strip search.
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,3569.8,3587.051,"I believe defense counsel cross-examined both the agent and the female officer as to each point -- was she free to go at the point of the stop, was she free to go at the point of arrest, was she free to go at the point of consent, and at each point the answer was no."
1979.78-1821,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3606.291,3618.456,"Well, there is testimony at page 12 of the appendix by the officer that before she went to the office she gave some kind of consent, and I thought it read consent to the search of the purse and the person."
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,3625.329,3635.346,"What it says here is, ""I asked her to accompany myself and Agent Myhills to our office which was very nearby,"" but there is no indication that she was told she had any choice."
1979.78-1821,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3650.691,3658.913,"Suppose we disagreed with you and the Court of Appeals, I take it, with respect to probable cause."
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,3665.433,3672.182,"I suppose my argument would be at that point that if there were no exigencies, that a search warrant should have been sought."
1979.78-1821,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3672.182,3683.118,"Well, there is probable cause to arrest and you claim there was an arrest."
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,3686.376,3687.175,That's correct.
1979.78-1821,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3687.175,3692.145,"Well, you don't need a warrant to search incident to arrest, do you?"
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,3692.145,3692.891,"No, you don't."
1979.78-1821,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3692.891,3697.594,And you don't need a warrant to arrest on probable cause.
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,3697.594,3697.71,No.
1979.78-1821,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3697.71,3703.001,So what would be your argument if we disagreed with you about probable cause?
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,3705.107,3710.69,The District Court actually -- and I'm glad you give me a chance to clarify this -- I think the District Court was wrong.
1979.78-1821,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3729.04,3735.749,But they found consent to search the purse.
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,3735.749,3736.797,That's correct.
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3736.797,3744.732,"At what point did the officers find out that she had three different names, that is two in addition to her true name?"
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,3744.732,3747.411,That point was on the concourse.
1979.78-1821,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3760.381,3765.09,"Well, you still haven't answered my question."
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,3786.918,3805.451,"Well, I guess I would say at that point that it would be a search incident to arrest."
1979.78-1821,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3805.451,3807.97,That sounds like --
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,3807.97,3818.909,"At the point that they have consent to search her purse, I would contend that that would be a product, a tainted product of the illegal stop."
1979.78-1821,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3818.909,3831.24,You say you would argue it would be the product of an illegal arrest?
1979.78-1821,1,24202,f_randall_karfonta,,3831.24,3838.434,Or an illegal stop.
1979.78-1821,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3838.434,3842.392,Thank you.
1979.78-1821,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3844.547,3851.52,"Yes, I have a couple of minor points and one I think of fairly major importance that I hope to be able to talk about."
1979.78-1821,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3927.334,3952.562,"Well, Mr. Frey, on your direct argument, your initial argument you weren't talking any position or whether there was or was not probable cause to arrest, I take it then I walk judge the case on the assumption that there never was probable cause to arrest prior to the search?"
1979.78-1821,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3952.562,3966.809,"Well, that raises the problem of what we've presented to the Court in our petition for certiorari and and whether you are free -- I mean the District Court did find that there was probable cause to arrest and search --"
1979.78-1821,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3966.809,3970.599,Do you defend that or not?
1979.78-1821,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3970.599,3975.524,"We haven't asked for review on that ground, but I would defend that."
1979.78-1821,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3976.313,3979.625,"Well, the Court of Appeals thought there wasn't probable cause."
1979.78-1821,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3979.625,3981.886,I understand that.
1979.78-1821,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3981.886,3990.025,So we judge the case on the assumption that the officers never validly acquired probable cause to arrest?
1979.78-1821,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,3990.025,3996.976,I think you would certainly be well within propriety to do so since we didn't challenge that conclusion of the District Court.
1979.78-1821,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4066.261,4070.416,Can you tell us how often he was wrong?
1979.78-1821,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4070.416,4072.711,The record does not tell you.
1979.78-1821,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4072.711,4077.686,"He was right this time, but we don't know whether maybe one out of ten or nine out of ten."
1979.78-1821,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4077.686,4089.97,"But what we are talking about, the record does not indicate, although there is an opinion which does in the Garcia case in the Eastern District of New York which indicates that very few people are stopped."
1979.78-1821,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4110.042,4125.178,"You're not, but if I understood your answer to Mr. Justice White, your position if sustained in this case would allow you to make virtually random stops if you could get the kind of sequence of events you got here."
1979.78-1821,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4125.178,4135.412,"The first position that this is not a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment would allow a police officer without violating the Fourth Amendment to approach somebody and ask a question, that's correct."
1979.78-1821,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4135.412,4142.433,And the sequence of events ends up in an office upstairs in the airport with the suspect taking his clothes off?
1979.78-1821,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4142.433,4145.64,"The Fourth Amendment would be implicated at that point, at the point of the search."
1979.78-1821,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4145.64,4147.635,But not violated.
1979.78-1821,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4147.635,4152.89,But not violated in these events.
1979.78-1821,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4152.89,4161.452,"Mr. Solicitor General, as I understand your argument, it would not be random stops if all of these facts existed."
1979.78-1821,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4161.452,4177.267,"I've now moved to the argument about whether there is founded suspicion if this is a stop and there we are saying that the Fourth Amendment does apply, and I am saying that we have a very limited intrusion and the experience of the agents --"
1979.78-1821,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4177.267,4183.086,If this issue which you now describe as critical we need address only if we are not persuaded on the consent sequence?
1979.78-1821,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4183.086,4184.14,That's right
1979.78-1821,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,4184.14,4187.269,"If there was consent all along the line, we don't have to decide that."
1979.78-1821,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4187.269,4204.803,"You would have to decide it -- you have to decide with respect to the initial encounter in the airport concourse whether (a) it was not a Fourth Amendment seizure or (b) if it was it was lawful, because otherwise what ensued following that encounter was arguably a fruit of the initial illegality."
1979.78-1821,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4213.683,4215.47,"Well, perhaps a combination of things."
1979.78-1821,2,15933,andrew_l_frey,,4229.09,4235.196,"You would not have to reach the question of whether there was founded suspicion or probable cause at any point, that is correct."
1979.78-1821,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4235.368,4236.018,"Thank you, gentlemen."
