1977.76-5856,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.272,We will hear arguments first this morning in number 76-5856 Holloway against Arkansas.
1977.76-5856,0,27296,harold_l_hall,,13.329,17.008,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1977.76-5856,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,105.652,116.296,Was there any difference in the general nature of the defense as between and among these defendants?
1977.76-5856,0,27296,harold_l_hall,,116.296,129.715,"Well, sir prior to going to the Court there was, but then when the Court said you will represent all three, you cannot cross-examine your own witness which happens to be a defendant."
1977.76-5856,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,138.65,148.198,Did you make any proffer that the witness was inherently a hostile witness and asked for the cross-examination under the hostile witness rule?
1977.76-5856,0,27296,harold_l_hall,,148.198,150.601,"No, sir because he was my client."
1977.76-5856,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,150.601,151.544,No.
1977.76-5856,0,27296,harold_l_hall,,151.544,154.312,All three.
1977.76-5856,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,154.312,157.115,That would not necessarily bar that proffer --
1977.76-5856,0,27296,harold_l_hall,,157.115,157.135,Yes.
1977.76-5856,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,157.135,162.578,As an explanation of why one witness might be hostile with respect to another?
1977.76-5856,0,27296,harold_l_hall,,162.578,176.188,"But I have been admonished by the Court not to cross-examine my own witness, I could not cross examine, these are exact words, well, you have no right to cross examine your own witness then he told me to proceed like you told me to."
1977.76-5856,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,176.188,180.327,What was their defense that they had --
1977.76-5856,0,27296,harold_l_hall,,180.327,181.7,They had alibi defense.
1977.76-5856,1,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,981.791,985.081,Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.
1977.76-5856,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1085.681,1090.723,Where is that told that there was no conflict where the judge said there was no conflict?
1977.76-5856,1,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1090.723,1093.132,The judge denied his motion for --
1977.76-5856,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1093.132,1098.383,But where in the record is it that the judge said there is no conflict?
1977.76-5856,1,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1098.383,1118.03,"I do not know that Mr. Justice Marshall, I do not know that the Court elucidated those exact words, but the trial court continually stood ready to hear evidence of some conflict, and there was none that really existed here."
1977.76-5856,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1204.54,1209.247,"Mr. Purvis, let me ask you question about the practical preparation for the trial."
1977.76-5856,1,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1212.57,1213.426,"Yes, sir."
1977.76-5856,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1213.426,1224.436,"And the lawyer made the judgment that it would be better for that particular defendant to tell the whole truth; to explain that he was there, he was at the top of the stairs and the other two men were at the bottom of the stairs and did the other things."
1977.76-5856,1,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1234.395,1242.523,"I think had defense counsel done so, sir, he certainly would have made a case of conflict and he could have merely outlined the --"
1977.76-5856,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1242.523,1246.412,Could he have done that -- could he have done that while he was representing all three?
1977.76-5856,1,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1251.204,1255.903,I think he should have gone to the Court when he perceived this conflict.
1977.76-5856,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1263.403,1270.579,"But, in order to go to the Court, would he had not had found it necessary to explain to the Court that these men were really guilty."
1977.76-5856,1,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1273.504,1289.133,"No sir, I think he could have gone to the Court and explained Your Honor, ?I have one of my three clients who wishes to testify and his defense is or the essence of his testimony will be totally antagonistic."
1977.76-5856,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1316.496,1318.169,This would be before the trial.
1977.76-5856,1,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1318.169,1319.154,"Yes, sir."
1977.76-5856,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1319.154,1321.525,"Well, what would have happened if that developed in the middle of the trial?"
1977.76-5856,1,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1321.525,1337.497,I think if it develops in the middle of the trial and the State does not refute the position if at any time during the trial it can be shown that a conflict actually exists then I think the trial court has the duty to declare a mistrial if it is in trial --
1977.76-5856,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1337.497,1341.682,And then what do you do with double jeopardy?
1977.76-5856,1,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1341.682,1343.076,"Arguably, due to --"
1977.76-5856,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1343.076,1344.311,"Yeah, it will be arguably?"
1977.76-5856,1,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1344.311,1348.052,"Yes, sir."
1977.76-5856,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1359.461,1368.766,But do you contend that the motion made at the opening of the trial which was a renewed motion was untimely?
1977.76-5856,1,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1368.766,1369.297,"No, sir."
1977.76-5856,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1371.657,1384.695,And you think the Court correctly said that the inability to cross examine a codefendant who wants to testify is an insufficient reason for a separate counsel?
1977.76-5856,1,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1384.695,1394.845,"Mr. Justice White, there was no indication, and the court had no indication, the Court was not advised as to even the real nature of the potential conflict here."
1977.76-5856,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1394.845,1396.661,"Alright, so your answer is no."
1977.76-5856,1,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1400.106,1402.21,"He was told that there was a possibility yes, sir."
1977.76-5856,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1402.21,1405.28,Possibility or they got up and said they were going to testify it.
1977.76-5856,1,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1405.28,1411.561,"Well, that was at the closure of the State's case, but the court had no information --"
1977.76-5856,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1411.561,1412.967,"Yes, that is right."
1977.76-5856,1,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1416.384,1416.839,Not necessary --
1977.76-5856,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1416.839,1419.727,The Court did not say it was that he just denied it.
1977.76-5856,1,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1419.727,1420.892,"That is right, because the court --"
1977.76-5856,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1420.892,1424.954,And he said that apparently the inability to cross-examine is insufficient reason --
1977.76-5856,1,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1424.954,1434.762,Because the court had no information before that there would be anything that would be antagonistic or indicative of a conflict at that time.
1977.76-5856,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1434.762,1440.291,"No, he did say -- the court said -- that is alright that they testified."
1977.76-5856,1,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1443.037,1450.616,Based on the information that the court had at the time which was minuscule merely that there was a possibility of a conflict of interest.
1977.76-5856,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1450.616,1467.434,"You do not think it would be an appropriate rule that a court would be obliged to accept the representation of a member of the bar if he tendered that as a member of the bar and as an officer of the court, that is not enough?"
1977.76-5856,1,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1467.434,1485.632,I think Mr. Chief Justice that the trial court bears a very grave responsibility and any such decision such as this needs to be made by an independent authority.
1977.76-5856,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1513.931,1519.857,But there is no question that he did deny the right to cross-examine the other defendants?
1977.76-5856,1,32419,joseph_h_purvis,,1519.857,1521.26,"Yes, sir, but there was nothing."
1977.76-5856,2,27296,harold_l_hall,,2257.337,2259.113,No Your Honor.
1977.76-5856,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2259.113,2259.68,Thank you gentleman.
