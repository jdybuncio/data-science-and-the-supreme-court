1999.99-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.732,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-391, Robin Free v. Abbott Laboratories."
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,9.815,12.9,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,79.497,87.396,"Mr. Small, you didn't raise the question whether any plaintiff in this class qualifies."
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,100.379,110.625,"It is true, Your Honor, that none of the plaintiffs have damages that would satisfy the then-applicable 50,000 dollars matter-in-controversy requirement."
1999.99-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,124.711,137.658,"But then their ability to collect those fees depends on their bringing other people with them, that is, the solo plaintiffs who don't qualify for Federal court jurisdiction."
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,137.658,139.1,That is precisely correct.
1999.99-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,154.243,159.566,"As I understand, you did bring that up below, but you didn't tender it to this Court."
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,159.566,167.395,"Well, Your Honor, we didn't specifically raise it because we didn't frame the question presented in that way."
1999.99-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,173.442,186.524,"Yes, but if it goes to the amount in controversy, or diversity jurisdiction, it is jurisdictional and, even if you didn't bring it up, you know that we would have an obligation to do so on our own."
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,186.524,188.637,"I believe that's correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,212.692,230.905,"Well, I don't want to detain you, because you want to argue Zahn and the effect of 1367, but I do see that as a major problem in this lawsuit, that these plaintiffs could qualify only because they bring other plaintiffs with them, and not in their individual right."
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,230.905,246.514,"I think, Your Honor, that goes to the appropriate result in this case if the Court were to reverse, because it would require that everyone's claims go back to State court, because the absent class members as well as the named plaintiffs would not have the amount--"
1999.99-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,246.514,256.534,"But it's a matter of Louisiana law, is it not, at least so the Fifth Circuit held, that the named plaintiffs get all of the attorney's fees?"
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,256.534,259.94,--That was decided as a matter of Louisiana law.
1999.99-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,260.952,262.559,But not as individuals.
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,271.685,275.678,--They would not get attorney's fees under the specific Louisiana statute.
1999.99-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,275.678,280.263,"So Louisiana permits them, as class representatives, to get these fees."
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,280.263,280.872,That's correct.
1999.99-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,280.872,287.86,"But to get them, they must pull other people along with them, and that was the only point that I was attempting to make."
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,287.86,288.174,That's correct.
1999.99-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,288.174,291.218,Why don't you address yourself to the question presented.
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,291.218,309.273,"Our view of the matter-in-controversy requirement is a permissible interpretation under section 1332, the diversity statute, and it's also the better reading of that statute for several reasons."
1999.99-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,343.822,350.501,"Well, when you say it could not be clearer, I take it you're talking about the legislative history and not the statute itself."
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,350.501,354.658,"We're talking about more than just the legislative history, Your Honor."
1999.99-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,360.466,367.052,"But don't we usually first look to find out what Congress intended, at the words that Congress wrote?"
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,367.052,369.438,"Yes, and looking at--"
1999.99-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,369.438,372.424,What is your view of that language?
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,372.424,380.854,"--My view of that language, Your Honor, is that section 1367's plain language has relevance to only one issue in this case."
1999.99-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,477.353,485.634,"Will you go back for a minute to 1367, and the Fifth Circuit ruled against you on this point, didn't it?"
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,485.634,486.094,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,486.094,490.61,And what is your response to the Fifth Circuit's construction of 1367?
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,490.61,500.251,"The Fifth Circuit overlooked, in our opinion, the original jurisdiction predicate in 1367."
1999.99-391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,524.865,526.832,"Unless they all qualify, nobody does."
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,526.832,528.518,"--That's exactly right, Your Honor."
1999.99-391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,528.518,530.327,Which is the rule that's applied for diversity.
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,530.327,531.695,That's precisely correct.
1999.99-391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,531.695,536.073,And you're just urging that the same rule be applied for amount.
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,536.073,542.104,"That's correct, and obviously there's the parallel between the other provision of--"
1999.99-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,542.104,542.614,"Just a minute, Mr. Small."
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,555.872,570.672,"--In the class action context, as this Court's decision in Ben Hur has subsequently been construed by lower courts, it is true that you look at the named plaintiffs to see whether they are diverse from each of the defendants."
1999.99-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,608.342,620.35,I was just trying to clarify that the Strawbridge rule of complete diversity doesn't apply in class actions to the extent that only the citizenship of named representatives count.
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,620.35,623.77,"--I agree with you in part, Your Honor."
1999.99-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,641.107,651.104,"Are you suggesting that today, in all the class actions that are brought in Federal court, that rule isn't observed, that only the named representatives count for diversity purposes?"
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,651.104,652.969,"--I'm not disputing that, Your Honor."
1999.99-391,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,658.571,663.852,"Now, you suggest that this statute changed the lower court's general reading of Ben Hur?"
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,663.852,670.307,"No, Your Honor, I don't believe that our interpretation would affect Ben Hur."
1999.99-391,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,709.75,713.963,Let me see if I understand your argument under 1367.
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,739.002,740.48,"Not quite, Justice Kennedy."
1999.99-391,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,767.682,769.144,But let me just be sure I understand.
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,788.258,796.324,"That's correct, Your Honor, and the reason is there would be coplaintiffs in the case, here absent class members, who do not have the jurisdictional amount."
1999.99-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,813.713,817.323,That just rules out supplemental jurisdiction altogether.
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,817.323,828.224,"--Well, Your Honor, it never existed before 1367 as to claims by plaintiffs joined under Rule 20 or Rule 23, so it's not a change in the law."
1999.99-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,830.993,836.986,"Well, but certainly one can read it as making a change in the law, as overruling Zahn."
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,836.986,840.358,"Well, that is, of course, what the question is here--"
1999.99-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,840.358,840.358,Yes.
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,840.358,848.086,"--Your Honor, and our point is that that's not an appropriate reading because, number 1, we know Congress didn't want to do that."
1999.99-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,848.086,851.042,How do you know?
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,857.186,872.846,"Well, we know that what Congress wrote in 1367 does not overrule Zahn because all that 1367 says is, you can have supplemental jurisdiction if there's first original jurisdiction."
1999.99-391,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,875.611,891.574,"But it... the statute begins by saying, except as provided in subsections (b) and (c), so it seems to me that to make your argument you have to go to (b) and then say that the first clause takes you out of it."
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,891.574,901.423,"If our position were that 1367(a) granted supplemental jurisdiction over the absent class members, we would have to get to (b) to say, but it took it away."
1999.99-391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,905.266,906.152,That's what I don't understand.
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,913.805,913.958,Well--
1999.99-391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,913.958,916.616,"--you're saying... you're saying... all right, we have a person called Smith."
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,921.997,922.319,--Yes.
1999.99-391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,922.319,935.798,"And now we're going to look to other members of the class, B, C, and D, and you're saying unless there's original jurisdiction also as to B, also as to C, also as to D, that the whole statute doesn't operate."
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,937.154,937.906,That is true.
1999.99-391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,937.906,938.136,All right.
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,975.623,979.905,"It has to do, Your Honor, with the scope of the matter-in-controversy rule."
1999.99-391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1005.632,1006.299,Why?
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,1015.626,1020.406,--But that's not the way the matter-in-controversy requirement has been interpreted in decisions--
1999.99-391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1020.406,1020.572,"Oh, no, no."
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,1041.236,1054.477,--I believe there are reasons that have been expressed by the Court in deciding whether the addition of certain claims into a diversity case are treated as a matter of original jurisdiction or as a matter of supplemental jurisdiction.
1999.99-391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1116.31,1136.852,"Since you're... you're way ahead of me because you're an expert on this and I'm not, so what... give me an example of somebody who, on your interpretation, 1367 would enable you to bring into the case, but without 1367 it wouldn't."
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,1136.852,1144.774,1367 did not expand supplemental jurisdiction at all.
1999.99-391,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1150.452,1150.848,Okay.
1999.99-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1152.674,1154.224,Why did Congress pass it?
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,1154.224,1158.048,Congress passed 1367 because of the Finley decision.
1999.99-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1222.436,1226.204,"Why... but Finley was a Supreme Court decision, right?"
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,1226.204,1226.885,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1226.885,1232.287,And what did Finley do that 1367 changed?
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,1232.287,1252.63,"Finley said there may... there cannot be an exercise of supplemental jurisdiction in a pendant party case unless there's statutory authority for that exercise, and Congress wanted to provide the missing statutory authority that the Finley court pointed out."
1999.99-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1255.181,1255.728,So--
1999.99-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1255.728,1266.083,"--So then at least it provided for pendant party jurisdiction, which this Court said didn't exist before absent explicit statutory authorization."
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,1266.083,1280.04,"That was the particular problem in Finley but, of course, there was concern that Finley could be read broader and, in fact, had been by some of the lower courts to justify denials of supplemental jurisdiction in other areas."
1999.99-391,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1280.04,1290.121,Did 1367 give jurisdiction to a Finley-type plaintiff where the Finley court had not given jurisdiction?
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,1290.121,1290.984,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-391,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1290.984,1299.145,"So then 1367 does confer jurisdiction on some plaintiffs at least, at least the Finley plaintiffs."
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,1299.145,1300.35,It restored--
1999.99-391,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1300.35,1301.115,Finley-type plaintiffs.
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,1301.115,1302.015,--The answer is yes.
1999.99-391,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1306.965,1307.521,I don't know if it restored.
1999.99-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1307.521,1307.841,Finley--
1999.99-391,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1307.841,1314.029,--This Court had said that there was no such jurisdiction.
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,1314.029,1320.635,It's true at the... it did change the law from the way it existed after the Finley case was decided.
1999.99-391,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1320.635,1320.766,All right.
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,1325.055,1326.668,"Well, Finley--"
1999.99-391,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1326.668,1332.833,As you read the statute as I'm suggesting you have to read it in order to get to your position.
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,1332.833,1342.746,"--There is, of course, a completely different history behind diversity jurisdiction compared to pendant party jurisdiction."
1999.99-391,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1402.639,1409.193,"The way you read the statute is that Congress told the Supreme Court, when you get another Finley case, would you think about it again?"
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,1413.057,1416.852,--We don't believe that that's what Congress was doing.
1999.99-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1422.839,1423.011,"Well, you gave--"
1999.99-391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1423.011,1428.884,"--Well, you say it would require us to come out the other way in the next Finley case, not just think about it again."
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,1431.44,1433.753,"It would do precisely that, Justice Scalia."
1999.99-391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1437.745,1450.836,"And Finley was a case involving supplemental jurisdiction, not involving Federal question jurisdiction in the first place, or, I'm sorry, Federal jurisdiction in the first place, involving supplemental jurisdiction."
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,1450.836,1451.571,That's correct.
1999.99-391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1451.571,1457.502,"And 1367 deals with what, supplemental jurisdiction, not original jurisdiction?"
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,1457.502,1458.165,That's correct.
1999.99-391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1458.165,1464.693,So it would be more likely for 1367 to be addressing itself to Finley than to Zahn.
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,1464.693,1466.084,That's correct.
1999.99-391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1471.903,1476.633,"And if you were going to address Zahn, presumably you'd be more likely to do it in 1332, no?"
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,1476.633,1481.64,"It would certainly make sense to do it in 1332, I agree, Justice Scalia."
1999.99-391,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1481.64,1495.203,"Now, you also had a point about an inconsistency that's created if you interpret 1367 in such a fashion as saying... as overruling Zahn."
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,1506.076,1541.48,"The inconsistency under the respondents' interpretation is that you can have a plaintiff come into a diversity case under Rule 20 in their supplemental jurisdiction over that plaintiff, but the very same plaintiff could not enter the case under Rule 19 when it was necessary, for instance, to avoid the potential for multiple liability or inconsistent obligations on the part of a defendant, and would also prohibit that very same plaintiff from coming in to the case as an intervenor under Rule 24 to protect his or her interests in the litigation."
1999.99-391,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1573.054,1583.6,"Then why do you... how do you explain the absence of Rule 23 in 1367(b), which enumerates several rules?"
1999.99-391,0,21481,daniel_a_small,,1583.6,1608.583,"There was no need, Your Honor, to include Rule 23 in 1367(b) because there's no original jurisdiction over class members who lack the jurisdictional amount, therefore there's no supplemental jurisdiction conferred over their claims by 1367(a), and therefore no need to exclude that jurisdiction in 1367(b)."
1999.99-391,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1611.654,1612.542,"Very well, Mr. Small."
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,1614.496,1619.145,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1694.9,1696.655,May I stop you at that point?
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,1696.655,1696.802,--Yes.
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1697.142,1714.107,"Is it reasonable to suppose that someone who has an individual claim of this nature, even treble, that is, for being overcharged for baby formula, would get attorney's fees so large that they could make the amount in controversy?"
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,1726.749,1743.448,"That's what it was over a period of time, Your Honor, and for numerous purchases during a year, trebled, but we would have a different case if the plaintiffs' lawyers had stipulated that in no circumstances would their fees be in excess of the requisite amount, but they didn't do that."
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1747.976,1750.291,"Well, there has to be... the Court would have to decide--"
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,1750.291,1750.912,--That's correct.
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1750.912,1776.984,"--if the case were brought originally in Federal court whether what you're claiming is a reasonable assertion of amount-in-controversy, and if I'm right that these claims are worth in the neighborhood of something like 100 dollars apiece, even trebled would be a 300 dollar claim, how could you expect a court to award on a claim of that size such an astronomical fee that would get you up to 50,000 dollars?"
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,1776.984,1802.877,"Well, as the Court observed... as the Court has observed in several of the cases where you get involved in questions of class action such as Zahn, the cost of prosecuting a case like this, and a cost of prosecuting that case, where the damages were being claimed... were themselves probably more than 100 dollars, but it doesn't really matter, 50,000 dollars, which was the jurisdictional amount at that time, is not an exorbitant, reasonable fee for attorneys to prosecute a case that was--"
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1802.877,1819.707,"Do you have any examples in Louisiana of a small claim getting under the provision on which you rely, 51: 137, a small claim attracting large legal fees under Louisiana law--"
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,1819.707,1819.97,--Well--
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1819.97,1820.474,--under that provision?
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,1820.474,1821.805,"--I don't off-hand, Your Honor."
1999.99-391,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1840.109,1844.473,"Well, and we generally defer to the court of appeals on questions of State law."
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,1855.489,1856.373,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1856.373,1865.85,"Mr. Cicero, have we ever held that for purposes of the amount-in-controversy statutes attorney's fees are included?"
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,1865.85,1868.403,"Your Honor, you held in the--"
1999.99-391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1868.403,1876.743,"That's a major Federal question, it seems... you think the amount-in-controversy doesn't just mean the claim, but it also includes attorney's fees?"
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,1876.743,1896.755,"--It includes... Your Honor held... Your Honor, the Court held in the Missouri Interstate Insurance, I think it was, the Jones case was the second name, in 1933 that attorney's fees under statutes like this were substantive matters and could be included for purposes of determining, and were included in that case--"
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1896.755,1898.2,You're right about that.
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,1901.367,1904.705,"--I don't remember off-hand, Justice Ginsburg."
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1909.628,1942.303,"It's a 1933 decision, and the fee... the Court... it was a 250 dollar attorney's fees, then upped to 550 dollars, and in response, in your response to the Chief Justice before, I do not see in Judge Higginbotham's opinion anything that says that under Louisiana law that second statute would justify a fee of this size."
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,1942.303,1943.349,"Well, the--"
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1943.349,1946.216,"And if there is something that I missed in the opinion, point it out to me."
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,1946.216,1964.281,"--Well, the Court... the only thing that's different between the two statutes was the question that Your Honor asked first, and that is whether 595, which deals specifically with class actions, if this was not a class action, therefore you did not have the attribution to the named plaintiffs, whether the case did not fail for that reason."
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1997.078,2010.617,"I'm just suggesting that there aren't awards of that size made when you're not representing a class where the recovery will... aggregated, the recovery will be very large."
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2016.517,2026.656,"Well, that's correct, but as the Court knows, in several of these cases, including the Clark case, that the plaintiffs are in effect... the petitioner is in effect asking this Court to overrule."
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2051.264,2052.775,Snyder said you couldn't aggregate.
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2055.273,2055.568,--Well--
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2055.568,2056.812,--Snyder supports his position.
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2056.812,2087.438,"--Well, Snyder... it was correct in the holding that you couldn't aggregate, but with respect to the doctrine of the case, which was citing Clark, that you cannot... that only plaintiffs who have the requisite amount can stay in Federal court, both Clark and Zahn, because Zahn had four plaintiffs, both of those were cited and relied on Clark in citing the rule that only plaintiffs who had the requisite amount could stay, but the court did not lose jurisdiction, because there had been plaintiffs without the requisite--"
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2087.438,2090.362,"Yes, but they wouldn't have jurisdiction over the class action."
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2095.443,2096.083,--That's correct.
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2096.083,2099.212,"And let me... since you brought that up, what about this very case?"
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2115.695,2117.337,"Yes, they could, if the court--"
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2117.337,2118.127,On the basis that--
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2118.127,2126.17,"--If the court reasonably made the judgment that prosecuting that case would amount to, or would require more than 50,000 dollars in reasonable attorney's--"
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2126.17,2142.594,"--If the court decided that on those individual claims there could be a fee of that size justified, and you have not been able to tell me, at least this morning, that there's any small claim in Louisiana in which a court ever awarded a fee of that size."
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2142.594,2144.146,"--I'm not able to this morning, Your Honor, that's correct."
1999.99-391,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2144.146,2146.687,Would you address yourself now to the question presented?
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2146.687,2147.82,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice."
1999.99-391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2200.984,2202.188,"Well, they could all go to State court."
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2209.202,2210.816,"--Well, they could all go to State court--"
1999.99-391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2210.816,2210.97,Sure.
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2210.97,2219.414,"--but if... if, Justice Scalia, the named plaintiffs met the requisite standards for diversity of citizenship, the defendants could remove."
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2222.305,2232.681,"Mr Cicero, I... I'm just going back to your prior answer, because you're... and under your prior answer, every one of these class members could stay in State court."
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2239.327,2239.858,--Yes.
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2239.858,2253.589,"But the named representatives are just like every other member of the class as far as the stake that they have, the claim that they have, so all you would have to do is add a whole slew of other names."
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2259.885,2261.515,"Well, that's correct."
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2279.372,2291.757,"Well, that's only if you read the statute as allowing them to bring along the others to test whether they have the amount, or you take... forget about 595."
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2308.219,2324.105,"--Once there is original jurisdiction, as is, I believe, set forth in the question presented, then there clearly is supplemental jurisdiction here because of subsection (a) of 1367, no exception under subsection (b)--"
1999.99-391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2324.105,2329.633,"Right, but your opponent contests precisely whether there is original jurisdiction."
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2329.633,2330.005,--I understand that.
1999.99-391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2330.005,2345.068,"And he contests your assertion that by reason of Clark, when you file a suit in which some of the plaintiffs do not meet the jurisdictional amount requirement, there is jurisdiction over the suit."
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2383.131,2383.975,That's not what happened--
1999.99-391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2383.975,2384.857,Unless and until you dismiss--
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2384.857,2385.469,--Excuse me.
1999.99-391,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2385.469,2387.554,--the people who don't meet the jurisdictional requirement.
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2387.554,2392.205,"That's what... no, because precisely what happened in Clark is what Your Honor is postulating here."
1999.99-391,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2417.383,2425.838,"What do you think about the argument they made, which I take it was that this statute's just interested in changing the result in Finley?"
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2468.894,2471.98,"I think he's... I think petitioner is clearly wrong on that, Your Honor."
1999.99-391,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2492.651,2506.398,"Well, you're absolutely right, in my opinion, that literally the language would cover an over... overturning Zahn too, but then it would also cover, literally, permissive joinder under Rule 20."
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2512.582,2513.422,I'm sorry.
1999.99-391,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2513.422,2514.566,You don't agree with that.
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2536.423,2544.7,"I'm not saying that... I... they may well have done that because of Rule... the subsection (b), to the extent--"
1999.99-391,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2544.7,2546.503,"No, it doesn't apply to my case, I know."
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2546.503,2546.656,--I understand that.
1999.99-391,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2549.383,2571.692,"Right, so if you... you're either saying... so that you are now going to say that indeed, since you want a literal interpretation of this language, you're saying that not only did this statute overturn Zahn, it also turned... overturned what I call is the pillar of this obscure area of the law, namely Strawberry, or... is that the case?"
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2573.061,2573.214,Strawbridge--
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2573.214,2573.335,--Strawbridge--
1999.99-391,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2573.335,2573.945,--Yes.
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2583.348,2610.79,"Well, Your Honor, I don't know whether anybody ever noticed it or not, because the... there were a lot of academics crawling over this area, as the Court knows, and they wrote a lot of things about it, including some in the legislative history, but the statute... and of course it's well-accepted the statute clearly operates to say in this case, Zahn notwithstanding, the absent class members, there is jurisdiction despite the fact they may not make the requisite amount."
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2618.862,2622.399,"Mr. Cicero, you said... you said that everybody agrees on that."
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2625.101,2627.268,"Well, that's correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2627.918,2631.876,So everybody... the Tenth Circuit in fact found 1367 ambiguous.
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2631.876,2638.267,"--Well, they... the Tenth Circuit said that they were going to look at the statutory construction, that's correct."
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2640.587,2658.033,"So we can't say... now, there were certainly a lot of academic commentators about the time of Zahn that said Zahn was wrongly decided, because it should have been like Ben Hur, that only the named representatives' amount-in-controversy mattered, not the class members, but that debate was in the 1970's--"
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2658.033,2658.715,Well--
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2658.715,2661.369,--and Zahn has existed since then.
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2661.369,2686.503,"--Some of the commentators, Your Honor, were people like the ones we cite in our footnote, in the footnote at page 6 of our brief, who stated in an article afterward that they realized that they had to correct what the plain language of the statute said, and so that footnote... that one sentence was put into the legislative history in a section dealing with subsection (b), by the way."
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2724.014,2735.19,"Well, if you take Mr. Small's interpretation you never get to (b), because (a)... because you're not... you can't have a Zahn-type claim under (a)."
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2751.765,2752.353,"Yes, Your Honor."
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2752.353,2758.508,"And everybody was concerned about Finley, and wasn't that the motive, motivating force--"
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2758.508,2758.749,Well--
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2758.749,2760.199,--for 1367?
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2760.199,2762.468,"--Two things with respect to your question, Your Honor."
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2796.618,2802.732,"Is that different from what, by the way... his interpretation different from the Tenth Circuit's interpretation of 1367?"
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2802.732,2806.665,"--I'm not sure, Your Honor, exactly how they got there."
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2851.855,2865.688,"Mr. Cicero, practically, if you have two people who present themselves as champions of a class, will they want to stay in Federal court as individual claimants and not continue to be champions of the class?"
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2876.91,2878.785,"--Well, it may well be they don't want to."
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2883.505,2886.332,"Well, they moved to remand because they wanted to be with the class, right."
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2886.332,2896.983,"--Well, they... and... they wanted to be with the class, and what they're asking here now by the result they're asking is that the Court in effect give them a remand by saying that there wasn't jurisdiction."
1999.99-391,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2909.699,2912.442,"May I ask a question, counsel?"
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,2942.949,2997.069,"--Well, Your Honor, what you should do here, I think, is that you should affirm the Fifth Circuit, because I think the reading of the statute was correct, and this goes to your question as well as the second part of Justice Ginsburg's question, the legislative history is not one-sided here, because the judicial... the Court Study Commission, which issued its report in April of 1990, the report of the commission itself had a simple statement concerning ancillary jurisdiction, or supplemental jurisdiction that it should be in anything arising out of the same case or controversy, but the subcommittee, as the Court knows, chaired by Judge Posner, had a statute very similar to what was finally enacted which did not refer to subsection, to Rule 23 in the draft of subsection (b), and which said the intention... as the report said, the intention was to overrule Zahn."
1999.99-391,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3105.559,3121.215,"Okay, but I take it there is no hint anywhere of an intent to overrule Strawbridge, and I take it that your position there has to be, no, there wasn't any intent to overrule it, but that's what the plain language does, and Congress can fix it up when it comes back next time if that's the case."
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,3122.288,3125.056,"--Well, that's correct, if... that's correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-391,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3125.056,3126.874,--I didn't... I wasn't sure what your position was in your brief--
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,3126.874,3127.081,If they made it--
1999.99-391,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3127.081,3128.698,--but that's the position you're taking here.

1999.99-391,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3133.953,3136.266,"Well, it almost certainly must be."
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,3152.697,3164.11,"--Well, Strawbridge doesn't go in its entirety, because the purpose of subsection, or the clear import of subsection (b) is to preserve Strawbridge in a great many examples."

1999.99-391,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3226.257,3226.393,Yes.

1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3276.25,3286.885,"But Mr. Cicero, it's one thing to say that, sub silentio, Congress overruled Zahn because the words literally read do that, to a 1973 case."
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,3289.339,3290.947,"--1806, I think."
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3290.947,3305.943,"And the thought that that mainstay of Federal diversity jurisdiction, that 1806 case, was overruled by 1367 I think is an awful lot to take on."
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,3305.943,3345.066,"Well, Your Honor, I think that what's happened here, perhaps, with respect to that, is one of those gotchas that Judge Pollack talks about in one of the cases that's cited here and that comes up in certain places, and that is that with respect to the question of multiple plaintiffs under Rule 20, that the exceptions that were carved out may not have been broad enough to preserve in its entirety Strawbridge, but that doesn't mean that the statute should lead one, should lead the Court to the other extreme; that is, to import into it, into subsection (a) a meaning that doesn't make any sense with respect to having--"
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3345.066,3345.134,Well--
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,3345.134,3346.115,--subsection (b) at all.
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3348.077,3375.023,"--Well, you say, not in its entirety, but it seems to me when you're talking about initial joinder of plaintiffs, that's the heart of Strawbridge and of the complete diversity rule, and it just... to think of what that would throw into Federal courts if you were to have... if you were to say that 1367, with a few exceptions, has enacted minimal diversity, that's a very big step to take."
1999.99-391,1,23691,frank_cicero_jr,,3375.023,3398.176,"Well, I agree with Your Honor, but that's not what... what we're asking the Court to do here, and what the Fifth Circuit and the Seventh Circuit have held, and Judge Posner in another case in the Seventh Circuit the same thing, is that Rule 23, which is not included in the carve-outs of subsection (b), Rule 23 allows this case to go forward with the absent class members."
1999.99-391,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3402.577,3407.314,"But if you go on what's not in (b), rule 20 isn't in (b) either."

1999.99-391,2,21481,daniel_a_small,,3445.489,3447.823,"It's not correct, Your Honor."
1999.99-391,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3447.823,3448.515,Why not?

1999.99-391,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3557.151,3557.959,There was not.
1999.99-391,2,21481,daniel_a_small,,3563.31,3569.559,"It would, Your Honor, because the Federal Tort Claims Act works differently from the diversity statute."
