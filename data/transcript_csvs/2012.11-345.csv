2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,0.0,0.416,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2012.11-345,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.416,7.237,"Well, I get to say that this is Case Number 11-345, Fisher against the University of Texas at Austin."
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,8.304,11.622,"Mr. Chief Justice, General Suter trained me too well."
2012.11-345,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,43.96,54.135,"Mr. Rein, before we get to that, because the Court is supposed to raise it on its own: The question of standing."
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,75.131,83.052,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, the first injury that was before the court was the use of a system which denied equal treatment."
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,88.67,99.312,"How do you get past Texas v. Lesage with that injury, which says that mere use of race is not cognizable injury sufficient for standing?"
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,99.312,116.623,"Lesage was litigated on its merits, and the question was whether Lesage could carry his case when -- on summary judgment when it was apparent that his complaint, which was that he was denied access to the graduate program at the University of Texas, was not sustainable."
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,134.418,136.27,Can I go to another side?
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,137.437,138.303,--Correct.
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,138.303,143.841,She disclaimed the desire after her application to go to the school at all.
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,149.677,151.362,"No, that's not correct, Your Honor."
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,164.854,165.687,But she's graduated.
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,165.687,166.687,--She has graduated.
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,166.687,167.889,"Injunctive relief, she's not going to get."
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,173.793,178.328,"Well, that issue, of course, is bifurcated, and we've reserved the ability to--"
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,178.328,180.697,"But you have to claim an injury, so what's the injury--"
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,180.697,181.347,--Well--
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,181.347,184.566,--that you're claiming that would sustain a claim of damages?
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,184.566,191.319,"--the denial of her right to equal treatment is a constitutional injury in and of itself, and we had claimed certain damages on that."
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,195.206,198.408,You still haven't answered how Lesage gets away from that--
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,198.408,199.125,"Well, if there's--"
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,199.125,200.693,--but if there's a -- give me another--
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,200.693,201.193,"--Well, I think--"
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,201.193,202.109,--damages question.
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,202.109,215.767,"--On the -- if we then, on remand, were to assert damages contingent upon the fact that she should have been admitted to UT and was not admitted, we would then have to prove that but for the use of race she would be admitted."
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,229.276,229.843,What damages--
2012.11-345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,229.843,248.84,"We've had cases involving alleged discrimination in state -- state contracting, and we haven't required the person who was discriminated against because of race to prove that he would have gotten the contract otherwise, have we?"
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,248.84,249.724,"--No, sir."
2012.11-345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,249.724,253.559,It's -- it's been enough that there was a denial of equal protection.
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,253.559,255.494,"That is our correct, and that is our first premise."
2012.11-345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,288.881,296.702,"Her claim is not necessarily that she would have been -- would have been admitted, but that she was denied a fair chance in the admission lottery."
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,305.676,308.711,"Yes, Justice Scalia, I agree with that."
2012.11-345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,308.711,319.317,"If you are going to the merits, I want to know whether you want us to -- or are asking us to overrule Grutter."
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,339.748,357.775,"Justice Breyer, we have said very carefully we were not trying to change the Court's disposition of the issue in Grutter, could there be a legitimate, a compelling interest in moving -- in using race to establish a diverse class."
2012.11-345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,371.469,378.039,"So your question is whether -- your point is, does your case satisfy Grutter?"
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,379.475,381.658,"--We litigated it on that basis, yes."
2012.11-345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,381.658,384.693,"Well, how do you want to argue it right now in the next ten minutes?"
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,390.93,395.334,"Well, Justice Breyer, our argument is we can satisfy Grutter if it's properly read."
2012.11-345,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,396.467,401.738,"May I ask you on that specifically, let's take away the 10 percent solution."
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,426.936,437.994,"--Well, I think that there would be flaws under Grutter even if you assumed away something that can't be assumed away because it is a matter of Texas law, that is, there is a top 10 percent program, and that--"
2012.11-345,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,437.994,440.946,"Well, then the question is can you have both?"
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,457.639,460.675,"--Well, I don't agree with that, and let me explain why."
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,495.081,506.888,"--The one social studies that this University did said that minority students overwhelmingly, even with the numbers they have now, are feeling isolated."
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,517.612,520.914,"Well, the survey was -- a random survey."
2012.11-345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,529.504,537.324,Was it done before or after they announced the decision to reinstitute racial quotas?
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,537.324,540.943,--It was done after President Faulkner had made the declaration they were going to do it.
2012.11-345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,542.109,545.395,Which came almost immediately after our decision on Grutter.
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,545.395,546.545,"--On the -- I believe, on the same day."
2012.11-345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,546.545,557.803,"And by the way, do you think that Grutter -- this goes to Justice Breyer's question -- do you think that Grutter held that there is no more affirmative action in higher education after 2028?"
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,557.803,558.553,"No, I don't."
2012.11-345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,558.553,559.588,Was that the holding of Grutter?
2012.11-345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,559.588,567.074,"I agree it might, but I want to get to the question, see what I'm trying to pinpoint, because we have such a limited time."
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,618.959,622.577,I'm not sure we agree with those courts in their method of analysis.
2012.11-345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,622.577,629.748,"But we have a rule that if two courts say it, we're very reluctant, on something connected with facts, to overturn it."
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,631.867,639.789,"And -- particularly in the case of considering alternatives that have worked about as well, I think that's a legal question this Court is free to act on."
2012.11-345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,639.789,641.689,"There are facts and there are facts, aren't there?"
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,641.689,653.346,"So if I might try to answer your question, there was no effort in this case to establish even a working target for critical mass."
2012.11-345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,671.925,680.264,That -- that's a normal fact that we accede to two-court holdings on: Whether there is or is not a critical mass?
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,680.264,681.383,--No.
2012.11-345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,681.966,683.05,It's a weird kind of a fact.
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,683.05,684.901,--And I'm -- I'm not saying--
2012.11-345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,684.901,686.284,"It's an estimation, isn't it?"
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,688.369,690.055,"--Justice Scalia, that is correct."
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,693.84,696.125,So could you tell me what a critical mass was?
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,728.328,733.215,"--Well, we don't believe that demographics are the key to underrepresentation of critical mass."
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,733.215,741.821,"No -- putting aside -- I don't -- I'm not going to quarrel with you that if demographics alone were being used, I would be somewhat concerned."
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,757.081,766.103,"Well, I think if you start to split out subgroups of minorities, you mistake I think what I think is the proper thrust of Grutter, or at least ought to be."
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,766.103,769.805,It might be -- it might be insulting to some to be thrown into a pot.
2012.11-345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,769.805,772.59,Why -- why don't you seriously suggest that?
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,793.337,795.987,Certainly -- racial balance--
2012.11-345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,795.987,798.139,"I wish you would take that position, because it seems to me right."
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,798.139,806.728,"--Justice Scalia, racial balancing is not a permissible interest, and we are constantly -- this Court has constantly held not a permissible interest."
2012.11-345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,853.208,863.997,"But the test is -- the test is, in your opinion -- I have to write this in the opinion, you say -- the proper test of critical mass is is the minority isolated, unable to speak out."
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,868.634,869.201,Yes.
2012.11-345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,870.451,871.253,Isolated.
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,874.705,892.499,"--In Grutter, the Court assumed that the very small number of admissions, minority admissions, looked at as the whole -- and it was looked at as a whole, only as a whole in Grutter -- would have yielded about 3 or 4 percent minority admission in a class of 350, which means about 12 to 15 students--"
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,892.499,895.035,So what are you telling us is the standard of critical mass?
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,916.882,919.732,--We -- it's not our burden to establish the number.
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,923.017,925.167,"Well, they told -- they told the district court."
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,954.036,960.69,"--Well, if you are allowed to state all the grounds that need to be proved, you will always prove them, in all fairness, Justice Sotomayor."
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,961.84,965.458,"Well, but given it was in the evidence, what more do you think they needed?"
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,975.414,982.135,--What we're saying in the brief was they were generating in fact a very substantial number of minority presence on campus.
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,982.135,982.885,That's enough now.
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,982.885,983.785,And--
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,983.785,984.368,That's what you're saying.
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,984.368,984.835,--No.
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1000.863,1013.487,"Tell me -- tell me what about their use of race did not fit the narrow tailoring, not the necessity prong as you've defined it, but the narrow tailoring that Grutter required?"
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1019.891,1021.526,And for this purpose--
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1021.526,1023.026,Assuming that the need is there.
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1024.628,1033.334,"--Put -- put aside whether this was necessary and whether it was an appropriate last resort in a quest for diversity and critical mass, because Grutter's not without limits."
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1049.51,1051.195,So you have to set a quota for critical mass?
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1051.195,1052.095,No.
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1069.757,1074.645,"So we won't call it a quota; we'll call it a goal, something Grutter said you shouldn't have."
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1074.645,1089.654,"--Well, Justice Sotomayor, I think it's very important to distinguish between the operative use of that range, in other words, that's where we are, and we're going to use race until we get there every year in consideration of each application, which was a problem."
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1089.654,1102.395,"Boy, it sounds awfully like a quota to me that Grutter said you should not be doing, that you shouldn't be setting goals, that you shouldn't be setting quotas; you should be setting an individualized assessment of the applicants."
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1106.282,1110.734,"This system doesn't -- I mean, it's not narrowly tailored because it doesn't fit."
2012.11-345,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1114.136,1119.09,"Mr. Rein, do you understand what the University of Texas thinks is the definition of a critical mass?"
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1120.774,1123.609,"--Well, it simply reiterated the language of Grutter."
2012.11-345,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1125.943,1135.033,"Mr. Rein, it seems to me that in your talking about critical mass, you are relying entirely on the 10 percent is enough."
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1148.091,1168.087,"--Well, let me tell you that if you look outside the Top 10, at the so-called AI/PAI admits only -- forget the Top 10 for a minute, they were generating approximately 15 percent minority admissions outside the Top 10, which is in -- above what the target was in Grutter."
2012.11-345,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1172.339,1173.824,Because of the 10 percent.
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1173.824,1179.11,"--No, it was -- I'm talking about only the non-Top 10 percent admissions."
2012.11-345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1191.668,1193.87,And -- and this was before the adoption of the plan.
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1193.87,1194.72,That is correct.
2012.11-345,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1194.72,1195.988,"Well, I'm sorry."
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1202.391,1203.108,No.
2012.11-345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1261.514,1266.418,"Could you comment on this, and then I hope we can get back to Justice Alito's question."
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1285.629,1286.545,"Well, it's a question--"
2012.11-345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1286.545,1288.728,Then -- let's assume--
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1288.728,1289.913,"--Excuse me, Justice Kennedy."
2012.11-345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1289.913,1293.032,--that it resulted in the admission of many minorities.
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1299.286,1299.953,Well--
2012.11-345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1299.953,1301.471,--I see an inconsistency here.
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1301.471,1302.271,--Well--
2012.11-345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1302.271,1313.195,"Is it -- are you saying that you shouldn't impose this hurt or this injury, generally, for so little benefit; is that the point?"
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1313.195,1314.862,"--Well, yes, that's part of it."
2012.11-345,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1341.63,1346.084,But -- the race-neutral alternative is the 10 percent plan?
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1346.084,1354.439,--The race-neutral alternative includes an extension of the 10 percent plan because it's a major generator of minority admissions.
2012.11-345,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1356.822,1361.843,"But you say, and that's okay because it's -- it's race-neutral, but is it really?"
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1370.782,1372.065,"Well, we say--"
2012.11-345,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1372.065,1381.173,And that -- the only way it works is if you have heavily separated schools.
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1406.388,1409.824,"--But, Justice Ginsburg, let -- let me say that -- that a lot of that is speculative."
2012.11-345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1417.013,1417.546,Excuse me.
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1422.082,1423.1,--Correct.
2012.11-345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1423.1,1427.469,--to say this -- this is not good for education because people will take easy courses.
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1429.403,1430.254,Correct.
2012.11-345,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1430.254,1434.991,Anybody who is in the top 10 percent of any school in the state gets into the University of Texas.
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1434.991,1435.541,Yes.
2012.11-345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1458.423,1461.375,Or they could -- this is what is underlying my thing here.
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1485.824,1486.607,No--
2012.11-345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1486.607,1487.124,Okay.
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1512.307,1513.157,--But Justice--
2012.11-345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1513.157,1514.676,"I saw what happened, you saw the numbers."
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1516.326,1518.128,"--Justice Breyer, just -- I will answer your question."
2012.11-345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1519.345,1522.33,"You can answer it later if you want, or not answer it at all if you don't."
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1523.949,1526.151,"No, I am perfectly happy to -- to answer your question."
2012.11-345,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1536.007,1536.673,Uh-huh.
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1536.673,1540.577,So I just want to make clear the record doesn't depend -- they don't depend on race to do it.
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1561.657,1567.911,"So now we're going to tell the universities how to run and how to weigh qualifications, too?"
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1567.911,1570.763,--It's not the job of the Court to tell them how to do it.
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1577.5,1586.44,Could you tell me again how race and their use of race overwhelms those other factors in their system as it's created?
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1586.44,1589.308,I -- the question is not whether it overwhelms them.
2012.11-345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1615.142,1633.92,"Well, perhaps you could summarize by saying -- by telling us, from your point of view, this plan fails strict scrutiny on one or two or both levels, (a), because the objective is inappropriate or ill defined, and, (b), because of the implementation is defective."
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1636.722,1639.24,"We have argued both, and we continue to argue both."
2012.11-345,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1641.692,1648.346,And in what respect does this plan fail strict scrutiny under either of those -- under both of those categories?
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1648.346,1648.88,--Okay.
2012.11-345,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1700.481,1708.837,"Counsel, you are the one who in your brief has assumed that they are valuing different races differently."
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1757.584,1759.353,--There is a plus because of race.
2012.11-345,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1825.662,1829.866,We will afford you rebuttal time since our questions have prevented you from reserving it.
2012.11-345,0,17998,bert_w_rein,,1829.866,1830.666,Thank you.
2012.11-345,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1830.666,1831.483,Mr. Garre.
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1831.483,1833.568,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-345,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1856.783,1863.837,"I -- I put that in the narrow tailoring category, that it is narrowly tailored the way Grutter did, said."
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1872.36,1896.158,"That's right, and so that's the second point I was going to make, which is that the holistic admissions process at issue here is a necessary counterpart to the State's Top 10 Percent Law and works to systematic -- to offset the systematic drawbacks of that law in achieving an interest that is indisputably compelling, the university's interest of assembling a broadly diverse student body."
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1896.158,1900.344,"Counsel, before -- I need to figure out exactly what these numbers mean."
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1905.931,1909.485,"Your Honor, there is a multiracial box."
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1914.704,1920.007,"Well, I suppose a person who is one-quarter percent Hispanic, his own determination, would be I'm one-quarter percent Hispanic."
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1920.007,1922.042,"--Then they would check that box, Your Honor, as is true--"
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1922.042,1923.325,They would check that box.
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1924.827,1929.613,"--Your Honor, that was -- they would make that self-determination, Your Honor."
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1935.433,1941.171,"Would it violate the honor code for someone who is one-eighth Hispanic and says, I identify as Hispanic, to check the Hispanic box?"
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1941.171,1942.873,"--I don't think -- I don't think it would, Your Honor."
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1948.027,1951.812,You don't check in any way the racial identification?
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1951.812,1955.114,"We do not, Your Honor, and no college in America, the Ivy Leagues, the Little Ivy Leagues, that I'm aware of."
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1955.114,1958.799,So how do you know you have 15 percent African American -- Hispanic or 15 percent minority?
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1958.799,1966.154,"Your Honor, the same way that that determination is made in any other situation I'm aware of where race is taken into account."
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1966.154,1967.304,You say the same way.
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1968.271,1971.123,The persons self-identify on that form.
2012.11-345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1971.123,1972.725,Do they have to self-identify?
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1972.725,1973.808,"They do not, Your Honor."
2012.11-345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1976.76,1978.062,And how do they decide?
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,1997.024,1999.376,"No, Your Honor, and let me try to be clear on this."
2012.11-345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2010.6,2012.133,I don't know what you are talking about.
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2025.11,2035.049,"This Court in Grutter, Your Honor, and maybe the most important thing that was said during the first 30 minutes was, when given an opportunity to challenge Grutter, I understood my friend not to ask this Court to overrule it."
2012.11-345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2049.892,2050.458,Fine.
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2052.66,2053.477,"--Well, Your Honor--"
2012.11-345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2053.477,2061.116,"Did they require everybody to check a box or they have somebody figure out, oh, this person looks 1/32nd Hispanic and that's enough?"
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2061.116,2068.806,"--They did a study, Your Honor, that took into account the same considerations that they did in discussing the enrollment categories--"
2012.11-345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2068.806,2069.772,What kind of a study?
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2069.772,2072.508,"--Well, Your Honor, it's in the Supplemental Joint Appendix."
2012.11-345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2072.508,2079.162,"Yes, it doesn't explain to me how they go about, classroom by classroom, deciding how many minorities there are."
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2079.162,2081.196,"Your Honor, there are student lists in each classroom."
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2082.079,2087.35,There are student lists in each classroom that have race identified with the students.
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2087.35,2088.167,"--No, no, Your Honor."
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2096.539,2099.841,"Oh, you go back to what they checked on the form."
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2099.841,2101.543,"--Your Honor, this was part of a--"
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2101.543,2104.312,That's a yes or no question.
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2113.251,2119.072,"--That is information that is available to the university, Your Honor, the race of students if they've checked it on the application."
2012.11-345,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2125.975,2132.812,"Well, on the classroom diversity, how does the non-Top 10 Percent part of the plan further classroom diversity?"
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2159.38,2162.065,"Well, Your Honor, first I think that 200 number is erroneous."
2012.11-345,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2164.267,2165.5,Per class?
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2165.5,2168.485,"--No, not -- not on a per-class basis."
2012.11-345,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2168.485,2169.671,Individuals in class.
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2169.671,2174.973,"I think in looking at the classrooms, Your Honor, what the university found was shocking isolation."
2012.11-345,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2174.973,2183.729,How many -- how many non-Top 10 Percent members of the two minorities at issue here are admitted in each class?
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2183.729,2187.049,"Your Honor, we didn't look specifically at that determination."
2012.11-345,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2213.431,2214.333,I really don't understand your answer.
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2221.737,2222.389,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-345,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2222.389,2226.091,And you know the total number who were admitted under the Top 10 Percent Plan?
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2226.091,2227.141,"We do, Your Honor."
2012.11-345,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2227.974,2230.726,"If you subtract A from B you'll get C, right?"
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2230.726,2231.912,"--Your Honor, at the time--"
2012.11-345,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2231.912,2234.062,And what is the value of C per class?
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2234.062,2240.518,"--Your Honor, I don't know the answer to that question, and let me try to explain why the university didn't look specifically to that."
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2266.399,2267.168,What is that number?
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2272.905,2274.272,"Your Honor, we don't have one."
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2275.691,2279.976,So how are we supposed to tell whether this plan is narrowly tailored to that goal?
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2279.976,2283.011,--To look to the same criteria of this Court in Grutter.
2012.11-345,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2287.646,2290.848,Does critical mass vary from group to group?
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2293.034,2295.319,--It certainly is contextual.
2012.11-345,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2306.543,2307.943,But could you answer my question?
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2320.284,2322.303,"No, it's not at all."
2012.11-345,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2322.303,2322.869,It's not.
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2322.869,2323.386,It's not at all.
2012.11-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2331.925,2343.816,"Mr. Garre, could you explain -- I think you were trying to before -- what seems to me the critical question in this case: Why didn't the 10 percent solution suffice?"
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2353.857,2355.957,"--Let me make a couple of points, Your Honor."
2012.11-345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2392.565,2393.282,I don't understand that.
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2394.632,2410.711,"Because, Your Honor, as is true for any group, and the Harvard plan that this Court approved in Bakke specifically recognized this, you would want representatives and different viewpoints from individuals within the same -- the same racial group, just as you would from individuals outside of that."
2012.11-345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2410.711,2411.594,What kind of viewpoints?
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2414.146,2422.585,"Anyone's experiences, where they grew up, the situations that they -- that they experience in their lives are going to affect their viewpoints."
2012.11-345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2422.585,2424.419,But this has nothing to do with racial diversity.
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2426.053,2451.604,"Your Honor, I think it directly impacts the educational benefits of diversity in this sense, that the minority candidate who has shown that -- that he or she has succeeded in an integrated environment, has shown leadership, community service, the other factors that we looked at in holistic review, is precisely the kind of candidate that's going to come -- come on campus, help to break down racial barriers, work across racial lines, dispel -- stereotypes--"
2012.11-345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2451.604,2453.888,"Also, the kind that is likely to be included within the 10 percent rule."
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2456.723,2459.108,"--1998, Your Honor."
2012.11-345,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2486.092,2495.031,"Well, I thought that the whole purpose of affirmative action was to help students who come from underprivileged backgrounds, but you make a very different argument that I don't think I've ever seen before."
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2547.899,2548.684,"No, Your Honor."
2012.11-345,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2557.707,2563.777,"Well, how can the answer to that question be no, because being an African American or being a Hispanic is a plus factor."
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2563.777,2568.746,"Because, Your Honor, our point is, is that we want minorities from different backgrounds."
2012.11-345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2572.3,2575.269,So what you're saying is that what counts is race above all.
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2575.269,2578.052,"No, Your Honor, what counts is different experiences--"
2012.11-345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2578.052,2582.489,"Well, that's the necessary -- that's the necessary response to Justice Alito's question."
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2582.489,2589.225,"--Well, Your Honor, what we want is different experiences that are going to -- that are going to come on campus--"
2012.11-345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2589.225,2592.51,You want underprivileged of a certain race and privileged of a certain race.
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2593.377,2596.229,"--No, Your Honors, it's -- it's not race."
2012.11-345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2605.902,2615.543,"But the reason you're reaching for the privileged is so that members of that race who are privileged can be representative, and that's race."
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2616.326,2620.864,"--It's -- it's members of the same racial group, Your Honor, bringing different experiences."
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2633.171,2633.971,Counsel--
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2633.971,2636.373,And that's -- that's the interests that we're discussing here.
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2640.675,2649.447,--I understand my job under our precedents to determine if your use of race is narrowly tailored to a compelling interest.
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2662.191,2668.595,"--Your Honor, what -- what this Court's precedents say is a critical mass is an environment in which students of underrepresented--"
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2668.595,2672.129,"I know what you say, but when will we know that you've reached a critical mass?"
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2672.129,2672.579,--Well--
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2672.579,2676.164,Grutter said there has to be a logical end point to your use of race.
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2680.168,2684.104,"--Your Honor, this question, of course, implicates Grutter itself."
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2699.964,2703.416,"So, what, you conduct a survey and ask students if they feel racially isolated?"
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2703.416,2704.768,That's one of the things we looked at.
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2704.768,2707.053,And that's the basis for our Constitutional determination?
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2707.053,2708.77,"Your Honor, that's one of the things that we looked at."
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2708.77,2709.086,Okay.
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2709.587,2722.245,"Another is that we did look to enrollment data, which showed, for example, among African Americans, that African American enrollment at the University of Texas dropped to 3 percent in 2002 under the percentage plan."
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2722.245,2724.112,At what level will it satisfy the critical mass?
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2724.112,2727.299,"Well, I think we all agree that 3 percent is not a critical mass."
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2728.266,2731.168,"Yes, but at what level will it satisfy the requirement of critical mass?"
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2731.168,2733.62,When we have an environment in which African Americans do not--
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2733.62,2739.191,When -- how am I supposed to decide whether you have an environment within particular minorities who don't feel isolated?
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2739.191,2745.595,"--Your Honor, part of this is a -- is a judgment that the admin -- the educators are going to make, but you would look to the same criteria--"
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2745.595,2747.445,"So, I see -- when you tell me, that's good enough."
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2747.445,2749.047,"--No, Your Honor, not at all."
2012.11-345,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2760.687,2768.793,"But would 3 percent be enough in New Mexico, your bordering state, where the African American population is around 2 percent?"
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2768.793,2770.226,"Your Honor, I don't think it would."
2012.11-345,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2790.088,2805.715,"--Mr. Garre, I think that the issue that my colleagues are asking is, at what point and when do we stop deferring to the University's judgment that race is still necessary?"
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2826.463,2852.078,"I think the standard you would apply is the one set forth in Grutter, and it comes from Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke, that you would look to whether or not the University reached an environment in which members of underrepresented minorities, African Americans and Hispanics, do not feel like spokespersons for their race, members -- an environment where cross-racial understanding is promoted, an environment where the benefit -- educational benefits of diversity are realized."
2012.11-345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2860.7,2865.088,"But that holds for only -- only another what, 16 years, right?"
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2868.056,2871.242,"--Your Honor, we don't read Grutter as establishing that kind of time clock."
2012.11-345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2872.392,2874.36,"But you're appealing to Grutter, and that's what it said."
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2874.36,2877.478,"--Well, Your Honor, Grutter is this Court's precedence."
2012.11-345,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2889.586,2890.486,Mr.--
2012.11-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2890.486,2890.969,Mr. Garre.
2012.11-345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2890.969,2895.587,"Some of the stuff that Grutter says -- some of the stuff that Grutter says you agree with, some of the stuff that it says you don't agree with."
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2895.587,2898.289,"--Well, I don't know that I've disagreed with anything it said."
2012.11-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2898.756,2912.997,"Mr. Garre, before your time is -- runs out, the other point that I'd like you to answer is the argument based on Parents Involved, that the gain is just too small to warrant using a racial criteria."
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2912.997,2913.516,--Your Honor--
2012.11-345,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2913.516,2917.301,"Once you have the 10 percent, you don't need more."
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2921.852,2928.922,"--First I'd point to my friend's own concessions, that the consideration of race has increased racial diversity at Hispanic and helps with minority enrollment."
2012.11-345,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2945.467,2949.669,"Well, in terms of diversity, how do you justify lumping together all Asian Americans?"
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2953.137,2953.804,Your Honor--
2012.11-345,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2953.804,2955.304,--Cambodian Americans?
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2955.304,2961.458,"--the common form that's used has Asian American, but also, next to that, has a form that says country of origin where that can be spelled out."
2012.11-345,1,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2961.458,2966.595,But do you have a critical mass as to all the subgroups that fall within this enormous group of Asian Americans?
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2966.595,2973.783,"Your Honor, we've looked to whether or not we have a critical mass of underrepresented minorities, which is precisely what the Grutter decision asks us to do."
2012.11-345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2976.902,2978.918,"--If I could, before we get to that."
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,2978.918,2979.435,--I'm sorry.
2012.11-345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2979.435,2994.947,"Suppose we -- that you, in your experience identify a numerical category a numerical standard, a numerical designation for critical mass: It's X percent."
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3005.319,3005.869,No.
2012.11-345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3008.388,3009.538,--You -- you cannot do that?
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3009.538,3012.29,--We -- we wouldn't be monitoring the class.
2012.11-345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3013.242,3015.492,But isn't that what happened in Grutter; it allowed that.
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3015.492,3017.093,"--It did, Your Honor."
2012.11-345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3018.093,3019.145,So are you saying that Grutter is incorrect?
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3019.145,3020.162,"--No, Your Honor."
2012.11-345,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3025.132,3027.918,I'm -- I'm asking whether or not you could do that.
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3028.801,3037.024,"--I don't think so, because the Grutter majority didn't understand it to be monitoring for the purposes of reaching a specific demographic."
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3037.024,3044.194,"They don't -- they don't monitor, but race is the only one of your holistic factors that appears on the cover of every application, right?"
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3044.194,3052.2,"Well, all the holistic factors are taking into account on the application, and they're listed at various points on the application."
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3052.2,3052.717,I'm sorry.
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3057.27,3058.587,That -- that is true on the cover of the application.
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3060.805,3063.924,We will give you a little more time since I'm going to give your friend a little more time.
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3063.924,3064.757,Thank you.
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3083.319,3088.39,"Just to be clear, are you arguing that she doesn't have standing in an Article III sense?"
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3088.39,3089.742,"--Yes, Your Honor."
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3090.392,3093.361,"You address that in your brief in one footnote, right?"
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3101.549,3106.667,"--And there is another part of that that comes from the brief in opposition, Your Honor, which goes to the relief that she has requested."
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3136.02,3143.709,What about -- what about our Jacksonville case that said it is an injury to be forced to be part of a process in which there is race-conscious evaluation?
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3143.709,3151.363,"Texas v. Lesage says that that -- that injury is not sufficient in a backward-looking case like this, where you only have monetary damages."
2012.11-345,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3159.419,3168.907,I thought your friend -- your friend told us that these remedial issues and damages issues had been segregated out of the process and are still available for remand.
2012.11-345,1,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3168.907,3182.167,"--Your Honor, that is not an answer to jurisdiction for this reason: It's true that it is bifurcated in the sense that we could go and prove damages, but the complaint makes no doubt that the only request for monetary damages is a request for admissions fees."
2012.11-345,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3194.959,3197.142,"Well, that's part of the injury she suffered."
2012.11-345,2,17998,bert_w_rein,,3199.577,3200.344,It's the only--
2012.11-345,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3200.344,3206.766,But she -- she had to pay an admissions fee for a process in which she was not treated fairly.
2012.11-345,3,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3206.766,3207.782,And the reason why--
2012.11-345,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3207.782,3209.566,Why shouldn't she get her money back?
2012.11-345,4,17998,bert_w_rein,,3209.566,3223.292,"--The reason why the payment of that fee doesn't redress the injury, Your Honor, is that she would have paid it even if Texas didn't consider race at all; and, therefore, the payment of the application fee back doesn't remedy the injury that she is complaining about."
2012.11-345,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3223.292,3230.013,"Can I ask you to get -- if this is easy, do it; if not, don't."
2012.11-345,5,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3265.971,3267.605,"--Your Honor, I don't have specific numbers."
2012.11-345,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3280.565,3293.372,"Since we are asking questions just about just curiosity, I am curious to know how many -- this is a very ambitious racial program here at the University of Texas."
2012.11-345,5,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3316.154,3321.456,"Your Honor, one of the things that the University of Texas does monitor is the racial climate on campus."
2012.11-345,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3324.408,3325.094,How many people?
2012.11-345,5,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3325.094,3325.727,I don't--
2012.11-345,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3325.727,3326.177,You don't.
2012.11-345,5,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3326.177,3334.632,"--have a specific number of people, Your Honor, but it is -- it is an important part of improving the educational experience for all students at the University of Texas no matter what their race."
2012.11-345,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3334.632,3335.449,"Thank you, counsel."
2012.11-345,5,25346,gregory_g_garre,,3335.449,3336.149,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2012.11-345,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3336.149,3348.023,General Verrilli.
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3348.023,3350.642,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2012.11-345,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3397.903,3406.093,Does the United States agree with Mr. Garre that African American and Hispanic applicants from privileged backgrounds deserve a preference?
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3406.093,3409.295,"I understand that differently, Justice Alito."
2012.11-345,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3467.131,3475.57,"If you have two applicants who are absolutely the same in every respect: They both come from affluent backgrounds, well-educated parents."
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3490.997,3491.781,--No.
2012.11-345,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3492.631,3500.804,"Do you agree with -- do you agree that that is an incorrect statement of the facts, or do you agree that that's an incorrect understanding of the Equal Protection Clause?"
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3500.804,3501.837,--I think it's both.
2012.11-345,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3521.884,3526.853,"Yes, but -- but the hypothetical is that the two applicants are entirely the same in all other respects."
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3526.853,3527.455,Right.
2012.11-345,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3527.955,3540.779,"And if -- if the ability to give a racial preference means anything at all, it certainly has to mean that, in the -- in the hypothetical given -- given by Justice Alito, the minority student gets in and the other one doesn't."
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3540.779,3542.464,"--I disagree, Justice Scalia."
2012.11-345,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3556.372,3562.443,It's not a matter of not everyone; it's a matter of two who are identical in all other respects.
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3562.443,3562.961,Right.
2012.11-345,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3562.961,3569.282,And what does the racial preference mean if it doesn't mean that in that situation the minority applicant wins and the other one loses?
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3569.282,3571.567,There may not be a racial preference in that situation.
2012.11-345,6,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3574.935,3578.137,I don't understand this argument.
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3588.176,3589.293,I don't think it's a tie-breaker.
2012.11-345,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3591.778,3593.897,It doesn't function more subtly in every case.
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3627.868,3629.236,It can make a difference.
2012.11-345,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3634.306,3636.057,You have to agree that it makes a difference in some cases.
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3636.057,3636.774,"--Yes, it does."
2012.11-345,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3636.774,3637.341,Okay.
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3637.341,3641.293,But it doesn't necessarily make a difference in the situation that Justice Alito posited--
2012.11-345,6,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3641.293,3648.364,"But that's the same -- the same would be true in -- of the Bakke plan, that in some cases it's going to make a difference."
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3655.137,3660.624,"--That -- that is exactly right, Justice Ginsburg, but the point is that it's not a mechanical factor."
2012.11-345,6,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3701.43,3709.85,"General, I think, as I take your answer, is that the supposition of Justice Alito's question is truly impossible under this system."
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3732.965,3733.599,That's correct.
2012.11-345,6,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3736.417,3737.769,Because no two people can be the same--
2012.11-345,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3737.769,3744.607,"To get back to what we're talking about, you -- as I understand it, race by itself is taken into account, right?"
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3753.696,3754.196,--Yes.
2012.11-345,6,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3791.571,3792.054,"All right, sir."
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3827.261,3828.227,--Not necessarily.
2012.11-345,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3832.748,3833.431,"Gentlemen, don't write--"
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3833.431,3835.264,--neither might get in.
2012.11-345,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3835.264,3836.45,Let me withdraw that hypothetical if you don't like that.
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3847.758,3848.474,Sure.
2012.11-345,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3848.474,3857.279,Why is it important for the ROTC program for commissioned officers that Texas have this other plan on top of the top 10 percent plan?
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3857.279,3871.289,Our -- our military effectiveness depends on a pipeline of well-qualified and well-prepared candidates from diverse backgrounds who are comfortable exercising leadership in diverse settings.
2012.11-345,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3871.289,3872.106,"Oh, I understand that."
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3873.373,3873.889,Right.
2012.11-345,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3873.889,3881.495,"--because the time is about to expire, so you've got a marginal candidate who wants to go to the University of Texas at Austin and is also interested in ROTC."
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3899.273,3900.34,"No, Justice Alito."
2012.11-345,6,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3900.34,3902.075,Then I don't understand the argument.
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3902.075,3926.424,"The point of educational diversity, the point of what the University of Texas is trying to achieve is to create an environment in which everyone develops an appropriate sense of citizenship, everyone develops the capacity to lead in a racially diverse society, and so it will benefit every ROTC applicant from the University of Texas."
2012.11-345,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3933.28,3939.933,"--General, how -- what is your view on how we tell whether -- when the University has attained critical mass?"
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3939.933,3945.421,I don't think critical -- I agree with my friend that critical mass is not a number.
2012.11-345,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3949.456,3950.006,Okay.
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3960.764,3963.649,"May I answer, Mr. Chief Justice?"
2012.11-345,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3963.649,3964.266,"Oh, yes."
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3964.266,3965.199,Thank you.
2012.11-345,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4060.707,4070.746,"We should probably stop calling it critical mass then, because mass, you know, assumes numbers, either in size or a certain weight."
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4070.746,4071.513,I agree.
2012.11-345,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4071.513,4072.515,So we should stop calling it mass.
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4072.515,4073.298,I agree.
2012.11-345,6,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4073.298,4075.384,Call it a cloud or something like that.
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4076.7,4084.256,I agree that critical mass -- the idea of critical mass has taken on a life of its own in a way that's not helpful because it doesn't focus the inquiry where it should be.
2012.11-345,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4087.275,4088.158,Sure.
2012.11-345,6,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4124.9,4088.158,Thank you.
2012.11-345,6,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4125.483,4126.383,"Thank you, General."
2012.11-345,7,17998,bert_w_rein,,4127.769,4131.387,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2012.11-345,7,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4133.673,4136.439,Just keeping the playing field level.
2012.11-345,7,17998,bert_w_rein,,4136.439,4142.611,"Well, that's what we're seeking in this case, Mr. Chief Justice, a level playing field for Abby Fisher."
2012.11-345,7,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4167.06,4175.5,Is your complaint limited to injunctive relief and the return of the $100?
2012.11-345,7,17998,bert_w_rein,,4177.65,4182.237,"--No, because it said, “ any and all other damages ”, at the point when we were writing it, which was--"
2012.11-345,7,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4182.237,4189.157,In Arizonans and Alvarez we said any all -- any and other -- all damages is too speculative.
2012.11-345,7,17998,bert_w_rein,,4195.996,4200.198,--And what I'm saying is that we never had the opportunity to develop the full damages--
2012.11-345,7,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4200.198,4200.815,In--
2012.11-345,7,17998,bert_w_rein,,4200.815,4201.415,--because of--
2012.11-345,7,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4201.415,4207.971,--In Arizonans and Alvarez we said you can't manufacture standing after the fact.
2012.11-345,7,17998,bert_w_rein,,4212.756,4222.045,"--The only specific number in the complaint, because of the point in time when it was filed was the application fee, which we believe--"
2012.11-345,7,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4222.045,4229.217,And you would have paid that no matter what; under any system of admission you would have paid the same $100.
2012.11-345,7,17998,bert_w_rein,,4229.217,4238.073,"--You would have paid the fee in return for a fair processing of the application, which she did not receive, and we think that is a claim that will be sustained."
2012.11-345,7,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4253.166,4254.702,"For what, nominal damages?"
2012.11-345,7,17998,bert_w_rein,,4254.702,4255.402,--No--
2012.11-345,7,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4255.402,4257.002,And then how do you get around Arizonans?
2012.11-345,7,17998,bert_w_rein,,4257.002,4268.525,"--Because as -- as in the BIO, what UT pointed out was there are other kinds of financial injuries which were not ascertainable at the time the complaint was filed because we were trying to put her into the university."
2012.11-345,7,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4268.525,4271.294,She was going to get a better job because she went to a different university?
2012.11-345,7,17998,bert_w_rein,,4271.294,4272.746,That's one of the things they suggested.
2012.11-345,7,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4357.333,4392.406,"You are not suggesting that if every minority student that got into a university got into only the physical education program; and in this particular university that -- that physical education program includes all the star athletes; so every star athlete in the school happens to be black or Hispanic or Asian or something else, but they have now reached the critical mass of 10, 15, 20 percent -- that the university in that situation couldn't use race?"
2012.11-345,7,17998,bert_w_rein,,4392.406,4393.775,"--Well, I think you are talking about--"
2012.11-345,7,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4393.775,4396.81,In the holistic way that Grutter permits?
2012.11-345,7,17998,bert_w_rein,,4396.81,4405.333,"--Well, if you are saying there's a -- a differentiated department of physical education, which is like a separate college, you have changed the nature of the hypothetical."
2012.11-345,7,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4405.333,4411.118,"No, it's just that every one of their students who happens to be a minority is going to end up in that program."
2012.11-345,7,17998,bert_w_rein,,4417.141,4422.776,"Well, if that were the case, remember the factor that is causing it, and you are assuming, is choice."
2012.11-345,7,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4443.239,4454.314,"Aren't they saying the same thing when they say, when we are looking at the holistic measure, we are looking for that student who is a -- that minority student who is a nuclear scientist?"
2012.11-345,7,17998,bert_w_rein,,4454.314,4455.433,--No.
2012.11-345,7,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4511.333,4519.856,"Is it any more unchecked than the Harvard plan which -- that started all this off in 1978, decided by Justice Powell?"
2012.11-345,7,17998,bert_w_rein,,4524.491,4526.926,"--Well, I mean, they are two different questions."
2012.11-345,7,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4646.789,4671.505,"So what you want me to do is go read back what we wrote in Grutter, go look what the underlying determinations of critical mass were there, go look exactly how it is being done in Texas -- which I have charts that help me see that -- and I will find enough of a difference that I can write some words that can be administered by 2,000 or 3,000 -- a thousand Federal judges as they try to deal with programs like this, in -- that's the point, is that right?"
2012.11-345,7,17998,bert_w_rein,,4671.505,4701.024,"Well, I'm saying if you clarify the needs and the necessity point, if you then look at some of the other deficiencies and clarify the -- the consideration of reasonably available alternatives as a necessity, if you then attribute that -- you attribute the weaknesses of the Texas program to the absence of those factors, I think you can fashion a result in this case which may or may not have to, quote, “ overrule ” Grutter."
2012.11-345,7,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4713.732,4715.516,"So you don't want to overrule Grutter, you just want to gut it."
2012.11-345,7,17998,bert_w_rein,,4715.516,4716.449,Excuse me?
2012.11-345,7,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4716.449,4717.635,You just want to gut it.
2012.11-345,7,17998,bert_w_rein,,4720.468,4721.07,Well--
2012.11-345,7,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4721.07,4729.693,"Now you want to tell universities that once you reach a certain number, then you can't use race anymore."
2012.11-345,7,17998,bert_w_rein,,4729.693,4731.843,"--Justice Sotomayor, I don't want to gut it."
2012.11-345,7,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4749.588,4750.504,"Thank you, counsel, counsel."
