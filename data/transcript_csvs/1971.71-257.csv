1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,41.397,43.238,Thank you Your Honor.
1971.71-257,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,228.498,241.728,Mr. Cornelius was your pleading against the United States proper under the Texas law of pleadings without a permissible type of claim to assert in the case that General Electric had a reason to sue?
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,241.728,245.362,"Yes Your Honor we believe it was, and --"
1971.71-257,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,245.362,249.713,Can the Antitrust claims be tried in State Court?
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,249.713,254.726,"No Your Honor, but at the time, we filed this pleading."
1971.71-257,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,268.441,273.739,So what's your answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist?
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,276.232,281.566,"Yes Your Honor, I understood him to ask if it was proper for us to bring the government in."
1971.71-257,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,281.566,284.082,Using a certain antitrust decree against the --
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,284.082,284.935,Not against the government.
1971.71-257,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,330.301,332.563,"Mr. Cornelius, straighten me out."
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,342.011,346.23,"Yes Your Honor, that's correct."
1971.71-257,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,396.575,398.468,Including the United States?
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,398.468,402.683,"Including the United States, yes Your Honor."
1971.71-257,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,409.492,413.247,"Did you say Mr. Cornelius, the United States prevailed at the trial?"
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,413.247,415.95,"No Your Honor, they were denied relief."
1971.71-257,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,419.652,422.46,"Denied, and in the case of General Electric, what happened?"
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,422.46,425.201,General Electric was absorbed of liabilities.
1971.71-257,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,425.201,426.115,I see.
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,426.115,426.551,General Electric --
1971.71-257,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,426.551,429.464,On the merits of finding it no liability.
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,429.464,432.105,"On General Electric Company, yes Your Honor."
1971.71-257,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,432.105,435.649,Is the United States here this time?
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,435.649,436.756,No Your Honor.
1971.71-257,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,468.828,472.5,Was pending jurisdiction argued?
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,472.5,472.76,I think --
1971.71-257,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,472.76,475.254,Was pendant jurisdiction argued in those supplemental briefs?
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,475.254,476.371,Yes it was Your Honor.
1971.71-257,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,528.757,541.609,"If that wasn't necessarily a whole issue unless there were jurisdiction placed in United States District Court, your position has been â€“ if it wasn't properly removed, there was as you say organic jurisdiction?"
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,541.609,543.067,Your Honor.
1971.71-257,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,543.067,547.301,But the fact that the parties had intent of the jurisdiction although it wouldn't help you if it wasn't?
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,547.301,548.88,Not if there was a lack of jurisdiction.
1971.71-257,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,559.018,561.957,What's was ahead of federal jurisdiction to say?
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,561.957,562.575,I beg your pardon.
1971.71-257,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,562.575,566.121,"What was the head of federal jurisdiction, would you say that was?"
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,566.121,567.622,What was the head of federal --
1971.71-257,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,567.622,569.674,What was the jurisdiction?
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,569.674,575.507,"The Federal Court jurisdictions, on several grounds Your Honor and I am going to get to those in just a moment."
1971.71-257,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,589.375,595.122,Without that if it is left to the presence of the United States to party would be what?
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,598.297,604.614,We take the position Your Honor that the presence of the United States as a party gives the Court original --
1971.71-257,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,604.614,606.271,Without more?
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,606.271,606.916,Without more.
1971.71-257,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,606.916,607.934,Without more.
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,607.934,626.172,"Yes, and also then the government had a lien on all of the assets of petitioner Grubbs including his accounts receivable and these were in dispute in the lawsuit and were being dissipated and converted by General Electric Credit Corporation."
1971.71-257,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,639.898,644.507,Mr. Cornelius did anyone at anytime make a motion to remand?
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,644.507,646.32,"No Your Honor, never."
1971.71-257,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,646.32,650.016,Any objection ever made to Federal Court jurisdiction?
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,650.016,651.188,None whatsoever Your Honor.
1971.71-257,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,700.22,703.142,Was this entirely sue sponte.
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,703.142,704.613,"Yes Your Honor, entirely."
1971.71-257,0,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,704.613,706.848,Nobody if the arguments suggested?
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,706.848,712.004,Was never even mentioned in the argument before the Court of Appeals Mr. Justice Douglas.
1971.71-257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,729.147,743.145,"Mr. Cornelius, on the face of the opinion of the Court of Appeals at the outset is a statement that they find the complete absence of federal jurisdiction."
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,758.732,769.489,"No Your Honor it was never mentioned, it was never anticipated by any of the parties until we received a letter from the Court of Appeals raising the questions sue sponte."
1971.71-257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,769.489,785.35,"Now, assuming that there was no diversity either alleged as there was in paragraph one, or no diversity of substance."
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,798.861,801.355,It certainly does in our opinion Mr. Chief Justice.
1971.71-257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,801.355,804.305,Was it argued in the court?
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,804.305,809.503,It was argued in the supplemental briefs both sulfurously and enthusiastically.
1971.71-257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,811.587,825.676,How could you go by the argument to the main argument without some reference to this diversity and some reference to the fact that the United States had become a party?
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,825.676,832.26,I think it was touched on Your Honor in the argument before the Court of Appeals but most of the time was spent on the discussion of the merits.
1971.71-257,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,832.26,839.143,"Well, the Court of Appeals said it was a frivolous claim against the United States, sort of a trouped up claim, was that --"
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,839.143,841.713,"More or less Mr. Justice White, yes."
1971.71-257,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,841.713,847.412,And that it was not -- so it was baseless that it wouldn't independently support removal.
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,847.412,848.581,Yes sir.
1971.71-257,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,858.155,866.194,"The federal question here is just as you already answered to the plaintiff's complaint, that wouldn't afford independent(Inaudible)"
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,866.194,883.572,"Ordinarily no Mr. Justice Rehnquist, but in our case, it was a cross action and therefore a new action against the General Electric Company and so it was not an answer, it was a plaintiff's complaint as against General Electric Company and raised a federal question."
1971.71-257,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,892.357,901.867,Would you just defend the jurisdiction over your claim as against General Electric Credit Company of the pendant jurisdiction to it?
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,901.867,917.583,We would claim that the Court had pendant jurisdiction of the entire controversy Your Honor under the circumstances because very similar situations have been affirmed on that point in some cases citied in our brief.
1971.71-257,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,926.52,941.887,"Well supposing that government is increasing on something iterative theory that can be sustained in the federal and applicable law and said it isn't really a claim to a limited fund, but it's just a question to lien priority."
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,941.887,942.069,Yes sir.
1971.71-257,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,942.069,955.82,"The Federal District judge confront that as soon as the case is removed, it decided that there just isn't colorable claim against the United States, but would that support federal jurisdiction of the bill, whole balance the action (Inaudible) United States?"
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,955.82,975.176,"There is some difference of opinion on that point Your Honor, but in my opinion, it would because Section 2410 gives parties the right to sue the United States Government in State Court in order to determine the priority of liens or in actions involving the title to property or to the lien of the government."
1971.71-257,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,975.176,978.221,Where the United States claim is in between.
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,978.221,981.506,"Yes Your Honor, and they did it in this case."
1971.71-257,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,981.506,993.427,"Mr. Cornelius I suppose that if one were a purist, pleading doesn't support diversity jurisdiction."
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,1000.133,1001.162,Yes Your Honor.
1971.71-257,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1001.162,1005.384,There's certainly a plenty of circuit court opinions that this is insufficient.
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,1005.384,1023.17,"But, Your Honor we believe that it is sufficient in our case and we have cited some cases in our brief to the effect that since the record showed diversity, there was no necessity that there be any formal -- diversity case, any formal allegation of it."
1971.71-257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1023.17,1030.974,But you responded to someone's question a few minutes ago that there was no objection when it was removed.
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,1034.498,1038.016,"Yes Your Honor, very definitely."
1971.71-257,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1075.063,1081.019,"That isn't true in all circuits but did they affirm, I think there is no controversy here anyway?"
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,1081.019,1081.578,No Your Honor.
1971.71-257,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1144.79,1148.91,You say a lien on the property would be a big problem Mr. Cornelius.
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,1158.155,1159.16,That's right Your Honor.
1971.71-257,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1193.782,1202.207,"I have a little problem with Mr. Cornelius, the lien doesn't come up until you get judgment, does it?"
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,1204.622,1236.928,"Yes Your Honor, Mr. Justice Marshall, under Texas law, you have a lien which can be created by the chattel mortgage and then if you recover judgment on the debt, you get a judgment lien, but it's different from the chattel mortgage lien, which both the government and GECC were claiming on the property involved here."
1971.71-257,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1295.489,1309.772,"Is it true that if the United States removes a claim against it to the Federal Court and even though that claim might be separable in terms of the present case, the whole controversy is automatically removed from the Federal Court?"
1971.71-257,0,17750,bill_jcornelius,,1309.772,1333.17,"Not automatically removed Your Honor, but if there is no objection and all parties proceed the trial voluntarily in the US court on the merits, it would have pendant jurisdiction of the entire controversy, even if it later found against some or even all of the federal grounds and we have citied cases in our brief which sustain this proposition."
1971.71-257,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1336.278,1346.565,"Very well, Mr. Bill J. Cornelius.Mr. Johnson?"
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,1346.565,1351.076,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1971.71-257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1433.292,1436.471,Let me ask you this.
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,1487.437,1496.53,I direct your attention because the question that the court asked and the court asked to us and we answered it and we tried to go on into the rest of it.
1971.71-257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1496.53,1497.483,What page are you talking about?
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,1497.483,1507.33,"I am talking about Appendix B to my brief, the reason I put it, I don't believe it appears on the face of it in the records."
1971.71-257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1583.776,1586.35,And that suit was not removable by that particular defendant?
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,1586.35,1595.236,"Not by that particular defendant, that was a resident defendant and the right of removal was given to the non residents."
1971.71-257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1611.592,1613.542,Read it for the defendant's concern.
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,1613.542,1653.293,"Well, the defendant was a resident -- he had no right of removal and the Court of Appeals focussed the attention on the status of it, as at the time that it was removed, and as at the time it was removed, and there are a lot of cases that emphasize that, that is the point at which you determine removability jurisdiction as at that time, 2410 was the only thing we could have in the hand and if 2410 didn't fit, then it was -- it's been this, and they thought that they would have a force to (Inaudible) and that could not be done."
1971.71-257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1653.293,1658.434,"Well, they thought the United States was a party by then?"
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,1658.434,1672.84,"Yes, but I think one of the reasons you have to keep in mind and maybe I would try to figure out one of the quotes by Judge Billy Bergley (ph), we will laugh on this, United States was nowhere in sight when it was argued at the Circuit Court level."
1971.71-257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1677.543,1680.773,The United States though wanted to remove it to the Federal Court.
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,1680.773,1685.716,They already thought and then they sort of abandoned it.
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,1691.183,1694.54,But when they were denied to --.
1971.71-257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1694.54,1698.221,In connection with this very transaction?
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,1698.221,1700.931,Yes but I do believe --
1971.71-257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1700.931,1703.591,"You can't really say, can you that United States abandoned it."
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,1707.429,1724.395,"Not to appeal, but if the (Inaudible) that the Circuit Court of Appeals in looking at it, the government had then denied even the right as to its lien claim and this court said he couldn't pass on that."
1971.71-257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1724.395,1731.114,At that time the United States removed it -- wasn't it a proper removal?
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,1731.114,1744.898,"Not in this at 2410 because there was no assertion by a lien on any specific property, there was no -- the assertion on the basis of (Inaudible) interpleader."
1971.71-257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1802.162,1803.642,How about 2410?
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,1812.242,1813.468,I don't think it did.
1971.71-257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1813.468,1814.384,Why not?
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,1814.384,1837.33,"Well, I think that if you're look the portion of 2410, that the government is by the law is called interpleader, this is not an action by the government, but this was by determination of rights over the theory of the protection of this multiple liability."
1971.71-257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1842.601,1845.915,Do you say 1234 --
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,1845.915,1847.334,I don't think they're going to ask.
1971.71-257,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1912.099,1914.919,"Mr. Johnson, you've got to deal with the argument too."
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,1931.241,1941.162,"I am aware of those cases and I've attempted to read those cases and I have great difficulty with them, and I think they were cited in their supplemented brief."
1971.71-257,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2025.052,2029.899,"Mr. Johnson I suppose, if you would start it in federal court, you wouldn't be here today at all."
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,2029.899,2030.953,No question.
1971.71-257,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2049.565,2054.931,The posture today as perhaps it was originally is that she wanted a law suit tried in the state court.
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,2054.931,2063.541,"Well, I am in a position that where I don't believe that I have the right to say that I will rollover and play bid, and you can just continue on the jurisdiction."
1971.71-257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2069.226,2084.121,"Don't we have to talk about another lawsuit too, namely Grubbs' suit against General Electric, Grubbs may not have been able to get this promissory note case under the Federal Court, but the judgment against use on anti-trust claims?"
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,2084.121,2085.318,"No, not at all."
1971.71-257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2085.318,2086.138,What is it for?
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,2086.138,2091.458,It's for tortuous interference in the business definition.
1971.71-257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2102.197,2104.716,With that law suit he could have filed in the federal court?
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,2104.716,2115.859,"He could have known â€“- I don't think he could have filed it in Federal Court because he was the resident, oh, yes he could have on a diversity concept, that's true but he simply had filed --"
1971.71-257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2115.859,2119.357,That's the lawsuit in which there is a judgment.
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,2119.357,2127.184,"That's correct, but that is a lawsuit, that's the lawsuit, they need to file themselves and they brought in the civil court."
1971.71-257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2127.184,2133.107,"I understand that, but it ended up in Federal Court, and he could have filed it there originally."
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,2133.107,2133.944,Possibly so.
1971.71-257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2140.183,2144.675,So that judgment of -- well not if you were in Texas.
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,2144.675,2152.136,GECC doesn't operate except on a sale position and may be on the long run we might have been able to get it there but I believe --
1971.71-257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2152.136,2162.165,"I know but you were already in the State Court, as a party and he filed this cross action, in which he named the United States and General Electric."
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,2163.004,2164.825,Filed it in the state court.
1971.71-257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2164.825,2171.699,"Filed it in the State Court, then after that filed -- that was what was pending in the State Court when the United States removed, isn't it?"
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,2171.699,2172.692,That's correct.
1971.71-257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2172.692,2184.482,"There was pending actually a suit by the Texas resident against the New York resident and that's the action, and the cross action that removed this."
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,2184.482,2188.632,"Well, I think you have to --"
1971.71-257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2188.632,2189.16,"No, that's right."
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,2189.16,2200.88,"Where that leads you is to the fact that the law about not changing the nature of the case by the cross action, you're going to have to change some of that law if you arrive at that conclusion."
1971.71-257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2219.034,2224.864,There is one thing you could have done though that if you dismissed a state action and start all over again in Federal Court.
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,2224.864,2234.025,"Well, he didn't have to -- if he wanted to bring his tortuous claim, his definition suit, he would not require to bring, he is not a compulsory counter claim, he could have brought it."
1971.71-257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2241.841,2244.593,One of his claims was an anti-trust claim.
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,2244.593,2245.201,That's correct.
1971.71-257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2249.634,2251.29,Exclusive jurisdiction in the federal court.
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,2251.29,2252.74,I think he is right.
1971.71-257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2252.74,2263.094,So here is a case in which he has judgments being tried out in the federal court and the suggestion is that you start all over and try it out again on the same court.
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,2263.094,2267.465,I don't know what GE's position is in the matter.
1971.71-257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2282.606,2283.963,Grubbs had a judgment.
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,2283.963,2285.024,I guess too.
1971.71-257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2285.024,2285.694,GE?
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,2285.694,2290.298,"No, denied, GECC."
1971.71-257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2296.353,2297.916,What kind of a judgment did Grubbs get?
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,2297.916,2304.977,"It's plain money judgment and the damages were $20,000 â€“ they saw on the injury to its business from deformation."
1971.71-257,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2304.977,2305.87,Against whom?
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,2305.87,2316.13,Against General Electric Credit Corporation that furnished the credit upon which he operated and appliance dealer for General Electric.
1971.71-257,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2326.047,2330.834,"You have to agree this was -- it makes the law at hand, doesn't it?"
1971.71-257,1,27369,hubert_d_johnson,,2330.834,2335.013,There is no question that it brings back memories of Charles Dickens 's writings.
1971.71-257,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2479.241,2482.306,You have a few minutes left Mr Cornelius.
1971.71-257,2,17750,bill_jcornelius,,2482.306,2485.135,"Thank you Your Honor, may it please the court."
1971.71-257,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2585.749,2588.848,The cross-action you referred to was brought into State Court.
1971.71-257,2,17750,bill_jcornelius,,2589.301,2591.351,Yes Your Honor.
1971.71-257,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2591.351,2595.06,Do you say that the State Court could have tried that on a antitrust theory?
1971.71-257,2,17750,bill_jcornelius,,2595.06,2595.962,No Your Honor.
1971.71-257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2610.73,2617.692,"Do you think your $20,000 judgment was for violation of the antitrust law?"
1971.71-257,2,17750,bill_jcornelius,,2617.692,2622.821,It is for the commission of acts which are prohibited by the antitrust laws as we see it Your Honor.
1971.71-257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2622.821,2626.927,Was your cross-claim under state law as well as under federal law?
1971.71-257,2,17750,bill_jcornelius,,2626.927,2628.458,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.71-257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2630.767,2632.76,For malicious injury to your business?
1971.71-257,2,17750,bill_jcornelius,,2632.76,2633.753,"Yes, yes."
1971.71-257,2,17750,bill_jcornelius,,2634.917,2646.38,"Under State law and acting in concert with General Electric Company, under federal laws."
1971.71-257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2646.38,2650.118,The Federal District Court gave you judgment but said that it wasn't an antitrust claim.
1971.71-257,2,17750,bill_jcornelius,,2651.078,2652.441,"No Your Honor, it didn't say that."
1971.71-257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2653.354,2655.324,"Well, it said there wasn't any conspiracy."
1971.71-257,2,17750,bill_jcornelius,,2655.324,2659.982,"It said that under the evidence, he could not find a conspiracy between GE and GECC."
1971.71-257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2659.982,2664.758,"If there wasn't, then could it have been an antitrust judgment?"
1971.71-257,2,17750,bill_jcornelius,,2664.758,2680.159,"I am of the opinion that, that it could be Your Honor under the deliberate and malicious Acts of a single party -- but I maybe wrong on that, but --"
1971.71-257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2680.159,2684.359,Incidentally what happened -- and the action -- no cause of action on that order?
1971.71-257,2,17750,bill_jcornelius,,2684.359,2695.546,"The action on the note Your Honor was tried and the note was canceled by the Trial Court, because of the failure of consideration."
1971.71-257,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2823.3,2841.291,"Do you see any difference in how aobut it'd be here -- you have got two different judgments, all at one judgments, two different recoveries; one that notes that declaratory enforces about $66,000."
1971.71-257,2,17750,bill_jcornelius,,2841.291,2843.162,"Yes Your Honor, yes."
1971.71-257,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2843.162,2845.981,"Secondly, you have got an separate judgment on $20,000."
1971.71-257,2,17750,bill_jcornelius,,2845.981,2848.862,Correct.
1971.71-257,2,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,2848.862,2864.597,"-- you may have been able to be in the federal court for that $20,000 either on diversity or by joining to the federal anti-trust claims but if GE got it started first in state court."
1971.71-257,2,17750,bill_jcornelius,,2874.441,2877.957,That is exactly right Your Honor because we were a resident.
1971.71-257,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2898.237,2899.173,"Well, let's see."
1971.71-257,2,17750,bill_jcornelius,,2902.077,2902.557,"Yes, it is."
1971.71-257,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2902.557,2904.418,A resident defendant cannot remove.
1971.71-257,2,17750,bill_jcornelius,,2904.418,2905.763,Yes Sir.
1971.71-257,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2909.019,2913.628,"And your other case is same, even though improperly removed in a situation like that."
1971.71-257,2,17750,bill_jcornelius,,2918.605,2930.507,"Right, and we say we are certainly not completely lacking in jurisdiction, but had jurisdiction or the organic power to hear the controversy for five or six different reasons."
1971.71-257,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2964.106,2970.283,What most specifical items in property that are involved and --
1971.71-257,2,17750,bill_jcornelius,,2970.283,2988.317,"Furniture, fixtures and equipment and Mr. Grubbs's business and multi-thousands of dollars worth of accounts receivable, all of which had been assigned to the government as security for its note that it had from Mr. Grubbs."
1971.71-257,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2988.317,2993.379,"From my own assignment, it doesn't consider the lien of the government."
1971.71-257,2,17750,bill_jcornelius,,2993.379,2995.088,An assignment of accounts receivable.
1971.71-257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2995.088,2995.864,That's what it is.
1971.71-257,2,17750,bill_jcornelius,,2995.864,2997.952,"Under these instruments, we believe so."
1971.71-257,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2998.25,3004.495,Is it Texas law that would confer a lien on a property which is subject to the constitution?
1971.71-257,2,17750,bill_jcornelius,,3004.495,3005.052,Yes Your Honor.
1971.71-257,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3013.595,3014.498,It's a pledge that says all of the -- .
1971.71-257,2,17750,bill_jcornelius,,3014.498,3016.265,"It's a pledge, yes."
1971.71-257,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3021.667,3026.21,Was there a delivery of possession in connection with the plea?
1971.71-257,2,17750,bill_jcornelius,,3026.21,3028.791,"No, not of the property itself."
1971.71-257,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3028.791,3035.154,We are assuming now in the pledge of this traditional thoughts or a sense of sort of --
1971.71-257,2,17750,bill_jcornelius,,3035.154,3036.605,"Well, no, possibly not."
1971.71-257,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3041.99,3043.751,Is it Chattel mortgage?
1971.71-257,2,17750,bill_jcornelius,,3043.751,3056.685,"Chattel mortgage, yes, further secured by an assignment of accounts receivable which were actually being claimed in an adverse proceeding between GECC and the government."
1971.71-257,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3056.685,3057.944,Thank you Mr. Cornelius.
1971.71-257,2,17750,bill_jcornelius,,3057.944,3058.684,Thank you very much Your Honor.
1971.71-257,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3058.684,3076.709,The case is submitted.
