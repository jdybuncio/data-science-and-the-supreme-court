1992.91-7580,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.936,"We'll hear argument now in number 91-7580, Gary Graham v. James A. Collins."
1992.91-7580,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,9.798,16.613,"Mr. Chief Justice of the United States, and may it please the Court:"
1992.91-7580,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,250.116,271.791,"If we accept that, do we have to overrule Jurek, because Jurek was premised on the fact that the moral significance could theoretically at least be considered within the framework of the questions, and I'm not sure that the youth consideration could meet the test, as you describe it, unless we overrule Jurek?"
1992.91-7580,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,271.791,277.935,"No, Justice Souter, we do not ask you to overrule Jurek, any more than the State asks you to overrule Penry."
1992.91-7580,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,328.439,344.669,"Well, it seems, Mr. Tigar, that in almost any case there's going to be some evidence of troubled background, positive character traits, so I'm not sure where the limits of your rule are."
1992.91-7580,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,352.786,355.458,Justice Kennedy--
1992.91-7580,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,355.458,356.068,--And probably both.
1992.91-7580,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,356.068,364.935,"--At the margin, there are surely cases in which these issues are raised... for example, in Boyd v. California or Franklin itself."
1992.91-7580,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,970.701,982.16,"You raise two... excuse me... questions, I believe, and one has to do with youth and the other with evidence of positive character traits."
1992.91-7580,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,982.16,984.251,"That is correct, Justice O'Connor."
1992.91-7580,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,984.251,997.357,"Now, I suppose there isn't a defendant in the world that hasn't patted a dog or kissed a sibling or been kind to a grandmother at some time in their life."
1992.91-7580,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,997.357,999.38,"Yes, Justice O'Connor, that's true."
1992.91-7580,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1102.658,1109.762,Let me ask you one question on something you haven't touched on in the course of the argument.
1992.91-7580,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1165.228,1171.802,"No, it does not, Justice Souter, and I think Franklin is the answer to that."
1992.91-7580,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1255.948,1261.274,Good enough for now.
1992.91-7580,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1261.274,1263.334,Thank you very much.
1992.91-7580,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1263.334,1268.266,"We pose the questions, we don't answer them."
1992.91-7580,0,36803,michael_e_tigar,,1268.266,1273.212,"Well, I understand that, Mr. Chief Justice."
1992.91-7580,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1279.236,1280.576,"Very well, Mr. Tigar."
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1282.519,1287.171,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1992.91-7580,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1307.173,1310.556,"Could you speak up a little bit, Mr. Palmer?"
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1310.556,1310.916,"Yes, sure."
1992.91-7580,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1310.916,1312.499,I think some of us may be having a hard time hearing.
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1312.499,1312.749,I'm sorry.
1992.91-7580,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1596.642,1599.995,Are you going to get to... did someone else speak?
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1650.999,1660.315,"My response is, Your Honor, that examination of the trial record reveals that youth was offered for one purpose only, and that was to show that Graham would not be a future danger."
1992.91-7580,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1791.549,1800.505,"Counsel, how many cases are there with a death sentence pending now in Texas--"
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1800.505,1801.967,"--Under this statute, Your Honor?"
1992.91-7580,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1801.967,1812.053,--That fall under this old statute where the argument is made that youth was a factor?
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1812.053,1815.385,"Your Honor, I do not... there are 360 pending cases."
1992.91-7580,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1820.73,1824.411,360 under the old statute?
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1824.411,1829.266,360 inmates on death row in Texas who were convicted under the old statute.
1992.91-7580,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1833.848,1846.838,"Did the Texas courts under the old statute, other than perhaps in the Penry case, grant supplemental instructions in any cases?"
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1846.838,1851.369,"--Your Honor, I am aware that that has been done."
1992.91-7580,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1852.651,1855.953,Mr. Tigar represented to us that the Court of Criminal Appeals said we will not retreat from this.
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1860.996,1862.488,"--Well, Your Honor... no, Your Honor."
1992.91-7580,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1877.468,1879.368,What is the date of the new statute?
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1879.368,1882.801,It became effective September 1st of 1991.
1992.91-7580,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1882.801,1884.25,'91.
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1884.25,1892.318,"Although Graham concedes, as he must, that Jurek remains good law--"
1992.91-7580,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1892.318,1893.206,May I ask on the timing--
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1893.206,1893.707,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-7580,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1893.707,1895.858,"--Your opponent cited Black v. State, which I haven't read."
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,1900.643,1914.08,"Your Honor, I'm not sure I know... if it's the case I think it is, it had to do with excusing a defendant's failure to raise the issue at trial."
1992.91-7580,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1987.89,2004.47,But I take it your position is that youth is not a mitigating factor in the sense that it reduces the culpability of the offender for having committed the offense.
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2004.47,2010.775,"No, Your Honor... or, yes, Your Honor, that is what I'm saying."
1992.91-7580,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2010.775,2028.745,"Yes, and that is... if culpability for the crime that's been committed were a mitigating factor the second question the jury has to answer does not reflect that."
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2034.501,2057.315,"Yes, Your Honor, but the point I'm making is that his present culpability, his culpability for the crime itself, is taken into account by the jury at two different stages of the trial: 1) in finding him guilty of the capital murder itself, because in doing so it has found him to be eligible for the death penalty, and then the second time, through the first special issue of whether or not he committed the crime deliberately."
1992.91-7580,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2057.315,2060.976,"Well, deliberately just means intentionally, or--"
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2060.976,2061.366,"No, Your Honor."
1992.91-7580,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2079.117,2092.809,"--So to the extent that it is claimed that a youth as compared with an adult is really not in full control of himself, that may be considered under issue 1."
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2092.809,2109.029,"Yes, Your Honor, and it's also something that necessarily can be considered under issue 2, because the jury knows and is told, as it was by Graham's counsel at his trial, that he will not remain a youth forever."
1992.91-7580,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2110.591,2111.042,I understand that.
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2114.995,2117.657,"Yes, Your Honor, that does."
1992.91-7580,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2117.657,2128.824,"How does youth enter into the determination of guilt initially, just in this same way to find that the requisite intent existed?"
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2129.595,2132.186,"Well, Your Honor, I'm not sure--"
1992.91-7580,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2132.186,2139.332,--I thought you'd indicated that youth was taken into account in deciding whether he's guilty to begin with... guilty of the murder.
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2139.332,2142.774,"--If that was how Your Honor understood me, I apologize."
1992.91-7580,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2161.725,2163.298,So you're back just to the special issues.
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2171.423,2182.04,"Your Honor, we would urge that what the court of appeals did in this case is a noble attempt to reconcile the Court's two lines of cases."
1992.91-7580,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2186.963,2202.582,"Well, it... do you think the court of appeals dealt with youth in terms of culpability at all?"
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2219.894,2221.986,"No, Your Honor."
1992.91-7580,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2237.587,2252.106,"--Well, did the court of appeals expressly deal with the notion of youth as a mitigating factor in the sense of less culpability for committing the crime that he's committed?"
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2264.505,2271.68,I'm not sure they'd rest it in just the terms Your Honor has posed.
1992.91-7580,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2300.288,2310.584,"But the opinions of this Court, perhaps some that I haven't joined, really refer to culpability, don't they?"
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2310.584,2317.249,"They do, Your Honor, and again, it is our position that the first issue raises that."
1992.91-7580,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2317.249,2326.626,And there is plenty of support in the cases that youth is a factor that is fairly considered in terms of culpability.
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2326.626,2328.417,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-7580,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2337.542,2338.203,"Yes, all right."
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2372.627,2373.539,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1992.91-7580,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2373.539,2373.929,All right.
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2384.365,2385.517,"No, Your Honor."
1992.91-7580,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2386.578,2387.991,Then I don't think I understand you.
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2387.991,2413.425,"--Well, Your Honor, quite frankly, I'm not sure I understand all the nuances of mens re myself, but as I understand it, what the Court of Criminal Appeals has held is, deliberateness falls somewhere between premeditation and intent, and it involves some mental process more than simply the intent to do the act but less than deliberated premeditation."
1992.91-7580,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2413.425,2427.097,"So it isn't merely an element leading to an intentional act, it is some... in some sense it is a further mental element in addition to intentionality--"
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2427.097,2427.915,"Exactly, Your Honor."
1992.91-7580,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2427.915,2430.318,--And it has been so defined by the Texas courts.
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2430.318,2431.928,"Yes, Your Honor."
1992.91-7580,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2431.928,2436.972,"This is... I don't mean to put you on the spot here, but could you give me a cite to a case--"
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2436.972,2437.322,"Yes, Your Honor--"
1992.91-7580,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2437.322,2438.354,--In which they have so construed it?
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2438.354,2440.123,--I would site Firens v. State.
1992.91-7580,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2445.258,2446.018,"I'm sorry, 6--"
1992.91-7580,1,19818,charles_a_palmer,,2446.018,2446.999,620.
1992.91-7580,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,2983.02,2995.398,"We have a watershed difference here about what the jury was told in this case as to special issue number 1 and the intent element of the offense, and something of a difference about Texas law."
1992.91-7580,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3071.357,3076.901,"Well, is the jury entitled to consider the strength of the State's evidence on intent?"
1992.91-7580,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3076.901,3100.175,"The standard of proof, Justice Kennedy, is the same with respect to both of the elements, so that there really isn't any opportunity for the jury to do other than look again to the same things they looked at plus, of course, to the additional aggravating evidence when they get on to the punishment phase."
1992.91-7580,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3111.044,3131.027,"Mr. Tigar, your argument that you just made that in this case the judge conflated this and that, I suppose that doesn't go to the facial validity of the Texas statute."
1992.91-7580,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3131.027,3132.117,"--No, it doesn't Justice White."
1992.91-7580,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3132.547,3138.5,"And so you might win this case, but if the trial judge had spoken differently you might lose it."
1992.91-7580,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3138.5,3145.516,"--That's correct, Justice White, and we might lose... might have lost this case if the defendant were 25 years old."
1992.91-7580,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3181.399,3191.335,"Mr. Tigar, your opponent says that claims have been raised in Texas now since Penry that being a sociopath is in effect a mitigating circumstance."
1992.91-7580,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3196.339,3198.16,"Of course not, Justice Rehnquist."
1992.91-7580,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3249.795,3286.167,"Well, it could be that mental retardation is such a... so likely in every case to affect somebody's control that you just have a per se rule about it that you have to have a separate instruction, but just being useful, maybe it ought to be decided on a case-to-case basis, which arguably, at least Texas argues, is amply taken care of in issue 1."
1992.91-7580,2,36803,michael_e_tigar,,3286.167,3288.649,"It could be, perhaps, Justice White."
