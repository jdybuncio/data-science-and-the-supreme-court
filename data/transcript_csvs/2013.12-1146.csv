2013.12-1146,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,11.056,"We will hear argument this morning in Case 12-1146, Utility Air Regulatory Group v. The Environmental Protection Agency and the consolidated cases."
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,11.808,14.274,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
2013.12-1146,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,78.35,79.783,"Mr. Keisler, I'm sorry."
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,145.408,145.992,--Yes.
2013.12-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,180.281,180.632,May I ask--
2013.12-1146,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,180.632,187.654,"When you say area-specific, I mean, I take it that these sort of ozone pollutants are not area-specific."
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,190.939,196.677,"--If the EPA couldn't make a regulatory finding that they had an area-specific air quality impact, yes."
2013.12-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,198.11,200.645,--Could I ask you a follow-up to Justice Kagan?
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,226.129,240.454,"--Well, first of all, Your Honor, the deference that an agency is afforded is always going to be limited to reasonable interpretations, and we would start out with the premise that an interpretation that requires the Agency to rewrite other provisions of the Act is not reasonable."
2013.12-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,240.454,241.204,"Well, it hasn't rewritten them."
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,269.754,271.104,"That is right, Your Honor."
2013.12-1146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,280.226,288.232,"Before you do that, can you clarify whether or not you agree with the dissenting judges on the D.C. Circuit?"
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,316.816,318.251,And -- and let me sort that out.
2013.12-1146,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,343.383,345.585,"But, again, that's because they're not local."
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,345.585,348.354,"Because they don't have area-specific air quality impacts, yes."
2013.12-1146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,348.354,361.195,"Well, what do you make -- what do you make of the endangerment finding that greenhouse gases have severe effects at the local level that -- I think the endangerment finding is not before us today."
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,368.434,377.706,"Certainly, every effect that any environmental phenomenon has on the planet and on people will at some point be felt in some local area."
2013.12-1146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,385.545,386.595,It's certainly not measurable.
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,389.181,389.847,--That's right.
2013.12-1146,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,394.835,395.401,I'm sorry.
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,399.037,401.255,"--Thank you very much, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-1146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,434.576,436.412,I didn't read them as saying that anyway.
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,441.549,445.434,"Well, and the problem is, Justice Scalia, that those exemptions violate the statute as well."
2013.12-1146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,459.893,468.549,"It -- it clearly is not a matter of the EPA simply saying we can't do it right away, but we're going to do it eventually."
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,468.549,468.916,--That's right.
2013.12-1146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,468.916,469.449,It hasn't said that.
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,469.449,473.853,"It hasn't, and if they did say that they would be violating the statute in worse ways."
2013.12-1146,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,480.691,495.366,"Mr. Keisler, do you really mean to say that the only difference between greenhouse gases and the air pollutants that Congress clearly had in mind when it enacted the Clean Air Act is that greenhouse gases don't have a localized effect?"
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,512.328,512.895,That's right.
2013.12-1146,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,512.895,513.395,--substituted?
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,513.395,514.178,"That's right, Your Honor."
2013.12-1146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,598.868,601.286,How does the -- this differ?
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,662.61,676.034,"I don't know that there actually is a precedent of this Court which says the agency can do precisely what it did here, which is take an express command that identifies thresholds, that didn't delegate to the agency the determination of the thresholds but says--"
2013.12-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,676.034,688.342,"But I'm -- but I'm a little confused, because there have to be pollutants who -- where it doesn't emit just 250, where it emits a million."
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,722.915,723.965,"--Well, that's right, Your Honor."
2013.12-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,739.543,739.959,"That's a minimum, but anything--"
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,739.959,740.476,--That's right.
2013.12-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,740.476,740.943,--above it.
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,740.943,741.493,That's right.
2013.12-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,742.059,742.495,All right.
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,742.811,743.911,And then -- and then best available--
2013.12-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,743.911,750.915,--And so GHG is something that's above that and it's never going to be brought down below it.
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,750.915,751.248,--That's right.
2013.12-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,758.754,759.087,Right.
2013.12-1146,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,759.471,768.959,"Mr. Keisler, if I could follow up, really, on Justice Breyer's question, because the conundrum here, you keep saying: Look, EPA is violating this specific statutory term."
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,831.7,839.289,"--Because we don't agree, Your Honor, that those two -- that those two horns of the dilemma that Your Honor described are equally situated."
2013.12-1146,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,851.846,852.782,"Well, I think I don't really understand."
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,894.192,894.625,--No.
2013.12-1146,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,955.164,960.068,"--Counsel, you began that discussion by saying putting Massachusetts v. EPA to one side."
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,964.956,965.505,"No, that's--"
2013.12-1146,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,968.823,973.125,And -- and my question is along that exact same line.
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1006.28,1006.697,Sure.
2013.12-1146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1088.182,1093.752,"What else does it cover other than Title II, other than mobile vehicles?"
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1093.752,1110.447,"There are multiple places in which the word “ pollutant ” appears in the Act in which the EPA has understood Mass v. EPA the way I just described, in which they have interpreted the words “ any air pollutant ” to mean only a subset of the pollutants that -- that the definition literally could be held to encompass."
2013.12-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1110.447,1116.701,--That's generally because the section that it's in gives a different definition directly.
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1116.701,1119.47,"No, that's -- with respect, Your Honor, that's not correct."
2013.12-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1130.027,1130.378,"You are right, but--"
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1130.378,1132.01,The context suggests otherwise.
2013.12-1146,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1135.262,1139.383,But your -- your answer is that they can be treated differently under different parts of the Act.
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1143.685,1156.411,"No, I don't think so, Your Honor, because it was an act of interpretation in Massachusetts v. EPA of a particular term, and the question is, reading that decision as a whole, what import did the Court give that interpretation."
2013.12-1146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1170.503,1172.77,And what other programs I asked earlier.
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1181.793,1189.649,"I think most critically, Your Honor, it includes the new source performance standards program of Section 111 that this Court discussed in Connecticut v. AEP."
2013.12-1146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1280.559,1285.811,So in your opinion -- is -- I'm not sure what the statutory cite is to the provision you are talking about.
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1286.896,1287.496,"That's right, Your Honor."
2013.12-1146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1287.496,1287.88,All right.
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1293.217,1294.017,"Yes, without--"
2013.12-1146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1294.017,1294.985,You don't see an objection.
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1296.801,1297.785,"--Well, they are doing it, Your Honor."
2013.12-1146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1297.785,1298.52,They are doing it?
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1309.243,1311.095,"But it's not exactly the same thing, Your Honor."
2013.12-1146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1349.22,1349.553,It says
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1358.242,1358.626,Right.
2013.12-1146,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1358.626,1359.142,Okay.
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1380.591,1393.915,"Because the statutory language and structure of the PSD program does not, we think, encompass these kinds of pollutants that have globally dispersed results and not area-specific impacts."
2013.12-1146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1414.246,1415.346,Is that your second point?
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1428.005,1428.488,"Oh, well, Connecticut."
2013.12-1146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1428.488,1429.072,"You never did that, yes."
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1429.072,1446.532,"Well, Connecticut v. AEP, and the only point to make about that is that that was the case which held that the commission -- that the EPA has authority under Section 111, the NSPS provision, to address greenhouse gases without having to rewrite thresholds by designating the categories of sources like it's trying to do here."
2013.12-1146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1462.393,1471.249,"The other thing -- you were going to give two points and you only got to -- what is it -- 7411(e), but there was another point."
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1471.249,1476.736,"There were really -- yes, there were three features I mentioned of the PSD statute which we think make the context clear."
2013.12-1146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1476.736,1477.603,"You got the first, which was the--"
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1477.603,1480.771,"Which was 7471, prevention of significant deterioration."
2013.12-1146,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1480.771,1481.155,--Right.
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1481.155,1486.842,"The second was that study, the only required study is of local conditions and area-specific impacts."
2013.12-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1507.438,1526.334,"--You -- just to be clear, your reading would say that the -- that the Agency was not permitted, with notice and opportunity to be heard, to say -- to make a criteria -- make this a criteria of pollution in NAAQS."
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1526.334,1539.393,"If the Agency had tried to establish a NAAQS for greenhouse gases, we think that would be contrary to the statute because the National Ambient Air Quality Standards are all about regional concentrations."
2013.12-1146,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1551.551,1573.883,"Well, why don't you take an extra 5 minutes, and -- and you can begin by answering the question: You know, the government disaggregates the discussion, and their first point in their brief is that greenhouse gases can be regulated with respect to sources that are already covered by the PSD program."
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1583.088,1604.936,"--I think it does, Your Honor, because while that might deal with the specific issue of rewriting the thresholds, the fact that the PSD provisions for the reasons I have indicated is limited to area-specific air impacts would we think be violated merely by applying best available control technology to a globally disbursed substance like greenhouse gases."
2013.12-1146,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1604.936,1605.569,I understand.
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1612.442,1620.712,"That's right, but they would be applying it to a substance, greenhouse gases, which the PSD program was not designed to address, which was designed to be addressed by other programs."
2013.12-1146,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1673.63,1675.265,You have three and a half minutes left.
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1675.265,1677.2,--Not including rebuttal?
2013.12-1146,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1677.2,1677.567,No.
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1678.717,1679.2,"Thank you, Your Honor."
2013.12-1146,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1711.188,1713.14,"Well, but that's not Judge Kavenaugh's position."
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1717.109,1718.259,"That's right, Your Honor, and that is a distinction."
2013.12-1146,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1720.627,1722.929,And it comes from a different portion of the statutory language.
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1722.929,1723.329,That's right.
2013.12-1146,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1737.423,1742.059,"Can I ask, Mr. Cavanaugh, why Judge Kavenaugh's argument has been left by the wayside?"
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1742.059,1752.015,"It is very similar, Your Honor, to the argument that we're making, but we get at it in a different way and with a slightly different result."
2013.12-1146,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1752.015,1754.884,"Well, it does -- it comes from different statutory language."
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1767.358,1771.746,This is the argument we made below and it's the argument we've continued to make here.
2013.12-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1774.531,1775.781,I don't think that answers the question.
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1775.781,1777.65,"Excuse me, Your Honor?"
2013.12-1146,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1777.65,1787.688,"I said I don't think -- I don't think it answers the question, which is I know that's the argument; are you saying you can't defend his argument or are you saying that--"
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1787.688,1797.061,"No, it's just that it's been hard enough to make two alternative arguments in this forum and to add a third to it would be more than I think I could handle."
2013.12-1146,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1797.527,1799.663,--Can you clarify that?
2013.12-1146,0,38076,peter_keisler,,1814.756,1834.002,"Your Honor, it is true that ever since 1980 -- although it proposed our interpretation as its original interpretation of the statute, ever since EPA has said that any pollutant, whether it's a NAAQS pollutant, whether it's a pollutant for which the area is in attainment, any pollutant would be sufficient to trigger PSD permit requirements."
2013.12-1146,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1861.57,1862.087,"Thank you, counsel."
2013.12-1146,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,1873.211,1886.787,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
2013.12-1146,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1953.246,1960.502,"General, I take it that the unambiguous statutory language that you are referring to is the references to 100 and to 250."
2013.12-1146,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2010.602,2021.474,"Justice Kagan, the reason we don't think the approach that you describe is permissible is because there are statutory provisions in the Clean Air Act that specifically forbid EPA to do what Your Honor is prescribing."
2013.12-1146,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2127.593,2138.315,"But, General, if you think about the question of what any pollutant means, and you put aside this whole absurdity question that the numbers get you to, you just say, what does any air pollutant mean?"
2013.12-1146,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2184.696,2191.283,"Because I don't think it can be said, Justice Kagan, that the phrase “ any air pollutant ” unambiguously means any regulated pollutant."
2013.12-1146,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2198.189,2198.972,Let me ask you a question.
2013.12-1146,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2225.69,2228.808,"--It's more than just that there's ambiguity, Justice Sotomayor."
2013.12-1146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2247.536,2257.575,"But that's a difficult -- I think where Justice Kagan is going -- and I will if she wasn't, but I think she was -- is put the definition from 7479 in your mind."
2013.12-1146,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2260.677,2261.696,--The definition of?

2013.12-1146,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2264.565,2264.848,Right.
2013.12-1146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2264.848,2265.431,Okay.
2013.12-1146,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2341.998,2343.398,Choice one.
2013.12-1146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2344.783,2345.517,I knew you would say that.
2013.12-1146,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2346.167,2359.526,"--The reason choice one does less violence is because the term “ air pollutant ” is flexible and has been acknowledged to be by EPA for decades, and I think even by this Court, notwithstanding its holding in Massachusetts."
2013.12-1146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2394.865,2395.148,All right.
2013.12-1146,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2435.357,2442.512,"--I think they did make a choice, and it's in the language of the bill, that EPA does not have the authority to exempt any major source from Title V."
2013.12-1146,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2448.183,2451.552,Title V is not the PSD requirement.

2013.12-1146,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2456.856,2462.926,And so why shouldn't we exempt people from Title V?
2013.12-1146,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2468.914,2473.216,--But it's a -- it's a very burdensome recordkeeping provision as -- as EPA acknowledges.
2013.12-1146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2531.57,2531.904,All right.
2013.12-1146,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2557.221,2566.243,"I don't -- yeah, I don't think it would be a permissible act of statutory construction to say that carbon dioxide could be an air pollutant and not an air pollutant at the same time."
2013.12-1146,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2566.243,2568.827,"Well, you -- you'd accept his definition, wouldn't you?"
2013.12-1146,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2578.885,2581.253,"Right, which means it can't be regulated under the Title V--"
2013.12-1146,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2581.253,2582.019,So that would be a wonderful definition.
2013.12-1146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2582.019,2583.353,"It can, though."
2013.12-1146,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2591.042,2592.059,"--Well, we have a problem with--"
2013.12-1146,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2592.059,2596.779,"I mean, are you saying it doesn't make sense to control major emitters of CO2?"
2013.12-1146,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2596.779,2607.651,--We're saying it doesn't make sense to construe air pollutant in a greenhouse gas-inclusive manner for purposes of the PSD program because the unambiguous requirements require the EPA to reach the small emitters.

2013.12-1146,1,31992,jonathan_f_mitchell,,2694.609,2695.409,No.
2013.12-1146,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2731.132,2732.598,"Thank you, General Mitchell."

2013.12-1146,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2785.983,2786.349,Why?
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2805.077,2823.022,"--Well, the Court said, I think, that it was plain that Congress gave EPA the authority to regulate stationary sources in the American Electric Power case under Section 7411, and that I think gets to a fundamental premise where the Petitioners are just wrong."

2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2957.111,2958.261,"--Well, I would be happy to get to that."

2013.12-1146,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3109.009,3109.293,All right.

2013.12-1146,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3144.349,3151.186,"No, but my point is it relates to energy consumption as opposed to particulate emission."
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3151.186,3156.74,"At the -- at the moment that's largely true, not entirely true; there are some other technologies described."

2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3198.15,3198.433,That's correct.
2013.12-1146,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3198.433,3203.387,Prevailing on the second argument gets you to 86 percent.
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3203.387,3204.604,That's correct.

2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3375.713,3376.98,"Yes, they did say that."
2013.12-1146,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3376.98,3382.884,"On the other hand, EPA says, but that's what we're going to aim to achieve at some point down the road."
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3382.884,3391.573,"No, that's a fundamental misconception, Justice Alito, and I would like to try to clear it up and it goes to -- I'll try to answer Your Honor's question as well, Justice Scalia."
2013.12-1146,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3427.746,3430.031,And then they're never going to get to the statutory thresholds.

2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3451.528,3468.154,"--Under the point -- the nuance there, that I think answers Your Honor's question, is that there -- the Agency has discretion in deciding what constitutes the potential to emit 250 tons per year."
2013.12-1146,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3477.179,3482.664,"But then they'll -- then they'll be back down to -- to 41,000 people fully within this."
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3513.785,3514.435,--Well--
2013.12-1146,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3514.435,3538.417,"What I thought the question was, was whether EPA had the authority to implement this in a way that EPA itself thinks make sense, which might be, on their own reasoning, to not impose permitting requirements on tens of thousands, perhaps millions of small businesses."
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3542.804,3543.137,--It is.
2013.12-1146,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3556.462,3558.231,Are they going to get some new standards?
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3562.033,3562.416,--Right.
2013.12-1146,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3562.416,3574.091,The words they used in their opinion implied to me when I read them that they're never going to want to put tiny boilers under this because it just doesn't do very much good and it's expensive to administer.
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3575.358,3576.092,That's correct.
2013.12-1146,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3576.092,3576.508,All right.
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3625.789,3636.147,"So the -- it's the reason I tried to suggest earlier, Justice Breyer, that the PSD program is supposed to work as a complement together with 7411."
2013.12-1146,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3652.772,3653.705,"Well, put those all in."
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3664.177,3683.623,"--They can do all of that, but the -- but the problem is that that's going to take a lot of time, and that was the very reason Congress put the PSD program into existence in 1977 was because of the dissatisfaction because of the time it took to go source by source, pollutant by pollutant under the EPA's 7411 program."
2013.12-1146,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3683.623,3683.99,I'm sorry.

2013.12-1146,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3693.679,3694.146,--Right.
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3694.146,3705.971,"But part of the reason, as I said, I think it's just wrong to think about the PSD program as being -- addressing a different kind of problem from the 7411 problem is that you've got to meet the 7411 standard in your PSD application."
2013.12-1146,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3705.971,3713.393,"General -- general, if I could actually get back to Justice Alito's question, because I had a similar issue with what EPA did here."
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3762.742,3764.842,"I take that point, Your Honor."
2013.12-1146,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3801.117,3808.038,Are greenhouse gases the only air pollutant for which EPA has the authority to change the statutory thresholds?
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3808.038,3813.592,"Well, I'd like to make a point, if I could, about that."
2013.12-1146,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3827.768,3833.672,"But could it do -- could it do this for another pollutant, something other than any of the greenhouse gases?"
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3833.672,3838.74,"Well, I think, in fairness, what EPA is saying here is that we've got an obligation under the statute to regulate."
2013.12-1146,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3863.541,3896.162,One of the things that EPA said in -- in the explanation of this rule is that EPA could say that PSD or Title V applies only to certain GHG sources -- it's been suggested that that's also the carbon dioxide -- applies only to certain GHG sources and does not apply to the remaining GHG sources.
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3907.72,3919.628,"But I think the reason, Justice Ginsburg, is because that is not going to make -- the carbon dioxide is also a huge part of the problem, and so you're really not going to be getting to the heart of the problem."
2013.12-1146,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3947.328,3947.795,I'm sorry.
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,3998.061,3998.777,But this is--
2013.12-1146,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3998.777,4000.679,Can you public a NAAQ for greenhouse gases?
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4000.679,4014.271,"--I think it would be within EPA's authority to do so, but there are really significant problems with trying to regulate that way, and that's why -- but -- and -- but it's important to understand, Mr. Chief Justice, that the PSD program applies to more than just NAAQS pollutants."
2013.12-1146,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4017.223,4017.506,Okay.
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4027.529,4046.908,"I guess what I would say about that is that if EPA found itself in exactly the same circumstances it finds itself in with respect to greenhouse gases, where it's -- it feels like the statutory definition compels it to regulate, it kicks in at 250, and you've got to issue a permit in a year, that they could make a judgment comparable to the one they made here."
2013.12-1146,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4050.11,4050.544,But why?
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4098.108,4102.41,"--If the Court were to do that, that would certainly justify the EPA's judgement--"
2013.12-1146,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4102.41,4109.833,"And now, my problem is I will hear from many that what I would -- perhaps it isn't a question of what I'd like to do."
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4118.954,4133.464,"--Well, EPA has committed itself in this -- in the regulations, in the rulemaking proceedings, to try to bring the 250 tons per year into alignment with the expectation that only large sources will be regulated."
2013.12-1146,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4135.231,4148.374,"General Verrilli, really, I don't have as expansive a notion of reading exceptions into a statute that are not there as Justice Breyer does."
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4248.573,4250.806,"--Two points about that, if I could."
2013.12-1146,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4341.28,4341.73,And--
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4341.73,4343.099,--about 15 percent of the sources.
2013.12-1146,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4344.482,4354.357,"--General, wouldn't it be right to say that the rule that Justice Scalia is referring to only applies if there are alternative interpretations that are consistent with the legislative purpose."
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4372.485,4382.857,"Yes, that's exactly the argument, and I think that's exactly what EPA did when it reads Massachusetts v. EPA and its understanding of air pollutant and thought about that in the context of the regulatory goals of this program."
2013.12-1146,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4382.857,4395.934,"In the -- you know, the argument against that is, no, that the statute evidences concern with ambient air quality and requires that to be measured."
2013.12-1146,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4414.995,4415.362,All right.
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4470.082,4471.149,I think that states it fairly.
2013.12-1146,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4472.517,4473.084,I don't think so.
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4478.488,4480.607,I think that was Justice Breyer who said “ unthinkable ”.
2013.12-1146,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4481.19,4488.961,"--But what is supposed to be unthinkable, that greenhouse gases should not be regulated?"
2013.12-1146,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,4500.269,4501.952,But isn't that the argument?
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4513.242,4520.165,"That's certainly true, but it wasn't -- but it -- also, even before Massachusetts, it had -- there's significant problems with it."
2013.12-1146,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4520.165,4528.938,"Here we have a statutory provision that has very specific numbers, and the agency has said these numbers are absurd."
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4546.481,4549.602,"Obviously, I wouldn't characterize it quite that way."
2013.12-1146,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4573.9,4575.833,What was that case?
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4575.833,4576.433,--Morton v. Ruiz.
2013.12-1146,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4620.212,4632.686,"Just to be clear, you're not saying -- or are you saying -- that if you're denied the authority you seek here, there can be no significant regulation of greenhouse gases under the Act?"
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4633.553,4635.372,No.
2013.12-1146,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4690.372,4694.093,"That's the 80 -- that's the 8386 question, right?"
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4694.093,4695.293,"That's correct, Your Honor."
2013.12-1146,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4741.824,4743.324,"Well, that has local effects."
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4747.895,4757.834,"Well, that -- well, if those local effects count, then certainly, greenhouse gases have those kinds of local effects, because they raise the sea levels, which cause flooding in certain places and they cause droughts in other places."
2013.12-1146,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4762.22,4764.756,Where have the sea levels risen other than Massachusetts?
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4765.389,4773.526,"Well, certainly Massachusetts, but -- but with respect -- but EPA has been regulating ozone-depleting substances since 1988."
2013.12-1146,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4773.526,4776.345,Isn't your argument Congress has acquiesced in that?
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4776.345,4777.664,Yes.
2013.12-1146,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4806.865,4815.703,I thought there was a very short time lag between EPA's assertion of the authority to regulate the ozone-depleting substances under the PSD program and the enactment of--
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4815.703,4816.122,2 years.
2013.12-1146,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,4816.805,4817.989,--So was it a full 2 years?
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4817.989,4830.297,"I don't know if it was a full 2 years, but -- but the Congress focused specifically on exactly how ozone-depleting substances were going to be regulated under the Clean Air Act, and they created a new -- they were -- it's not an accident."
2013.12-1146,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,4837.419,4841.188,What's the -- I know litigants hate this question.
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4843.623,4845.073,--I knew you were going to ask me that question.
2013.12-1146,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4854.514,4855.23,There's a difference between them.
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4855.23,4856.664,--There is a significant difference between them.
2013.12-1146,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4856.997,4857.616,So which one?
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4858.232,4860.651,"--Well, I've got another thought on that subject--"
2013.12-1146,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4920.623,4921.889,"Well, what -- what about BACT for CO2, then?"
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4921.889,4922.473,"--Well, no."
2013.12-1146,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4947.523,4950.808,You've got to follow -- you've got to follow the plain text of the statute there.
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4950.808,4956.379,"--Well, if the command of the statute is that BACT applies for each pollutant subject to regulation--"
2013.12-1146,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4956.379,4962.2,"Yeah, but the plan of the statute is 250 tons per year, too; and you've changed that to 100,000 tons per year."
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4962.2,4963.733,"--Right, but I think--"
2013.12-1146,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4963.733,4969.97,"And you were going to get to 7475(3), (a), (b), (c) on that point."
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,4969.97,4984.729,"--Well, 7475(3)(c) also does say that if -- if EPA does set a greenhouse gas standard for a particular stationary source like power plants, then that becomes a condition of the permit."
2013.12-1146,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5003.36,5004.243,--I just want to be clear.
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5019.903,5030.944,"--If you took CO2 out of the equation, I don't think this -- the expanded scope of the permitting obligation is going to happen, because it's the CO2 emissions that expand the scope."
2013.12-1146,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5034.746,5044.035,"--Well, Justice Breyer said the difference between 83 percent and 86 percent, that 3 percent difference of who you're covering is thousands and thousands of people."
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5044.035,5044.787,--That's correct.
2013.12-1146,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5044.787,5048.139,"Or entities, I should say, not people, of institutions."
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5051.608,5052.274,Pretty close.
2013.12-1146,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5084.245,5091.933,"Well, wouldn't the proper answer be if we are rejecting your entire position to say there are these other options?"
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5100.022,5101.089,"Yes, certainly that's right."
2013.12-1146,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,5144.366,5152.622,"I have to say in reading the brief for the States and reading your brief, I -- I couldn't find a single precedent that strongly supports your position."
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5163.929,5169.333,"So at the -- at the -- sustaining the argument that the trigger applies here, I do think there aren't -- there's aren't a lot of cases."
2013.12-1146,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5174.751,5177.703,"But that's not cited in your brief, is it?"
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5177.703,5179.336,"--No, it's not, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-1146,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,5200.131,5204.6,"General, I don't want to interrupt your summation, but on the -- let mejust ask this quick question."
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5235.37,5236.886,"You know, I'm glad you raised that, Justice Alito."
2013.12-1146,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5395.749,5399.518,"Well, you've got five extra minutes, to be -- to be fair."
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5402.737,5404.239,You should have told me that before my summation.
2013.12-1146,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5404.805,5408.374,--You had already gotten going.
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5421.866,5422.566,Yes.
2013.12-1146,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5423.133,5425.919,So what level do you think they should be regulated at?
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5442.295,5443.012,"--Well, I think--"
2013.12-1146,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5443.012,5444.731,--other than -- since it's not 250?
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5444.731,5464.377,"--You would want to look at the definition of what it means to emit 250 tons per year, and then you'd want to think about the underlying notion that what Congress is trying to do is to impose these obligations on facilities that are capable of responding to them, that are going to tend to be facilities that are major in quality."
2013.12-1146,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,5471.298,5471.548,Could I -- sorry.
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5477.968,5479.568,"I'm sorry, Justice Kagan."
2013.12-1146,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,5480.987,5484.122,As in the more typical emissions context.
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5485.472,5486.688,It might -- I don't think it would--
2013.12-1146,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,5486.688,5488.674,--captures a certain set of emitters.
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5494.244,5505.718,"--I think -- I don't know that it will be the same, but I think it'll be -- but I think the -- the class will be a lot smaller than the class under EPA's current understanding of what it means to emit 250 tons per year."
2013.12-1146,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,5505.718,5510.789,"Well, how did the EPA come at -- settle on the number?"
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5510.789,5535.988,"Yeah, they tried to explain that in -- in one of the rulemaking orders, and I think what they did is to try to figure out the right balance point where they were accomplishing very significant emissions limitations while not sweeping in sources that were -- that very large number of small sources that were going to only make the incremental -- an incremental difference."
2013.12-1146,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5547.378,5548.978,Why -- two things.
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5562.971,5564.321,"Well, I think the streamlining."
2013.12-1146,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5565.34,5567.073,It's the same basic point.
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5589.305,5590.571,"--Well, I--"
2013.12-1146,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5590.571,5590.821,--I just wondered.
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5591.588,5598.075,"--There would be a helpful point for us, but for this, and then I'll tell you why -- explain why we didn't, because there is a citizen suit provision in the -- in the law."
2013.12-1146,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5600.277,5601.363,--Yes.
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5601.363,5608.8,"And so, I think that's the reason why because it's subject to a citizen suit, whether we exercise our--"
2013.12-1146,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5608.8,5613.17,"In other words, you would be out of it totally, and any citizen could go bring a suit and say where is your permit?"
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5613.17,5613.536,--Right.
2013.12-1146,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5613.536,5614.603,I see.
2013.12-1146,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,5614.603,5617.722,No further questions?
2013.12-1146,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5618.555,5619.322,"Thank you, General."
2013.12-1146,3,38076,peter_keisler,,5622.79,5626.744,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2013.12-1146,3,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,5690.82,5704.061,"So what do I do with the examples in the brief of the 144 permits that have already been given, people who have managed to come into compliance under that?"
2013.12-1146,3,38076,peter_keisler,,5704.061,5713.433,It's certainly not our submission that every single determination by every one of these authorities is going to be unreasonable or outrageous or is going to reach into the cafeterias.
2013.12-1146,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5828.644,5829.377,"Thank you, counsel, counsel."
