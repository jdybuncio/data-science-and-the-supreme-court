1973.73-29,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,17.916,"We'll hear arguments first this morning in No. 73-29, Corning Glass against Brennan and 73-695 Brennan against Corning Glass Consolidated."
1973.73-29,0,42307,scott_f_zimmerman,,20.558,23.932,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-29,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,759.295,761.277,Before you get to that Mr. Zimmerman --
1973.73-29,0,42307,scott_f_zimmerman,,761.277,762.406,"Yes, sir?"
1973.73-29,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,762.406,782.785,"Supposing that we were to conclude that the difference in shift does represent a working condition, does that end the judicial inquiry even though a finder of fact might conclude that notwithstanding the difference in working conditions, there was actually some sex discrimination billed into the actual pay rate?"
1973.73-29,0,42307,scott_f_zimmerman,,782.785,785.893,"Your Honor, in my judgment, it clearly does."
1973.73-29,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1400.997,1405.318,"Very well, Mr. Zimmerman."
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1409.165,1414.657,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1973.73-29,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1447.645,1455.906,Do you think there is any element in this act to a straight differential for a night work --
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1455.906,1456.662,Absolutely not.
1973.73-29,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1456.662,1457.65,-- compared with day work?
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1457.65,1474.04,"And -- and -- that is the -- the burden of my first few moments remarks is to try and make crystal clear, if I can, to the Court that Secretary does not challenge the propriety of paying night differentials, indeed, there are some here."
1973.73-29,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1521.284,1525.346,"You do not concede that that is a working condition though, as I understand."
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1525.346,1528.404,We do not concede that it is a working condition.
1973.73-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1736.67,1742.381,"Mr. Tuttle when we're talking about a night shifter, is that the traditional swing shift or is it a graveyard?"
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1742.381,1744.662,It's a 12 to 8.
1973.73-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1744.662,1745.341,12 to 8.
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,1745.341,1749.968,Regular non-rotating night work is 12 to 8.
1973.73-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1998.35,2010.808,"Are you suggesting it's really that -- as used in the statute, the term working conditions meaning something different and what it means in its primary (Inaudible)"
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,2010.808,2020.184,"Well, I'm saying that -- that-- it -- it had -- it had over the years acquired a specialized technical meaning that was incorporated into the Act."
1973.73-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2049.025,2058.003,Would your case be any different as the testimony before Congress about the meaning of working conditions had come from somebody other than a Corning witness?
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,2058.003,2061.576,"Oh no -- no, that's just a -- a cute element."
1973.73-29,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2078.326,2085.914,"Other -- other statutes, other labor statutes have the term working conditions."
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,2103.955,2105.058,A special -- a specialized -- a specialized meaning.
1973.73-29,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2105.058,2108.101,Specialized in the context of evaluation.
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,2108.101,2110.046,"Yes, and -- and I'd like -- I'd like to elaborate --"
1973.73-29,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2110.046,2119.267,That -- that -- that then is a narrower definition and would be given the same term in the National Labor Relations Act?
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,2119.267,2122.183,"I think that's true, yes."
1973.73-29,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2122.183,2132.629,"Mr. Tuttle, how do you dispose of Congressman Goodell's comments that Corning places such a great reliance on?"
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,2132.629,2135.777,"I -- I can't dispose of them, Mr. Justice."
1973.73-29,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2147.99,2152.259,"Well, when you say that, you say not the sponsor of 6060."
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,2154.876,2165.679,"He was involved in the legislation and in the fact, had introduced the bill which differed in the respect that it would have called for work under equal working conditions and not similar working conditions."
1973.73-29,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2165.679,2169.445,I doubt if you can relegate him to the back seat in congress as --
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,2169.445,2171.463,"I -- I don't -- no, I don't -- I don't propose to do that."
1973.73-29,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2264.942,2277.911,"Supposed, hypothetically, the Court should find that the night and day difference is in fact a working condition under this Act, how does -- where does that take you on this case?"
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,2277.911,2279.593,"It takes me to my next point, Mr. Chief Justice."
1973.73-29,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2279.593,2280.327,All right.
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,2280.327,2294.623,"Which is, that even if the Court should find that time of day worked were a working condition, we believe that under the peculiar circumstances of this case, that the work jobs are nonetheless equal."
1973.73-29,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2318.269,2331.829,You don't suggest that that's an attitude in industry generally on the part of employees and factories.
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,2331.829,2340.846,"No, we're not -- we're not making any suggestion about any other employer than this one and we're really, if you have to go back in the history to even get this attitude."
1973.73-29,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2358.48,2361.809,Was this alternative argument applicable?
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,2368.432,2369.741,Yes.
1973.73-29,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2369.741,2371.62,Is there -- is there a similar record?
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,2371.62,2374.506,"Oh, the records are virtually identical."
1973.73-29,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2384.664,2388.544,"Well, suppose we should disagree with you on that?"
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,2393.663,2415.532,"Then -- then you should consider whether or not the factor here -- see, our contention is that the factor of night work where it is separately compensated for by a negotiated difference is effectively eliminated from the Act as a consideration in evaluating the equality of the work."
1973.73-29,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2450.19,2457.934,"But I am still puzzled, is there any difference between these two cases on this argument you're now -- now making?"
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,2457.934,2463.23,There is no difference on this argument.
1973.73-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2463.23,2465.193,"Well, but you do have different records, don't you?"
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,2474.844,2497.863,"Once you -- once you -- If you were to decide with us that time of day of worked was not a working condition or if it was a working condition that it was out of the case because it was separately compensated, then you would have to look at the record to consider the record in that case to consider Corning's other defenses and that the record is -- is factually in some respects difference -- different."
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2516.009,2552.181,"Mr. Tuttle, sorry to interrupt, let's put aside the Corning -- the peculiarities of the Corning case here such as the claim that no matter what the differential originated as a sex -- as a sex discrimination, just in an ordinary case, what difference would it make whether a shift differential which you can see this warrant, I take it you can see that -- that higher pay for a night work is not a violation of the Act."
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,2552.181,2552.817,Of course.
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2552.817,2560.629,"Now, what difference does it make for the, you say, the reason it isn't is that it's a working condition or that it is under the other, the more general fact --"
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,2560.629,2562.23,The -- the factor other than sex?
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2562.23,2562.795,Yes.
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,2562.795,2577.075,"Well, if -- if you were to conclude that it was a working condition and if you were to reject my argument with respect to separate compensation taking that difference out of the case, then you would conclude that the Act was inapplicable."
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2591.045,2615.608,"I know that's this case, but normally if you -- if you -- if a union and management negotiate for a separate identifiable additional compensation for night work applicable to everybody who works at night, I take it you would agree that's --"
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,2615.608,2616.49,We wouldn't be here.
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2616.49,2621.673,"Now, why would that differential not violate the Act?"
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,2621.673,2622.84,"Well, because --"
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2622.84,2631.462,"And -- but would it make any difference which answer you give, whether because it's a working condition or it's not a sex oriented factor?"
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,2631.462,2637.084,Only -- only if you have the peculiar historical anomaly which you have here of two different differentials.
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2637.084,2641.503,"All right, only then in the -- in a unique case such as this?"
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,2641.503,2643.956,I -- I think this case is -- is quite unique.
1973.73-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2656.113,2672.221,"Supposing you have a shift differential where people on the night shift gets $6 an hour, people on the day shift get $3 an hour, and you also assure that they day shift is 50/50 men and women, the night shift is 90% men, 10% women."
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,2687.036,2697.299,"No, I don't think so.One of the things I wanted to suggest is that I don't think our interpretation puts the Court in the business of job evaluation."
1973.73-29,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3085.964,3090.09,"Well, absent the red circle rates, would you be here?"
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3090.09,3093.739,You mean with respect to after January 1969?
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3104.573,3112.516,"(Voice Overlap) red circle rates, that after a certain date, everybody was receiving the same pay?"
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3112.516,3113.041,"No, no, what happened --"
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3113.041,3114.007,"No, what?"
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3114.007,3115.309,I'm sorry.
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3117.343,3118.868,"Well, no, what?"
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3124.847,3127.322,We would only be -- we'll only be here for back pay.
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3127.322,3128.772,How far back?
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3128.772,3138.362,"Well, there's a stipulation amongst the parties in the New York case, that if back pay is owing, it's owing since November 1st of 1964."
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3139.858,3141.697,To whom?
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3141.697,3143.455,"-- which was brought later, it's a --"
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3143.455,3145.211,Owing to whom?
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3145.211,3156.315,"Owing to the employees who received the discriminatory wage, the daytime inspectors."
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3158.925,3159.024,I understand that.
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3159.024,3161.596,-- as part of the remedies under the Act.
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3168.679,3174.537,"Yes, but I just wanted -- who would -- who would be entitled to back pay?"
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3174.537,3179.459,We -- we believe that the daytime inspectors entitled to back pay.
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3179.459,3180.992,Back to 60 --
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3180.992,3186.771,"Back to 1964, they -- they've all been receiving at least 20 cents or in the neighborhood of 20 cents less an hour --"
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3186.771,3187.124,But --
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3187.124,3192.111,"-- for work which is rated and which by hypothesis is equal, I mean by hypothesis that we got to this point."
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3192.111,3199.098,"And also, I suppose, nighttime inspectors who don't have the grandfather higher pay?"
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3199.098,3200.988,"Well, there aren't any of those --"
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3200.988,3201.012,Not anymore?
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3201.012,3210.711,"-- since January 20 because there were -- there were so many people on layoff that it's going to be some time before anybody gets this, this nighttime January 20 rates."
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3210.711,3210.84,All right.
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3210.84,3212.882,They're all -- they're all getting the higher rates.
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3212.882,3214.169,I see.
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3214.169,3218.528,And we believe that it's perfectly clear that this was not intended as Corning had suggested.
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3218.528,3224.269,But when was -- when was nighttime inspection opened up to everybody?
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3224.269,3224.292,June --
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3224.292,3224.847,Sixty-six?
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3224.847,3226.418,"In New York, June 1 of 1966."
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3226.418,3227.705,In 1966.
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3231.675,3235.242,"No, nighttime inspectors received the same rate."
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3235.242,3236.006,All of them?
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3236.006,3237.3,Yes.
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3237.3,3244.135,"Even after the -- when the nighttime differential went in, I thought that the --"
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3244.135,3246.797,"Well, the nighttime differential went in in 1944."
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3246.797,3248.083,Yes.
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3248.083,3248.877,The initial higher --
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3248.877,3250.446,How about the plant-wide?
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3250.446,3253.815,In 1944 was when they adopted a plant-wide differential.
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3261.322,3261.772,Yes.
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3261.772,3264.804,They were paid double wage.
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3282.566,3283.061,Well I agree.
1973.73-29,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3283.498,3287.812,I thought -- I thought you said in 1966 it all leveled off.
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3287.812,3293.329,"In -- in 1966, there -- women were allowed to exercise their seniority."
1973.73-29,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3293.329,3300.74,"Well, I thought you said that, except for the night differential, all wages for comparable work leveled off."
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3300.74,3301.623,"No, no."
1973.73-29,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3319.383,3324.241,"So that -- so that on the same shift, people were getting different pay."
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3324.241,3328.151,"No, because there's no one -- there was no one getting the January 20 --"

1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3331.044,3337.421,"Eventually, eventually after -- after January 20 of 1969."
1973.73-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3337.421,3349.898,"Mr. Tuttle, if the red circle system had not been taken care off in 1969 on, would there been an economic strike?"
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3349.898,3353.246,"Oh, I'm sorry, would you repeat the question?"
1973.73-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3353.246,3356.82,If the red circle system had not been carried --

1973.73-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3356.825,3360.705,"-- on from 1969 on, would Corning have been subjected to an economic strike?"
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3360.705,3363.979,There -- There's nothing on the record on that.
1973.73-29,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3363.979,3370.513,"Well, what do you think?"
1973.73-29,1,17125,allan_abbot_tuttle,,3370.513,3372.704,It will be speculation on my part.
1973.73-29,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3412.798,3413.734,Very well Mr. Tuttle.
1973.73-29,2,42307,scott_f_zimmerman,,3415.895,3428.275,"Yes I do, if I may, Your Honor, may it please the Court."
1973.73-29,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3575.603,3592.99,"Well, if we were to hold that there may be a differential whether unilaterally fixed by the employer or negotiated with a bargaining contract, under a bargaining contract, does that get you home free?"
1973.73-29,2,42307,scott_f_zimmerman,,3592.99,3595.539,"Your Honor, I -- I don't think so."
1973.73-29,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3647.739,3651.653,"Lost a little bit, Mr. Zimmerman, I confess."
1973.73-29,2,42307,scott_f_zimmerman,,3677.605,3678.07,(Voice Overlap) --
1973.73-29,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3678.07,3690.295,But I don't understand your last answer that seems to suggest that it does solve the problem and then it seems to go the other way that it doesn't solve the problem.
1973.73-29,2,42307,scott_f_zimmerman,,3690.295,3695.041,"Perhaps I didn't fully appreciate the significance to your question, Your Honor."
1973.73-29,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3721.443,3723.918,"Well, I thought Mr. Tuttle agreed with that?"
1973.73-29,2,42307,scott_f_zimmerman,,3723.918,3733.262,"Well, if he does, then I don't know why we are in this Court because I -- think that he's rejected that -- that as a solution to this case."
1973.73-29,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3733.262,3738.049,"(Voice Overlap) one was 16, and one was 20 more."
1973.73-29,2,42307,scott_f_zimmerman,,3738.049,3739.239,"Yes, Your Honor."
1973.73-29,2,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3739.239,3741.596,You don't get to that?
1973.73-29,2,42307,scott_f_zimmerman,,3741.596,3744.848,"Well, I will Your Honor."
1973.73-29,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3887.236,3889.943,We -- We need to know a little more about his.
1973.73-29,2,42307,scott_f_zimmerman,,3889.943,3914.075,"On -- On deposition, a witness was asked the question and this was a witness who was not employed by Corning Glass Works until sometime in late -- very late 1930s, 1939, 1940, was asked the question by the government, “Why did Corning Glass Works pay this higher rate in 1925?” fifteen years before he went to work there and he responded by saying a number of different things."
