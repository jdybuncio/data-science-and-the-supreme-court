1984.84-476,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,76.614,"Mr. Ennis, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1984.84-476,1,44613,william_a_eagles,,1881.645,1897.572,"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, over 20 years ago this Court decided New York Times v. Sullivan."
1984.84-476,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1963.647,1972.42,Has anyone ever succeeded in getting a recovery from The New York Times since Sullivan that you're aware of?
1984.84-476,1,44613,william_a_eagles,,1976.555,1984.042,"I don't know offhand, Your Honor."
1984.84-476,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2348.815,2351.867,--But don't you think a half million dollars would be quite chilling?
1984.84-476,1,44613,william_a_eagles,,2356.035,2360.955,"In Alamass County, North Carolina it would indeed, sir."
1984.84-476,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2460.469,2475.562,Do you agree that there should be immunity for a good faith statement not made maliciously?
1984.84-476,1,44613,william_a_eagles,,2475.562,2479.949,That's the common law position in North Carolina.
1984.84-476,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2491.923,2502.814,And the standard which this action would go to trial would be the equivalent of the standard required under New York Times v. Sullivan as you understand it?
1984.84-476,1,44613,william_a_eagles,,2502.814,2504.731,"As I understand it, Your Honor, that's correct."
1984.84-476,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2550.126,2565.802,"Well, do you tend to agree that anything short of that standard certainly would provide a significant chilling effect on people who otherwise might furnish information to public officials?"
1984.84-476,1,44613,william_a_eagles,,2565.802,2567.052,"Well, I believe so, Your Honor."
1984.84-476,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2687.348,2703.892,Do you think it's desirable that appointed officials for public positions be made aware of even reasonable rumors that are floating around about people that they might be considering for appointment?
1984.84-476,1,44613,william_a_eagles,,2705.809,2722.754,"I think it's desirable for government officials who are acting on the basis of some information to the benefit or detriment of a particular individual, to make that individual aware of it and have an opportunity to respond to it in other areas."
1984.84-476,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2722.754,2725.973,"Well, that's not the question I asked... what do they do with it."
1984.84-476,1,44613,william_a_eagles,,2725.973,2726.49,I'm sorry.
1984.84-476,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2726.49,2739.965,"I'm asking initially if you think that as a matter of public policy, it's desirable that as much information as possible be funneled into appointing authorities, even if it consists only of rumors."
1984.84-476,1,44613,william_a_eagles,,2739.965,2755.892,"Yes, Your Honor, I think it is in fact a valuable... can potentially be a valuable service for someone to make government officials aware of information of which they cannot themselves be certain."
1984.84-476,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2931.941,2941.213,"Mr. Eagles, Mr. Smith was not appointed, was he?"
1984.84-476,1,44613,william_a_eagles,,2941.213,2942.013,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1984.84-476,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2942.58,2943.248,What is he doing now?
1984.84-476,1,44613,william_a_eagles,,2943.248,2973.252,"He's in private practice of law in Burlington, North Carolina in the community where some copies of these letters were found among the general population and in the community where word of the existence of them reached him from rumor in the streets before opportunity had been... before he had ever seen a copy of it and the other ways he heard about it."
1984.84-476,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2973.252,2974.718,Is that in the record?
1984.84-476,1,44613,william_a_eagles,,2974.718,2975.203,Well--
1984.84-476,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2975.203,2975.969,"Well, is it?"
1984.84-476,1,44613,william_a_eagles,,2977.753,2983.873,"--The only part of that that's in the record, Your Honor, is in depositions that I guess have not yet been filed."
1984.84-476,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2987.177,2999.502,What... does the complaint allege any specific damage?
1984.84-476,1,44613,william_a_eagles,,2999.502,3006.073,"--The complaint alleges that he was damaged in his professional reputation in the community, as well as his reputation--"
1984.84-476,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3006.073,3010.358,So that alleges that there has been damage in the community.
1984.84-476,1,44613,william_a_eagles,,3010.358,3011.46,--That's correct.
1984.84-476,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3011.46,3018.663,Which I take it alleges that the people in the community know about it.
1984.84-476,1,44613,william_a_eagles,,3018.663,3019.482,"Oh, yes."
1984.84-476,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3156.337,3159.823,"You have three minutes remaining, Mr. Ennis."
