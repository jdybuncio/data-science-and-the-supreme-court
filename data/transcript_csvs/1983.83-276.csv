1983.83-276,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,8.487,We will hear arguments first this morning in Selective Service System against Minnesota Public Interest Research.
1983.83-276,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,12.808,29.769,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, on July 2nd, 1980, President Carter, pursuant to statutory authority, reactivated a draft registration requirement for men between the ages of 18 and 26."
1983.83-276,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,276.878,281.18,"May I ask, Mr. Solicitor General, what is the dimensions of this problem?"
1983.83-276,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,284.199,284.599,To date?
1983.83-276,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,284.599,285.567,Yes.
1983.83-276,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,285.567,286.051,To date.
1983.83-276,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,300.911,303.363,What is the total number who have registered?
1983.83-276,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,303.363,308.647,--I will give you some figures and you can extrapolate and I can extrapolate.
1983.83-276,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,480.744,491.334,"Why, Mr. Solicitor General, did Congress... is there any indication in the history why did they want the registration without the actual authority to draft?"
1983.83-276,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,491.334,507.046,"That decision, of course, was made at an earlier point in time, and I guess it was made in 1980, and actually was reflected in President Carter's proclamation, but I would assume that it is simply a readiness statute."
1983.83-276,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,655.475,664.664,"Do we know, Mr. Solicitor General, how many of that 350 to 380,000 who have not registered are receiving financial aid?"
1983.83-276,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,664.664,666.283,We do not.
1983.83-276,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,666.283,667.15,Or are asking for it?
1983.83-276,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,667.15,667.75,We do not.
1983.83-276,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1049.014,1049.481,General Lee?
1983.83-276,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1049.481,1049.7,Yes.
1983.83-276,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1049.7,1053.985,I notice that the individual plaintiffs in the District Court were all anonymous.
1983.83-276,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1056.104,1058.087,"No, not as far as I know."
1983.83-276,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1058.087,1062.508,Mr. Keppel.
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,1062.508,1080.485,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question before you today is whether the Constitution will countenance now and for the future the use of leverage of a statutory benefits program to enforce an unrelated penal statute."
1983.83-276,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1104.835,1121.129,Would you view in the same way a statute that provided that no loan applicant would be... receive aid if he owed any delinquent taxes to the federal government?
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,1121.129,1130.818,"The repayment of a loan, Mr. Chief Justice, is at least related to the payment of other obligations."
1983.83-276,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1147.114,1150.399,What about... Let me try this hypothetical.
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,1188.005,1195.428,"The repayment of the loan, Mr. Chief Justice, is not in itself a crime."
1983.83-276,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1365.652,1378.245,"Mr. Keppel, is there anything in the record that tells what percentage of all applicants to colleges in Minnesota, if that is the relevant... are eligible for financial aid?"
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,1380.697,1397.873,The affidavit of Robert Kusenko and the brief of the amicus group of colleges headed by the University of Minnesota indicates that about 80 percent of all financial aid money is federally funded and comes within this statute.
1983.83-276,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1436.95,1457.613,Do those statistics show... perhaps you have answered it and I just didn't get it... what percentage of the applicants for... the ratio perhaps the people who would be eligible for these federal funds bear to the total number of applicants for admission or the total number of people admitted?
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,1457.613,1461.499,"That is not in the record, Your Honor."
1983.83-276,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1461.499,1473.123,"Mr. Keppel, isn't a class an open... certainly as applied to people who are becoming 18?"
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,1486.697,1499.94,"Justice O'Connor, this Court has indicated that inescapability, and that is the rubric that the government uses in describing what you are talking about, inescapability is not required."
1983.83-276,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1560.931,1574.172,"Mr. Keppel, would it not be a permissible construction of the statute to avoid the constitutional question to treat it the way the Solicitor General suggested, that... in accordance with means and the manner required by rather than within the time required?"
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,1576.107,1583.278,In the manner required is not a literal interpretation.
1983.83-276,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1583.278,1586.38,Wouldn't that be in the best interests of your clients to so construe the statute?
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,1586.38,1608.661,"My clients, Your Honor, do not fall within the group of people who are unaware of their obligation to register, and so with the threat of criminal prosecution hanging over them because the government has been careful not to grant immunity to late registrants, with the threat of criminal prosecution hanging over them, it would not be in their best interest."
1983.83-276,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1608.661,1612.113,"In other words, you are saying they wouldn't register anyway?"
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,1616.232,1622.755,There is no question but that they are adversely affected.
1983.83-276,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1664.332,1684.56,"What would you say about a person who had been convicted of some criminal act and in prison and then a fugitive, escaped from the prison, that had a pension due him either from the government or from some private source."
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,1701.505,1703.707,There--
1983.83-276,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1703.707,1707.575,He has to show up in order to get the benefit.
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,1712.813,1719.383,"--The statute in that case, Mr. Chief Justice, is evenhanded."
1983.83-276,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1755.758,1762.329,"You referred to the Act as it was in the sixties, I think you said the seventies also."
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,1775.969,1778.605,"Yes, the draft was in effect at the time, Your Honor."
1983.83-276,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1778.605,1780.123,"That makes it somewhat different, doesn't it?"
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,1792.348,1803.739,"That is correct, Your Honor, but by the same token, that provides the argument that there is nothing sacred about their present forebearance."
1983.83-276,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1852.053,1853.005,One question.
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,1859.575,1873.835,"There is a statute of limitations in prosecutions for non-registration, Justice Marshall, and that has been extended, as the government notes in its reply brief to five years after one attains his 26th birthday."
1983.83-276,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1873.835,1875.785,"So, I mean, you keep saying forever."
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,1878.154,1892.73,"The effect on these young men could be viewed as longlasting, and certainly beyond the statutory period, because their college degrees are being terminated with the termination of their aid."
1983.83-276,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1892.73,1897.082,"I am only talking about prosecution, criminal prosecution."
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,1897.082,1898.734,And that criminal prosecution--
1983.83-276,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1898.734,1900.236,Five years.
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,1900.236,1904.188,--potential ceases five years after attaining the 26th birthday.
1983.83-276,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1904.188,1917.329,"Mr. Keppel, would you have difficulty if the government just gave an outright financial grant of, say, $50 a person to get people to register for the draft?"
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,1921.281,1927.351,That would be leverage far less drastic than is the leverage here.
1983.83-276,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1938.158,1946.662,"Well, if the grant program operated the same way, and they are cut off from the outright grant if they don't register, how is that different?"
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,1946.662,1952.566,"In this case, they are required to certify themselves."
1983.83-276,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1956.954,1958.989,"Well, that is your self-incrimination argument."
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,1962.524,1968.262,This Court has noted that punishment has to be determined in the context of the particular case.
1983.83-276,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1980.569,1984.187,"It is just less money, I suppose."
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,1984.187,2000.733,"--It is less money, but it also has a far less drastic impact on the young men, because they may not be penalized by $50, but when you are cutting them off completely, we are talking about quite a different matter."
1983.83-276,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2020.36,2023.598,"Mr. Keppel, take Justice O'Connor's example a point further."
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2057.986,2063.723,--If it targets an identifiable group and if it inflicts punishment--
1983.83-276,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2063.723,2066.591,"Well, I ask you to answer a question yes or no."
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2066.591,2077.899,"--I would consider that very close to what we are talking about here, absent the self-incrimination problem that we have also in Section 1113."
1983.83-276,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2077.899,2079.851,"So you feel that, too, would be a bill of attainder?"
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2079.851,2082.887,"It would in my judgment, Justice Rehnquist."
1983.83-276,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2189.656,2194.041,"It is a punishment that can easily be avoided, can it not?"
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2194.041,2196.143,The punishment--
1983.83-276,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2196.143,2200.362,The punishment as you describe it.
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2200.362,2239.422,"--It can be avoided, Chief Justice, by registering, but this Court has also held that, in cases like Spevack, that the ability to obtain other kinds of work or the like cannot be imposed, and furthermore, in Grasso and Marketti, the Court said it is not whether these young men have a right to register or not to register, but once having chosen not to, whether they can be compelled to incriminate themselves, and contrary to what the government suggests, this is not a separate or this is not a combined argument."
1983.83-276,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2267.572,2277.714,"Mr. Keppel, do you disagree with the basic figures as I understand the other side to give us that there have been 300,000 or 400,000 people who have been late registrants, and none of them have been prosecuted?"
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2277.714,2282.182,"I have no reason to quarrel with that, Justice Stevens."
1983.83-276,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2282.182,2286.051,"So the probability of prosecuting, getting prosecuted for a late registration is really quite low."
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2286.051,2294.49,"The probability today is quite low, but as I mentioned, late registrants have been prosecuted in the past."
1983.83-276,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2314.22,2320.641,Has anyone ever been prosecuted when there was just a registration requirement without a draft system?
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2320.641,2324.778,"Please, I missed the question."
1983.83-276,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2324.778,2334.384,Has anyone ever been prosecuted for failing to register except when there was a draft system extant?
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2334.384,2337.003,I am aware of no such situation.
1983.83-276,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2337.003,2342.388,"There have been prosecutions for failure to register, haven't there, in different jurisdictions?"
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2342.388,2347.041,There have been a number of them in the last few years.
1983.83-276,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2352.762,2357.832,"Mr. Keppel, are you about to address your privilege argument?"
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2357.832,2360.032,Yes.
1983.83-276,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2360.032,2362.551,May I ask this?
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2376.559,2377.561,That is true.
1983.83-276,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2377.561,2390.951,"Well, isn't it also true that if he were to say, I waive my privilege against self-incrimination, I admit that I have not registered, would he not also be denied any aid?"
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2390.951,2402.092,The waiver of the privilege would not get him federal aid.
1983.83-276,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2402.092,2411.632,"Then my question is, where is the coercion in this scheme, the compulsion to force students to waive?"
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2411.632,2416.102,The compulsion is in their need for financial aid.
1983.83-276,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2417.669,2431.445,"If it doesn't make any difference whether they admit or refuse to say whether they have registered, in both cases, they would be denied aid, how does the scheme work with compulsion?"
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2431.445,2437.349,--The scheme of Section 1113 is part of the reason why it violates the Fifth Amendment.
1983.83-276,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2454.025,2460.679,"But as I understand it, if he waives by admitting that he has not complied, he is not going to get any aid anyway."
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2460.679,2467.933,"--But for this section, which has been found to be unconstitutional, he would get aid."
1983.83-276,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2494.166,2515.229,"If this statute said, if you will waive, you will get... and admit that you have not complied, you will get the aid, I can see the compulsion then of the provision, but if he is not to get it, at least as to this scheme, it is difficult to see where the government compulsion is for purposes of the privilege."
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2515.229,2518.531,The compulsion is that they need the aid.
1983.83-276,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2544.099,2555.473,"Mr. Keppel, what if we disagree with you on the first part of your argument, and say that late registration is permissible under the statute?"
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2562.127,2563.246,"Justice White, we do."
1983.83-276,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2563.246,2579.339,"And in that situation, if he says, no, I have not registered but I want to register now in order to get the aid, your Fifth Amendment argument is still there, I take it."
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2579.339,2580.522,It is indeed.
1983.83-276,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2580.522,2586.16,"And Justice Brennan's question would be answered, wouldn't it?"
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2586.16,2589.112,"It would, Your Honor."
1983.83-276,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2589.112,2593.098,"They could get the aid, as long as they registered--"
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2593.098,2594.248,As long as--
1983.83-276,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2594.248,2597.133,"--and in the course of doing so, admitting that they were late."
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2597.133,2599.085,--And that's what they'd be doing.
1983.83-276,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2607.858,2612.56,"But if you agree with that construction of the statute, the violation of law has dissipated."
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2618.881,2631.89,"Looking at the Fifth Amendment problem as one in which invoking one's right to remain silent makes the price that is paid too costly, as this Court held in Spevack--"
1983.83-276,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2631.89,2632.44,The price is zero.
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2635.192,2637.044,"--If there is immunity, there is no problem."
1983.83-276,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2639.144,2642.429,So in other words your argument fails if the statute is construed the other way.
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2670.765,2673.133,"That is exactly correct, Justice White."
1983.83-276,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2803.066,2807.053,"May I ask you another question, because I am a little confused on the statutory scheme."
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2829.15,2832.852,That fact will be known to the government.
1983.83-276,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2832.852,2833.954,"Well, that is not my question."
1983.83-276,1,45174,william_j_keppel,,2836.739,2840.774,"In the application itself, you do not disclose--"
1983.83-276,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2840.774,2842.326,You just have to say you have registered.
