1960.94,0,41434,stuart_e_hertzberg,,27.369,31.486,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.94,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,106.746,110.969,"More accurately, we have reached two conclusions."
1960.94,0,41434,stuart_e_hertzberg,,110.969,113.1,"A sua sponte opinion, Your Honor --"
1960.94,0,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,113.1,113.826,That's the way I narrowed (Voice Overlap) --
1960.94,0,41434,stuart_e_hertzberg,,113.826,117.253,-- took a different position.
1960.94,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,793.184,795.03,But New York -- New York and --
1960.94,0,41434,stuart_e_hertzberg,,795.03,795.165,Pardon?
1960.94,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,795.165,799.331,"-- Michigan, New York and Michigan belong to the same family States, don't they?"
1960.94,0,41434,stuart_e_hertzberg,,799.331,802.521,"That is right, Justice Stewart."
1960.94,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,808.159,817.688,They -- they provide that a creditor who extends credit between the time of the execution of the chattel mortgage and its recording or filing is protected against mortgage (Inaudible).
1960.94,0,41434,stuart_e_hertzberg,,817.688,818.636,That's right.
1960.94,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,826.647,829.897,And Michigan provides that it must be done forthwith or at least did at the time of this (Voice Overlap) --
1960.94,0,41434,stuart_e_hertzberg,,829.897,831.107,"That's right, immediately."
1960.94,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,836.304,837.959,Yes.
1960.94,0,41434,stuart_e_hertzberg,,837.959,861.362,"Now, the Sixth Circuit and the respondents failed to see this particular distinction that I have pointed out in Constance versus Harvey because the Sixth Circuit cited Holt versus Crucible Steel which was decided by the Supreme Court of the United States and In re American Textile Printers Society as refusing to follow Constance versus Harvey."
1960.94,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1086.093,1086.94,You may.
1960.94,0,41434,stuart_e_hertzberg,,1086.94,1088.875,Thank you.
1960.94,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1088.875,1096.607,Mr. Rohr.
1960.94,1,40324,richard_d_rohr,,1096.607,1101.526,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1960.94,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1173.842,1178.307,"Constance against Harvey didn't say anything contrary to that, did it?"
1960.94,1,40324,richard_d_rohr,,1178.307,1180.187,It held contrary to that.
1960.94,1,15097,john_m_harlan2,scotus_justice,1180.187,1181.09,Did it?
1960.94,1,40324,richard_d_rohr,,1181.09,1184.227,"I will attempt to show that, Justice Harlan."
1960.94,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1747.927,1749.409,Is that the Committee Reports you're reading from?
1960.94,1,40324,richard_d_rohr,,1749.409,1757.298,This is the Report of the House Committee on the judiciary favorably reporting out H. R. 7242.
1960.94,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1821.976,1827.844,"After the vetoed liaison, the bill wasn't -- the -- the legislation didn't pass over the veto."
1960.94,1,40324,richard_d_rohr,,1827.844,1828.867,"No, sir --"
1960.94,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1828.867,1829.751,What?
1960.94,1,40324,richard_d_rohr,,1829.751,1830.43,-- it -- it --
1960.94,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1830.43,1834.005,Nothing was done in the -- in subsequent Congress?
1960.94,1,40324,richard_d_rohr,,1834.005,1834.534,This was --
1960.94,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1834.534,1834.569,(Voice Overlap) --
1960.94,1,40324,richard_d_rohr,,1834.569,1841.062,-- in the very recent short session after the nominations just last September.
1960.94,1,15107,william_o_douglas,scotus_justice,1842.581,1842.873,I see.
1960.94,1,40324,richard_d_rohr,,1842.873,1848.832,-- congressional return or returning the bill.
1960.94,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,1854.741,1859.191,Is there any -- was there a Senate Committee Report that made any reference to this?
1960.94,1,40324,richard_d_rohr,,1859.191,1861.064,"If there was, sir, I'm not aware of it."
1960.94,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2512.575,2513.865,(Voice Overlap) --
1960.94,1,40324,richard_d_rohr,,2513.865,2513.974,Pardon.
1960.94,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2513.974,2518.834,Have you -- have you -- your brief with reference to that article by Professor McLachlan?
1960.94,1,40324,richard_d_rohr,,2518.834,2519.39,"No, sir."
1960.94,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2519.45,2523.214,Because I -- it was -- I had read it at a time but forgot where it was.
1960.94,1,40324,richard_d_rohr,,2523.214,2532.83,"I -- I -- to keep the brief short, I referred to a Michigan Law Review which collects almost everything and I'm sure the citation is in there, sir."
1960.94,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2532.83,2535.545,He used some strong language.
1960.94,1,40324,richard_d_rohr,,2535.545,2535.947,He does.
1960.94,1,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2535.947,2543.394,(Inaudible) use some strong language.
1960.94,1,40324,richard_d_rohr,,2543.394,2549.75,So most cases may be harmonized with the view as the Calhoun case.
1960.94,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2773.599,2774.619,Mr. Hertzberg.
1960.94,2,41434,stuart_e_hertzberg,,2774.619,2776.909,I have no rebuttal before (Inaudible).
1960.94,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2776.909,2789.574,Would you mind just to responding a moment to -- to Mr. -- counsel's statement that there's no time limitation on the doctrine of Constance.
1960.94,2,41434,stuart_e_hertzberg,,2793.962,2801.43,"Certainly, if -- if the Court please, certainly, the time limitation would be the individual statute of limitations of the various States."
1960.94,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2874.997,2882.355,What do you say to the -- about the abortive legislature passage of the Act of the Congress?
1960.94,2,41434,stuart_e_hertzberg,,2882.355,2885.482,"Well, my comment is this, Justice Frankfurter."
1960.94,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2905.122,2908.084,"You mean in District Court, they -- they made all these criticisms?"
1960.94,2,41434,stuart_e_hertzberg,,2908.084,2909.369,"No, I'm -- I'm saying that the --"
1960.94,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2909.369,2910.799,(Voice Overlap) --
1960.94,2,41434,stuart_e_hertzberg,,2910.799,2911.357,Pardon?
1960.94,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2911.357,2912.51,You mean at the time Moore --
1960.94,2,41434,stuart_e_hertzberg,,2912.51,2914.037,At the time of the various decisions --
1960.94,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2914.037,2914.245,Yes.
1960.94,2,41434,stuart_e_hertzberg,,2914.245,2914.358,-- these charges were made.
1960.94,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2914.358,2919.07,But in those -- as to Moore and Bay the legislation actually passed --
1960.94,2,41434,stuart_e_hertzberg,,2919.07,2923.639,"In Moore versus Bay, legislation was not passed until eight years after the decision."
1960.94,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,2964.623,2991.548,"I -- I don't think that's the significant of what I understood to be the legislative history of the last session of Congress, significant that I find -- I'm not saying it's controlling because that's -- there's no thing that raises a great question as to what significance you attached to the latest congressional attitude that does not actually take the form of a measure on the statute."
1960.94,2,41434,stuart_e_hertzberg,,3006.044,3006.6,That is correct.
1960.94,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3008.859,3021.57,"Well, all I'm saying is that here, we've got a rather unusual situation of both on the Congress agreeing on a bill which spelled by the President's veto unrelated to that separate measure."
1960.94,2,41434,stuart_e_hertzberg,,3038.427,3038.643,Then it is --
1960.94,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3038.643,3056.955,"But suppose I start with that, what -- to what extent should that be displaced at that agreement with the opinion because you got actually an enactment so it fail, as I said, because of the President's veto (Inaudible) unrelated grounds."
1960.94,2,41434,stuart_e_hertzberg,,3056.955,3070.332,"My personal opinion, Justice Frankfurter, would be the Court should take the same position that it took in Corn Exchange versus Klauder where it was anticipated that the Registration Acts or Congress was going to immediately amend after the results of that decision anyway."
1960.94,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3090.795,3096.325,But we have to make a -- we have to make an originating construction so far as this Court is concerned --
1960.94,2,41434,stuart_e_hertzberg,,3096.325,3096.529,That is correct.
1960.94,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3096.529,3097.624,-- is it not?
1960.94,2,41434,stuart_e_hertzberg,,3100.202,3101.133,That is right.
1960.94,2,15050,felix_frankfurter,scotus_justice,3101.133,3110.235,"So, it didn't merely saying in the First or the Second Circuit because whenever we make privately take (Inaudible) between the Second and the Sixth, can we?"
1960.94,2,41434,stuart_e_hertzberg,,3110.235,3112.995,"No, Your Honor."
1960.94,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3121.823,3125.436,Very Well.
