1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,26.756,31.336,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,339.87,343.613,In the Lanham Act?
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,343.613,346.7,If the case comes here in regard of the Lanham Act case.
1966.214,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,359.887,362.878,So you mean whether fund from which the --
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,362.878,363.768,Short of the fund case.
1966.214,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,363.768,364.184,Yes.
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,364.184,364.204,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.214,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,364.204,365.185,"Yes, that's Sprague -- Sprague is the funding."
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,365.185,366.253,They -- that's right.
1966.214,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,370.927,371.338,Yes.
1966.214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,371.338,383.088,"What if we don't -- what if -- what if -- what if we don't read the opinion as broadly, what you said is that in -- sort of -- that they did say clearly that never remand on that case."
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,383.088,384.628,"Well, then it's still an important question."
1966.214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,384.628,385.156,Yes.
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,386.543,387.307,I have the same argument.
1966.214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,387.307,387.653,(Inaudible)
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,387.653,389.295,"Exactly, exactly."
1966.214,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,389.295,397.796,"Well, you -- you're not arguing, are you, that the Lanham Act authorizes attorney's fees in any case?"
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,397.796,398.596,"Yes, I do."
1966.214,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,398.596,399.281,You do argue that?
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,399.281,399.874,Yes I do.
1966.214,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,399.874,407.78,And then you argue that if the Lanham Act does not authorize that the Court nevertheless has equity power.
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,407.78,407.991,I say --
1966.214,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,407.991,408.539,Is that correct?
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,408.539,415.182,"-- that the Lanham Act does authorize it, but if it doesn't, it does not subtract from a power already present."
1966.214,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,429.017,429.292,I understand that --
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,429.292,430.57,-- the first Judiciary Act.
1966.214,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,430.57,440.569,"But are you relying, -- so far as your Lanham Act argument is concerned, are you relying on Section 35 or are you relying on any specific --"
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,440.569,440.595,No never.
1966.214,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,440.595,442.373,-- language of the Lanham Act?
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,442.373,447.798,"Your Honor, there is no expression in the Lanham Act which have those words."
1966.214,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,451.36,451.594,I see.
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,451.594,452.764,There is no such.
1966.214,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,452.764,453.32,So you're saying that --
1966.214,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,453.32,453.556,What is --
1966.214,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,453.556,463.128,"-- it's implicit in the Lanham Act or if it's not implicit in the Lanham Act, then the power resides in the courts of general equity jurisdiction?"
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,463.128,485.205,"Yes, the power -- the Lanham Act Section 35 says that a registrant whose rights have been violated is entitled -- is entitled to injunction or injunctions of previous section, to the defendant's profits, to the plaintiff's damages, and the cause of action and it prefixes all by saying subject to the principles of equity."
1966.214,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,485.205,489.65,"Well, Mr. Lasky, do you bring this within any of those three as example cause of action or you say --"
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,489.65,489.814,Yes.
1966.214,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,489.814,491.142,-- independently at all?
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,491.142,491.736,No.
1966.214,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,496.736,497.75,"Well, does it ordinarily?"
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,497.999,498.284,Yes.
1966.214,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,498.284,500.203,"It does in England of course, but does it in the United States?"
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,500.203,500.986,"Yes, yes."
1966.214,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,507.502,508.802,But I -- excuse me --
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,508.802,508.842,Yes sir.
1966.214,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,508.842,513.625,-- but -- I -- this is important point to me.
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,522.049,523.27,I think they do.
1966.214,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,523.477,528.879,-- and then you are relying on the system as therapies?
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,528.879,529.354,No.
1966.214,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,553.879,558.002,"But it -- in the United States, generally do we get that, that's the cost?"
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,558.002,561.503,"Well in 1928, this Court said we do not have to pass on it now."
1966.214,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,576.065,580.564,"Except -- except with those, because that really was in the context of the fund, wasn't it?"
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,580.564,580.577,It was --
1966.214,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,580.577,581.709,-- and that is ordinarily (Voice Overlap) --
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,581.709,582.261,Not exactly.
1966.214,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,585.015,586.107,And subject to it.
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,586.107,587.233,"Yes, I think so."
1966.214,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,611.786,618.641,"Is that -- were all five Circuit Court cases think I haven't read them, that you cite are -- they were -- this has been sustained?"
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,620.45,621.078,Yes.
1966.214,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,621.68,622.932,"The First, Second, Third, and Seventh?"
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,622.932,624.125,"Yes, they're Lanham."
1966.214,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,631.501,632.77,But in all of these are in the Lanham Act?
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,632.77,641.523,"All are Lanham Act case except the first one, the Aladdin case which was decided in 1941, five years before the Lanham Act was passed."
1966.214,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,919.118,933.797,"Well, is your position that this power exists with respect to trademark infringement cases but not for example with respect to unfair competition kind of like other than by trademark?"
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,933.797,934.385,"No, no."
1966.214,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,938.398,946.511,"Now, how about any other kind of tort, how about business secrets torn or whatever?"
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,946.511,948.534,It has been applied on business secret cases.
1966.214,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,948.534,952.289,"Well, what -- what is your -- what's the position you're urging on us that --"
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,952.289,952.462,"Well, I think --"
1966.214,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,952.462,956.209,-- that's something -- something special about handling cases?
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,956.209,957.345,Let me explain Your Honor.
1966.214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1011.227,1016.318,Are you -- are you asking us that we have to have (Inaudible)?
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1016.318,1016.906,No.
1966.214,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1043.247,1050.126,"Mr. Lasky, perhaps I -- I seem to having difficulty in getting my question to you."
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1080.032,1080.207,Yes.
1966.214,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1080.207,1081.86,That's what I'm trying to get to.
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1081.86,1082.554,"Yes, Your Honor."
1966.214,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1088.262,1092.789,"Well, now why -- what is there about the trademark cases --"
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1092.789,1093.271,A fair question --
1966.214,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1093.271,1093.642,-- that distinguishes it?
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1093.642,1097.105,-- which I'll attempt to answer right now.
1966.214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1188.131,1192.085,"Now, but what remedy -- what remedy is allowed under the Lanham Act?"
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1195.479,1200.656,"The Lanham Act provides of course, you may recover damages if you can control them."
1966.214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1250.777,1260.597,This is judging -- isn't the judging have entitled to allow some additional sum as he think is -- is just under the Lanham Act?
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1260.597,1282.506,"I think Section 36 confines that statement to the assessment of damages, damages owned.I have Section 35 rather, in assessing damages, the Court may enter judgment according to the circumstances of the case where any sum above the amount found is actual damages, not exceedingly to that."
1966.214,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1282.506,1286.883,There have to be some actual damage before he can use this provision?
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1286.883,1288.93,"Well, that's what bothers me."
1966.214,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1306.706,1319.145,"Except, you're really suggesting it seems to me that the criterion for attorney's fees or one of the criteria should be a kind of a punitive damage consideration?"
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1319.145,1333.233,It is -- I wouldn't agree with that Mr. Justice Fortas because punitive damages imposes a penalty which it has no relation to compensation and we do not claim here that the plaintiff should have get an award more --
1966.214,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1333.233,1333.295,That's what --
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1333.295,1334.706,-- than its own attorney's fees (Voice Overlap) --
1966.214,0,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1334.706,1336.718,"Yes, but that -- that's measuring it."
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1353.837,1359.947,"The cases, the Aladdin case I cited, said that these are -- it had never been justified as punitive damages."
1966.214,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1397.586,1399.371,When the Lanham Act was passed --
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1399.371,1399.958,Pardon?
1966.214,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1399.958,1405.583,"When the Lanham Act was passed, did the report say anything about lawyer's fees?"
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1405.583,1406.822,Not a word.
1966.214,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1406.822,1411.545,Was anything said about lawyer's fees in the hearing?
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1411.545,1411.908,The legislative --
1966.214,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1411.908,1413.147,"-- in the hearing, the legislative --"
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1413.147,1414.915,There appears to be not a word on it.
1966.214,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1414.915,1416.618,Not a word?
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1416.618,1418.511,Not a word on it.
1966.214,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1418.528,1423.978,But why does the Congress had wanted to give attorney's fee when they have nothing to do in the number of other cases?
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1423.978,1427.31,"Well, I -- I think the answer is --"
1966.214,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1427.31,1427.52,I think --
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1427.52,1427.648,-- it was necessary.
1966.214,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1427.648,1443.162,"-- quite frankly, I have to test it if I see it, but I think you give a little too much omniscious to pertinent committee when you think that they would have understood from the cryptic words of equity that that meant they were going to get lawyer's fees."
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1443.162,1460.017,"Well, this very question of what the Lanham Act did and did not do has been thoroughly set forth in an opinion in the A. Smith Bowman case by Chief Judge Leahy in the District of Delaware, case I cite."
1966.214,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1491.719,1492.976,What committee is that?
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1492.976,1495.656,This was the Uniform --
1966.214,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1495.656,1496.852,Committee of lawyers?
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1496.852,1499.083,Commissioners on Uniform State Law.
1966.214,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1499.083,1501.468,Were they lawyers?
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1501.468,1504.492,"I believe they are, yes."
1966.214,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1504.576,1508.736,They -- they suggested that they get lawyers too?
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1508.736,1512.518,"If -- Your Honor, it isn't a question from whether a lawyer gets his fees or not."
1966.214,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1523.983,1526.222,It's not a question of lawyer's fees?
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1526.222,1531.718,I don't think it's a question of whether a lawyer is going to get his compensation for his services or not.
1966.214,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1531.718,1536.208,"Would that be a pretty good way to get it, wouldn't it?"
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1537.956,1541.965,It depends on who's more solved; your own client or the other party.
1966.214,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1544.792,1546.819,But you have five more minutes.
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1546.819,1548.21,"I would -- yes, I know."
1966.214,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1550.647,1551.756,That's all.
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1551.756,1552.544,-- for a reply.
1966.214,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1552.544,1553.119,Alright.
1966.214,0,36243,moses_lasky,,1553.119,1558.749,I'll simply make this submission that the power -- the power as such does exist.
1966.214,0,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1578.352,1580.318,Mr. Hutchinson.
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,1580.318,1585.685,"Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court."
1966.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1667.177,1676.797,May I ask you the statement of your understanding of what can be assessed against a defendant in the Lanham Act case?
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,1676.797,1705.267,"As I understand the Lanham Act provision which is Section 1117 of the U.S. Code 36 as I believe is the Lanham Act Section, the Court may award compensation, actual damages which can be measured by either one or perhaps and I'm not certain about this, a combination of two measures."
1966.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1718.06,1720.955,In other words -- in other words all the profits?
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,1720.955,1725.381,-- that can get one or both or perhaps its one recovery.
1966.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1736.679,1745.237,So that the Act itself provides that a defendant can be held out also three times the amount of the damages he suffered?
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,1745.237,1752.638,Up to three times the actual damages as determined by either one of these methods or a combination of them.
1966.214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1829.746,1832.467,"What was the result on the merits here, Mr. Hutchinson?"
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,1832.467,1844.997,"On the merits, in the first trial, the trial judge -- District Judge, Chief Justice incidentally of this district ruled in favor of the defendants without qualification or limitation --"
1966.214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1844.997,1846.267,That's your client?
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,1846.267,1848.904,"Yes, Maier and Ralphs -- Maier and Ralphs."
1966.214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1848.904,1849.717,Yes.
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,1849.717,1864.446,"On appeal, the Court of Appeals stated that the -- that that Court was not to be bound by the District Court's finding as to the likelihood of confusion."
1966.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1915.347,1920.083,Accounting which was inclusive to cover for damages and so on?
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,1920.083,1926.622,"Yes, as I understand the accounting, it's another way of determining the plaintiff's damages."
1966.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1963.367,1965.191,That accounting has not been held?
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,1965.191,1965.382,No.
1966.214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1991.266,1993.456,"Well, let's see if I understand your point."
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,1998.355,1999.685,"There would be no recovery of any kind, even --"
1966.214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1999.685,2001.494,Because your clients prevailed.
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,2001.494,2002.092,Yes.
1966.214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2002.092,2004.496,"But then, there was an injunction mandated that held it?"
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,2004.496,2005.301,Yes.
1966.214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2005.301,2010.257,And this then brought on one motion to assess attorney's fees or something?
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,2010.257,2010.705,Yes sir.
1966.214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2032.475,2036.851,"They based it on the merits but what -- in other words, the $60,000 counsel fee allowed?"
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,2036.851,2038.489,"Yes, attorney's fees were $60,000 and the --"
1966.214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2038.489,2041.549,But why is it -- how was that it arrived -- arrived at?
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,2041.549,2044.698,It was arrived at by the testimony of the --
1966.214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2044.698,2046.056,Then there was a hearing on this thing?
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,2046.056,2047.105,"Yes, on the amount, yes sir."
1966.214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2047.105,2047.759,I see.
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,2047.759,2051.936,The order for attorney's fees was made without any additional evidence.
1966.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2061.636,2063.916,But there has been no accounting?
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,2063.916,2064.788,"No, and it was --"
1966.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2064.788,2068.955,How did it -- how was it subject to appeal?
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,2068.955,2074.206,"We felt we could not take a chance on it as being treated as the final order, so we appealed."
1966.214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2088.501,2089.635,Under the interlocutory appeal?
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,2089.635,2094.257,"Yes, Section 1292 of the -- of 28 U.S.C."
1966.214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2278.837,2294.086,"What would you say absent the Lanham Act, would you say that -- that you would -- I gather your suggestion of the provision of the Lanham Act itself indicate there should be no attorney's fee?"
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,2294.086,2295.523,"Yes, as we see it --"
1966.214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2295.523,2299.875,But now what – absence of the Act-- in the absence of the Act.
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,2299.875,2307.237,"Well, the facts of this case -- there could be no recovery because all these state-generated issues had been eliminated."
1966.214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2308.81,2312.439,Do you think -- do you think Aladdin was in rule?
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,2312.439,2317.485,"I believe insofar as it dealt with -- sure Lanham Act was used, yes sir."
1966.214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2317.485,2319.017,"Yes, but that was before the Lanham Act?"
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,2319.017,2319.684,Yes.
1966.214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2327.732,2330.847,"Well I doubt, didn't it -- didn't that opinion deal with this subject anyway."
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,2337.148,2344.659,As I recall Aladdin treated the award of attorney's fees as compensatory damages rather than exemplary.
1966.214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2344.659,2347.051,Yes.
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,2347.051,2363.038,"This sort of thing doesn't fit, in my idea at least, as damages, any -- unless we adopt the English system or some modification of it, attorney's fees either way are not what we call damages."
1966.214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2373.508,2376.144,But that was something in the antitrust law has provided for.
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,2376.144,2377.052,"Yes, they're all -- they are very expressed --"
1966.214,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2377.052,2378.148,(Voice Overlap)
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,2378.148,2380.12,-- very expressed.
1966.214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2398.579,2412.707,"Well, I take that the position of the other side is that even -- even in the Lanham Act case were damages where a jury trial is required that attorney's fees would be awarded."
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,2412.707,2430.124,"Well, they seem to take the view that the inherent powers of the courts, the federal courts in equity matters somehow throws a cloak over as purely statutory proceeding in such ways to augment or assimilate some unstated power."
1966.214,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2443.846,2448.007,"Yes, but once, they traded mark actions before they were statutes?"
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,2448.007,2452.913,I doubt that there were any in the federal jurisdiction other than on diversity grounds.
1966.214,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2567.511,2569.315,What are the remarks?
1966.214,1,30730,j_albert_hutchinson,,2569.315,2589.506,"They referred to a deposition of a witness prior to the first trial and state that they are quoting from their brief in the first appeal and apparently, trying to make our people because though they were named pirates or something of the sort."
1966.214,2,36243,moses_lasky,,2921.202,2922.154,"Yes, if the Court please."
1966.214,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3223.429,3228.734,Do you have any cases regarding attorney's fees in equity in the past cases?
1966.214,2,36243,moses_lasky,,3228.734,3230.474,Had there been?
1966.214,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3237.217,3244.854,"Well, I know, but that's -- you don't have any cases of attorney's fees was not allowed in patent case or equity or law."
1966.214,2,36243,moses_lasky,,3244.854,3245.087,No.
1966.214,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3247.056,3248.448,When was the statute --
1966.214,2,36243,moses_lasky,,3248.448,3249.134,When was the statute --
1966.214,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3249.134,3251.602,"Under the statute, the statute permits it?"
1966.214,2,36243,moses_lasky,,3251.602,3252.684,"Yes, I would think so."
1966.214,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3252.684,3258.296,Is that the only case that's been known?
1966.214,2,36243,moses_lasky,,3258.296,3266.935,"Very well, probably the statute has been there so long that the people would actually refer to the statute."
