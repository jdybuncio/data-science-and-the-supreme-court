1971.71-1016,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,43.219,"We will hear arguments next in 71-1016, Federal Power Commission v. Louisiana Lights and Powers, and 71-1040, United Gas Pipe Line against Louisiana Light and Power, consolidated cases."
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,45.293,47.586,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1971.71-1016,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,69.871,71.148,State that first one again.
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,71.148,95.822,"Yes, sir, whether the Federal Power Commission has jurisdiction under Section 1 (b) of the Natural Gas Act, and sections 4, 5 and 16 to regulate the curtailments of service of gas transported in interstate commerce by interstate pipelines, regardless of whether the customer is a customer of a distribution company, or a direct purchaser from the pipeline."
1971.71-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,281.325,289.645,"It held that the Commission had the power neither under 1 (b) 4 and 5, nor under Section 7 or 8."
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,289.645,301.516,"Sir, it appeared to me that the Fifth Circuit held that under Section 7 (b) the Commission could have an abandonment proceedings and order the direct industrials completely out of an interstate pipeline."
1971.71-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,305.533,310.066,"Oh yes, but they held that they cannot have a curtailment proceeding?"
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,310.066,310.799,"That's correct, sir."
1971.71-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,310.799,312.116,Under section 7.
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,312.116,326.915,"No, sir they didn't really approach that, they only said that to the extent that the Federal Power Commission has any jurisdiction, it's under Section 7, and that would be limited to the initial certification or the abandonment, but nothing in between."
1971.71-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,326.915,327.616,Yes.
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,327.616,334.067,"And the curtailment proceedings are handled under Section 4 and 5 and 16, not under Section 7."
1971.71-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,334.067,347.094,"Well, I know but wasn't one of the claims before the Fifth Circuit that there could be a curtailment sort of abandonment under Section 7?"
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,347.094,348.137,"Yes, sir."
1971.71-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,348.137,350.071,And they rejected that?
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,350.071,351.013,"I can't say that, sir."
1971.71-1016,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,644.112,646.825,Transco was an initial certification proceeding?
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,646.825,649.6,Yes sir.
1971.71-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,683.31,691.745,Would United have to get to consent of the Federal Power Commission to curtail transportation to LP&L?
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,691.745,692.722,Yes sir.
1971.71-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,692.722,694.757,Under what section?
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,694.757,701.237,-- they would have to -- assuming the contract [Voice Overlap]
1971.71-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,701.237,703.206,Let's assume there was no contract --
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,703.206,703.957,No contract at all.
1971.71-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,703.957,713.511,"They have just been selling gas to LP&L over a long period of time, and they suddenly decided they want to sell it all to, to transport it farther East."
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,713.511,714.877,"No sir, they could do not do that."
1971.71-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,714.877,716.196,Will they have to get consent?
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,716.196,716.66,Yes sir.
1971.71-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,716.66,718.53,Under what section?
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,718.53,729.259,"The Federal Power Commission has ordered all pipelines that are unable to meet all their contracts, direct or indirect filed under Section 4."
1971.71-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,729.259,733.723,"I know they have ordered but that's sort of assuming the answer to this case, isn't it?"
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,733.723,738.555,"Well sir, it seems to me that the Federal Power Commission has three choices."
1971.71-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,749.615,751.398,Or forbid it?
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,751.398,754.208,"Or forbid it, well it's not necessary -- yes sir, that's correct."
1971.71-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,768.63,777.168,"Would United have to get consent from the Federal Power Commission if it cut down its deliveries to its domestic, to the utilities for the resale?"
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,777.168,779.701,Yes sir.
1971.71-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,779.701,788.049,"So one way or another, if they can't satisfy both direct users then the utility customers are going to have to --"
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,788.049,789.428,Somebody is going to be curtailed.
1971.71-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,789.428,791.354,Somebody is going to have to go to the Commission?
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,791.354,792.13,Yes sir.
1971.71-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,792.13,792.535,One way or the other?
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,792.535,805.221,"Yes sir, but the Fifth Circuit has held that the direct customers do not come to the Commission, they are free to sue for their full contract quantities in Court and then it's up to the Court to determine who had to allocate the gas and decide who gets the gas."
1971.71-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,805.221,812.249,"Well, there are some contract provisions on the contract sale under which United could curtail without coming in the Commission?"
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,812.249,820.6,"Well sir, the problem with that is there are some 300 and some odd contracts on United system that all the contract provisions are not the same."
1971.71-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,875.529,890.282,So a court could decide that United had to satisfy deliveries to LP&L and the Commission could refuse to give United the permission to cut down its gas deliveries to the utility resale.
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,890.282,891.587,That's a possibility sir.
1971.71-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,893.098,895.022,Exactly the same circumstances.
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,895.022,897.384,"I think so, I am not sure I understood your question but --"
1971.71-1016,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,897.384,902.889,"Well, I mean to Commission and the courts could decide it differently?"
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,902.889,905.698,"Oh yes sir, no question about that."
1971.71-1016,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,935.478,940.19,"May I ask Mr. Gooch, this gets back back to a question Mr. Justice White asked you earlier."
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,946.956,962.342,"No sir, I don't mean to say that -- I don't think there is any question in the Fifth Circuit's decision that the Commission could proceed by way of abandonment and knock a direct industry or any other customer of an interstate pipeline, I don't think --"
1971.71-1016,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,962.342,964.63,What does this mean in 17A?
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,986.782,1010.396,"We didn't claim that sir, we weren't claiming that we had a modification of the certificate, what we were saying was that under Section 4 and 5 of the Natural Gas Act, that says that the Commission has certain powers among of which is to prevent discrimination against any person, that we have the power to overwrite the contracts that were behind those certificates."
1971.71-1016,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1010.396,1015.806,"Are you saying then that to do what you are doing in this case, you could not operate under Section 7?"
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,1015.806,1028.785,"No sir, we could not because until the end of a lengthy proceeding, I don't know who would determine where the interstate gas supply would go, that would depend on who got to the courthouse first, or who was closer to the interstate source and --"
1971.71-1016,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1028.785,1032.508,If that have to be done on an individual by point company basis?
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,1032.508,1033.214,Yes sir.
1971.71-1016,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1033.214,1035.499,And individual contract basis?
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,1035.499,1036.789,Not only individual contract but --
1971.71-1016,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1036.789,1038.173,But each individual pipelines?
1971.71-1016,0,25381,gordon_gooch,,1038.173,1047.721,"Yes sir, it does because the Federal Power Commission has no jurisdiction whatsoever to order interstate pipelines to exchange gas among themselves."
1971.71-1016,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1062.23,1070.218,Very well Mr. Gooch.
1971.71-1016,1,45061,william_c_harvin,,1074.785,1079.496,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court."
1971.71-1016,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1465.155,1468.95,Thank you Mr. Harvin.
1971.71-1016,2,15711,andrew_p_carter,,1471.134,1474.934,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1971.71-1016,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1942.088,1942.937,Mr. Carter.
1971.71-1016,2,15711,andrew_p_carter,,1942.937,1944.658,"Yes, Your Honor."
1971.71-1016,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1944.658,1953.343,"Turning to 1(b) is there a specific exclusion there, that you are relying on."
1971.71-1016,2,15711,andrew_p_carter,,1953.343,1968.638,"Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, we are relying on the exclusion that comes about from the conservatory proviso that commences with but shall not apply to any other transportation or sale of natural gas."
1971.71-1016,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2380.071,2403.851,"I take it that if the contract here between United and LP&L had expired and United said to LP&L we are only going to send you half as much gas from now on, that ceased transporting that much to LP&L that you say the United wouldn't have to get permission from anybody?"
1971.71-1016,2,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2403.851,2419.421,"No, I think Your Honor at that point at the termination of a contract, you have a situation then developed that is akin to a new certificate because now you're going to have a new contract, so I think if United took that position --"
1971.71-1016,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2419.421,2421.999,"What if United said, we aren't going to send you anything?"
1971.71-1016,2,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2421.999,2427.012,"They said, we are not going to send you anything, I think we would just have to go look for another supplier, Mr. Justice White."
1971.71-1016,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2427.012,2437.027,But as far as I know you would probably have to but wouldn't United have to get consent of the FPC before it terminated this transportation?
1971.71-1016,2,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2437.027,2442.294,"Actually, I have my own debates within myself as to that to give you an honest answer --"
1971.71-1016,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2442.294,2462.258,"Well, I mean within the Transco and I suppose that would be a veto if the FPC might say, -- if LP&L came up to the commissioner and says, please don't give them consent, you would say, would the FPC have veto power over that termination?"
1971.71-1016,2,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2462.258,2465.256,"I would think probably not, Mr. Justice White."
1971.71-1016,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2466.789,2468.945,You must say that.
1971.71-1016,2,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2468.945,2471.29,"No, I don't think so."
1971.71-1016,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2697.679,2720.736,"Mr. Carter, turning back to 1(b) and in some of this authority that it grants in the first part of the statute, do you conceive the reservations in the latter part of the section, to take away parts that were granted in the first section or are they simply a statement of the adverse side, simply pointing out what wasn't granted?"
1971.71-1016,2,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2720.736,2751.657,"I think they are a very carefully phrased reservation of the powers to the states, so that if you could look at it this way and I am not saying that it's the only way to look at it, but you could look at it as though those first portions of that section or the statement of jurisdiction by the FPC, and that the latter conservatory proviso is to indicate which portions of that upper part are actually reserved to the states."
1971.71-1016,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2751.657,2762.211,"So, you say then, that were it not for the provisos, the granting would give broader power if it stood by itself?"
1971.71-1016,2,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2762.211,2769.343,"I am not sure, I understand that question, Your Honor, if you mean if the two sections suppose were separated?"
1971.71-1016,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2769.343,2776.758,"Yeah, assume that the granting provisions stood by themselves and what you refer to as the conservatory provisions were absent."
1971.71-1016,2,15711,andrew_p_carter,,2783.573,2789.542,"Oh, yes, I do think that."
1971.71-1016,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3002.536,3008.945,Didn't our recent case in Florida tend to undermine your position on that?
1971.71-1016,2,15711,andrew_p_carter,,3008.945,3027.893,"Not at all, Mr. Chief Justice, because you have in the case of the Green System, a wholly different channel, there is a different pressure from the Black System."
1971.71-1016,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3111.452,3122.618,What was the Court's power to do this ab initio in a suit like this rather than on review of the Power Commission?
1971.71-1016,2,15711,andrew_p_carter,,3122.618,3128.134,"Mr. Justice White, the FPC voluntarily walked into this cases."
1971.71-1016,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3132.13,3139.993,"Let's assume it hadn't walked into it, and the United would have had to plead the primary jurisdiction."
1971.71-1016,2,15711,andrew_p_carter,,3139.993,3147.903,"Even if it had not walked into it, I would say to you that once it got into it and took part then the Panhandle case applies --"
1971.71-1016,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3147.903,3150.012,Let's assume it never was in it.
1971.71-1016,2,15711,andrew_p_carter,,3150.012,3155.425,"Well, if it never was in it, I don't think you would ever have the question of primary jurisdiction arise."
1971.71-1016,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3155.425,3161.812,"Well, I don't know, United easily could have raised it."
1971.71-1016,2,15711,andrew_p_carter,,3177.368,3179.812,It might have made a difference.
1971.71-1016,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3179.812,3182.736,It could have been arguable primary jurisdiction in the Commission?
1971.71-1016,2,15711,andrew_p_carter,,3182.736,3186.28,"I don't think it would have been, but it might have."
1971.71-1016,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3186.28,3196.359,But in any event the Commissions coming in and litigating the issue curative --
1971.71-1016,2,15711,andrew_p_carter,,3196.359,3204.601,"I think it did in terms of what has actually happened here, yes, Your Honor."
1971.71-1016,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3227.582,3228.719,"Thank you, Mr. Carter."
1971.71-1016,3,25381,gordon_gooch,,3234.019,3240.188,"Thank you, Mr Chief Justice."
1971.71-1016,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3269.326,3282.096,"Mr. Gooch, would you conceive that if your opponents could bring these curtailment matters within the definition of anything that they referred to as the conservatory portions of (b) that you would lose?"
1971.71-1016,3,25381,gordon_gooch,,3282.096,3296.703,"No, sir, because if we are going to lose on that ground, we are going to lose because it's not in the transportation jurisdiction because I don't think those language would be -- based on the legislative history and the reading of the statute, I don't think the 'but for' language makes any difference."
1971.71-1016,3,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3301.333,3307.309,"Okay, but then if it doesn't make any difference, if it's within the transportation jurisdiction, it shouldn't come within any of them."
1971.71-1016,3,25381,gordon_gooch,,3310.707,3314.625,"Yes, I agree, sir."
1971.71-1016,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3478.125,3484.733,Did United itself come into this or prior to the FPC?
1971.71-1016,3,25381,gordon_gooch,,3484.733,3485.46,Yes.
1971.71-1016,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3485.46,3489.192,And under what section did it wrote this?
1971.71-1016,3,25381,gordon_gooch,,3489.192,3491.39,It asked for a declaratory order.
1971.71-1016,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3491.39,3492.002,Under what?
1971.71-1016,3,25381,gordon_gooch,,3492.002,3496.553,Under our regular rules of practice and procedures for asking a declaratory order.
1971.71-1016,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3496.553,3500.164,But what kind of power the Commission did it asked to be invoked?
1971.71-1016,3,25381,gordon_gooch,,3500.164,3519.309,"Well, you see United already had a curtailment plan as part of their tariff and they did not have to file a new curtailment plan at that time and they asked the Commission, if they were faithfully following the curtailment plan that Commission wanted to follow, and so that would be under -- in my view under both Section 4 and 5."
