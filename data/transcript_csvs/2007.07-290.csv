2007.07-290,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.932,"We will hear argument today in Case 07-290, District of Columbia versus Heller."
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,7.121,29.173,"Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Second Amendment was a direct response to concern over Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, which gave the new national Congress the surprising, perhaps even the shocking, power to organize, arm, and presumably disarm the State militias."
2007.07-290,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,101.345,110.06,"If you're right, Mr. Dellinger, it's certainly an odd way in the Second Amendment to phrase the operative provision."
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,119.707,128.251,"Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that the phrase ""the people"" and the phrase ""the militia"" were really in... in sync with each other."
2007.07-290,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,138.889,140.48,"But if that's right, doesn't that cut against you?"
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,148.085,155.002,"Yes, I do believe it includes all the people in the sense of Verdugo-Urquidez, all those who are part of the polity."
2007.07-290,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,178.855,209.653,"One of the concerns, Mr. Dellinger, of the framers, was not to establish a practice of amending the Constitution and its important provisions, and it seems to me that there is an interpretation of the Second Amendment differing from that of the district court and in Miller and not advanced particularly in the red brief, but that conforms the two clauses and in effect delinks them."
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,242.328,243.389,--Yes.
2007.07-290,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,243.389,250.278,"And this makes, it does... I think you're quite right in the brief to say that the preface shouldn't be extraneous."
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,265.116,289.745,"Justice Kennedy, I think any interpretation that delinks the two clauses as if they were dealing with related but nonetheless different subject matters has that to count against it, and what you don't see in the debates over the Second Amendment are references to, in those debates, the use of weapons for personal purposes."
2007.07-290,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,301.319,308.643,"Well the subject is ""arms"" in both clauses, as I've suggested is the common subject, and they're closely related."
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,308.643,318.607,"--I think, as this Court unanimously held in Miller, or at least noted in Miller... I'll leave aside the debate."
2007.07-290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,329.587,352.06,"I don't see how there's any, any, any contradiction between reading the second clause as a... as a personal guarantee and reading the first one as assuring the existence of a militia, not necessarily a State-managed militia because the militia that resisted the British was not State-managed."
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,378.315,392.046,"Yes, but once you assume that the clause is designed to protect the militia, it... surely it's the militia that decides whether personal possession is necessary."
2007.07-290,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,402.633,407.57,"Well, do you think the clause, the second clause, the operative clause, is related to something other than the militia?"
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,407.57,409.275,--No.
2007.07-290,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,409.882,410.32,All right.
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,410.74,420.972,"--the second clause, the phrase ""keep and bear arms"", when ""bear arms"" is referred to... is referred to in a military context, that is so that even if you left aside--"
2007.07-290,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,420.972,432.823,"--It had nothing to do with the concern of the remote settler to defend himself and his family against hostile Indian tribes and outlaws, wolves and bears and grizzlies and things like that?"
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,432.823,437.994,--That is not the discourse that is part of the Second Amendment.
2007.07-290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,447.415,449.428,Blackstone thought it was important.
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,462.236,471.045,"--When Blackstone speaks of the personal guarantee, he describes it as one of the use of weapons, a common law right."
2007.07-290,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,489.257,499.266,"Well, that may be true, but that concedes your main point that there is an individual right and gets to the separate question of whether the regulations at issue here are reasonable."
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,499.266,524.43,"--I don't dispute, Mr. Chief Justice, that the Second Amendment is positive law that a litigant can invoke in court if a State were to decide after recent events that it couldn't rely upon the Federal Government in natural disasters and wanted to have a State-only militia and wanted to have everybody trained in the use of a weapon, a Federal law that interfered with that would be a law that could be challenged in court by, by an individual."
2007.07-290,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,525.632,527.164,Mr. Dellinger--
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,527.164,527.539,--Yes.
2007.07-290,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,527.539,546.279,"--short of that, just to get your position clear, short of reactivating State militias, on your reading does the Second Amendment have any effect today as a restraint on legislation?"
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,546.279,554.417,"It would, Justice Ginsburg, if the State had a militia and had attributes of the militia contrary to a Federal law."
2007.07-290,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,555.384,557.681,"But it doesn't, as far as I know."
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,557.681,559.303,"--As far as I know, today it doesn't."
2007.07-290,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,572.566,578.578,"Your argument is that its purpose was to prevent the disarming of the organized militia, isn't that correct?"
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,578.578,579.234,--That is correct.
2007.07-290,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,579.234,592.091,"And if that was the purpose, then how could they... how could the Framers of the Second Amendment have thought that it would achieve that purpose, because Congress has virtually plenary power over the militia under the militia clauses?"
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,592.091,600.443,"That is because, I think, Justice Alito, that those who wanted to retake State authority over the militia didn't get everything they wanted."
2007.07-290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,606.051,608.89,"They got nothing at all, not everything they wanted."
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,620.292,621.934,"Yes, but if... well--"
2007.07-290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,621.934,627.307,"So what, what was the function served by the Second Amendment as far as the militia is concerned?"
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,627.307,633.351,--It is by no means clear that the Federal Government could abolish the State militia.
2007.07-290,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,671.351,680.566,"Well, but your reading of the militia clause, the militia clause specifically reserves certain rights to the States by its terms."
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,694.869,700.227,"I'm not sure I followed the, the question exactly, but--"
2007.07-290,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,700.227,707.195,"Well, the militia clause, Article I, Section 8, says certain rights are reserved to the States with respect to the militia."
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,717.939,733.448,"--The debate over the militia clause... what is shocking about the militia clauses is that this is a, a new national government that for the first time has the power to create a standing army of professionals."
2007.07-290,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,768.777,771.151,But the Second... the Second Amendment doesn't repeal that.
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,776.743,777.195,No.
2007.07-290,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,777.195,778.943,So it was supplementing it.
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,790.174,800.608,It restricted in our view the authority of the Federal Government to interfere with the arming of the militia by the States.
2007.07-290,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,867.439,883.402,So what you are... what you are saying is that the individual has a right to challenge a Federal law which in effect would disarm the militia and make it impossible for the militia to perform those functions that militias function.
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,885.898,886.666,--Yes.
2007.07-290,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,887.15,887.618,Okay.
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,887.618,889.337,And if the Court--
2007.07-290,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,889.337,891.085,"May ask this question, Mr. Dellinger?"
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,899.94,909.372,--I think they are highly relevant to your inquiry because now 42 States have adopted constitutional provisions.
2007.07-290,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,909.372,910.812,I'm not talking about those.
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,910.812,911.638,You're talking about at the time.
2007.07-290,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,911.638,919.98,"I'm talking about the contemporaneous actions of the States, before or at the time of the adoption of the Second Amendment."
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,919.98,927.977,I think that the... the State amendments are generally written in different... in different terms.
2007.07-290,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,978.706,983.0,"Well, there's no question that the English struggled with how to work this."
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,999.041,1007.005,--I think it doesn't address the same subject matter as the English Bill of Rights.
2007.07-290,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1017.207,1019.191,I think that would be more restrictive.
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1019.191,1023.064,--That... that could well... the answer then would be--
2007.07-290,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1023.064,1034.852,"Well isn't it... isn't it more restrictive in the sense that the English Bill of Rights was a guarantee against the crown, and it did not preclude Parliament from passing a statute that would regulate and perhaps limit--"
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1034.852,1035.964,--Well--
2007.07-290,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1035.964,1039.415,--Here there is some guarantee against what Congress can do.
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1039.415,1041.556,--Parliament could regulate.
2007.07-290,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1047.194,1050.599,The Bill of Rights only protected the rights of protestants.
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1050.599,1052.502,--This is correct.
2007.07-290,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1052.502,1059.501,"And it was suitable to their conditions then as allowed by law, so it was... it was a group right and much more limited."
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1059.501,1061.767,I think that is... that's correct.
2007.07-290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1061.767,1079.101,"And as I recall the legislation against Scottish highlanders and against... against Roman Catholics did use the term... forbade them to keep and bear arms, and they weren't just talking about their joining militias; they were talking about whether they could have arms."
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1079.101,1129.236,"Well, the different kind of right that you're talking about, to take this to the question of... of what the standard ought to be for applying this, even if this extended beyond a militia-based right, if it did, it sounds more like the part of an expansive public or personal... an expansive personal liberty right, and if it... if it is, I think you ought to consider the effect on the 42 States who have been getting along fine with State constitutional provisions that do expressly protect an individual right of... of weapons for personal use, but in those States, they have adopted a reasonableness standard that has allowed them to sustain sensible regulation of dangerous weapons."
2007.07-290,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1129.895,1133.174,What is... what is reasonable about a total ban on possession?
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1133.174,1148.356,"--What is reasonable about a total ban on possession is that it's a ban only an the possession of one kind of weapon, of handguns, that's been considered especially... especially dangerous."
2007.07-290,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1148.792,1155.086,"So if you have a law that prohibits the possession of books, it's all right if you allow the possession of newspapers?"
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1155.086,1158.085,"--No, it's not, and the difference is quite clear."
2007.07-290,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1184.668,1189.074,The regulation... the regulation at issue here is not one that goes to the number of guns.
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1200.368,1209.052,That is correct because there is no showing in this case that rifles and handguns are not fully satisfactory to carry out the purposes.
2007.07-290,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1214.671,1215.782,The purposes of what?
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1215.782,1218.312,--I'm sorry.
2007.07-290,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1218.312,1221.53,You said there is no showing that rifles and handguns.
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1223.184,1223.874,"Yes, I'm sorry."
2007.07-290,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1224.7,1227.637,Is necessary for the purpose of what?
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1228.745,1243.084,"The purpose... if the purpose... if we are shifting and if we assume for a moment arguendo that you believe this is a right unconnected to the militia, then the purpose would be, say, defense of the home."
2007.07-290,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1275.804,1280.866,But wasn't there a leeway for some weapon prohibition?
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1295.687,1296.124,Yes.
2007.07-290,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1311.367,1312.038,Could you go back to the--
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1312.038,1312.49,--in those States--
2007.07-290,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1312.49,1314.522,If I could just have one follow-on on Justice Ginsburg real quick.
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1321.647,1328.517,"--No, it's not in the text of the State constitutional provision; it's in their--"
2007.07-290,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1328.517,1329.594,It's in interpretation.
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1329.594,1330.221,--reasonable application.
2007.07-290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1348.073,1356.146,"Mr. Dellinger, let's come back to your description of the opinion below as allowing armor-piercing bullets and machine guns."
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1364.862,1365.345,--That is--
2007.07-290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1365.345,1367.547,--that is common for the people to have.
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1378.263,1387.134,"--The number of machine guns, I believe, is in excess of a hundred thousand that are out there now, that are--"
2007.07-290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1387.134,1388.57,How many people in the country?
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1388.57,1393.273,"--Well, there are 300 million, but whether that's common or not, but the--"
2007.07-290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1393.273,1394.536,I don't think it's common.
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1394.536,1400.331,--But it's the... the court protects weapons suitable for military use that are lineal descendants.
2007.07-290,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1426.166,1431.722,"Well, I'm not sure that it's accurate to say the opinion below allowed those."
2007.07-290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1450.14,1456.308,"Or a law on the carrying of concealed weapons, which would include pistols, of course."
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1456.308,1460.336,Let me fight back on the notion that it's a... it's a total ban.
2007.07-290,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1463.46,1466.053,Are you allowed to carry the weapons that are allowed?
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1474.161,1474.832,No.
2007.07-290,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1497.713,1511.066,"But even if you have... even if you have a rifle or a shotgun in your home, doesn't the code prevent you from loading it and unlocking it except when it's being used for lawful, recreational purposes within the District of Columbia?"
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1516.424,1525.748,"--That is not the city's position, and we have no dispute with the other side on the point of what the right answer should be."
2007.07-290,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1544.383,1546.832,"Why don't you remain, Mr. Dellinger."
2007.07-290,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1548.27,1550.568,Because I did interrupt Justice Breyer.
2007.07-290,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1550.568,1553.363,--I just wondered if you could say in a minute.
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1595.736,1600.735,It's a reasonable regulation for two kinds of reasons.
2007.07-290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1619.507,1620.568,"It means ""well trained"", doesn't it?"
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1620.568,1621.941,--When you... when you have one--
2007.07-290,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1621.941,1623.598,"Doesn't ""well regulated"" mean ""well trained""?"
2007.07-290,0,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,1629.299,1638.139,"--Well, every... every phrase of the amendment, like ""well regulated"", ""security of the State"", is something different than a... a libertarian right."
2007.07-290,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1748.374,1750.734,"Thank you, Mr. Dellinger."
2007.07-290,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1760.26,1774.364,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Second Amendment to the Constitution, as its text indicates, guarantees an individual right that does not depend on eligibility for or service in the militia."
2007.07-290,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1774.364,1775.082,May I ask you a preliminary question.
2007.07-290,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1782.42,1789.015,"I don't think so, Justice Stevens, because we don't take the position that the preamble plays no role in interpreting the amendment."
2007.07-290,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1795.964,1799.727,So you think some weight should be given to the clause.
2007.07-290,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1806.741,1811.706,"--Oh, I suppose it probably does define two rights that are closely related."
2007.07-290,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1811.706,1813.316,There's a right to keep arms and a right to bear arms?
2007.07-290,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1813.316,1821.201,"I think that's the better view, and a number of State courts that have interpreted analogous provisions have distinguished between the two rights and looked at them differently."
2007.07-290,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1843.803,1845.912,It doesn't means all.
2007.07-290,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1857.907,1874.512,"Absolutely, Justice Ginsburg, and just... I mean, to give you a clear example, we would take the position that the kind of plastic guns or guns that are specifically designed to evade metal detectors that are prohibited by Federal law are not ""arms"" within the meaning of the Second Amendment and are not protected at all."
2007.07-290,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1894.11,1908.574,"So in your view this amendment has nothing to do with the right of people living in the wilderness to protect themselves, despite maybe an attempt by the Federal Government, which is what the Second Amendment applies to, to take away their weapons?"
2007.07-290,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1908.574,1911.089,"Well, Justice Kennedy, I wouldn't say that it has no application there."
2007.07-290,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1919.602,1942.874,"I agree that Miller is consistent with what you've just said, but it seems to me Miller, which kind of ends abruptly as an opinion writing anyway, is just insufficient to subscribe... to describe the interests that must have been foremost in the framers' minds when they were concerned about guns being taken away from the people who needed them for their defense."
2007.07-290,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1942.874,1958.227,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, we would analyze it this way, which is we would say that probably the thing that was foremost in the framers' minds was a concern that the militia not be disarmed such that it would be maintained as a viable option to the standing army."
2007.07-290,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1981.463,1982.82,Not plenary authority.
2007.07-290,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1982.82,1984.697,--Except for that which is reserved in--
2007.07-290,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1984.697,1985.932,Who appoints the officers?
2007.07-290,1,37772,paul_d_clement,,1985.932,1987.897,"--Yes... no, absolutely."
2007.07-290,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2017.866,2022.74,Do you think he was guided at all by the contemporaneous provisions in State constitutions?
2007.07-290,2,37772,paul_d_clement,,2022.74,2026.394,"I am sure he was influenced by that, although I think, honestly--"
2007.07-290,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2026.394,2030.125,And how many of them protected an individual right?
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2031.954,2037.496,I think... I think Pennsylvania and Vermont are the ones that most obviously protected.
2007.07-290,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2037.496,2039.621,"And the others quite clearly went in the other direction, did they not?"
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2039.621,2041.774,"Well, I don't know about quite clearly."
2007.07-290,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2060.471,2065.529,"There was also a proposal to make it clear there was an individual right, which was also rejected."
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2065.529,2066.842,"--I'm sorry, Justice Stevens."
2007.07-290,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2068.824,2070.965,The Pennsylvania proposal.
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2070.965,2074.666,"Oh, but I don't think that ever made it to the floor of the House or the Senate that I'm aware of."
2007.07-290,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2083.882,2093.393,"You think Madison was guided by the experience and the expressions of the right in English law, including the Bill of Rights of 1689?"
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2093.393,2102.701,"--I do, Justice Kennedy, and I think in that regard it is telling that... I mean, there are a variety of provisions in our Bill of Rights that were borrowed from the English Bill of Rights."
2007.07-290,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2107.995,2119.835,"If we're going back to the English Bill of Rights, it was always understood to be subject to the control and limitation and restriction of Parliament."
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2125.412,2130.614,"--Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think you could say the same thing for every provision of the English Bill of Rights."
2007.07-290,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2135.878,2136.938,But isn't there one difference?
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2154.697,2157.181,"--That's exactly right, Justice Souter."
2007.07-290,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2164.395,2173.688,"This provision has the additional limitation to ""suitable to their conditions"", and a large number of people were not permitted to have arms."
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2173.688,2178.188,"Again, that is also true and is also relatively unique to this amendment."
2007.07-290,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2218.496,2232.398,"May I go back to another point, which is to the same point, and that is consistent with your emphasis on the people was your emphasis a moment ago on the distinction between keeping and bearing arms."
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2284.531,2290.2,"The way I would read it, Justice Souter, is that ""keep"" is really talking about private possession in the home."
2007.07-290,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2300.947,2301.415,But wait a minute.
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2305.522,2309.49,"--I would say that and so would Madison and so would Jefferson, I would submit."
2007.07-290,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2310.146,2316.33,"Somebody going out to... in the eighteenth century, someone going out to hunt a deer would have thought of themselves as bearing arms?"
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2317.734,2326.875,"--Well, I will grant you this, that ""bear arms"" in its unmodified form is most naturally understood to have a military context."
2007.07-290,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2353.52,2360.126,"But it's ""arms"" that has the kind of the military... the martial connotation, I would have thought."
2007.07-290,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2360.126,2371.934,"Wasn't... wasn't it the case that the banning of arms on the part of the Scottish highlanders and of Catholics in England used the term, forbade them to ""bear arms""?"
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2376.59,2379.538,"--And again, I think various phrases were, were used."
2007.07-290,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2400.439,2402.685,"Not only Miller, but the Massachusetts declaration."
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2406.89,2408.309,"Oh, absolutely."
2007.07-290,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2415.979,2418.369,--the right to keep and bear... I'm sorry.
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2423.1,2430.38,"--Well, I mean it's... it's my friends from the District that are emphasizing that no word in the Constitution is surplusage."
2007.07-290,3,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2435.847,2438.798,"And you want to talk about the standard, and your light's on."
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2439.765,2440.327,Okay.
2007.07-290,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2492.09,2500.945,"The freedom of speech that was referred to in the Constitution was also ""the"" freedom of speech, which referred to the pre-existing freedom of speech."
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2516.703,2519.951,"Justice Scalia, let me make two related points."
2007.07-290,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2540.366,2541.068,Like libel.
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2541.068,2546.488,"Like libel, and I would say like laws barring felons from possessing handguns."
2007.07-290,3,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2547.222,2550.002,Or would you say like protecting yourself against intruders in the home?
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2550.002,2570.805,"--Well, that gets to the self-defense component and I don't know that I ever got a chance to fully answer your question on that, Justice Kennedy, which is we would say, notwithstanding the fact that the preamble makes it clear that the preeminent motive was related to ensuring that the militia remained a viable option vis-a-vis the standing army, the operative text is not so limited."
2007.07-290,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2581.427,2615.786,"If the amendment is intended at least, in part to protect the right to self-defense in the home, how could the District code provision survive under any standard of review where they totally ban the possession of the type of weapon that's most commonly used for self-defense, and even as to long guns and shotguns they require, at least what the code says without adding a supposed gloss that might be produced in a subsequent case, that even as to long guns and shotguns they have to be unloaded and disassembled or locked at all times, even presumably if someone is breaking into the home?"
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2615.786,2625.207,"Well, Justice Alito, let me answer the question in two parts if I can, because I think the analysis of the trigger lock provision may well be different than the analysis of the other provisions."
2007.07-290,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2651.147,2652.211,I don't understand that.
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2665.938,2669.548,"--If that's going to be the exception, it could clearly be inadequate."
2007.07-290,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2692.773,2693.616,Can I interrupt for a minute?
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2693.616,2696.536,"If it did, I think then the statute might well be constitutional."
2007.07-290,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2698.97,2704.936,There is a lot of talk about standards and stop words like strict scrutiny.
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2734.377,2752.745,"In our view it makes a world of difference, Justice Ginsburg, because we certainly take the position, as we have since consistently since 2001, that the Federal firearm statutes can be defended as constitutional, and that would be consistent with this kind of intermediate scrutiny standard that we propose."
2007.07-290,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2756.886,2771.208,"Well, these various phrases under the different standards that are proposed, ""compelling interest"", ""significant interest"", ""narrowly tailored"", none of them appear in the Constitution; and I wonder why in this case we have to articulate an all-encompassing standard."
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2805.8,2832.228,"Well, Mr. Chief Justice, let me say a couple of things about that, which is to say that if this Court were to decide this case and make conclusively clear that it really was focused very narrowly on this case and it was in some respects applying a sui generis test, we think that would be an improvement over the court of appeals opinion, which is subject to more than one reading, but as Justice Ginsburg's question just said, it's certainly susceptible to a reading that it embodies strict scrutiny."
2007.07-290,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2832.699,2833.214,"Well, it did."
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2839.882,2840.943,--I--
2007.07-290,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2840.943,2854.658,"But that opinion also, it didn't use the militia prologue to say it's only the kind of weapons that would be useful in militia, and that are commonly... commonly held today."
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2867.37,2898.105,"--Well, Justice Scalia, I think our principal concern based on the parts of the court of appeals opinion that seemed to adopt a very categorical rule were with respect to machine guns, because I do think that it is difficult... I don't want to foreclose the possibility of the Government, Federal Government making the argument some day... but I think it is more than a little difficult to say that the one arm that's not protected by the Second Amendment is that which is the standard issue armament for the National Guard, and that's what the machine gun is."
2007.07-290,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2898.105,2899.841,But this law didn't involve a restriction on machine guns.
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2911.68,2926.343,"I think, Mr. Chief Justice, why one might worry about that is one might read the language of page 53a of the opinion as reproduced in the petition appendix that says once it is an arm, then it is not open to the District to ban it."
2007.07-290,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2943.04,2947.586,But that passage doesn't mean once it's an arm in the dictionary definition of arms.
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2958.845,2959.473,Well--
2007.07-290,3,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2959.473,2962.065,"If you read it that way, I don't see why you have a problem."
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,2962.065,2964.546,"--Well, I... I hope that you read it that way."
2007.07-290,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3020.301,3021.522,"Thank you, General."
2007.07-290,3,37772,paul_d_clement,,3021.522,3022.053,Thank you.
2007.07-290,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3022.053,3032.437,Mr. Gura.
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,3032.437,3043.605,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: All 50 states allow law-abiding citizens to defend themselves and their families in their homes with ordinary functional firearms including handguns."
2007.07-290,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3046.947,3049.181,Talk a little slower; I'm not following you.
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,3049.181,3049.665,--Okay.
2007.07-290,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3173.095,3183.796,"You're saying that this is unreasonable, and that really is my question because I'd like you to assume two things with me, which you probably don't agree with, and I may not agree with them, either."
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,3291.796,3309.04,"Because, Your Honor, for the same reason it was offered by numerous military officers at the highest levels of the U.S. military in all branches of service writing in two briefs, they agree with us that the handgun ban serves to weaken America's military preparedness."
2007.07-290,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3334.875,3349.163,"Well, I didn't read... I read the two military briefs as focusing on the nature of the right, which was quite a pretty good argument there that the nature of the right is to maintain a citizen Army."
2007.07-290,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3395.832,3397.302,You want to say yes.
2007.07-290,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3397.302,3397.817,"Now, why?"
2007.07-290,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3397.817,3398.488,That's your answer.
2007.07-290,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3398.488,3405.269,"Well, you want to say yes, that's correct, but I want to hear what the reasoning is because there is a big crime problem."
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,3407.141,3428.993,"The answer is yes, as Justice Scalia noted, and it's unreasonable, and it actually fails any standard of review that might be offered under such a construction of individual rights because proficiency with handguns, as recognized as a matter of judicial notice by the First Circuit in Cases back in 1942... that was a handgun case where the First Circuit examined the restriction on the carrying of the 30-caliber revolver."
2007.07-290,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3438.629,3445.298,"Let me ask this question: In answering yes, do you attach any significance to the reference to the militia in the Second Amendment?"
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,3445.298,3446.655,"--Yes, I do, Your Honor."
2007.07-290,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3446.655,3452.059,"You think that is... to understand the amendment, you must pay some attention to the militia requirement?"
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,3452.059,3453.357,"Yes, Your Honor, we must--"
2007.07-290,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3453.357,3460.493,"So a conscientious objector who likes to hunt deer for food, you would say, has no rights under the Second Amendment."
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,3468.944,3469.958,"--No, Your Honor."
2007.07-290,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3485.109,3485.924,Is it a limitation?
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,3493.825,3507.068,"--It is a limitation to one extent, Your Honor, the extent recognized in Miller where the Miller Court asked whether or not a particular type of arm that's at issue is one that people may individually possess."
2007.07-290,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3524.608,3533.588,"If it limits the kinds of arms to be appropriate to a militia, why does it not also limit the kind of people who may have arms?"
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,3533.588,3538.07,"--It does not eliminate the kind of people, Your Honor, because the Second Amendment is the right of the people."
2007.07-290,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3549.035,3561.232,"If you were thinking of the -- The People, what those words meant when the Second Amendment was adopted. It was males between the ages of, what, 17 and 45?"
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,3566.824,3579.758,"Well, certainly, there were many people who were not eligible for militia duty, or not subject to militia service, who nevertheless were expected to, and oftentimes did, in fact, have guns."
2007.07-290,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3579.758,3589.613,Which shows that maybe you're being unrealistic in thinking that the second clause is not broader than the first.
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,3621.16,3622.754,"Well, we do acknowledge that, Your Honor."
2007.07-290,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3622.754,3624.704,Then why have the first clause?
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,3626.922,3635.482,"Well, it was a way in which to remind us... the Framers certainly felt that a militia was very important to the preservation of liberty."
2007.07-290,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3646.572,3653.802,Could it also be simply to reaffirm that the provisions in the main text of the Constitution remain intact?
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,3653.802,3655.413,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2007.07-290,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3673.857,3681.527,But you were about to tell us before the course of the questioning began about the other purposes that the amendment served.
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,3702.503,3703.252,"--Oh, yes."
2007.07-290,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3719.887,3727.491,"That brings me back to the question because Blackstone describes it as a right to keep and bear arms ""under law""."
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,3783.547,3786.544,"--Well, certainly they saw--"
2007.07-290,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3786.544,3787.89,What's your response to the question?
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,3787.89,3793.666,"--Well, my response is that the government can ban arms that are not appropriate for civilian use."
2007.07-290,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3794.527,3796.777,That are not appropriate to--
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,3796.777,3798.696,That are not appropriate to civilian use.
2007.07-290,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3798.696,3800.103,For example?
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,3800.103,3812.083,"For example, I think machine guns: It's difficult to imagine a construction of Miller, or a construction of the lower court's opinion, that would sanction machine guns or the plastic, undetectable handguns that the Solicitor General spoke of."
2007.07-290,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3840.616,3843.677,But why wouldn't the machine gun qualify?
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,3847.989,3855.563,--But it's not an arm of the type that people might be expected to possess commonly in ordinary use.
2007.07-290,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3866.778,3868.028,Is there any parallel--
2007.07-290,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3868.028,3880.991,"At this time... I would just like to follow up on what you said, because if you were right that it was at that time, yes; but that's not what Miller says."
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,3900.641,3902.013,--That's correct.
2007.07-290,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3936.298,3940.045,--Is there any parallel at the time that the amendment was adopted to the machine gun?
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,3954.945,3962.646,"--At the time that... even at the time Miller was decided, the civilian arms were pretty much the sort that were used in the military."
2007.07-290,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3976.218,3988.808,"--It seems to me that Miller, as we're discussing it now, and the whole idea that the militia clause has a major effect in interpreting the operative clause is both overinclusive and underinclusive."
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4005.612,4013.141,"--Your Honor, even within the militia understanding, the understanding of the militia was always that people would bring whatever they had with them in civilian life."
2007.07-290,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4016.375,4022.216,My point is: Why is that of any real relevance to the situation that faces the homeowner today?
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4022.216,4030.525,--It's only of relevance if the Court wishes to continue reading the militia clause as informing the type of weapon which is protected.
2007.07-290,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,4030.525,4032.272,"Well, you're being faithful to Miller."
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4033.945,4045.285,"I agree with Your Honor, and certainly in our brief we suggest that the militia emphasis of Miller is not useful as a limiting principle to the type of arms that may be... that may be permitted."
2007.07-290,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4089.892,4094.108,"Why... now, when say ""keep"" and ""bear"", I mean you are... I think you're on to something here."
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4170.545,4174.854,The legislature has a great deal of leeway in regulating firearms.
2007.07-290,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4216.603,4218.756,Not self-defense being the harm.
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4276.266,4286.322,"--Well, back to Your Honor's first question, we don't agree that the military purpose is the exclusive purpose of the Second Amendment."
2007.07-290,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4297.382,4300.958,You don't even agree that Massachusetts was subject to the Second Amendment.
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4300.958,4303.862,"Well, originally it was not."
2007.07-290,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4306.659,4312.344,"But the time we're talking about, the firearms in the home ordinance, when was that?"
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4312.344,4314.189,--1783 I believe was the statute.
2007.07-290,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4314.189,4335.85,"How do you explain the fact that you include self-defense, but only two States, Pennsylvania and Vermont, did refer to self-defense as a permissible justification and all of the others referred to common defense or defense of the State, and in the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution itself there is no reference to self-defense?"
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4335.85,4341.863,"Your Honor, the State courts interpreting those provisions that you reference had a different interpretation."
2007.07-290,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4344.175,4345.001,1895.
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4349.061,4354.794,"--Well, at the time we haven't seen State court decisions from exactly that era."
2007.07-290,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4354.794,4360.573,"Just the text of the State constitutional provisions, two of them refer to self-defense."
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4364.71,4366.694,"On their literal text, yes."
2007.07-290,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4369.615,4374.942,I understand that judicial interpretation sometimes is controlling and sometimes is not.
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4380.64,4389.667,"--While it might not mention self-defense, it was clear that the demands that the States made at the ratifying conventions were for an individual right, and Madison was interested in--"
2007.07-290,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4389.667,4397.196,"Well, if you look at the individual rights I suppose you start back in 1689, the Declaration of Rights in England."
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4415.517,4418.562,"--It was in England, but that was criticized by the framers."
2007.07-290,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4420.593,4427.449,So you think that the Second Amendment is a departure from the provision in the Declaration of Rights in England?
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4427.449,4428.966,--It's quite clearly an expansion upon it.
2007.07-290,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4428.966,4434.886,So that's not really your... you would not confine the right the way the English did then.
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4434.886,4443.507,"I think the common law of England is a guide, and it's always a useful guide because that's where the... where we... where we look to, to interpret--"
2007.07-290,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4443.507,4448.19,"It's useful for such purposes as what ""keep and bear arms"" means and things of that sort."
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4448.19,4448.881,"--It certainly is, Your Honor."
2007.07-290,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4449.973,4459.889,"They certainly didn't want to preserve the kind of militia that America had, which was a militia separate from the state, separate from the government, which enabled the revolt against the British."
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4459.889,4460.798,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
2007.07-290,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4460.798,4487.583,"Is there any... is there any record evidence that the anti-Federalist objections to the Constitution that ultimately resulted in the Second Amendment were premised on any failure to recognize an individual right of self-defense or hunting or whatnot, as distinct from being premised on concern about the power of the national government and the militia clauses in Article 1?"
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4487.583,4489.346,"Yes, Justice Souter."
2007.07-290,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,4500.982,4502.92,"No, but they didn't... they didn't limit it to self-defense."
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4532.018,4534.595,"--Justice Souter, we wouldn't see the history that way."
2007.07-290,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4602.552,4614.952,"Why isn't the trigger-lock provisions that are at issue here, why aren't they similar to the various provisions that Justice Breyer mentioned like the gunpowder restriction?"
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4625.571,4631.772,"Well, it's not similar because the modern trigger-lock provisions are aimed squarely at self-defense in the home."
2007.07-290,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4635.274,4643.582,"Well, there is always a risk that the children will get up and grab the firearm and use it for some purpose other than what the Second Amendment was designed to protect."
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4643.582,4652.279,"--Oddly enough, a child can access a firearm stored consistently with the District's law, that is, a firearm which is disassembled and unloaded, nothing would prevent a child--"
2007.07-290,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4652.279,4652.938,"Well, right."
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4657.31,4659.216,"--That's true, Your Honor."
2007.07-290,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4707.212,4712.226,"You say that the right of self-defense was the heart of the Second Amendment, in your view."
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4718.817,4721.908,"Which provisions were those, Justice Stevens?"
2007.07-290,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4721.908,4722.596,Pennsylvania.
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4722.596,4725.484,"Well, Pennsylvania's provision was certainly influential."
2007.07-290,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,4747.119,4771.42,"Thinking of your exchange with the Chief Justice and think of the trigger lock in your view and what the question was, do you want... I don't know how well trigger locks work or not... but do you want thousands of judges all over the United States to be deciding that kind of question rather than the city councils and the legislatures that have decided it in the context of passing laws?"
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4780.822,4784.086,"When a fundamental right is at stake, there is a role for judicial review, Your Honor."
2007.07-290,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4788.754,4791.566,"If it's a fundamental right, what about licensing?"
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4816.744,4820.757,"Justice Ginsburg, that would depend on the licensing law itself."
2007.07-290,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4824.084,4825.491,What about this very law?
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4843.92,4853.072,"--So long as the licensing law is not enforced in an arbitrary and capricious manner, so long as there are some hopefully objective standards and hopefully some process for--"
2007.07-290,4,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,4853.072,4856.726,It just says... it says you have to get a license if you want to possess a gun.
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4859.99,4862.069,"--Well, the government could set reasonable standards for that, Your Honor."
2007.07-290,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4894.586,4900.974,What about... what about age limits... you've got to be over 18 or you've got to be over 21 to get a license?
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4900.974,4906.067,"--Well, certainly the age-of-majority issue is... is an appropriate one."
2007.07-290,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4911.55,4915.468,Is the age limit necessarily the same nationwide?
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4919.984,4924.543,--Courts would have to examine those at some point.
2007.07-290,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4941.864,4943.05,May I ask this question?
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4950.564,4957.42,--There is that inherent aspect to every right in the Constitution.
2007.07-290,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4957.42,4961.277,"So we can... consistent with your view, we can simply read this:"
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4963.323,4971.757,"Well, yes, Your Honor, to some extent, except the word ""unreasonable"" is the one that troubles us because we don't know what this unreasonable standard looks like."
2007.07-290,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,4971.757,4972.6,You wouldn't put it that way.
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4978.036,4979.756,"That's another way to look at it, Your Honor."
2007.07-290,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4980.286,4987.703,"--you would define ""reasonable"" in light of the restrictions that existed at the time the amendment was adopted."
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4987.703,4989.032,--Those restrictions--
2007.07-290,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,4989.032,4992.437,"You know, you can't take it into the marketplace was one restriction."
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,4998.669,5002.119,--Framing our practices would inform the kind of restrictions that would be accepted.
2007.07-290,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,5035.936,5040.963,Can we also look to current conditions like current crime statistics?
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,5040.963,5045.915,"To some extent, Your Honor, but we have certainly--"
2007.07-290,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,5045.915,5053.07,"Well, can they consider the extent of the murder rate in Washington, D.C., using handguns?"
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,5053.07,5059.598,"--If we were to consider the extent of the murder rate with handguns, the law would not survive any type of review, Your Honor."
2007.07-290,4,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5059.598,5063.033,All the more reason to allow a homeowner to have a handgun.
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,5063.033,5064.141,"Absolutely, Your Honor."
2007.07-290,4,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,5064.141,5066.032,Whose judgment is that to--
2007.07-290,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,5066.032,5070.844,"The question is whether they may consider those statistics, and I take it your answer is yes?"
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,5070.844,5078.074,"Well, those statistics might be considered in some way, the fact is that at some point there is a role for judicial review."
2007.07-290,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,5089.617,5094.116,But I think... I don't want you to misunderstand my question.
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,5108.997,5115.825,"--To some degree, yes, policymakers have to be informed by what's going on in order to make policy."
2007.07-290,4,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,5134.175,5135.299,They may be.
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,5160.463,5174.598,"--No, Your Honor, the fact is that we can always debate these things, but the object of the Bill of Rights is to remove certain judgments from the legislature, because we can make policy arguments, normative arguments about many provisions of the Constitution."
2007.07-290,4,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,5190.918,5205.397,"But Just to be clear... and I don't want to misstate your position, but my understanding, I at least inferred that you would consider it reasonable to ban shipment of machine guns and sawed-off shotguns in interstate commerce?"
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,5205.397,5206.255,"Yes, Your Honor."
2007.07-290,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5206.255,5212.253,And how about a State university wants to ban students having arms in the dormitory?
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,5212.253,5217.485,Certainly that creates some sort of an evidentiary record.
2007.07-290,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5219.064,5220.687,That's the bare fact.
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,5225.966,5228.244,--We would have to do--
2007.07-290,4,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,5228.244,5230.197,You'd have to think about that.
2007.07-290,4,16041,alan_gura,,5230.197,5230.68,--some fact finding.
2007.07-290,4,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5244.895,5245.425,"Thank you, Gura."
2007.07-290,5,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,5248.814,5269.134,"Mr. Chief Justice, I want to address first why this law is reasonable and should be sustained, and why the judgement below has to be reversed, however, whatever position you take on the theories of the amendment."
2007.07-290,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5279.709,5284.939,"Well, before you start with it, how many minutes does it take to remove a trigger lock and load a gun?"
2007.07-290,5,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,5289.533,5291.689,"Those are alternatives, Mr. Chief Justice."
2007.07-290,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5291.689,5292.75,"No, disassembled--"
2007.07-290,5,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,5292.75,5293.639,Just a trigger lock.
2007.07-290,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5293.639,5297.09,"--In either case it has to be unloaded, correct?"
2007.07-290,5,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,5297.09,5301.31,There are some versions of the trigger lock that allow you to put the trigger lock on and then load the gun.
2007.07-290,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5308.805,5312.802,"Well, the law, as I understand it, says that the gun has to be unloaded."
2007.07-290,5,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,5317.381,5320.207,"--You know, it's a question of where you put the parenthesis."
2007.07-290,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5329.219,5330.155,So how long does it take?
2007.07-290,5,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,5334.686,5347.571,"--You... you place a trigger lock on and it has... the version I have, a few... you can buy them at 17th Street Hardware... has a code, like a three-digit code."
2007.07-290,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5353.927,5362.58,"You turn on, you turn on the lamp next to your bed so you can... you can turn the knob at 3-22-95, and so somebody--"
2007.07-290,5,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,5362.58,5363.968,Well--
2007.07-290,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5363.968,5365.169,Is it like that?
2007.07-290,5,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,5366.687,5368.465,"--Yes, you can have one with a numerical code."
2007.07-290,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5368.465,5369.982,"So then you turn on the lamp, you pick up your reading glasses...--"
2007.07-290,5,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,5372.606,5373.854,Let me tell you.
2007.07-290,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5383.241,5386.207,"It may not matter, but I'd like some idea about how long it takes."
2007.07-290,5,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,5386.207,5387.599,--It took me 3 seconds.
2007.07-290,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5424.929,5430.63,"Well, if proportionate, in other words you're saying your interest is allowing self-defense in the home--"
2007.07-290,5,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,5430.63,5431.192,Yes.
2007.07-290,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5431.192,5436.44,"--Does it really make sense to say the best self-defense arm is a rifle, as opposed to a pistol?"
2007.07-290,5,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,5436.44,5449.605,It is... there has been no showing here that a rifle or a shotgun is inadequate for the purposes of self-defense in this facial challenge.
2007.07-290,5,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,5449.605,5454.882,Is there anything to show that the District Council ever considered the issue of self-defense?
2007.07-290,5,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,5478.59,5485.667,There are decisions in the District of Columbia about the right of self-defense that apply to this.
2007.07-290,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5553.094,5554.95,It's a related point.
2007.07-290,5,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,5561.649,5564.352,That only applies if it's... if it's unregistered.
2007.07-290,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5576.569,5579.521,Why is the... why is the D.C. law phrased in those terms?
2007.07-290,5,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,5584.127,5589.657,"Well, it's... it's... the carry provision, you cannot carry unregistered firearms."
2007.07-290,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5622.798,5627.516,Why isn't that covered by the provision that you have the right to keep arms?
2007.07-290,5,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,5627.516,5644.756,"--Well, the word ""keep"" would encompass... ""keep"" can encompass every use of an arm, and that's why it provides no limit at all, unless you read it in combination with ""keep and bear"" and that in combination with ""well-regulated militia""."
2007.07-290,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5644.756,5650.192,--You mean you can't have any more arms than you would need to take with you to the militia?
2007.07-290,5,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,5663.548,5664.032,Well--
2007.07-290,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5664.032,5664.859,--You can't do that?
2007.07-290,5,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,5667.389,5668.029,--Of course you could do that.
2007.07-290,5,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,5668.029,5669.012,--You can have to have a 12 gauge and that's it.
2007.07-290,5,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,5669.012,5673.868,"And like the District that allows that, as every State does."
2007.07-290,5,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,5674.557,5692.175,"I... at least to me the question is, what would be the constitutional basis for insisting on Justice Scalia's suggestion that you need a number of guns?"
2007.07-290,5,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,5702.544,5727.972,"--I do not know why that would pass the reasonableness scrutiny, but this law would because a powerful, overwhelming case could be made that you're eliminating the one type of weapon... this law is... is designed only for the weapon that is concealable and movable, that can be taken into schools and onto the Metro, can be easily stolen and transmitted among--"
2007.07-290,5,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,5727.972,5736.079,I'm asking about the constitutional standard you apply to a hypothetical statute which would prohibit the guns Justice Scalia described.
2007.07-290,5,44478,walter_e_dellinger_iii,,5739.858,5741.434,--You would apply this standard.
2007.07-290,5,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,5865.103,5866.195,"Thank you, Mr. Dellinger."
