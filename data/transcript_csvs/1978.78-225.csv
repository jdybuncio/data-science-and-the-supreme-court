1978.78-225,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,45.444,We'll hear arguments next in Babbitt against United Farm Workers.
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,48.835,52.846,Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.78-225,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,146.896,154.53,Beyond that didn't it hypothesize the number of probable likely situations?
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,154.53,158.815,"Yes and how the Act would be interpreted, given those situations."
1978.78-225,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,158.815,165.766,First hypothetical facts and then hypothetical or assumptions about what the Act meant?
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,165.766,176.949,"Precisely Mr. Chief Justice it was built on two hypothesize, one was factual and one was legal, neither of which we contend was within the preview of District Court."
1978.78-225,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,258.711,265.698,Mr. Lee we noticed how prompt your prior counsel were?
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,265.698,272.205,"Well, I know that Mr. Justice White and I realize no constitutional obligation, take all my time, I appreciate it."
1978.78-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,421.274,424.508,"Mr. Lee, can I just ask you about your problem here?"
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,445.247,447.177,"Well, let me answer it in two parts Mr. Justice Stevens."
1978.78-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,451.147,452.809,Right but rather important --
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,452.809,464.667,But even so I would feel much more comfortable if at least they had tried to hold an election and there had been some demonstration some facts on the record that in fact it takes too long to hold an election.
1978.78-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,469.206,476.528,"That goes to the merits of whether they are right or not, but for purposes of standing in case or controversy, don't we have to assume that there is merit to their argument?"
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,476.528,495.727,"Yes, we certainly do, but my point I think is nevertheless valid, that at the very least with regard to case or controversy as it applies to elections, that you have to at least have tried and at least to have shown that in fact there is some -- on the merits the election issue depends on delay."
1978.78-225,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,495.727,502.111,Mr. Lee what issue is it on the elections where we expect the difficulty in having?
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,505.988,536.354,"Of course not and the only -- in the final analysis we point out in brief the only thing that they are saying is that whereas before Arizona had no election, now it has an election process, but what they are really complaining about is it Arizona did not go far enough and provide enough protection for associational interests as perceived by the appellees and there is this case from the Eastern District of Virginia that says very clearly, that there is no obligation on any state to do that."
1978.78-225,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,536.354,541.415,Almost -- International Labor Relations that was constitutionally mandated if one would say that?
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,541.415,560.037,"Well, but you have problems even there, because the District Court and the appellees have both made the statement, this is their language that the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act dealing with elections and provisions of the AERA dealing with elections are virtually identical."
1978.78-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,560.037,569.017,"Isn't there a difference that the election procedure makes it unlawful to proceed without an election, in other words to have a bargaining representative voluntarily recognized?"
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,569.017,572.242,"No, I don't think it ever says that Mr. Justice Stevens."
1978.78-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,593.34,603.57,"Yes, the record doesn't tell us whether any, any attempt by a bargaining representative who had not been selected by means of an election was nullified because he wasn't elected?"
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,603.57,603.655,[Inaudible]
1978.78-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,603.655,606.652,I see so that it's hypothetical in that sense then?
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,606.652,609.599,This case is here far too soon.
1978.78-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,759.947,766.259,"I am still puzzled, I have been troubled in the past about procedure for reviewing elections under the National Labor Relations Act."
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,774.097,787.787,Well I think that at that point at least you would have established factually that there was a delay problem if there is a delay problem and I think at that point you can come into Federal court.
1978.78-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,810.479,816.538,"But you would say for standing purpose if they had requested an election and some how or other they didn't succeed with it, that would solve the problem?"
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,816.538,827.166,Well it would if in fact you could show that the factual premise on which your attack is being based was in fact correct.
1978.78-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,831.424,836.371,"You still saw a little bit like you say, you got to win on the merits to have a case or controversy or maybe you don't mean that?"
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,836.371,847.058,"This is another of those instances in which there is a very close relationship between the merits and case or controversy, but I do think that you need that, do more than just make the formal application."
1978.78-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1331.585,1334.449,"Mr. Lee, I have two questions that I'd like to ask you?"
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1343.607,1344.403,"Yes, there have."
1978.78-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1344.403,1344.918,There have been some?
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1344.918,1345.192,Yes.
1978.78-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1345.192,1347.836,But has been evoked and it's not possible to --
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1347.836,1348.959,That's right.
1978.78-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1348.959,1353.755,"And the second question I had, you've commented about the truthful publicity aspect of the statute."
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1370.88,1371.763,The Swing problem?
1978.78-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1371.763,1372.107,"Yeah, right."
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1372.107,1385.798,"Yeah, very simply this Mr. Justice Stevens, the Swing case as you know arose in your state and it was a beauty parlor, they lost the election and then they continue to picket around the Swing beauty parlor."
1978.78-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1419.831,1422.885,"Again it's strictly information of picketing that they're concerned about, isn't it?"
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1422.885,1442.705,"Yes, but I think, the clear message coming from (Inaudible), for example, which has no suggestion that that case was constitutionally based, is that insofar as secondary pressures if they are -- unless they go too far, that they will be upheld."
1978.78-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1462.962,1483.668,"On this aspect to the case, going back to your whole standing problem, you do have a First Amendment issue and the argument is that the statute in effect is overbroad here, and so wouldn't under classical overbreadth standing doctrine wouldn't the standing be okay in this case as to that particular portion of the statute and if not, why not?"
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1483.668,1490.944,"Well, I don't believe that this is a proper case for application of the overbreadth doctrine for these three reasons."
1978.78-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1507.257,1510.321,Typically in an overbreadth case you have a facial attack.
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1512.677,1527.58,"You do have a facial attack, but you at least in Broadrick, Broadrick and his companions at least had engaged in the permissible scope of the activity that is, or excuse me, the prohibitable part of the activity that is campaigning for their bosses."
1978.78-225,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1528.752,1532.436,"Well isn't this, for that reason closer to California Bankers Association against Schultz?"
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1532.436,1532.928,Sure.
1978.78-225,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1532.928,1539.445,Where we refused to pass on the ACLU's claim because we said wait till something happens to you even though you claim First Amendment violation?
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1539.445,1554.543,"Of course and for that matter, for that matter it's like Friedman versus Rogers which came out this morning and indeed in the Broadrick case itself Mr. Justice White cited from the Wurzbach, the Wurzbach case."
1978.78-225,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1554.543,1556.472,That was the court --
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1556.472,1557.938,Excuse me --
1978.78-225,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1573.568,1575.813,Do you think this is commercial speech?
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1575.813,1579.246,I thought about that this morning as I read Friedman versus Rogers.
1978.78-225,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1587.474,1589.091,"It's about wages, isn't it?"
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1589.091,1597.045,"It's about wages, it's about economic issues and it's about, it's about who pays whom, how much --"
1978.78-225,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1597.045,1620.594,"You don't really think, do you think to make a -- suppose I went to court and say, here's a law that says I may not speak in the following manner and I assert that I desire to speak in that manner and I think therefore I'm being restrained, and I don't want to commit a crime, I want you do adjudicate, don't you think there's a case or controversy or not?"
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1620.594,1628.113,At that point you have to apply the court's opinion in Broadrick versus Oklahoma and that depends on several things.
1978.78-225,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1653.316,1655.349,So I'm talking about case or controversy now.
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1655.349,1656.671,I understand.
1978.78-225,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1656.671,1674.817,"Isn't that enough as I think it was implicit in Justice Stevens' questions, if it forbids you from speaking and you make the good faith of assertion that I want to speak this way and I can't unless I -- do I have to violate the statute in order to make a --?"
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1674.817,1677.354,It would be easier to answer that question I submit Mr. Justice White --
1978.78-225,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1677.354,1687.452,"All the defendant have to say, all the Attorney General of the state have to say, well I never attempted to apply it to him, they only have to say to avoid the case --"
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1687.452,1694.587,You go back and you pickup Coates versus Cincinnati and Broadrick versus Oklahoma and that is an issue that has bedeviled this Court.
1978.78-225,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1698.96,1708.227,"Well, I know but you then – but then you say that you're hanging most of your case around case or controversy, isn't it?"
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1708.227,1712.64,"Pretty good argument, but it is not most of the case."
1978.78-225,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1712.64,1719.085,"And then you might be hanging maybe your case around some of the other provisions, but on this provision --"
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1719.085,1719.607,Yes.
1978.78-225,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1719.607,1725.334,"On this provision, was there an attack on the -- in the complaint on the statute?"
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1725.334,1725.93,Oh yes.
1978.78-225,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1725.93,1727.155,On this particular provision?
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1727.155,1727.856,"Oh yes, with --"
1978.78-225,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1727.856,1731.782,"And if they wanted to speak in this way, is the statute preventive?"
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1731.782,1739.91,"That they -- well, that I don't know that they actually allege [Voice Overlap] untruthful publicity but --"
1978.78-225,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1739.91,1742.164,They had hardly claim that they wanted to speak falsely on --
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1742.164,1745.575,"Well, I don't think they would have alleged it, they would have alleged it."
1978.78-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1745.575,1748.554,"This part of the statute is limited on truthful, is it?"
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1748.554,1750.81,"Excuse me, untruthful --"
1978.78-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1750.81,1756.108,This prohibits is even truthful statements about this trade name that has people involved--
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1756.108,1757.394,"That is correct, that is correct."
1978.78-225,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1757.394,1759.391,"So I'm just talking about untruthful dispute here, it's important too --"
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1759.391,1764.639,"That is correct, that is the second part and it does."
1978.78-225,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1773.775,1778.044,"Even if there's a case or controversy about this particular issue, it doesn't mean that there's about any other one in the case?"
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1778.044,1785.084,"Of course, of course and that's the big problem is that they've attempted to apply it all across the entire breadth of the statute."
1978.78-225,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1785.084,1786.322,You have [Inaudible]
1978.78-225,0,39761,rex_e_lee,,1786.322,1786.83,Thank you.
1978.78-225,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1786.83,1792.255,We didn't.
1978.78-225,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1792.255,1793.546,Mr. Cohen.
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,1793.546,1796.952,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1919.639,1921.472,Mr. Cohen what happened in those three cases?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,1921.472,1923.904,In those three cases we were picketing.
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1936.413,1937.92,What happened after they got the order?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,1937.92,1941.065,The order was then dismissed for lack of service.
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1948.214,1950.624,"-- go ahead, I am sorry I didn't want to interrupt you."
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,1950.624,1958.112,"Okay and they got another order, that's on page 88 of the Enforcement Stipulation, which restricted picketing, that order was gotten without notice."
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1958.112,1959.814,And then what happened to that order?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,1959.814,1963.317,"After that order was dismissed, the case was dismissed on the grounds--"
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1963.317,1966.683,Has there ever been an order that prevented you from picketing?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,1966.683,1968.335,Has there been an order that prevented us from picketing?
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1968.335,1968.969,Yeah.
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,1968.969,1970.699,"Of temporary length, yes."
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1970.699,1972.611,How long?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,1972.611,1980.933,"Five days, four days, I don't think the length matters because in Carroll, the Court said that it's not the duration of the order that counts."
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1992.036,2004.076,"If you have a history of another three, say you get 20 more, whether you've got a TRO without notice, and you get them all dismissed as soon as you get into courts as fast as you can get counsel there, do they really have an actual inhibiting affect on your client?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2004.076,2004.702,"Yes, they do."
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2004.702,2006.507,They know they are going to win all these lawsuits?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2006.507,2008.01,The order is issued.
1978.78-225,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2020.498,2022.356,"Carroll was a parade, wasn't it?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2022.356,2024.943,"No, Justice Rehnquist, Carroll was a rally."
1978.78-225,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2024.943,2026.06,A rally.
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2026.06,2035.078,And Justice Fortas said that the facts of a public demonstration are the kinds of facts for which an adversary hearing is needed.
1978.78-225,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2035.078,2039.774,"Well, isn't -- hasn't this Court said that picketing is a good deal more than free speech?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2043.7,2060.882,"Yes Justice Rehnquist, but I'd like to point out that the state board got an order which you'll find as appendix D to the brief, which prevents us from inducing or encouraging the employee or the manager of a retail store from removing a product."
1978.78-225,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2092.105,2094.782,Is that in the Enforcement Stipulation that you have been referring to?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2094.782,2101.165,"No, but this facial attack and I think it clearly falls within the shadow which (b) (7) cast over the First Amendment."
1978.78-225,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2156.393,2161.639,"Well, but the boards are – it was a reviewable on Superior Court and Judge Hardy gave you some relief, did he not?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2161.639,2179.933,"Yes, but two years later despite that relief, if you'll notice on Section -- it's on page 85 Section 11, the board, despite what Judge Hardy did, went in to try and get another order based on Section (b)(7) again, despite the fact that a Superior Court said it was unconstitutional two years before."
1978.78-225,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2340.355,2345.381,"Well it's a classically overbroad statutory provision, one of many statutory provisions, isn't it?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2345.381,2354.915,"Yes, it is, just as (b) (7) I submit is classically overbroad as well; (b)(7) by prohibiting all encouragement."
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2382.063,2390.925,"Once you've got a case or controversy with respect to that issue in terms of your own activity, you don't need to worry about overbreadths, do you?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2390.925,2392.246,No we don't as a mater of fact--
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2392.246,2394.671,I mean if it really been applied to you and you want to --
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2394.671,2395.97,"It's been applied to us, that's right."
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2395.97,2404.401,"And if you or if hasn't been applied to you if you nevertheless have a case or controversy about it in terms of your own interest you don't need to talk about anybody else's, do you?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2404.401,2411.218,"Well, I think that as to the clarity of the statute, yes there maybe some other sections in which --"
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2411.218,2412.912,"No, I mean talking just about the speech section."
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2412.912,2415.839,"No, that's true; I think we have a case or controversy that has been enforced."
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2415.839,2420.954,"I don't think you wouldn't suggest overbreadth analysis applies to the non-speech sections, would you?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2420.954,2448.246,"Well, I would suggest that insofar as they reflect -- they relate to First Amendment rights whether they have to talk about -- whether we are talking about speech in relationship to a manager of a store or speech in terms of an ultimate consumer for instance the access provision, there are findings of fact on the record which the state does not like, but they do not, they should not be allowed to come here and dispute what the trial court, what the three judges found."
1978.78-225,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2483.864,2489.315,"Arizona doesn't have to require a grower to -- give any time, does it?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2494.621,2507.249,"I think what, I think Justice Rehnquist the problem that we have with the statute is that there have been other ways of organizing workers that were available to farm workers before the statute."
1978.78-225,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2579.692,2584.518,But all the statute does is say that the grower has to give certain access?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2584.518,2597.466,"No, the statute says that the grower is not required to provide any time, any information, any materials or any facilities to allow the union to communicate."
1978.78-225,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2602.178,2605.725,It imposes on the grower some obligation to give--
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2605.725,2605.853,No.
1978.78-225,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2605.853,2607.414,It powers the board to impose [Voice Overlap] doesn't it?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2607.414,2610.627,No it does not Justice Rehnquist.
1978.78-225,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2631.511,2635.128,"What do you think it means by facilities, what do you read under facilities?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2635.128,2644.314,"I think in the context of this language as I think it's very well argued in the amicus brief, it can only mean a place at which we could talk to the workers."
1978.78-225,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2650.234,2653.91,"No, you just still haven't defined facilities, a building, a room?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2653.91,2658.345,"I think it's a place, I think it means a place to communicate with the workers in this context."
1978.78-225,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2658.345,2659.241,A building?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2659.241,2661.954,"Yes, labor camp would be a facility."
1978.78-225,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2661.954,2664.015,What if they don't have a building?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2664.015,2666.689,They are not required to provide us with anything.
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2685.432,2688.279,"Mr. Cohen, I'm just following up on Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question."
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2694.514,2708.661,"I think in that case you would be able to engage, there would be a general trespass law that would apply, you would be able to engage in a general case-by-case analysis as to whether there was no -- whether there was or was not alternate means of communicating with the workers."
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2710.909,2716.117,"Suppose there wasn't, suppose there wasn't what would be the source of any obligations, say I am employer and I don't want you on my property."
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2716.117,2716.528,I think this --
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2716.528,2717.271,How could you make the election on your property?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2717.271,2723.329,"I think the source would be the vitality of Marsh versus Alabama and I think that, I think that Marsh versus --"
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2723.329,2727.234,"Are there findings that all employers or these are all company towns, is there findings --"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2727.234,2728.403,"No there is just, no there isn't."
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2734.123,2737.89,"And you'd say that each employer therefore is like a state, so every part --"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2737.89,2749.203,"No, no I am saying that we would then be allowed in those situations in which the labor camp was enough like the company town in Marsh versus Alabama, we'd be allowed to access in those situations."
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2766.125,2769.057,Well this statute just says the board shall not order you -- order access.
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2769.057,2771.552,The board may not require the enclosure therefore it's up to the employer.
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2771.552,2775.728,"Case by case analysis under Marsh against Alabama wouldn't be before the board, would it?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2775.728,2779.97,No but I mean the board is precluded for making such an analysis under this language.
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2779.97,2781.343,Whatever it is but anyway --
1978.78-225,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2781.343,2784.901,"It's precluded by the First Amendment, if you're right?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2784.901,2788.24,"No I wouldn't -- why would that necessarily follow, I would think that the board--"
1978.78-225,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2788.24,2796.021,"You say if there was no law, then you rely on the first amendment and in order to rely on that Amendment you have to show that --"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2796.021,2796.906,That we would have access to --
1978.78-225,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2796.906,2799.687,-- municipality or a state or a government.
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2799.687,2804.426,Well I don't know if it wouldn't -- I think we'd have to show the need to communicate to those workers.
1978.78-225,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2804.426,2810.583,"No, no, no because if -- so long as the employer is a private person the First Amendment isn't implicated at all."
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2810.583,2824.748,"Yes, but when you take a private decision to refuse to give a labor union information, time, materials or facilities and then the state decides to sanction that decision, I think then you may have the necessary state action to an analysis just like Reitman versus Mulkey."
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2824.748,2834.062,"On that basis, you convert every private property owner in the state action as soon as he stands at the – at his gate with a gun and keeps you off the property --"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2834.062,2834.643,Well --
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2834.643,2838.421,-- and he calls the Sheriff and has you put off?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2838.421,2851.454,Mr. Justice White time and again in the statute the employer is left free to communicate with those workers or communicate with that chain store owner and I think the Doctrine of Mosley case I think might apply here.
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2870.387,2871.997,"No, that's different."
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2876.671,2883.593,"Yes, well I am just pointing out that what they've said in the case is they have said that they think –"
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2883.593,2899.431,"You are not suggesting that because there might be a question about the prohibition against talking to merchants that the property provisions are bad or that the election provisions are bad, or that the Compulsory Arbitration Provisions are bad?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2899.431,2906.927,Well the Compulsory Arbitration Provision of 1393(b) I don't think is bad for the reasons the district court found it to be bad.
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2923.626,2926.87,You mean every strike that's restrained violates the First Amendment?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2926.87,2939.795,"No, I didn't say that, I say that to allow the restraining of a strike or boycott without giving us an opportunity, I am talking about Section 3093(b), without giving us an opportunity to have notice and be there, that is a prior restrain."
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2950.428,2954.362,Every ex parte injunction against a strike violates the First Amendment?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,2954.362,2962.673,I think an ex parte injunction without notice against picketing does violate the First Amendment because it's the burden.
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3013.765,3014.394,Mr. Cohen?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3014.394,3014.588,Yes.
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3014.588,3018.651,"I don't want interrupt your chain of thought but I do want to ask the two questions about the election procedures if I may, is that —"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3018.651,3020.1,Yes.
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3020.1,3025.09,"Well, first of all you said that the election was exclusive means of obtaining recognition, is that –"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3025.09,3026.337,Yes.
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3026.337,3036.149,"The District Court's opinion at (A) 26 of the jurisdiction statement points out that before an election could be held, the union must first demand and be denied recognition by the employer."
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3044.906,3061.385,"But Mr. Justice Stevens, I'm referring to the unfair labor practice section (A) 5 that nothing in this article shall be construed as requiring an agricultural employer to bargain collectively until a representative of his agriculture employees has been determined by means of a valid secret ballot election."
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3086.267,3087.619,What about a strike?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3087.619,3095.802,"No, a strike can be enjoined if you'd take a look at section 1385 (b) 12, it's another one of those sections –"
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3095.802,3099.218,"Recognitions, recognizing the strike would be unlawful under the statute?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3099.218,3099.856,Yes.
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3115.198,3120.066,"How about the strike itself, the picketing would be illegal, but would the strike itself be illegal?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3120.066,3123.206,The strike itself could not be used to gain recognition.
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3137.054,3141.175,"He stops the picketing, but does he stop the strike, do necessarily you say, half the people won't go to work."
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3141.175,3143.036,"Well, that's not clear Mr. Justice Stevens."
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3143.036,3143.659,That is not --
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3143.659,3145.491,I don't think that's clear.
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3145.491,3150.035,"And one other question on election if I may, do you agree that there have been somewhat successful elections?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3150.035,3152.463,"No, there is no -- there's been one election."
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3179.593,3182.254,But do you agree the record shows that there is at least one successful election?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3182.254,3191.111,"Yes, it does, but as Mr. Lee says in his brief, he says that in about 22% of the cases in the Citrus, the election might be -- procedure might be workable."
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3217.662,3250.496,"Well, do you think if the state, if there is a state statutory provision regulating labor management relations and one of the provisions is by the way we don't believe too much in collective bargaining and the employer need not recognize any collective bargaining representative although unions are certainly legal and they can go about their business all they want to, of trying to force the employer into recognizing, but as far as the law is concerned the employers are under no obligation to recognize any collective bargaining representative, would that be unconstitutional?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3250.496,3257.843,"No, I think what amounts to an unconstitutional restraint on us in this case is that we --"
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3257.843,3259.073,How about my example?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3259.073,3260.074,I don't think it would.
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3265.525,3272.805,"Yeah, well they -- certainly the state is nicer to you in this case than in the one I have?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3272.805,3276.474,"No, Mr. Justice White our point is that they are not because what have they done to us?"
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3359.776,3362.356,You don't suggest that's unconstitutional by itself?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3362.356,3366.915,I'm saying that all these things taken together amount to what I think is the test.
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3379.124,3384.318,You don't claim any constitutional right to have a collective bargaining representative that the employer will recognize?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3384.318,3385.177,What we claim is --
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3385.177,3388.273,Or I take you just a while ago said you didn't have any such thing?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3388.273,3406.699,"I think what we have is that right which in the railroad case in 1927, I believe in Jones & Laughlin, I think farmers could still have that right, we are still back in that junk, and well I think we have the right to associate together to try to improve our wages, hours, and working conditions."
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3495.508,3497.117,Is this in the stipulation?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3497.117,3511.46,"In the overbreadth, I'm saying what happens when someone looks at a statute that says I can't induce or encourage manager to ask him to take a good off that has been directly used against us, but we've lost boycott support for that and there is testimony to that effect."
1978.78-225,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3511.46,3527.259,"Mr. Cohen what about the fact if I understood Mr. Lee correctly, the one-third of the unfair labor practice proceedings have been against employers for discriminating against employees engaging in union conduct, that can't be harmful to you, can it?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3527.259,3529.516,"No, we are not saying that's harmful to us."
1978.78-225,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3677.467,3682.593,Well do you contend that every one of the provisions of this Act is unconstitutional?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3682.593,3683.318,No.
1978.78-225,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3683.318,3689.163,Well then how do you justify the District Court's order enforcing enjoining its enforcement in its entirety?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3689.163,3692.377,"Well, I think it hinges--"
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3692.377,3694.375,[Voice Overlap] proceed against an employer?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3694.375,3701.642,I think it hinges on whether or not it's separable or not and I think that the intent of the legislature should be examined.
1978.78-225,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3702.681,3707.593,Do you think that Federal Court is the best place to examine that as opposed to a State Court?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3707.593,3710.046,"I think when it's clear on its face, yes."
1978.78-225,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3727.173,3731.381,"Well, the grower interveners -- grower interveners aren't the Arizona legislature?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3731.381,3740.344,"No, but the Arizona legislature did not put a severability clause and even though the National Labor Relations Act has one and I think that does say something about their intent."
1978.78-225,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3743.799,3748.948,Isn't there in Section 1 of the Arizona revised statute a general severability provision?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3748.948,3754.497,But I think that that general severability provision would not apply to a more specific statute.
1978.78-225,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3756.726,3767.534,Why would you have a general severability provision that says any statute enacted in the future by this legislature will be considered severable?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3775.452,3777.706,Mr. Justice Rehnquist that's a very good question.
1978.78-225,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3777.706,3778.387,I think it is too.
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3778.387,3782.151,"I have an answer to it, right and my answer is this."
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3794.859,3797.305,"I didn't mean it, you have an answer there, why did they need one?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3797.305,3799.884,I think they did need it to make their intent clear --
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3799.884,3801.434,"I know you do, but you haven't told us why."
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3801.434,3814.556,"When you, if you Mr. Justice White if you read this statute and look at for instance their inhibitions on boycott, they say in their declaration of policy that it is a state policy and there is a need to inhibit a boycott."
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3864.406,3869.756,"So what if the, so what if the court had found only one, only the compulsory arbitration provisions of the Constitution?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3869.756,3871.868,"[Attempt to Laughter] Well, I think --"
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3871.868,3875.399,Then are they not severable or severable?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3875.399,3876.295,In and of itself?
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3876.295,3877.149,Yes.
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3877.149,3878.482,"May be not severable, but together with --"
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3878.482,3882.152,"Where do you get that, out of the Section 1?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3882.152,3886.101,"No, I am assuming that you are correct in your analysis."
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3886.101,3891.467,"Well, I just assume one section declared unconstitutional, then would the entire statute fall?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3891.467,3892.816,It would depend on the sections.
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3892.816,3894.829,I said compulsory arbitration?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3894.829,3896.918,"Well, I would rather categorize it --"
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3896.918,3899.854,"I know you would, but how about compulsory arbitration?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3899.854,3901.012,No I don't think it would.
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3901.012,3902.243,"Well, why not?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3902.243,3903.617,"Well, I am --"
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3903.617,3906.473,Wouldn't you have to go to the section one that --
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3906.473,3911.388,Mr. Justice White I am assuming that what Justice Rehnquist says is correct.
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3928.225,3936.764,"It's your position that all of the unfair labor practice sections are now -- should have fallen with these five sections, all of the unfair labor practice sections?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3936.764,3938.125,I think the whole statute--
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3938.125,3941.884,"Against the unions, against employers, against everybody?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3941.884,3943.535,That's I think in the past.
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3943.535,3945.371,No more elections.
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3945.371,3948.226,The election procedure was found unconstitutional.
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3948.226,3948.51,No more anything --
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3948.51,3955.971,"As impressed upon agriculture, at the heart of the statute yes if the election procedure falls, I think the district court is right, the rest of it must fall."
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3965.328,3970.02,"-- Labor Relations Act started out, it was just unfair labor practices against employers."
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3970.02,3970.826,Yes.
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3970.826,3980.557,"Well what do you mean if you struck down the unfair labor practices against unions, why would you strike down the ones against employers?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3980.557,3984.346,You are assuming the presence or absence of the election procedure in that question?
1978.78-225,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3984.346,3985.801,Either way.
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,3985.801,3989.291,"I think without an election procedure, you have no statute."
1978.78-225,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3989.291,4002.654,"Well the district court seemed to have some sort of a general remand in -- not literally but pretty close to it, to the legislature to try again come up with a more balanced statute though."
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,4020.495,4023.772,Well they could Mr. Chief Justice.
1978.78-225,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4027.435,4039.416,"I am just asking one question, can the legislature say these judges have confused this issue so much that we'll just wipe the slate clean, we'll repeal the entire statute and we aren't going to enact any new statute?"
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,4039.416,4043.246,"Yes they could do that, yes they could."
1978.78-225,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4043.246,4044.661,Is that what you want?
1978.78-225,1,29531,jerome_cohen,,4044.661,4054.487,"[Attempt to Laughter] It's, we're not see it's not – we are not saying that the California Act is constitutionally mandated or that the National Labor Relations Act is constitutionally mandated."
1978.78-225,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4134.581,4137.154,Do you have anything further Mr. Lee.
1978.78-225,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4137.154,4144.25,"Yes, I do if Chief Justice would like to go ahead at this time."
1978.78-225,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4145.095,4150.738,"As we like let both of you get back to Utah and Arizona, the climate is much better there?"
1978.78-225,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4150.738,4154.56,Well I appreciate that courtesy Mr. Chief Justice.
1978.78-225,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4467.262,4472.6,And by doing what?
1978.78-225,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4472.6,4482.163,"By permitting in the B8 context Mr. Justice White, an opportunity well in all other contexts for the Arizona courts to say what their statute means."
1978.78-225,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4489.12,4491.512,Now you're talking about may be a (Inaudible) abstention?
1978.78-225,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4491.512,4492.862,That's exactly what I'm talking.
1978.78-225,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4492.862,4494.168,Saving the federal question?
1978.78-225,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4494.168,4495.543,That is exactly what I'm talking about.
1978.78-225,2,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,4495.543,4497.522,You have a certification procedure in Arizona?
1978.78-225,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4497.522,4499.14,"There is not, Mr. Justice."
1978.78-225,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4499.14,4499.795,Not?
1978.78-225,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4499.795,4502.301,There is not.
1978.78-225,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4503.055,4515.137,"Mr. Lee what happens if there are say 10 or 20 of these cases where the employer runs in and gets a TRO from a County judge or some place, and then after they educate him on the law they get it vacated, and there is never any appeal to the Supreme Court."
1978.78-225,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4522.031,4529.54,"Well, if that is a defect, Mr. Stevens, it is a defect in Rule 65 of the federal rules because that is exactly what Rule 65 permits."
1978.78-225,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4529.54,4537.028,"Well, the Rule 65 isn't specifically directed at First Amendment protected activity as a statute or at least arguably protected?"
1978.78-225,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4537.028,4547.466,"Well, but Carroll said that you have to get, you have to give actual notice except when there is some kind of compelling reasons that you can't."
1978.78-225,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4582.926,4591.442,The problem as I understand the burden of Mr. Justice White's question is how does the Supreme Court of the state really get to construe the statue in this?
1978.78-225,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4596.279,4617.331,"I would think that in a case in which I go into court, I get a TRO against Mr. Cohen, and then he immediately goes before the Arizona Supreme Court on a special writ, which that statute provides and attempts to dissolve it because I've violated his constitutional rights."
1978.78-225,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4622.982,4632.537,"Of course, if you are right about case or controversy, why, you probably couldn't get in a state courts either."
1978.78-225,2,39761,rex_e_lee,,4636.95,4642.81,"Yes and I vigorously urge you not to do that, Mr. Justice White and on that happy note, I will conclude my argument."
1978.78-225,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4642.81,4643.664,Thank you gentlemen.
