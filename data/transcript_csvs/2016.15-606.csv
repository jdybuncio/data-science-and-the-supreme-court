2016.15-606,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,7.475,"We'll hear argument next in Case 15-606, Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado. Mr. Fisher."
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,7.475,30.88,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Roughly half the trials in this country from New York to California to South Carolina are already conducted under the rule we seek today: Mainly, a requirement that judges consider evidence of racial bias when it's offered to prove a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury. This Court should require Colorado to follow the same rule."
2016.15-606,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,50.96,57.42,"What about religious bias? Same thing in this case, except it's not, you know, this is how Mexicans act."
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,64.105,68.83,"Well, there's obviously, Mr. Chief Justice, frequently an overlap between race and religion."
2016.15-606,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,71.92,72.18,All right.
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,77.765,81.31,All the Court needs to decide in this case today is race.
2016.15-606,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,81.48,83.11,"No, I don't think that's fair."
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,107.63,120.39,"I don't deny that there may be subsequent cases if you decide this one in my favor. But I'm saying two things to the Court. First of all, you can and should do what the Court's done in previous situations like this, which is start with race."
2016.15-606,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,131.63,141.5,"Suppose we start with race. You're not being very helpful to the Court in your answers. Suppose we start with race, and the next case involves religion."
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,149.065,161.85,"What you would do in that case, Justice Alito, is conduct the same analysis you're being asked to conduct here, which is look at the Tanner factors and ask how effective other safeguards are at rooting out --"
2016.15-606,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,161.85,162.995,"Mr. Fisher, why?"
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,162.995,163.885,Pardon me?
2016.15-606,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,163.885,164.645,Why?
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,164.645,165.86,Why would you ask that --
2016.15-606,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,165.86,175.695,"Why? I mean, you know, the Chief says this is not an equal protection case, but the Sixth Amendment applies to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment; correct?"
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,175.695,176.23,Yes.
2016.15-606,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,176.23,183.0,I always thought the most pernicious and odious discrimination in our law is based on race.
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,183.0,184.29,I agree with that.
2016.15-606,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,184.29,185.0,All right.
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,208.215,212.785,"I'm not denying that you can. And of course, the Constitution needs to be read structurally."
2016.15-606,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,213.48,224.65,"You think it's odious to have the same sort of discrimination against someone because he's a Muslim or practices Islamic faith? You're saying, he's a Muslim."
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,232.7,234.405,"It may well be, Your Honor."
2016.15-606,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,236.85,251.3,"What about sexual orientation? Somebody gives, you know, a bigoted speech in the jury room about sexual orientation and how particular types of people are more likely to commit crimes like the one before them? Is that sufficiently odious?"
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,251.3,252.52,It's quite odious.
2016.15-606,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,257.0,259.395,You have to have an answer for this reason.
2016.15-606,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,328.69,331.3,"And so that's why I, too, would like an answer."
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,331.3,347.53,"So I think you've asked a more specific question about objecting, and then the more general question that we've been talking about, about drawing lines. So for objecting, let me just say, it's impossible for the defendant to object to the misconduct in this case because the defendant is not in the jury room to hear it."
2016.15-606,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,351.67,354.79,"Mr. -- please, please concentrate on the question Justice Breyer --"
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,354.79,355.2,I'm sorry.
2016.15-606,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,355.38,360.965,"-- has asked you, which is answer his question, he's talking about the general principle."
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,382.865,402.72,"I think there's two reasons why. One is you can look at the Court's cases that I've described already, things like Rose v. Mitchell, Ham v. South Carolina, where we have race-specific rules that have never been extended beyond race. And the second reason is because, I know this isn't, strictly speaking, an equal protection case, but the same values of the Fourteenth Amendment infuse the Sixth Amendment."
2016.15-606,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,405.98,417.355,"Why isn't this national origin? I mean, you -- you're trying to isolate race. But this was a case of a Mexican American."
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,421.97,427.58,"Well, I think the Court's case law has fused the two concepts, particularly when it comes to people with Hispanic origin."
2016.15-606,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,437.7,442.36,"Well, is it true with respect to other ethnic groups, or only true with respect to Hispanics?"
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,442.36,454.24,"Oh, it's most true with respect to Hispanics in this Court's cases, which is why we've used the term ""race,"" and every other party in court in the case has used the term ""race."" And I think the tiers of scrutiny provide a helpful analogy."
2016.15-606,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,454.24,460.455,"Can you -- you keep on being cut off before you get to the tiers of scrutiny, but -- (Laughter.)"
2016.15-606,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,460.455,474.745,"-- the cases where the court has said that a lawyer has to be allowed to ask on voir dire about bias, does that -- is that only true of racial bias, or is that true of any other kind of bias as well?"
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,474.745,477.14,"Under this Court's cases, only race."
2016.15-606,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,484.07,484.54,I think it's --
2016.15-606,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,484.54,486.645,And then gender.
2016.15-606,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,486.645,488.15,I'm sorry.
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,489.175,489.52,I'm sorry?
2016.15-606,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,489.52,490.72,It's just race you're saying?
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,490.72,491.315,I believe so.
2016.15-606,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,491.315,495.755,It's just race. And then Batson would be race and gender; is that right.
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,495.755,496.42,That's right.
2016.15-606,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,522.82,523.37,"Well, suppose --"
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,523.37,524.21,Things like --
2016.15-606,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,524.21,539.59,"Is it so different? Suppose somebody in the jury room, say it's an automobile accident, says, what do you expect of women drivers? Women shouldn't be allowed to drive cars. Every woman I know is a terrible driver."
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,543.05,550.33,"Well, you would ask the same questions we're asking today, but you'd ask it through a different record and a different set of balancing."
2016.15-606,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,586.95,604.805,"Isn't it a fact that in the decisions of this Court, those tiers are not what they once were; that is, strict scrutiny is no longer fatal in fact, and for gender discrimination you must have an exceedingly persuasive justification for it?"
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,604.805,606.75,"Of course, Justice Ginsburg; that's correct."
2016.15-606,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,615.04,615.23,No.
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,661.28,670.3,"I think it's a very important question that goes to the heart of the case, because I think you could have also used the hypotheticals from cases like McDonald v. Pless and Tanner and Warger."
2016.15-606,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,697.93,699.68,What did the -- what did the 20 States do?
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,699.68,700.415,Pardon me?
2016.15-606,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,700.415,701.89,What did the 20 States do?
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,701.89,705.59,The 20 -- it's actually 18 States and two Federal jurisdictions.
2016.15-606,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,741.54,745.04,Race is -- race is different for some purposes.
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,773.909,780.505,"I think I can give you the same answer I gave to the Chief Justice earlier, which is that is woefully unfair."
2016.15-606,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,790.04,790.4,How does that --
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,790.4,791.47,As bad as --
2016.15-606,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,791.47,797.82,How does that connect with the right to an impartial jury? A jury can be partial for racial reasons.
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,798.2,798.31,Right.
2016.15-606,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,798.31,801.075,-- partial for some other reason.
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,801.075,805.93,Because the values of the Fourteenth Amendment are read into the Sixth Amendment as well.
2016.15-606,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,832.01,843.76,"Has -- has there been any case, other than Bolling v. Sharpe? In Bolling v. Sharpe, the conspicuous absence was any equal protection principle operative v. the Federal government."
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,850.765,850.91,No.
2016.15-606,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,869.975,884.75,"Do you think the entire body of law that we have developed in connection with racial discrimination or the Equal Protection Clause is the issue and apply that to your case? For example, here, you have a very obviously offensive and direct appeal to -- to race."
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,903.27,925.49,"Well, I think the analysis would be similar to what you do under the Equal Protection Clause, but it wouldn't have to be lockstep. So the question that's asked in the 20 jurisdictions that already do this is, would a reasonable juror have understood the comments to be about race? Would the -- would the jurors have understood the juror who spoke to be asking them to decide the case or view the evidence based on racial bias? And remember, too, Mr. Chief Justice --"
2016.15-606,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,925.49,928.07,The second is very different from the first.
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,930.86,941.28,"I'm sorry if I miss -- if I confused the Court, but the key, when you're talking about people such as from that neighborhood or whether or not it would be understood as race-based comments as opposed to something else. So a similar question --"
2016.15-606,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,941.28,950.76,"I like the second better because what -- otherwise, you're going to have an evidentiary hearing in every allegation, and 20 jurisdictions don't, right?"
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,950.76,951.265,Right.
2016.15-606,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,951.265,956.69,"There has to be a test that tells you when, what's the difference between a stray remark --"
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,956.69,957.365,Right.
2016.15-606,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,957.365,959.845,-- and something that has impact.
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,959.845,960.19,Right.
2016.15-606,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,995.78,998.805,I don't see the problem there.
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1055.63,1057.31,"For what exactly, Justice Breyer?"
2016.15-606,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1057.31,1079.93,"That what we're doing here in creating the exception, despite the fact that we can think of Justice Alito's case which is just as unfair, though it doesn't involve race, is we're trying to create a fairer system in general and one that will be perceived as such, and there race is a special problem."
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1079.93,1080.03,Right.
2016.15-606,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1080.3,1090.99,"So I wonder if you, and -- and I -- if I could write it right, I think it would make sense, but I'm asking you is there support for such a thing."
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1090.99,1091.33,Yes.
2016.15-606,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1162.98,1172.43,"What is it that the proceeding that you would have, I mean, if we accept your proposal and -- and interview the jurors, subject them to the -- what do you -- what do you ask them?"
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1172.43,1180.145,"So there's two -- there's two steps, Mr. Chief Justice. First is a threshold showing that I described earlier, that there was a statement that was racially --"
2016.15-606,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1180.145,1180.39,Okay.
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1187.89,1194.11,So the judge asks exactly the same question the judge would ask with other kinds of jury misconduct like extraneous evidence.
2016.15-606,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1199.21,1215.6,"So if the other jurors come in and they testify, there's testimony and everybody says, yes, that's what he said, and they say, well, what would you -- but of course the guy was guilty, no doubt about it, and the other 11 said, of course he was guilty, it was very offensive what, you know, HC or whatever it was said, but, of course, he was guilty."
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1219.98,1220.215,Right.
2016.15-606,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1268.21,1268.36,Right.
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1273.405,1273.95,So -- so --
2016.15-606,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1273.95,1286.475,"Do you have to poll -- do all the jurors have to come back and each one testify? First of all, did HC say what the two jurors said he said? There may be doubt about that."
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1289.77,1300.525,"So -- so there's two questions, Justice Ginsburg. The first one is, what does the evidence show, and so some juror testimony is required to bring out who said what and in what context."
2016.15-606,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1329.07,1334.18,"So the idea would be the judge would say, we'll look at all this other evidence v. the defendant."
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1337.245,1348.47,"No, that -- well, that's the issue I was talking about with the Chief Justice on which courts are divided. We think the Court might hold in a future case that it's enough to have a racially biased juror --"
2016.15-606,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1348.47,1350.9,But that would be a kind of structural error.
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1350.9,1357.96,"That would be a question the Court would ask. What I meant when I said, look at the other facts, I meant the context in which a statement was made during deliberations."
2016.15-606,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1371.92,1403.005,"But here we have -- in this case, we have a very blatant statement, but let's consider the standard that now applies on a lot of college campuses as to statements that are considered by some people to be racist. What would happen if one of the jurors has the sensibility of a lot of current college students, and thinks that one of the -- something that's said in the jury room that falls into one of those categories was a racious -- was a racial comment?"
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1403.005,1407.01,"We're talking here, Justice Alito, only about intentional racial bias."
2016.15-606,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1407.53,1422.35,Even the first time a person says something that is considered improper on a college campus today and another juror thinks that that shows intentional racial bias.
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1422.35,1424.825,"No, I think, as I said, it's an objective test."
2016.15-606,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1428.06,1428.2,Yeah.
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1433.555,1444.0,"Well, I think it's the same analysis the judge would conduct in an equal protection case, which is, is the statement asking to decide directly and intentionally on its face the case based on race."
2016.15-606,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1444.0,1444.49,Presumably --
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1444.49,1445.475,That's all you need to --
2016.15-606,0,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1445.475,1455.29,"Presumably the judge faces the same situation if a juror comes in during proceedings, is that right, and then the judge has to make whether this is something real or not."
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1455.29,1458.28,"Precisely right, Justice Kagan, or after proceedings."
2016.15-606,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1474.87,1497.895,"Does it make any difference if it were not the jurors as here, but the -- the lawyer for the defense went around, contacted all the jurors and elicited this testimony? So it wasn't the jurors volunteering, but the lawyer questioning the jurors to see if he can come up with something that would gain a new trial."
2016.15-606,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,1497.895,1504.245,"So long as what the lawyer was doing comported with the local rules with respect to contacting jurors, it would be the same case."
2016.15-606,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1518.215,1531.005,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Yarger."
2016.15-606,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,1531.005,1561.16,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Everyone, including Petitioner, agrees that the citizen jury system requires safeguards to ensure full and fair debate in the jury room and prevent harassment and tampering after verdicts are handed down. And the juror's alleged statements in this case are no doubt reprehensible, but the vital interests that the no-impeachment rule serves apply just as readily here as they do in other serious alleged cases of juror misconduct and bias."
2016.15-606,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1562.97,1574.375,"Mr. Yarger, let's -- let's assume that that's true, that the State interests are basically the same, and also let's assume that the safeguards, voir dire, don't operate particularly differently."
2016.15-606,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,1605.935,1613.145,"And we certainly don't dispute that racial bias is a particular problem, and a particular problem under the Constitution."
2016.15-606,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1637.975,1671.21,"The one question is whether identity-based harms are different than other kinds of unfairnesses, as we've talked about in the Warger case, for example, or the one before that. And then another question is whether race -- racial bias is different from other identity-based bias, right? But -- but would you -- would you concede that identity-based bias is different from like, you know, the kinds of bias that we've discussed in other cases?"
2016.15-606,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,1671.21,1686.71,I wouldn't concede that in this specific context where you're dealing with an individual defendant's Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury and a fair trial set v. the important and vital interests that the no-impeachment rule serves to allow the jury to do its job.
2016.15-606,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1686.71,1698.545,"But it's true that this is a Sixth Amendment case, but it seems artificial not to think about the Sixth Amendment issue as informed by the principles of the Equal Protection Clause."
2016.15-606,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,1754.9,1773.845,"I -- I think it would be difficult in the context of the Sixth Amendment in the same courthouse in Colorado to tell one defendant that that defendant gets to impeach the verdict because the error that happened to occur during deliberations is racial, whereas across the hall it was religious, or it was simply the jurors disrespecting the jury system enough to flip a coin."
2016.15-606,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1795.14,1797.02,Suppose this were a capital case.
2016.15-606,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,1804.345,1809.72,"Well, Your Honor, I think the -- certainly, this isn't a capital case, and that might raise different issues."
2016.15-606,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1813.87,1816.66,"Well, it doesn't follow from your position."
2016.15-606,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,1816.66,1818.05,And -- and it does.
2016.15-606,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1836.08,1848.465,Do you have any evidence that in the 20 jurisdictions that permit this -- this challenge that they've been overwhelmed with cases?
2016.15-606,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,1848.465,1872.2,"Your Honor, there -- I think there are two responses to that. First of all, we -- we don't agree with that count of jurisdictions or how it breaks down. But second of all, Petitioner does -- does point to jurisdictions in which this exception was made, but he doesn't link that up with evidence that -- that this is not occurring, that the harassment and the effects on full and fair deliberation are not being heard."
2016.15-606,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1872.2,1873.815,"Well, you can't prove a negative."
2016.15-606,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,1896.74,1920.22,"Well, what we do have, Your Honor, is specific examples in these particular cases where harassment is a very real problem, specifically with respect to racial bias, where, after all 12 jurors or a large number of jurors are pulled into the courtroom, it's -- it's determined that the affidavit at issue was manufactured by the attorney, and that the allegations were -- were untrue."
2016.15-606,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1980.56,2004.87,"Can you just clarify something? This -- I think Mr. Fisher told -- told us that in the states, whether the -- his number of 20, yours of six, is right, that this is limited to race. So it would not be applied to gender, sexual orientation, and apparently, national origin other than Hispanic."
2016.15-606,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2004.87,2011.045,"Justice Ginsburg, that -- that is true, that the cases that we've seen do only deal with racial bias."
2016.15-606,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2045.67,2071.62,"What -- what exception would you recognize? As far back as Reed we have said -- qualified 606(b)'s -- predecessors in 606(b). Wagner said it: There might be a case so extreme that we would not apply this rule. If race is not so extreme, what, in your judgment, would be?"
2016.15-606,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2071.62,2082.445,"Your Honor, I think the line that -- that can be drawn consistent with that footnote would be whether or not the other safeguards that are necessary to assure a fair trial were made available in that particular case."
2016.15-606,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2111.375,2123.915,"Well, right now, we don't permit or require questioning on bias except for race in voir dire, so where does your exception work?"
2016.15-606,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2123.915,2125.18,"Well, it --"
2016.15-606,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2125.18,2128.14,Because things do creep in.
2016.15-606,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2132.27,2134.4,"Well, I think that's precisely right."
2016.15-606,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2147.01,2153.075,The problem is it assumes that if the question is asked that every juror is going to be truthful.
2016.15-606,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2168.345,2189.615,"And, Your Honor, I think the same challenges arises with regard to nearly any bias that is crucial to a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights, which is precisely why the practice guides the defendant himself cites or Petitioner himself cites say, asking the general question is generally not the best way to expose those types of biases during voir dire."
2016.15-606,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2194.92,2203.785,But what other types of questions would -- what types of questions would you propound if you were trying to elicit whether there was bias on the part of a prospective juror?
2016.15-606,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2203.785,2215.89,"I would propound the same types of questions that Petitioner's counsel used below as to other issues: People's experiences on the subject, whether they believe racial issues still persist in this country, and what their attitudes are."
2016.15-606,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2215.89,2232.25,"But there are -- isn't it so that many lawyers won't ask that question even if they could? Because just by asking the question, you're putting race in the minds of the jurors, and you'd rather not do that."
2016.15-606,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2232.25,2234.72,That's certainly the argument the Petitioner makes here.
2016.15-606,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2258.825,2260.94,How do you know that?
2016.15-606,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2260.94,2264.55,That's the research that we cited for Professor Sommers in the briefing.
2016.15-606,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2276.48,2277.37,"Well, that's one of the --"
2016.15-606,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2277.37,2277.59,-- crop up.
2016.15-606,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2277.59,2278.96,But that's one of the problems here.
2016.15-606,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2308.24,2311.895,"Well, and that's one of our concerns, Mr. Chief Justice."
2016.15-606,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2346.11,2354.34,"Well, why? Isn't -- you know, there's a lot of talk about political correctness or not."
2016.15-606,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2396.585,2398.785,That is absolutely what we want.
2016.15-606,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2398.785,2401.72,So why shouldn't we try to drive it underground?
2016.15-606,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2401.72,2411.69,"Well, Your Honor, with respect, I think that if the juror harbors that bias and is on the jury, that's going to influence the verdict one way or the other."
2016.15-606,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2411.69,2412.09,Do jurors --
2016.15-606,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2412.09,2412.99,I don't think it's --
2016.15-606,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2412.99,2426.69,"Do jurors even know about the existence of a -- a de la rel rule -- rule -- I mean, that jurors can't impeach their verdict?"
2016.15-606,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2426.69,2432.73,"Justice Ginsburg, what jurors do know when they enter the deliberation room is that that's a secret proceeding."
2016.15-606,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2453.41,2474.23,"Can you please tell me, just as a matter of what goes on in the bar in your State, in Colorado, particularly, I take it that in civil cases, lawyers who may be trying a similar case all the time questioned jurors after the fact, after the verdict, in order to see how to improve their arguments, et cetera, et cetera, in civil and criminal cases."
2016.15-606,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2484.435,2488.91,The specific post-trial sort of conversation between counsel and jurors?
2016.15-606,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2488.91,2489.065,Yes.
2016.15-606,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2489.065,2490.46,I haven't seen anything like that.
2016.15-606,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2534.8,2546.335,"Well, when this rule was first pronounced, they were thinking about quotient verdicts, coin-flipping, perhaps."
2016.15-606,1,62752,frederick_r_yarger,,2562.149,2567.42,"Certainly, that might be true at the time the common law rule was announced."
2016.15-606,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2622.69,2637.495,"Thank you, counsel. Ms. Kovner."
2016.15-606,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2637.495,2645.0,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Racial bias is a real problem that the United States is committed to eradicating."
2016.15-606,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2666.55,2720.07,"Ms. Kovner, and it seems there are two lines of cases which -- in which we've recognized that racial bias in a jury room is an especially important problem, and that there need to be special rules to address that problem. And the first line of cases is the ones that on voir dire say that a lawyer who wants to ask about racial bias on voir dire has to be able to ask about racial bias, and that we've applied to nothing else except for racial bias. And the second is the Batson line of cases where we've said we're going to prevent lawyers from doing what we otherwise allow them to do when striking jurors will lead to -- may lead to race bias in the jury room. Now, here, we have like a screaming race bias in the jury room."
2016.15-606,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2746.24,2779.09,"So, Your Honor, we think this Court has never treated some Sixth Amendment violations as more serious than others, and to talk about these two lines of cases that Your Honor raises. If Your Honor looks at what, I think, the Court was doing in the voir dire cases, race was the particular issue that it confronted there, but it was indicating -- and I think it's indicated in other cases, you have to conduct the kind of voir dire that's reasonably calculated to detect the biases that may be present in a particular case. So those particular kinds of case involve the high risk of racial bias, and that's what why the Court said voir dire on race is required there."
2016.15-606,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2829.12,2848.36,"The reason I think would be the Sixth Amendment says, in all criminal prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a trial by an impartial jury. I agree with you that racial comments in the room can be equivalent to other comments."
2016.15-606,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,2889.355,2930.105,"So I think when considering -- I think, Your Honor, when considering a prophylactic approach to preventing Sixth Amendment violations, it's important to consider both the cost of this rule and the other alternative mechanisms that are available, because those are things that the Court has traditionally considered under the Sixth Amendment. So turning to that with respect to race, we think the prophylactic mechanisms that the Court has relied on are likely to be particularly available in many cases with regard to race, and to talk about, first, voir dire and then the in-trial mechanisms that Your Honor mentioned. So in voir dire, as Justice Kagan's questions alluded to, there's a -- a well-settled principle, and it's the law in Colorado that you are going to have the opportunity to ask these questions about race."
2016.15-606,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2996.42,3004.56,"So -- so the more insidious the evil, the less reason we -- the more caution we should have in -- in inquiring of the jury?"
2016.15-606,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3004.56,3004.94,No.
2016.15-606,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3005.66,3006.3,By them?
2016.15-606,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3006.3,3007.1,No.
2016.15-606,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3058.34,3075.98,"It does strike me, though, that given that one of the rules is that a juror can, during deliberations, say something appropriate -- something inappropriate is happening here, to the extent that there is this chilling effect, and more -- why doesn't that produce the exact same chilling effect?"
2016.15-606,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3075.98,3076.1,Yeah.
2016.15-606,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3076.83,3080.525,"I mean, it seems like it's such on the margins, what you're saying."
2016.15-606,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3080.525,3085.24,"I think, you know, for hundreds of years courts have treated the mid-trial context as different."
2016.15-606,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3138.85,3143.985,"Like -- like the government of the State of Colorado, the government of the United States would make the same argument in a capital case?"
2016.15-606,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3143.985,3148.79,We think that capital cases do present Eighth Amendment considerations that are not present here.
2016.15-606,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3174.02,3189.59,"In the states that allow this kind of evidence, is it -- is it all done by legislation, or by rule -- or by a rule of court? Or has it come about by judicial decision?"
2016.15-606,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3189.59,3190.6,I think it's a mix.
2016.15-606,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3208.32,3209.935,But if I can -- I'm sorry.
2016.15-606,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3209.935,3217.23,The issue of -- of a capital case could involve all sorts of misconduct in the jury room.
2016.15-606,2,39725,rachel_p_kovner,,3236.17,3237.85,"I -- I don't think so, Your Honor."
2016.15-606,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3246.4,3249.48,"Thank you, counsel. Five minutes, Mr. Fisher."
2016.15-606,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3249.48,3250.61,Thank you.
2016.15-606,3,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,3433.055,3437.325,"Well, Mr. Fisher, it's not a fear of confronting issues down the road."
2016.15-606,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3472.59,3480.39,"I think it's easy to say, Justice Alito, that categories covered in the Equal Protection Clause case by rational basis analysis would not require the rule we're seeking today."
2016.15-606,3,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,3492.64,3500.045,"Maybe you could put the question a little bit differently, because I understand why you don't want to say, well, it wouldn't apply to this or it wouldn't apply to that."
2016.15-606,3,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,3504.45,3513.78,"Race, this is unique in terms of our history and constitutional structure and in terms of the more practical considerations of rooting it out with the prophylactic measures we've discussed."
2016.15-606,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3547.68,0.0,"Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted."
