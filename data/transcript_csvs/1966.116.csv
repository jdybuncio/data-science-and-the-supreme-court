1966.116,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,33.61,Number 116 in the matter of application of Paul L. Gault et al appellant.
1966.116,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,35.583,46.675,"Before proceeding to the argument, Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, I would like to move the admission of the Assistant Attorney General of Arizona pro hac vice, Frank A. Parks."
1966.116,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,46.675,49.826,Is he admitted for that purpose?
1966.116,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,49.826,53.183,"Application of Gault, Number 116."
1966.116,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,323.751,333.251,"Did you have to size the fact that none of these was given to Mrs. Gault, why would she be the one if you're writing your theory?"
1966.116,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,333.251,337.934,"Well, the suggestion has been made Mr. Justice Stewart that notice was given to Mrs. Gault."
1966.116,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,350.078,350.816,To anybody?
1966.116,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,350.816,351.355,Right.
1966.116,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,351.355,354.434,"Well, how about the juvenile?"
1966.116,0,37075,norman_dorsen,,354.434,358.292,The juvenile received no notice whatsoever as far as the record shows.
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3355.435,3361.112,"Mr. Chief Justice, and if the Court please."
1966.116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3458.082,3466.019,Well what -- do you think this is such a big crossroad right in this case for New York?
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3466.019,3474.239,"Well, in regard to my estimation of New York provisions, Your Honor I believe, that New York has gone beyond their crossroad."
1966.116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3474.239,3476.929,So this case is no crossroads for them anyway?
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3476.929,3477.703,No crossroad for them Mr. Justice.
1966.116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3477.703,3479.051,And how about California?
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3480.566,3481.251,California.
1966.116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3495.292,3498.546,Take that Illinois.
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3498.546,3500.082,"Judging me short, Mr. Justice."
1966.116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3500.082,3503.564,"Well, I mean I'm just -- you say this is the crossroad for the Juvenile Court system."
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3507.819,3519.742,In certain states and of course I look through with a monocle as seen through the State of Arizona as to what our conception is of a proper and a proper functioning juvenile system.
1966.116,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3519.742,3531.805,And you will say why you think that that view of yours requires that the prior -- the evidentiary hearing the state place that I viewed --
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3531.805,3532.11,Certainly will.
1966.116,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3532.11,3537.502,-- he will take place rather than the way you do your --
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3537.502,3540.821,"Mr. Justice White, I certainly will."
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3541.143,3546.307,Well I hope let's assume that can be broken down a little bit.
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3555.585,3556.592,Certainly not.
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3556.664,3566.077,"Well, it then appears with the individualized treatment for the counsel to be provided to them."
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3566.077,3569.322,"Well this, if you would wish, I will go into it now."
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3573.543,3579.549,"I don't think -- all right, I will just like to get less from here."
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3585.637,3586.591,"Definitely, Your Honor."
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3587.632,3599.866,"As far as the child were told, were given warnings you didn't have to say anything and if they did say anything it could be used against you."
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3611.441,3612.577,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3612.577,3613.392,You think it would?
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3613.392,3614.563,That is correct.
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3620.11,3621.385,That is bad.
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3621.385,3623.248,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3623.248,3629.039,"How about appellate review, will that interfere with individualized treatment?"
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3629.039,3636.786,If the legislature so deemed that as the law of our jurisdiction then so be it.
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3647.73,3659.345,"I'm not asking that, I said would it interfere with the, what you say is Arizona's objective which is individualized treatment providing a right to appeal or right to review."
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3660.678,3663.402,"In good conscience, I would say no, Your Honor."
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3663.402,3665.937,And how about confrontation?
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3683.703,3691.249,In cases where the charges are denied by the child I think it is a requirement of due process.
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3691.249,3694.221,You think that is a requirement?
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3694.221,3694.931,That is correct.
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3694.931,3699.732,"How do you construe this record, is this a null or -- (Voice Overlap) sir?"
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3699.732,3703.962,The Supreme Court of Arizona wouldn't say side-step the issue.
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3711.537,3721.219,"Yeah, but usually, the criminal case unless there is a clear admission case proceeds as if there had been on a not guilty claim, isn't that right?"
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3721.219,3722.35,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3732.185,3734.688,I'm asking it in your view.
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3743.687,3768.723,I think it -- I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a constitutional requirement but I would be the first one to accept the concept that fair treatment would warrant a rule that would decide if the child has denied the charges that there'll be a fact-finding procedure to determine whether in fact the facts which have been alleged are correct or incorrect.
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3768.723,3778.728,Well unless you're going to confess here than you have to take the position that the Gerald Gault did not deny --
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3778.728,3779.108,That's correct.
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3779.108,3782.599,-- the act of which your complaint was made here.
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3786.028,3806.629,"As I would show the Court in the record, there were specific references made to the statements made by the boy not only to the judge who on two different occasions that the habeas corpus proceeding specifically stated, “I talked to the boy and asked him if in fact this telephone call was made.”"
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3853.08,3873.67,"And they get back to the other point, if you think that confrontation where the boy denies guilt would not negate individualized treatment, why is it that you're so worried about self-incrimination by telling the boy that he has got a privilege against self-incrimination?"
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3873.67,3890.167,"Well, I think the one potential disadvantage to confrontation is to bring the child into the center of an adversary proceeding with all the taint perhaps of a criminal proceeding that we try to remove in the child."
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3890.167,3897.673,But I thought you said that was alright where the child denies guilt that you thought there was an essential element of fairness?
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3897.673,3901.409,"Well, of course I'm going outside the record now, Your Honor, as far as my --"
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3901.409,3904.171,It may not be depending on how one (Voice Overlap)
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3904.171,3917.641,Because it's my position that I think fundamental fairness requires a fair fact-finding determination of an adjudication of delinquency.
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3940.485,3950.913,They know they would establish anything by declaring convincing evidence sort of giving -- providing fundamental due process?
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,3950.913,3955.84,"I think the two would run hand-in-hand, Your Honor."
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4007.446,4014.171,Which is reading was sort of lesson as applied to juveniles in the State of Arizona.
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4014.171,4021.531,"Well, the report that comes out on a county basis on our state indicates that it was below the national level."
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4040.619,4042.707,"Extremely low means what, supplement --"
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4042.707,4045.641,That ones who where in their once normally then come back.
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4045.641,4048.013,"That mean 40%, 50%?"
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4048.013,4059.723,"No, I think they're very -- in ‘54 -- '64, I believe it was in the 20% bracket."
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4274.422,4284.96,"Why did the state in its capacity as parens patriae on this 15-year-old boy, pick him up and put him in the receiving home?"
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4295.463,4297.088,"No, Your Honor."
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4315.389,4331.511,"And so this supposedly benevolent parens patriae, the state picks the boy up and puts him on the -- well in most jurisdictions one would have to say is whimsically called a receiving home."
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4332.864,4338.195,"We would like to think of that as a detention centers is getting the center of our attention, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4338.195,4343.113,"Well, I congratulate you up here relatively unique."
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4343.113,4355.924,But the Juvenile officer who by law is required to be contacted immediately in his best discretion decided that the proper procedure in this case was to have the boy taken to the detention center.
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4355.924,4358.907,"That's routine, isn't it?"
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4359.253,4359.522,In not all cases --
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4359.522,4360.765,-- with a delinquency as --
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4360.765,4361.642,Not in all cases.
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4361.642,4363.57,"No, it's not?"
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4363.57,4366.273,Not in all cases.
1966.116,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4366.273,4372.769,As part of being home alone with his father 120 miles away and his mother at work.
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4384.455,4387.188,"Mr. Chief Justice, this did not take place."
1966.116,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4387.188,4387.863,I beg your pardon?
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4387.863,4389.163,This did not take place.
1966.116,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4424.812,4432.253,But she had to get that information from neighbors or someone else around the place?
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4436.003,4437.1,"No, they did not."
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4487.502,4492.887,Was that -- was that ever approved when they boy -- is there anything in the record?
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4508.648,4512.357,Other than there was no written record --
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4512.357,4514.044,"Well, what then is that?"
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4514.044,4523.705,"Well, it's just that -- where In this case as a factual matter, the judge was there back in 1962, these Probation Officers were there in ‘62 and they handled it."
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4523.705,4528.264,But even the judge then say exactly what happened in this?
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4528.264,4537.595,"Well, he was not asked to delve into that specific issue, his statements on the fact show he was well aware of what the facts of the case were."
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4537.595,4542.247,"Someone -- well, I am aware of knowing that that's so or that it's not so."
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4579.775,4581.431,That's correct.
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4619.27,4622.417,"But forgive me, I'll leave you alone for this."
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4642.541,4643.596,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,4643.596,4648.223,"That's all we know, that that appears on this sheet of paper."
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4689.084,4699.913,That was the basic substance of that prior probation and I know the Court is limited to in this case the order signed by the Court under that occasion.
1966.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4707.159,4715.73,Were they following the ordinary course as followed by the Juvenile Court of the county as it has developed?
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4715.73,4719.973,"The basic framework, Your Honor, I would say, was complied with."
1966.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4745.754,4749.5,That's simply following the procedure as it has developed.
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4749.5,4750.151,That is correct.
1966.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4750.151,4758.039,And on second thoughts I would have called this to question.
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4758.039,4758.379,I understand.
1966.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4758.379,4763.996,I -- I don't see that you have done anything extraordinarily bad that you've done.
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4763.996,4764.262,"No, that is --"
1966.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4764.262,4768.993,I think you've been rather following the Court as it's been followed in the trial.
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4768.993,4772.199,"That is correct, Mr. Justice Black."
1966.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4826.971,4841.539,"With that questions you -- the basis here whether you're -- that that's the case, they set you in a situation of having to say, does it not, that they're not entitled to legal notice."
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4841.539,4856.065,"Well, I -- of course, I speak through the mouth now of our Supreme Court who interpreted our statute by saying the constitutional -- not the constitutional but the requirements of fair play and due process require notice."
1966.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4895.825,4906.09,"You can do it by not recognizing some federal rights that this fellow will have except that he's a minor, isn't that here?"
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4906.09,4918.133,"Well, if one was to accept the principle that a child has the same absolute rights as a parent, then one would only have one hurdle remaining."
1966.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4918.133,4922.374,But he would have stay in prison and do whatever has to be done.
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4926.576,4929.083,In regards to taking the juvenile and sending him to the state?
1966.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4929.083,4932.432,"Yeah, I think you're sending him to confinement."
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4937.659,4944.139,"We tend to think it's not confinement merely because his liberty, he is limited to the parental restraint levels."
1966.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4944.139,4948.414,You think it's not confinement?
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4951.88,4955.441,We look at it from this point.
1966.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4976.976,4978.995,Could he?
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4978.995,4988.876,"Well, he is there on a 24-hour basis depending on what the provisions are for perhaps his temporary release."
1966.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4988.876,4995.399,"As a matter of fact, if you're to call the place a jail instead of what do you call it and because it's not a jail, isn't it?"
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,4995.399,4999.423,If one would consider it a penal institution.
1966.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,4999.423,5002.047,But he didn't have a place to get home.
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,5005.392,5009.935,The record shows the father was constantly away.
1966.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5046.399,5056.135,"Well, how about the concept though that his parents are not given the child a home or that does not extend the home as it may extend this."
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,5056.135,5061.281,This is a prerogative of the Juvenile Court as far as sending them home if they wish.
1966.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5061.921,5064.517,As you were trying to do.
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,5065.872,5066.226,"Yes, sir."
1966.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5094.216,5096.338,"And he's denied of that here, doesn't he?"
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,5096.338,5096.827,That's correct.
1966.116,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,5096.827,5108.211,(Inaudible) I suppose that it is a major impact for both of the judge (Inaudible).
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,5108.211,5121.832,And this leads me to a point that has not been brought out and I think that they track a bit from the harshness of the disposition that was made by the juvenile judge.
1966.116,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5242.582,5271.08,"Mr. Parks, I was wondering about the request that the parents made for the recipient of this telephone call, the woman who received the telephone call to be brought to the hearing for examination as to whether it was this boy's voice or the voice of the other one and the judge said as I read some place, they don't have to come here."
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,5277.443,5296.693,"Well, it is our position Mr. Chief Justice that whether or not a complaining party should be there is directly dependent and commingled the question of whether or not when in a fatherly manner the juvenile judge says, “Gerald, what went on?"
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5302.886,5309.565,Suppose the judge didn't say it in fatherly manner.
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,5309.565,5313.73,"And I'd say it wasn't an Arizona juvenile judge, Mr. Justice Fortas."
1966.116,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5317.856,5337.238,I understood Mr. Parks that at that time when they asked for the woman to be pressed that there was a difference of opinion as between the boy and the authorities as to whether he had spoken any if those lewd words.
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,5373.924,5386.46,"Well, our Supreme Court reviewing the entire record thought that the statements that were made and there was one person who held a view that Gerald did not make the admission."
1966.116,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5407.437,5415.771,And did the probation officer would also indicate that the boy had not admitted that--
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,5415.771,5421.262,"That is correct, Your Honor in regard to the second hearing on June 15th."
1966.116,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5421.445,5424.953,Was that the time when they asked for the woman to be present?
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,5424.953,5425.421,"No, sir."
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5486.314,5497.977,In Arizona do you make -- is it appropriate or permissible to make a finding of delinquency on the basis just in the admissions of the juvenile?
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,5502.153,5519.269,"Mr. Justice Fortas, this was a case of first instance in that regard in Arizona on this issue and they are directly saying that the boy admits that there is no relevant issue on that subject and they have disposed of it."
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5519.269,5521.27,You mean that's what this case stands for?
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,5521.27,5522.727,"Yes, sir."
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5522.727,5534.142,There is a rule on other jurisdictions is entirely in effect that admissions have to -- of juveniles have to be corroborated before they would be accepted as a basis for --
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,5534.142,5557.456,I know that deals with cases of where I believe there's a question of who is an accomplice and who is a -- if there is a violation involved if they are an accomplice I don't know of any specific cases where any statement by a juvenile has to be corroborated before it's acceptable for it's probative value.
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5664.581,5664.604,With what?
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,5664.604,5672.392,"And therefore, dispensing with any potential problems that could arise out of that hearing beyond what was contemplated by our statute."
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5672.392,5674.984,What records are destroyed though?
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,5700.436,5715.197,"Your Honor, Title 8 Section 238 in our Juvenile Code provides for the destruction of records after two years after the discharge of the child from the institutions in which he may have been committed."
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5715.197,5728.342,That would mean now that this would be destroyed after he gets to be 21 with Gerald Gault unless he gets an absolute discharge prior to that time.
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,5728.342,5729.166,That is correct.
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5729.166,5737.191,And that you construe that as meaning all records including the records of this man in the institution?
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,5738.149,5744.454,They make a specific mention Your Honor to the fact that destroys the records of the proceedings.
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5744.454,5746.225,Just that with the proceeding.
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,5754.399,5764.625,"Of course, I couldn't make a specific statement that in all cases the proceedings are destroyed and the background information is retained."
1966.116,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,5776.767,5795.69,Which is told compliment in terms of we've been talking and they say that they still be -- presumably still would be a record that the boy was sent to the institution for such and such a period for such and such on such and such a basis.
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,5795.69,5799.611,There's a possibility that that is true.
1966.116,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5913.09,5924.669,"Does your Juvenile Court judge have the right to say, no lawyer can represent a child in this particular case?"
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,5924.669,5925.823,"No, Mr. Chief Justice."
1966.116,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,5946.215,5972.098,I wonder how you would distinguish so the situation where if the child of a wealthy family wants to bring a lawyer there to represent the child that they can do so and he can have representation all the way through the proceeding on the theory that it will be helpful to him.
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,5985.839,5994.806,There -- there is a distinction Mr. Chief Justice between what the Court perhaps would think is the best procedure for the child.
1966.116,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,6036.424,6047.484,And then do you think it represents a fair play for the judge himself to determine whether the child shall have counsel.
1966.116,1,24479,frank_a_parks,,6047.484,6058.732,"Shall have counsel in the circumstances needed and that the circumstances in the case might perhaps warn them, that's correct, Your Honor."
1966.116,2,35923,merritt_w_green,,6284.465,6289.16,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the members of the Court.
1966.116,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6445.11,6453.645,"But Mr. Green, the distinction between misdemeanors and felonies is based on some difference in the elements of the act."
1966.116,2,35923,merritt_w_green,,6453.645,6455.099,That's right sir.
1966.116,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6455.099,6469.16,"Well, if the distinction between delinquency and on the one hand felonies and misdemeanors on the other hand may or may not be based on the difference in the elements of the act."
1966.116,2,35923,merritt_w_green,,6469.16,6469.571,"That's right, sir."
1966.116,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6469.571,6476.693,It might be based merely on the fact that who doesn't whether he's 18 years old or 19 years old.
1966.116,2,35923,merritt_w_green,,6476.693,6478.528,That's right.
1966.116,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6576.52,6590.049,"What is the difference Mr. Green, here's a boy and let's suppose that he telephoned this lady and said some lewd things over the telephone."
1966.116,2,35923,merritt_w_green,,6677.479,6682.249,"Well, I'm just -- I'm not calling one a crime and not the other crime."
1966.116,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6733.913,6738.667,But one -- one of the questions here is very simply put.
1966.116,2,35923,merritt_w_green,,6804.255,6806.221,Or decided on that.
1966.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,6849.917,6856.546,(Inaudible)
1966.116,2,35923,merritt_w_green,,6856.546,6867.591,"No, we all -- I think all of the courts and all of us here would say that due process is certainly should be accorded to juveniles."
1966.116,2,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,6868.826,6873.597,(Inaudible)
1966.116,2,35923,merritt_w_green,,6873.607,6873.597,"No, I don't believe so."
1966.116,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6892.937,6902.152,"Mr. Green, you don't say, do you, that due process is what the Juvenile Court judge says it is in the particular case period and that's the end of the definition."
1966.116,2,35923,merritt_w_green,,6902.152,6903.556,"No, I don't think so."
1966.116,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6903.556,6905.242,"So, well do you say that --"
1966.116,2,35923,merritt_w_green,,6905.242,6907.651,I think those are all subject to scrutiny.
1966.116,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6908.073,6909.76,"Well, what does this include then?"
1966.116,2,35923,merritt_w_green,,6921.302,6922.696,I think adequate notice.
1966.116,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6922.696,6923.645,Adequate notice.
1966.116,2,35923,merritt_w_green,,6923.645,6924.643,"Adequate notice, yes."
1966.116,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6924.643,6926.6,Would it include counsel?
1966.116,2,35923,merritt_w_green,,6926.6,6927.824,"I think, yes."
1966.116,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6927.824,6937.528,"Would it include a warning about the -- and the privilege of self-incrimination, privilege against self-incrimination?"
1966.116,2,35923,merritt_w_green,,6937.528,6947.916,"Well, constitutional protections against those things apply in where its person is charged of the crime."
1966.116,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,6981.959,6990.685,I don't get any words by trying to solve these problems in terms of the use of the word like ‘crime’ or ‘not crime’.
1966.116,2,35923,merritt_w_green,,7010.977,7013.347,"Yeah, but children are not adults."
1966.116,2,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,7052.691,7054.277,"Well, I think and I think there is a difference."
1966.116,2,35923,merritt_w_green,,7072.983,7079.829,"If denied -- if the act is denied by the juvenile, most assuredly."
1966.116,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7095.836,7101.166,"Mr. Green, is there a National Association of Juvenile Court Judges?"
1966.116,2,35923,merritt_w_green,,7101.166,7102.893,"Yes, there is, Your Honor."
1966.116,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7102.893,7106.568,Do they agree with you in your position here?
1966.116,2,35923,merritt_w_green,,7106.568,7121.069,"Well, I can't speak for them and they were asked to command amicus but because of the power structure, the organizational structure they couldn't get together the information to file an application."
1966.116,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7121.069,7122.892,"Well, did they all agree?"
1966.116,2,35923,merritt_w_green,,7122.892,7123.523,Sir?
1966.116,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7123.523,7125.685,Did they all agree?
1966.116,2,35923,merritt_w_green,,7125.685,7126.756,As to --
1966.116,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7126.756,7128.558,-- any of this or either way?
1966.116,2,35923,merritt_w_green,,7129.652,7133.91,Do they all agree?
1966.116,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,7142.974,7147.708,You know some members of that association think that none of them should?
1966.116,2,35923,merritt_w_green,,7147.708,7148.492,That none of them?
1966.116,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7153.273,7157.157,You wouldn't expect that (Inaudible)?
1966.116,2,35923,merritt_w_green,,7157.157,7160.627,"No, that's right."
1966.116,2,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7167.709,7169.289,Mr. Dorsen.
1966.116,3,37075,norman_dorsen,,7169.289,7172.704,I should be very brief Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.
1966.116,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7200.181,7204.892,"Who speaks for the juvenile in this respect, Mr. Dorsen?"
1966.116,3,37075,norman_dorsen,,7217.099,7220.117,"If the child wants counsel, it's his right, he should have counsel."
1966.116,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7220.117,7224.515,"Well, he speaks to the -- so the judge shouldn't think the father has agreed to it."
1966.116,3,37075,norman_dorsen,,7224.515,7231.917,Or the question would be under the cases like Carnley and Cochran where there was a knowing waver of a right.
1966.116,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7232.327,7233.923,How can the child waive a right?
1966.116,3,37075,norman_dorsen,,7233.923,7235.619,Well that's the point I was just going to make.
1966.116,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7236.851,7245.606,So you view the thing as in every single case that there necessarily must be a counsel for the juvenile even if the parent is represented.
1966.116,3,37075,norman_dorsen,,7245.606,7248.101,"No, I would not go that far unnecessarily."
1966.116,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7248.205,7249.949,"Well, how do you get out -- how do you get out of it?"
1966.116,3,37075,norman_dorsen,,7252.59,7258.038,"In certain situations, I think that the counsel probably could represent both interests."
1966.116,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7261.02,7261.711,"Well, that's different."
1966.116,3,37075,norman_dorsen,,7271.513,7273.526,"That's right, that's correct."
1966.116,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7273.526,7277.228,And that there has to be a lawyer in the courtroom.
1966.116,3,37075,norman_dorsen,,7280.746,7283.084,"That would be my position, Mr. Justice White."
1966.116,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,7333.327,7335.709,(Inaudible)
1966.116,3,37075,norman_dorsen,,7335.709,7337.739,"No, it does not."
1966.116,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7384.648,7385.568,During when?
1966.116,3,37075,norman_dorsen,,7385.568,7390.284,"The custodial, the preliminary stage before the hearing when he was picking up Gerald Gault."
1966.116,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7429.231,7431.148,Did Gerald --
1966.116,3,37075,norman_dorsen,,7431.148,7433.763,He did not testify at the habeas corpus hearing.
1966.116,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7433.763,7435.879,But did he at the second hearing?
1966.116,3,37075,norman_dorsen,,7435.879,7436.983,Yes.
1966.116,3,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,7443.703,7446.483,Thank you.
