1991.90-6105,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.077,"We'll hear argument now in No. 90-6105, John H. Evans, Jr. v. United States."
1991.90-6105,0,18265,c_michael_abbott,,49.835,55.208,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-6105,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,96.154,100.376,What about if the conviction is valid?
1991.90-6105,0,18265,c_michael_abbott,,100.376,103.26,"Then we are out of luck on count two, Your Honor."
1991.90-6105,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,103.26,103.628,Yes.
1991.90-6105,0,18265,c_michael_abbott,,104.319,114.386,"The petitioner was convicted on one count of extortion, one count of false statement that was affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in September of 1990."
1991.90-6105,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,348.019,352.411,"Did he thank him for $1,000 or for $8,000?"
1991.90-6105,0,18265,c_michael_abbott,,352.411,355.313,"--I don't believe there was any reference to the amount of the contribution, Your Honor."
1991.90-6105,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,444.06,455.598,"Now at common law, I suppose, that would have been the case, that extortion under color of right would not be said to require inducement."
1991.90-6105,0,18265,c_michael_abbott,,455.598,459.852,"There certainly are cases, Justice O'Connor, under common law, in which that is true."
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1797.772,1803.306,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1991.90-6105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1821.638,1836.599,"Mr. Bryson, if you're right on that, why is a maximum 20-year penalty attached to this particular offense, whereas at both the common law and in New York law, as I understand it, it is a misdemeanor with a very minor penalty?"
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1836.599,1851.097,"Well, of course, at common law, Your Honor, a misdemeanor didn't mean that... what it now means, which was that you would, in Federal law for example, be subject only to a 1-year penalty, but it rather meant that it was not a crime that was subject to the death penalty, typically, and forfeiture of property."
1991.90-6105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1854.29,1858.524,"Well, could you be imprisoned for life under a common law rule--"
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1858.524,1858.804,Yes.
1991.90-6105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1859.543,1860.855,--for the extortion?
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1860.855,1861.896,"Yes, you could, Your Honor."
1991.90-6105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1861.896,1866.989,And the registrar of deeds who asked for $20 and got... when he was only entitled to $10?
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1866.989,1868.189,"Yes, Your Honor."
1991.90-6105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1881.578,1883.378,How about under New York law?
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1883.378,1885.421,Under New York law it was a misdemeanor.
1991.90-6105,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1963.242,1965.405,"Mr. Bryson, do you know of any New York case?"
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1981.865,1991.041,The only prosecution that we could find under the official extortion branch of the New York law was the old Whaley case.
1991.90-6105,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1991.041,1991.691,The Whaley case.
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,1992.831,1993.251,That's right.
1991.90-6105,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2001.369,2002.358,A claim of official right.
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2002.358,2003.81,"Well, if the claim--"
1991.90-6105,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2003.81,2007.821,"And you don't think that's suspicious, that the language says official right?"
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2015.869,2016.507,"--It's an old case, sir."
1991.90-6105,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2016.948,2023.112,"--In all those years, the only prosecution happens just accidentally to track the language of the statute."
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2023.112,2036.762,"--Your Honor, the... what's important, I think about the Whaley case, which was the source for the penal code, which in turn is the basis for the New York statutory code, the important thing about Whaley is not what it in fact involved."
1991.90-6105,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2083.851,2085.943,"Bribery was a separate offense under New York law, wasn't it?"
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2088.364,2092.078,--Bribery could certainly be reached through this.
1991.90-6105,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2095.821,2097.2,Never used.
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2097.2,2099.702,"It was not used... well, we don't know if it was never used."
1991.90-6105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2265.44,2269.875,So you say in effect that under color of office means pretty much the same thing as under color of right?
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2269.875,2270.692,Exactly.
1991.90-6105,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2301.224,2302.995,"Mr. Bryson, do your... I'm sorry."
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2325.66,2328.132,We think absolutely and I--
1991.90-6105,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2328.132,2331.344,Do you have examples like the examples you just gave to us?
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2331.344,2346.374,--I can't give you a case which says specifically that only in cases in which the official was not the initiator of the transaction he is nonetheless guilty.
1991.90-6105,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2367.368,2389.462,"There's this argument to be made, isn't there, that at least in the nonofficial extortion by force, threat, and so on, the person who's going to end up with the money is making some kind of affirmative act to, in other words, making the threat or applying the force, twisting the arm, or whatnot."
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2407.063,2423.074,"Well, actually I think the analogy... first of all I think that the way the common law courts looked at this problem was to say that someone's office itself has a very powerful potential coercive effect, and the officer doesn't have to underscore the matter by going out and soliciting."
1991.90-6105,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2454.664,2457.846,"Yes, but that's because he's broken somebody else's arm."
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2457.846,2459.797,"Well, not necessarily."
1991.90-6105,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2459.797,2462.441,"At some point, he's initiated something."
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2462.441,2464.852,"Well, that is typically true, of course, in official extortion, too."
1991.90-6105,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2497.801,2506.767,So is there an instruction required that the payor must know that if he doesn't pay that there will be adverse action taken against him?
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2506.767,2509.04,"Well, it doesn't matter."
1991.90-6105,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2511.993,2512.731,Yes.
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2512.731,2513.412,"--No, no."
1991.90-6105,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2530.923,2543.362,But in this case was the jury instructed that there had to be some anticipation or fear on the grounds of the payor that adverse action would be taken?
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2543.362,2545.103,"--No, no, it was not."
1991.90-6105,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2549.146,2554.679,Is that because we presume that that fear is present whenever you're dealing with an official?
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2554.679,2556.121,--No.
1991.90-6105,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2588.091,2593.695,"How do you know that under New York... and I say the only case I know of involving this under New York law, is that one case that you mentioned."
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2608.614,2610.275,"Your Honor, two points."
1991.90-6105,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2637.853,2646.559,But would it not make sense to put in with those cases official extortion in the very narrow sense of extortion by an official who says you've got to make the payment.
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2656.056,2675.037,"--Let me go to my second point, which is to read the provision of the 1881 New York code, which again has come all the way through the period of the Hobbs Act to 1965, that relates to official extortion, that goes beyond just the definitional section that found its way into the Hobbs Act."
1991.90-6105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2704.617,2705.719,Is this in your brief?
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2705.719,2706.139,Yes.
1991.90-6105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2706.139,2706.73,Where?
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2706.73,2719.427,"This is... this statute is not set out, but it is described at page... let's see, at page 25 of our brief, in the middle."
1991.90-6105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2728.472,2729.894,On page 55?
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2729.894,2730.903,--25.
1991.90-6105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2732.715,2734.085,Section 855.
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2734.085,2740.21,"It's a... yeah, section 855, which was originally section 557 of the 1881 code."
1991.90-6105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2768.269,2769.389,Could you read that once more?
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2769.389,2769.899,--Certainly.
1991.90-6105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2795.785,2812.107,"So I take it if some constituent just sends in $10,000 to a Congressman or a Senator saying, I know you're performing great services for the country, and I want to supplement your compensation."
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2813.667,2821.884,"--I think that would not be, Your Honor, because that would not be a payment... the common law is very clear, the payment had to be related to a specific service."
1991.90-6105,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2832.461,2836.163,"I know you're a great supporter of the farmer, and I'm a farmer."
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2836.163,2842.447,"--Well, the closer you get to saying thank... you know, please vote for the farm bill, here's $10,000."
1991.90-6105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2846.381,2857.158,"From the language you read, it sounds as if the registrar of deeds who asks for $10 to record a deed and the fee is $10 is guilty of extortion."
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2857.158,2862.421,"--Well, no, Your Honor, I think this... when they refer to fee or other compensation--"
1991.90-6105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2862.421,2864.281,"Well, the registrar asks for fees."
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2864.281,2869.855,"--I'm sorry, but the rest of the statute goes on for a while and says in excess of the amount permitted or where it's not permitted."
1991.90-6105,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2870.225,2870.926,Thank you.
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2871.197,2877.3,"--That is... well, I think it's not pertinent to our inquiry here because there's no question that we're not talking about--"
1991.90-6105,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2877.3,2879.862,"Why isn't it pertinent, Mr. Bryson?"
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2890.357,2890.787,--That's right.
1991.90-6105,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2890.787,2891.729,It doesn't have a limiting factor.
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2898.073,2903.777,"Well, because this... our statute picks up on the New York definition."
1991.90-6105,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2908.81,2909.611,I'm not talking about that.
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2912.012,2912.643,--Yes.
1991.90-6105,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2912.643,2920.016,--The term extortion means the obtaining of property from another with his consent under color of official right.
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2920.016,2920.337,Right.
1991.90-6105,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2964.476,2967.068,"Well, I understand that, but the statute doesn't say that."
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2967.068,2977.455,"--Well, the statute uses a term of art, and our position is that term of art is not... it has to be read in light of its origins, which were in New York law and the common law."
1991.90-6105,1,15100,clarence_thomas,scotus_justice,2983.389,2987.383,But you will admit that on its face it has no limiting principle?
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,2987.383,2998.649,"Well, I think, yes, I think that the words under color of official right on their face do not answer the question of how broad the statute is."
1991.90-6105,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3011.536,3024.216,"Mr. Bryson, the step in the argument that I guess I'm unclear on is taking the definition as you just read it from the New York statute, how does that become subsumed under the term of art that is being used in the Hobbs Act?"
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3027.618,3027.879,No.
1991.90-6105,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3037.586,3039.215,"Okay, but it did use that term?"
1991.90-6105,1,44079,william_c_bryson,,3039.215,3039.946,"--Oh, absolutely."
