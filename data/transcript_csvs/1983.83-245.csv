1983.83-245,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.939,We will hear arguments first this morning in Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation against Gray and the consolidated case.
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,14.391,37.72,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is on appeal from the Ninth Circuit holding an Act of Congress unconstitutional with respect to its brief retroactive period."
1983.83-245,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,181.365,185.234,"What do we mean, exactly, Mr. Fellner, by the term ""withdrawing employer""?"
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,185.234,201.528,"--A withdrawing employer is an employer who has contributed to a multi-employer plan and chooses to, as defined under the statute, cease his obligations, cease contributing to a multi-employer plan."
1983.83-245,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,201.528,203.73,"Well, now, how does that come about contractually?"
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,211.884,213.42,There are a variety of circumstances.
1983.83-245,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,317.903,320.022,"Mr. Fellner, may I ask one question?"
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,329.795,334.365,"--Withdrawal liability is calculated as follows, Justice Stevens."
1983.83-245,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,352.926,359.996,"Now, is that of the entire unfunded vested benefits or just the employees for whom the particular employers contributed?"
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,359.996,368.619,It is roughly equivalent to the contributions which the employer has made up to that point.
1983.83-245,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,424.023,430.927,"What is the... I may just show my ignorance here, but I might as well show it now rather than later, I guess."
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,447.186,452.44,The typical collective bargaining agreement I think is difficult to describe.
1983.83-245,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,500.337,503.372,But now do those agreements also bind the employers?
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,503.372,504.189,Clearly.
1983.83-245,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,518.799,529.504,But the typical collective bargaining agreement doesn't contain a provision whereby an employer promises to pay any individual employee a pension of so much at the time he retires.
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,529.504,540.878,"That is correct, but the realities of collective bargaining we submit, however, and describe in detail in our brief, are such that these contributions are clearly not negotiated in a vacuum."
1983.83-245,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,548.568,552.436,"May I ask just one other question if I could, because I think I have the concept in mind now."
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,564.493,568.814,"--Let me first make one minor correction if I may, Justice Stevens."
1983.83-245,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,571.183,573.199,"Well, the three cases discussed in the Ninth Circuit opinion."
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,573.199,573.983,That's correct.
1983.83-245,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,604.154,605.954,"It had been making $65,000 a year roughly?"
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,605.954,606.606,That is correct.
1983.83-245,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,606.606,611.141,"So that in five years about $300,000 he had contributed, and he has to come up with another $200,000."
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,611.141,611.708,That's correct.
1983.83-245,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,613.776,615.712,"And is that typical of the other two, also?"
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,615.712,616.628,"--Yes, it is."
1983.83-245,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,616.628,617.262,They are roughly the same ratio?
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,617.262,632.138,We submit that Congress was therefore rational in legislating retroactively where to do otherwise could indeed have precipitated the very conduct that Congress intended to restrain.
1983.83-245,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,789.273,795.327,"Mr. Fellner, when you say that, it spread the pain around, it did keep advancing the date, didn't it?"
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,795.327,796.41,--That is correct.
1983.83-245,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,796.41,802.248,"And what, under political pressure by organizations with clout?"
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,804.85,807.968,"I don't apologize for it, Justice Blackmun."
1983.83-245,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1114.218,1117.853,Is this argument critical to your winning this case?
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,1117.853,1119.788,This argument is made last.
1983.83-245,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1121.322,1124.907,You have certainly been giving it a lot of emphasis.
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,1124.907,1127.942,I shall move from it immediately.
1983.83-245,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1329.923,1336.862,What will the... What are the trustees free to use this money for?
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,1344.816,1349.086,The trustees can use the money to pay benefits.
1983.83-245,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1349.086,1358.859,"So it can, instead of holding it to safeguard against unfunded liabilities, it could just increase the benefits and spend it all, I take it."
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,1358.859,1365.013,"That is correct, but there are some internal restraints upon the trustees from doing so."
1983.83-245,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1391.996,1393.829,"Yes, but, Mr. Fellner, what if it were a perfectly healthy trust?"
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,1400.233,1404.553,"If there are no unfunded vested liabilities, then there is no withdrawal liability."
1983.83-245,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1404.553,1405.003,Yes.
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,1412.223,1416.111,"Well, the problem, Your Honor, and of course this is--"
1983.83-245,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1416.111,1416.811,You never know.
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,1417.411,1423.765,"--That's the answer, and that's precisely why Congress had to legislate the complex statute that it did."
1983.83-245,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1423.765,1434.656,"But you wouldn't say, would you, that every pension plan in the country is so questionable that every single one of them needs to be protected like this."
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,1434.656,1435.306,That is correct.
1983.83-245,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1436.941,1439.977,So that there are a lot of them that don't need this kind of protection.
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,1439.977,1454.736,"--Congress was not in a position of legislating on the basis of need, that kind of a bright line, precisely because of what you have pointed out, Justice White, and that is the difficulty of defining where need begins and where it ends."
1983.83-245,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1486.623,1489.073,"Let me go back to Justice White's case, if I may."
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,1509.902,1511.586,That is correct.
1983.83-245,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1511.586,1522.692,"And as I understand it, the amount that the withdrawing employer has to come up with is unaffected by the change in the size of the population of potential beneficiaries."
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,1530.131,1531.264,That is not a factor.
1983.83-245,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1531.264,1539.57,"And that could make quite a difference in the future of the fund, depending, you know, what... there are all sorts of withdrawals, is what I am saying, and they are all treated alike for this purpose."
1983.83-245,0,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,1539.57,1540.586,That is correct.
1983.83-245,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1607.028,1607.578,Very well.
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,1613.701,1622.973,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to start by responding to the questions that were put to Mr. Fellner."
1983.83-245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1733.241,1736.043,How do you know which ones they are?
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,1736.043,1746.917,--Apparently PBGC had this information based on reporting forms that were filed with it pursuant to the 1974 Act.
1983.83-245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1753.071,1763.712,So you think it would be perfectly feasible to go around and in case of any particular trust make a sensible judgment about whether it was actuarially sound or not?
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,1763.712,1764.612,--I think that's right.
1983.83-245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1792.981,1805.123,"That may be so, but what if... I suppose any trust that you would say is actuarially sound, if a lot of employers suddenly withdrew, your judgment might change."
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,1805.123,1827.886,"The actuaries are also obligated to forecast the population of the trusts, and they do this on an annual basis, and on an annual basis they prepare reports based on the contribution base and the number of employers and then project the cash flow needs of the trust on a year by year basis."
1983.83-245,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2070.86,2078.883,"Well, of course, if that criticism were a ground for invalidating legislation, I don't know where we'd be."
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2081.418,2120.21,"The point that I am making is, we urge this Court that there is a procedural due process issue involved in applying a statute retroactively, and that indeed, that under our concept of due process, the employer here was entitled to reasonable notice of a change in the law, and to be given an opportunity to adjust his conduct to what that law would be."
1983.83-245,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2120.21,2140.522,"Mr. Triplett, that really... the normal presumption of any Congressional Act is that it can be and is going to be applied as of the date that Congress says it is going to take effect, isn't it, even though that date may be before enactment."
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2150.312,2155.716,"Your Honor, I respectfully disagree."
1983.83-245,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2171.559,2175.195,How good law do you think the Untermeyer case is today?
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2184.784,2188.77,It has been cited with approval since.
1983.83-245,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2218.457,2242.739,"What would follow from your analysis, I suppose, is that if Congress were to undertake a sweeping revision of the Internal Revenue Code and cut out a lot of tax shelters and that sort of thing, that it couldn't... and everyone knew that it was debating that for six months, that it could not make that applicable to any transaction that was closed before the date that the President signed it?"
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2242.739,2250.611,The income tax cases appear to me to be unique.
1983.83-245,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2327.742,2340.652,"Mr. Triplett, getting away from taxes, don't we about once a year get a Congressional Act where there were no hearings, no notice, and it was written on the floor, and we have upheld them, haven't we?"
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2340.652,2348.556,But I don't think those Acts have been upheld where they have applied retroactively to a transaction which has already been concluded.
1983.83-245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2348.556,2351.675,What would you say about Turner Elkhorn under this thesis?
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2351.675,2352.376,All right.
1983.83-245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2354.026,2357.744,I think you were just suggesting Turner Elkhorn was just wrongly decided.
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2357.744,2363.898,"--Turner Elkhorn, I think, is a completely different kind of case."
1983.83-245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2367.386,2373.373,"Well, it's a law that was applied retroactively to supposedly close transactions."
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2373.373,2378.575,--Turner Elkhorn did a couple of things which this law does not do.
1983.83-245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2414.129,2415.164,That is just a fairness argument.
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2418.366,2419.216,Well--
1983.83-245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2419.216,2420.016,Is that it?
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2420.016,2427.806,"--What is, what is the basics of the Fifth Amendment due process clause?"
1983.83-245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2455.575,2474.787,"What would you say, then, about, in this case, what if your clients had... one of your clients had been at the beginning of a three-year contract, and he contractually just couldn't withdraw when this law went into effect?"
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2487.76,2491.664,There are people here who are likely to make that argument.
1983.83-245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2512.577,2514.261,Which might measure fundamental fairness.
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2514.261,2515.011,--Yes.
1983.83-245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2538.61,2539.229,Yes.
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2548.917,2550.117,That's right.
1983.83-245,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2550.117,2553.652,--doesn't the logic of your argument apply to those employers just as well as it applies to the happenstance that your termination date happened to come in this interim?
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2553.652,2565.627,"I suppose that it does, although the employer... Maybe the best way of approaching that problem is to look at the specific facts here."
1983.83-245,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2620.262,2632.335,I am still not clear on how you differentiate that situation from one in which the expiration date was a couple of months later.
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2645.162,2649.781,I am not certain that I understood your question.
1983.83-245,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2649.781,2658.351,"Well, even if you knew about the statute, the statute has the effect of making the union's bargaining position much stronger than if the statute weren't there."
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2658.351,2658.887,No question.
1983.83-245,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2658.887,2665.207,And are you saying that... you don't challenge the statute simply for that reason.
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2665.207,2666.224,No.
1983.83-245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2714.806,2717.156,This isn't because of retroactivity.
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2719.524,2722.31,"No, this is because of prospective withdrawal liability."
1983.83-245,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2722.31,2722.876,--Yes.
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,2722.876,2749.776,"In terms of this notice question, this question which I view as a question of fundamental fairness, PBGC itself acknowledged the inability of certain employers to understand the effects of this law, even though it had already been passed."
1983.83-245,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3010.213,3014.915,"Mr. Triplett, let me just go back to that hypothetical example."
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,3019.819,3021.02,--Yes.
1983.83-245,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3156.889,3161.693,"But that is kind of a contradiction of the text of the Constitution, isn't it?"
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,3176.62,3199.402,"Well, what I am saying is that the analytical tools that underscore a contract clause analysis apply equally to a Fifth Amendment analysis with respect to retroactive application to a closed transaction."
1983.83-245,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3199.402,3200.468,Why should that be?
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,3200.468,3221.214,"I don't think that there is a restraint with respect to the language of the Constitution when it is borne in mind that when originally written it was thought that only the states would be in the business of regulating contracts, and secondly--"
1983.83-245,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3221.214,3224.833,But I think that is a very good reason for bearing it in mind.
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,3248.882,3260.507,"--But they did subsequently enact the Amendments, and the Fifth Amendment, and what indeed does that due process concept mean?"
1983.83-245,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3276.449,3281.67,"Well, certainly the contract clause is Exhibit A that would tend to contradict you, I think."
1983.83-245,1,43384,thomas_m_triplett,,3281.67,3296.596,"Well, this Court in the Spanouse case dealt with a contract clause issue."
1983.83-245,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3330.067,3333.971,Do you have anything further?
1983.83-245,2,17626,baruch_a_fellner,,3333.971,3335.688,"We waive rebuttal, unless there are any questions."
1983.83-245,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3335.688,3336.59,"Thank you, gentlemen."
