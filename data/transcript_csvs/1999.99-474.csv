1999.99-474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.522,"We'll hear argument now in Number 99-474, Andrew S. Natsios v. The National Foreign Trade Council."
1999.99-474,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,11.189,14.058,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,71.494,96.561,"Mr. Barnico, would you take the same position if Massachusetts decided it didn't like another State's death penalty policy and wanted to discourage it and said, we're not going to let anybody spend State money to buy anything if the seller has anything to do with the other State?"
1999.99-474,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,96.561,109.286,"Not if the law regulated our citizens in that way, but if it were expending our own funds, as it is in this case, we would consider that to be proprietary as well under our definition."
1999.99-474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,118.559,125.313,"Well, isn't the Gould case somewhat against you on this point, or the Wisconsin Department of Labor?"
1999.99-474,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,144.424,156.748,"Well, we think there, and the difference with Gould and this case, is the fact that the Court saw a nexus between the regulatory scheme imposed by Federal law and the State action that was at issue."
1999.99-474,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,188.1,199.925,"Mr. Barnico, would it make any difference in your analysis if the country with which we were dealing were not Burma but, say, Austria, or Switzerland?"
1999.99-474,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,199.925,212.916,"The country wouldn't matter, Your Honor, except insofar as some Federal law or treaty established relations between the United States and the country--"
1999.99-474,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,212.916,224.123,"So that a State would be free to decide what country it believed is violating some human rights norm, be it Austria, be it Burma?"
1999.99-474,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,224.123,232.996,"--That's right, except insofar as a plausible argument could be made that we were preempted by a Federal law or treaty on the point."
1999.99-474,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,245.704,245.787,Do you think that Congress--
1999.99-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,245.787,250.156,--Would your answer be the same if two States had different policies?
1999.99-474,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,262.98,265.58,"That's right, Your Honor."
1999.99-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,287.178,304.307,"I'm not sure it's realistic to expect the Congress to exercise this ongoing supervision over every local ordinance, over every State statute, and it certainly is inconsistent with what the Federalist Papers explain was the purpose of forming the Union itself."
1999.99-474,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,304.307,311.627,"Well, if I might address both of those points, Your Honor, the first is on the question of the proliferation of these laws."
1999.99-474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,362.893,371.932,"Well, here Congress has actually enacted a law dealing with this precise problem, an area of trade with Burma, has it not?"
1999.99-474,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,371.932,376.153,It has enacted a law imposing Federal sanctions on Burma--
1999.99-474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,376.153,377.169,Yes.
1999.99-474,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,377.169,382.14,--Restricting new investment by American nationals in that country.
1999.99-474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,386.675,415.028,"Oh, but isn't that kind of similar to what happened in the Hines v. Davidowitz case back in '41, when Pennsylvania had a law dealing with what resident aliens had to have to be in that State, and it was possible, certainly, for a resident alien to comply both with the Federal law and the State law, and yet that was stricken, wasn't it?"
1999.99-474,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,415.028,424.067,"--Yes, Your Honor, but we think that the key phrase from our point of view and Hines would be the reference to a complete scheme of regulations that was in issue there in Hines."
1999.99-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,466.143,475.749,"Well, think of California, with 30 million people, probably a major textbook buyer, probably buys a lot from Massachusetts."
1999.99-474,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,501.065,506.118,"Well, the Federal Government would be run by Congress stepping in in the event--"
1999.99-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,506.118,523.311,"No, no, I mean, the Federal... in other words, in your view, California could say, we will not buy any textbooks from Addison-Wesley for the reason that we don't like Massachusetts policies in respect to the environment, or we don't like their policy... they have no death penalty."
1999.99-474,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,524.346,527.031,"--The action's still proprietary, Your Honor."
1999.99-474,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,529.733,530.649,But your answer's yes.
1999.99-474,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,534.185,541.541,"--That's right, because of the safeguard included in the document to allow Congress to act in the event the national interest required."
1999.99-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,541.541,550.897,"I assume California could, under our decisions, decide to buy textbooks only from California manufacturers."
1999.99-474,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,552.78,554.365,"That's right, Your Honor."
1999.99-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,554.365,554.749,Yes.
1999.99-474,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,560.336,579.564,"Right, but the holdings of the Court regarding market participation say that whatever the effects of such a law, whatever the question of national interest or uniformity, the dormant Foreign Commerce Clause in that case is not displacing of that type of State choice."
1999.99-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,580.664,583.182,"Well, surely there's a difference in those two cases."
1999.99-474,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,594.038,595.371,That's right.
1999.99-474,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,595.371,598.054,So that's different from Justice Breyer's hypothetical.
1999.99-474,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,598.054,616.867,"It is different to the hypothetical, but the underlying point, of course, both as to the dormant Commerce Clause in the hypotheticals and the Foreign Commerce Clause that's at issue here, is that those dormant clauses don't reach a certain limited sphere of State activity in which the States can speak and act as they have here."
1999.99-474,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,618.484,630.794,Do you concede that there is a dormant Commerce Clause principle in the international area under the Foreign Commerce Clause?
1999.99-474,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,630.794,642.685,We concede that the Court has recognized in cases such as Barclays some foreign effect.
1999.99-474,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,662.146,700.604,"Mr. Barnico, you mentioned before that this case is different from Massachusetts, preferring itself as an economic actor, that here it is acting for reasons of foreign policy, and there's no doubt that Congress has the control power, but why shouldn't the assumption be that unless Congress says, States, you can do this, that States can't once Congress has occupied the field at least to the extent of having its own Burma law?"
1999.99-474,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,709.627,714.345,--I think this case shows why that presumption goes too far.
1999.99-474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,776.669,780.521,"Mr. Barnico, you mentioned the historical approach a few minutes ago."
1999.99-474,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,791.078,797.816,You'd have to go back under our research only to the revolutionary times.
1999.99-474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,802.351,803.586,Until the 1980's?
1999.99-474,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,803.586,805.286,--The eighties is what we have in mind.
1999.99-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,805.286,807.688,"Oh, but there were in the revolutionary times, weren't there?"
1999.99-474,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,807.688,808.54,"That's right, and they included--"
1999.99-474,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,808.54,816.027,"Virginia passed laws that prevented the collection of British debts, and there was litigation over that."
1999.99-474,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,816.027,822.848,"--And... but we have a different approach, though, as to the boycotts in particular."
1999.99-474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,828.352,833.071,"When you say revolutionary times, do you mean before the Constitution was adopted?"
1999.99-474,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,833.071,835.254,"--Absolutely, Your Honor, and before--"
1999.99-474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,835.254,842.26,"I mean, I don't know that that's a terribly satisfactory basis for analyzing the thing after the Constitution was adopted."
1999.99-474,0,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,842.26,865.44,"--Well, it goes to the intent of the Framers in adopting the foreign affairs clauses, Your Honor, and the question would be, since the Framers enumerated a number of prohibitions regarding treaties and engaging in war and so forth, we'd have to ask ourselves the question, do the affirmative grants of power to the executive and legislative branches in the Constitution have a nullifying force implied?"
1999.99-474,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,892.443,893.143,Mr. Barnico--
1999.99-474,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,893.143,899.697,"--If you're right, Mr. Barnico, why were there... have there been no Barnic... no boycotts--"
1999.99-474,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1559.217,1562.001,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-474,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1618.672,1618.988,Well--
1999.99-474,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1618.988,1619.155,--May I ask--
1999.99-474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1619.155,1629.896,"--without enacting something with the purpose, can it just spend its money the way it wants and buy from the suppliers that it wants?"
1999.99-474,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1629.896,1637.4,"--Well, Justice O'Connor, I assume that that question is is it compelled to do business with Myanmar if it's not attempting to--"
1999.99-474,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1637.4,1637.586,Right.
1999.99-474,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1637.586,1639.052,--communicate a foreign policy?
1999.99-474,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1649.124,1650.624,"Mr. Dyk... oh, excuse me."
1999.99-474,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1663.098,1665.65,"--Justice Stevens, I think it would be the same thing."
1999.99-474,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1666.836,1671.203,"--And what if the motivation was, for example, disaster in a particular country?"
1999.99-474,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1680.743,1682.178,--I think it could do that.
1999.99-474,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1689.015,1691.634,It all depends on trying to influence their policies?
1999.99-474,1,42609,timothy_b_dyk,,1692.534,1701.49,"Trying to influence it and attaching consequences to it, in the sense that they're using one of the tools of foreign policy."
1999.99-474,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1701.49,1712.047,"Do we have to undertake this subjective inquiry in every case, what was the purpose of... let's assume a State has a law against bigamy, and the king of some Muslim country is visiting the United States."
1999.99-474,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2774.532,2785.054,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-474,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2944.626,2945.109,General Waxman--
1999.99-474,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2945.109,2952.03,"--The question is whether they were trying to avoid it by giving Congress the power to prevent it, which everybody concedes they have here."
1999.99-474,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2968.824,2972.693,"--Well, General Waxman, Congress has passed a law, hasn't it?"
1999.99-474,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2972.693,2980.049,"Indeed it has passed a law, and I guess rather than choosing favorites I'll try and--"
1999.99-474,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2980.049,2981.965,Is there preemption?
1999.99-474,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,2981.965,3000.277,"--We think that there is preemption under the Hines-Boyle international paper articulation because, as I was starting to suggest, the Federal law... the Massachusetts act stands as an obstacle to... I'm quoting now from many, many opinions of this court."
1999.99-474,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3131.891,3139.997,"No, but the answer to that, it seemed to me... Mr. Dyk made the same point... couldn't they pass a general statute making into positive law the very position you're asserting here today?"
1999.99-474,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3139.997,3144.549,"--Yes, I think they could."
1999.99-474,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3150.353,3151.805,Will you state... what I'm suggesting is--
1999.99-474,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3151.805,3152.388,--but they... if I can just--
1999.99-474,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3152.388,3158.459,--that the constitutional rule that you advocate today could be enacted by Congress as a statute.
1999.99-474,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3158.459,3161.994,--Yes.
1999.99-474,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3389.771,3390.39,"Thank you, General Waxman."
1999.99-474,2,42213,seth_p_waxman,,3390.39,3390.923,Thank you.
1999.99-474,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3390.923,3394.009,"Mr. Barnico, you have 4 minutes remaining."
1999.99-474,3,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,3394.009,3397.811,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1999.99-474,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3449.244,3468.407,"Mr. Barnico, are you suggesting that times have changed so that the national unit is no longer responsible under international law for its subunits, that the rest of the world will target their retaliation to Massachusetts, and the rest of the United States will remain unaffected?"
1999.99-474,3,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,3470.007,3487.035,"--I'm suggesting, Your Honor, that as the... if the focus is on the effects of our law, the Court should not give great weight to the fact that foreign countries have objected to the Massachusetts law under a trade agreement that's been ratified by Congress."
1999.99-474,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3498.274,3528.695,"That's what I thought perhaps... I thought maybe you agree on this, I'm not sure, that whatever it requires, we should treat the Foreign Commerce Clause the same as the dormant Commerce Clause vis-a-vis States and if, in fact, they could do this vis... give us a... you'd have a regular body of law, we'd know how to apply it, and what the... what Massachusetts could do vis-a-vis Texas, it can do vis-a-vis Austria, et cetera, at least for purposes of this case."
1999.99-474,3,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,3529.512,3540.336,"Yes, Your Honor, and that means... that's why we urge the Court, under both of those constitutional provisions, to recognize what we've described as a market participation exception."
1999.99-474,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3562.499,3579.025,"Of course, what I'm thinking of is a kind of nightmare, where all the right-to-work States pass laws stopping procurement in the unionized States, and all the unionized States pass laws trying to stop procurement in the right-to-work States, and that's... that kind of, sort of chaos is what's worrying me under the dormant Commerce Clause."
1999.99-474,3,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,3579.025,3582.794,"Well, those questions will remain for Congress."
1999.99-474,3,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3618.317,3624.989,"Mr. Barnico, you said there's comity among the States and there's not comity with Burma, but it isn't Burma."
1999.99-474,3,42461,thomas_a_barnico,,3642.284,3650.955,"I acknowledge that, Your Honor, and I point to the '94 law and the GATT simply to say that this will be common in our view."
