1983.82-1608,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,13.4,We will hear arguments next in South-Central Timber Development against LeResche.
1983.82-1608,0,34336,leroy_eugene_deveaux,,17.942,21.444,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.82-1608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,391.389,393.65,"Well, that's true, isn't it?"
1983.82-1608,0,34336,leroy_eugene_deveaux,,399.043,399.423,"Yes, it does."
1983.82-1608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,436.149,443.743,How much more could Alaska get for its timber sales if it didn't have the in-state processing requirement?
1983.82-1608,0,34336,leroy_eugene_deveaux,,443.743,469.36,"In the state's brief, in its appendix, pages... I believe it's page A-8... when later looking to sell the same timber the state forester, the state expert in this area, states in numbered paragraph 3:"
1983.82-1608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,512.788,524.406,Could Alaska sell its timber without the requirement and turn around and use the extra money to somehow subsidize in-state processing?
1983.82-1608,0,34336,leroy_eugene_deveaux,,524.406,527.669,I think they somehow could do that.
1983.82-1608,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,527.669,530.23,"Well then, why can't they do it this way?"
1983.82-1608,0,34336,leroy_eugene_deveaux,,530.23,545.04,Because to encourage in-state processing rather than discouraging business from exporting logs in the round are entirely different matters.
1983.82-1608,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1205.722,1209.015,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
1983.82-1608,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1227.288,1237.852,"If the Court were to resolve this case on the market participation theory, then the Federal Government takes no position on that?"
1983.82-1608,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1237.852,1239.574,"--No, that's not correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1608,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1345.654,1349.247,"Ms. Oberly, why can't we rely on counsel to do that combing for us?"
1983.82-1608,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1350.887,1356.113,"No one found it in this case, Your Honor, for one thing."
1983.82-1608,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1368.859,1374.242,"No, but conceptually is there anything different about an implicit approval theory and an implied cause of action theory?"
1983.82-1608,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1386.671,1396.739,There are many cases where the Court has to figure out what Congress had in mind when it hasn't spoken as clearly as it might have.
1983.82-1608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1410.846,1413.428,"Clearly and expressly don't really mean the same thing, do they?"
1983.82-1608,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1413.428,1415.859,"I meant them to mean the same thing, Your Honor."
1983.82-1608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1423.055,1425.917,"Well, if it's implicit enough or clear enough you call it express."
1983.82-1608,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1425.917,1433.381,"--Twice last term, Your Honor, the Court actually required express Congressional consent."
1983.82-1608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1463.922,1481.233,Would you say it's express if Congress said that a requirement that logs owned by a state be processed before they're shipped out of the state shall not be considered to be a burden on commerce?
1983.82-1608,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1481.233,1483.424,That would clearly be express.
1983.82-1608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1483.424,1484.665,"Well, that's not an approval of a burden."
1983.82-1608,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1484.665,1492.739,It's express sanction for the state to do--
1983.82-1608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1492.739,1493.45,"No, it's not."
1983.82-1608,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1497.063,1498.062,--That's correct.
1983.82-1608,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1500.544,1502.146,"Well, what if the Court says it's a burden?"
1983.82-1608,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1502.146,1512.242,"--When Congress has spoken, it's Congress' judgment as to whether it wishes to permit that burden under the commerce clause."
1983.82-1608,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1554.15,1565.138,"Why does the Federal Government impose the restraint, the very restraint you're talking about, on timber exported from Alaska?"
1983.82-1608,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1565.138,1576.235,"The federal policy began in 1928, when the United States ran Alaska as a territory, and essentially its origins are for the same reasons that Alaska now wants to have the same requirement."
1983.82-1608,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1576.235,1584.76,"Well, was it to encourage the local industry or to see to it that the Federal Government had local processing for its own needs?"
1983.82-1608,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1585.481,1602.331,"In 1928 it was both, because in our capacity... in the United States' capacity as running Alaska as a territory, it had a legitimate concern in encouraging local employment, as well as providing sufficient timber processing capacity for federal timber."
1983.82-1608,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1602.331,1603.751,And what is it now?
1983.82-1608,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1603.751,1617.372,"Today the policy applies to all of the states west of the hundredth meridian, including Alaska, although in Alaska it's by regulation and in the other lower 48 states it's by statute."
1983.82-1608,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1821.235,1822.875,And still remains silent.
1983.82-1608,1,33933,kathryn_a_oberly,,1822.875,1824.438,And still remains silent.
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,1860.509,1863.661,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1988.063,2007.367,"Do you think that kind of... that consent which you say Congress gave would cover an Alaska statute that related not only to state-owned timber, but to privately owned timber?"
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2007.367,2009.228,"--No, Your Honor, I certainly would not take that position."
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2013.802,2015.552,You think that's the limit of the consent?
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2015.552,2017.422,"I think so, yes."
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2017.422,2030.342,"And that if Alaska attempted to require that privately owned timber be processed before it was exported, you think that would be a burden on commerce that would be illegal?"
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2030.342,2033.003,There would certainly be an argument that there is a burden.
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2081.155,2085.587,"When does... how does Alaska sell its timber, do you know?"
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2085.587,2088.589,At a request for bids.
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2088.589,2097.444,"And they take the highest bidder, and when does title pass, or when is the sale complete, do you know?"
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2097.444,2102.938,"Well, the sale and title are two different... the sale is complete at the time the contract is signed."
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2102.938,2104.099,"Well, I'll take the answer to both of them."
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2104.099,2107.031,The sale is complete at the time the contract is signed.
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2110.845,2113.255,When is payment made?
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2113.255,2119.15,--Payment is made after they are cut and cleaned and I believe removed.
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2119.15,2132.948,"But the buyer, then, who then has the timber, who's cut the timber and owns the timber, then can't do anything with them unless he processes them first?"
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2137.492,2138.771,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2401.863,2417.875,"Mr. Attorney General, do you think that a lot of this timber that is sold by the state from its own forests would be exported without processing except for this law?"
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2417.875,2421.479,"I'm quite sure that would be the case, Your Honor, yes."
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2421.479,2424.557,What kind of processing are you talking about?
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2424.557,2442.74,"The processing... in most cases, we're talking about either reducing the logs to pulp for processing as pulp or we are talking about reducing it into large slabs of wood, usually four-sided, which are referred to as cants and are usually somewhere in the area of 10 to 15 feet long."
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2442.74,2446.714,"And are those in turn used for pulp, making pump?"
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2446.714,2447.194,No.
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2452.618,2463.884,"And how... if timber would be exported without processing except for this law, how would it be exported?"
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2465.226,2469.988,"It would be exported on ships and most of it would likely go to Japan, that's correct."
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2469.988,2474.122,And even if it had been made into pulp?
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2474.122,2479.015,If it had been made into pulp... there are two pulp plants in southeast Alaska.
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2488.531,2495.514,So that to the extent that it's made into pulp it would probably be processed in Alaska anyway.
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2495.514,2496.375,That's correct.
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2496.375,2499.928,Just because of the economics.
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2499.928,2500.579,That's correct.
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2504.91,2505.891,"Right, right, right."
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2527.177,2531.168,"Your Honor, I don't actually know what the facts are."
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2535.832,2540.134,"Well then, why would anybody ever want to ship logs?"
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2545.356,2550.241,"Well, it's the efficiency of the processing process itself, not the transportation."
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2550.241,2561.128,"Well, I know, but all you're telling me is that even without this law it would be more efficient to process the logs into cants in Alaska than to ship logs."
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2561.128,2564.531,"Well, to process them into cants, yes."
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2569.475,2571.666,"No, no, I'm not."
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2586.124,2593.178,"--Well, South-Central is upset because they don't have a processing facility in the state and therefore would not have been able to bid on this contract."
1983.82-1608,2,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,2593.178,2600.113,"Alaska could get a lot more money, though, if it sold them without that requirement."
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2600.113,2603.396,"On a purely financial return that is correct, yes."
1983.82-1608,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2603.396,2612.833,Are any of them floated down on the inland waterway to Canadian destinations?
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2612.833,2616.974,"I don't believe any go to Canada, but I have--"
1983.82-1608,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2616.974,2620.627,"You could float them down to Canada, couldn't they, with tugs?"
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2620.627,2628.04,"--I understand that some are barged every now and then to the northwestern Washington area, but not to Canada."
1983.82-1608,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2630.163,2636.986,"General, may I ask this question: What market is Alaska participating in?"
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2636.986,2640.289,Well--
1983.82-1608,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2640.289,2643.632,You say Alaska is a market participant.
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2646.273,2649.646,--There are various ways to describe the market.
1983.82-1608,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2652.918,2657.57,Does Alaska process timber?
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2661.203,2664.765,"Alaska does not own any manufacturing facilities, no, Your Honor."
1983.82-1608,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2664.765,2667.978,Does it process the logs after they're cut?
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2667.978,2668.609,No.
1983.82-1608,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2673.461,2675.494,But you have no participation in the processing?
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2675.494,2677.084,At this time we do not.
1983.82-1608,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2677.084,2681.518,You don't have an interest in the logs when they're processed.
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2681.518,2685.379,"Under the terms of the contract as presently written, that's correct."
1983.82-1608,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2691.873,2693.886,How far down the line would the processing go?
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2706.743,2714.75,"To the extent that we could enforce that requirement as a result of privity, I believe yes, it would be valid."
1983.82-1608,2,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2727.44,2737.294,"But in terms of theory, there's no limit to your argument with respect to market participant, is there?"
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2752.854,2755.396,"Your Honor, I'm sure there would be some limit."
1983.82-1608,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2770.876,2774.198,What if the limit was just debarking under water pressure?
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2778.68,2781.893,"--Not under the state's processing requirements, Your Honor, no, it would not be."
1983.82-1608,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2781.893,2782.694,No.
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2795.311,2797.284,We certainly would take that position.
1983.82-1608,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2798.376,2807.189,"Well then, how far down to what Justice Powell was addressing, to the making of chairs and tables?"
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2807.189,2812.334,"Well, I think again the limit becomes one of how the transaction was structured."
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2838.26,2852.168,Do you think your argument is any different than an argument... maybe you're making this argument... the state could just refuse to sell any logs except to Alaska processors?
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2852.168,2857.681,"Certainly, Your Honor, we could refuse to sell logs at all, and I think we could certainly refuse to sell--"
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2857.681,2859.614,They just pick and choose their customers.
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2872.341,2874.755,--I think we could do that as long as they're our logs.
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2877.567,2881.17,You just take bids from people who are Alaska processors.
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2881.17,2881.888,That's correct.
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2881.888,2890.023,"And you don't have any contract at all that requires it to be done, but you just sell to Alaska processors, that's all."
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2895.937,2900.651,"I certainly would, depending on your definition of Alaska processor."
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2908.005,2911.939,"Well, I'm talking about somebody who has a processing establishment in the state."
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2911.939,2913.05,"Yes, I think in that case we could do it."
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2913.05,2915.942,Whether he's an Alaska corporation or not.
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,2915.942,2917.942,I think in that case we could do it.
1983.82-1608,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3266.681,3271.035,"General Lorensen, may I just ask this question on your market participant theory."
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,3282.062,3287.536,"As a result of the nature of the transaction, I think that is correct, Your Honor, yes."
1983.82-1608,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3287.536,3297.713,"Are there any cases... are there any other market participant cases in which the purchaser is not free, having bought it from the state, to do anything he wants?"
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,3306.749,3309.361,"There may be a distinction, but I don't think it's important."
1983.82-1608,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3340.9,3343.473,"White, the city is the purchaser."
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,3345.475,3346.453,"That's correct, but I'm not sure--"
1983.82-1608,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3346.453,3352.247,"And after the city acquires the building or whatever's being built, that's the end of the transaction."
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,3352.247,3353.869,--That's certainly correct.
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3353.869,3358.952,"Nobody can comply with your requirement who doesn't have a processing plant there, can he?"
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,3358.952,3364.916,"That's not correct, Your Honor, because that function could certainly be subcontracted out to an existing processor."
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3364.916,3373.442,So you really are doing more than just refusing to sell to anybody except with a processing plant.
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,3382.047,3384.891,We put potential purchasers on notice at the time of the sale--
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3384.891,3390.214,So you are doing more than just choosing people.
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,3395.577,3397.027,--We don't choose the customer at all.
1983.82-1608,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3399.581,3401.491,So you are doing much more.
1983.82-1608,2,39747,ronald_w_lorensen,,3401.491,3412.328,"The distinction which has been proposed between manufactured goods and natural resources is illogical, we believe, and analytically unsound."
1983.82-1608,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3754.371,3756.512,Do you have anything further?
1983.82-1608,3,34336,leroy_eugene_deveaux,,3758.835,3762.658,"I hope not to even use them, Your Honor."
1983.82-1608,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3762.658,3778.787,What about the legality of Alaska just choosing to sell its timber only to processing plants that are located in Alaska?
1983.82-1608,3,34336,leroy_eugene_deveaux,,3778.787,3783.58,"Well, Your Honor, I think that we come back to the same thing."
1983.82-1608,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3791.195,3792.525,"Well, that's something more."
1983.82-1608,3,34336,leroy_eugene_deveaux,,3804.183,3808.677,--You're saying a simple refusal to deal kind of situation?
1983.82-1608,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3808.677,3809.646,"Yes, yes."
1983.82-1608,3,34336,leroy_eugene_deveaux,,3809.646,3812.778,The Court has--
1983.82-1608,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3812.778,3814.12,That isn't what they're doing.
1983.82-1608,3,34336,leroy_eugene_deveaux,,3815.192,3816.582,--That's right.
1983.82-1608,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3816.582,3823.167,"They're saying, even if we accept a bid... whoever we accept a bid from, we require them to get the processing done in Alaska."
1983.82-1608,3,34336,leroy_eugene_deveaux,,3823.167,3823.788,Right.
1983.82-1608,3,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3892.641,3905.27,"Well, if the state took that risk, but nevertheless just chose to sell to people who have processing plants in Alaska, you wouldn't find much of a problem with that, would you?"
1983.82-1608,3,34336,leroy_eugene_deveaux,,3905.27,3911.393,"No, I think that's a very much closer question and certainly would be more difficult to deal with."
1983.82-1608,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3913.143,3921.29,"That's the same distinction we make in the vertical price-fixing cases under the antitrust laws, the Colgate case on the one hand and Dr. Miles on the other, isn't it?"
1983.82-1608,3,34336,leroy_eugene_deveaux,,3927.515,3930.317,"Yes, that is like the--"
1983.82-1608,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3930.317,3931.546,That's certainly a distinction that's--
1983.82-1608,3,34336,leroy_eugene_deveaux,,3931.546,3944.135,"--The place for commerce and the antitrust laws to get together is not to stop competition, is to allow competition, and I think the refusal to deal is a much more difficult question to deal with."
1983.82-1608,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3976.497,3977.509,"Thank you, gentlemen."
