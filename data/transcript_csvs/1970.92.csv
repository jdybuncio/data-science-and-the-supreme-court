1970.92,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,51.505,"We'll hear arguments in Whitcomb against Chavis, number 92."
1970.92,0,46431,william_f_thompson,,55.651,68.946,"Thank you, Your Honor."
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,1902.222,1907.176,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court."
1970.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1937.604,1939.069,Marion County and in Lake County?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,1939.069,1948.203,"In Marion -- no, plaintiffs from Marion and Lake County, but seeking only the single member districting of Marion County, Indiana."
1970.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1957.803,1960.647,What's the biggest city in Marion County?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,1960.647,1961.159,Pardon me?
1970.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1961.159,1961.935,What is the city --
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,1961.935,1963.345,"Indianapolis, Indiana."
1970.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1963.345,1965.569,What is city in the Lake County?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,1965.569,1968.912,"Gary and Hammond, Indiana."
1970.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1968.912,1971.532,And both had a multi-member districts to them?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,1971.532,1973.981,There were numerous multi-member districts in Indiana --
1970.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1973.981,1974.34,"Yes, including those two counties?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,1974.34,1976.265,Both of those were the largest two.
1970.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1976.265,1977.607,Yes.
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,1977.607,1983.896,"Immediately after the complaint was filed, request for admissions 118 in number were filed."
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2078.178,2083.105,I don't see that -- overall that is the forgetting the single multi-member --
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2083.105,2085.159,Completely forgetting the single multi-member district --
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2085.159,2094.73,This was only the more representatives from Marion County than they were entitled to on the basis of proper --
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2094.73,2097.997,There were more Senators from Marion County than they were entitled to --
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2097.997,2099.463,Well legislatives are sometimes --
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2099.463,2105.608,"And exactly the right amount of representatives, they were -- they had one half of this full Senate too much."
1970.92,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2127.757,2139.199,"If this lawsuit had not been pending, what would -- impact would the 1970 census have had on the State of Indiana in the apportionment problem?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2139.199,2143.895,"The normal impact, they would now be preparing to reapportion as they are."
1970.92,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2144.522,2151.892,"When did the court decide that it should have this accelerated reapportionment, what was the date?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2151.892,2163.528,"The Court's stay order in this cause has now made the state-wide mal-apportionment of Indiana, no longer matter of consequence, since Indiana will be reapportioned before there is another election."
1970.92,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2163.528,2165.272,You're speaking of this Court's stay order?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2165.272,2166.007,Yes.
1970.92,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2166.007,2168.044,I am speaking of the District Court.
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2179.105,2180.476,To begin a new reapportionment?
1970.92,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2189.543,2193.196,So at any rate they were quite close to --
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2193.196,2199.9,"Yes, there was only more election to be held before there would be a reapportionment, or a attempted reapportionment in normal course."
1970.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2218.108,2227.536,"Mr. Manahan, in the posture that this case now presents itself to us, I was wondering why it hadn't become moot?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2237.247,2237.795,"Yes, it was Your Honor."
1970.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2237.795,2248.655,And like you just told us that in the early next year there is going to be and will be a reapportionment based on the 1970 census?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2248.655,2250.785,"Early next year there is scheduled to be, an attempt for --"
1970.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2250.785,2265.217,"As we know general elections in Indiana I guess till -- until that has become effective, so this thing is just in limbo, and has no applicability to any elections, has it?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2271.794,2275.133,The court's plan would not conceivably ever apply to any election.
1970.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2275.133,2277.936,"Any election, so why isn't this moot?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2277.936,2289.783,"The court, the lower court has stated that there will be -- that the Marion County, Indiana must be sub-districted to have constitutional plan."
1970.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2292.134,2293.283,Court didn't need to state that.
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2298.751,2307.241,"Yes, but sub-districting, Your Honor and sub-districting is not allowable under the Indiana constitution except under the Supremacy Clause."
1970.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2328.299,2346.771,"I see so that the significance of this this three-judge District Court decision is that if it is affirmed or remains undisturbed, the Indiana legislature will be obligated not to create any multi-member districts."
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2346.771,2349.388,"They can create all the multi-members, definitely."
1970.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2370.247,2373.833,"Well, then why isn't this moot?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2375.949,2391.332,"The lower court says there must be uniform districting and there is anything but uniform districts in Indiana and it says, they must be small enough such that the vote of the ghetto area which they found to, just as a fact, would not be diluted or canceled out."
1970.92,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2391.332,2398.036,"Well you mean by that, that in such districts they must have single representatives?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2398.036,2398.964,Not single.
1970.92,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2405.109,2406.855,I want to see how far this goes.
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2450.744,2451.756,"No, Your Honor."
1970.92,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2451.756,2453.339,And what's it's based --
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2453.339,2453.913,"Well, the difference --"
1970.92,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2453.913,2455.594,-- distinguish that from there --
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2455.594,2457.438,"Your Honor we didn't -- well, greatly we have a difference."
1970.92,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2512.046,2517.372,Does the smaller district -- is the smaller district drawn to identify a particular group?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2517.372,2518.351,Absolutely not.
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2555.324,2562.769,"Well is that to say that what you have just been showing us in those squares, there may or may not be multi-member representatives --"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2562.769,2564.039,No.
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2566.559,2572.262,"Well, does it permit or not multi-member representation in those squares?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2572.262,2575.137,"Oh, these squares happen to be single-member districts, 15-single member --"
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2575.137,2577.115,"They must all be singles, is that it?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2577.115,2586.66,"Well this was not the court's original decision, this was the court's final order, after the State of Indiana reduced the district, these are districts which the court drew."
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2586.66,2593.214,"Then, at presently under this judgment, in Marion County, they are all single-membered districts, are they?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2593.214,2595.998,"The court drew nothing, but the single-member districts throughout the state."
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2595.998,2599.549,"Which is to say, under the court's plan they would have to be single-membered districts?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2599.549,2600.085,Under the court drawn plan --
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2600.085,2605.593,"And the only reason that wasn't effective for the last November election is our stay, is that right?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2605.593,2606.416,That's right.
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2606.416,2623.134,Now what is there about the court's judgment setting up single-member districts in Marion county under that claim which means that the legislature may not setup multi-member districts in Marion county in the 1970 reapportionment?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2626.111,2628.829,Only they are taking continuing jurisdiction.
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2628.829,2632.083,I know but wouldn't there have to be a brand new case?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2647.226,2648.462,That was the only theory.
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2648.462,2649.702,"That was the only theory, alright."
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2654.221,2655.846,"Well, we got the ruling."
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2655.846,2683.326,"So I mean, and now you’ve got a lot more I guess than you’ve asked for, but the point is, and what I am trying to get to, what is there about that determination as it related to the 1960 and 1965 figures to try the case which means that there is any obstacle whatever that a Indiana legislature reapportioning under a plan precisely like that one which in this instance for Marion County at least, the District Court struck down."
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2683.326,2684.371,You mean multi-member districting is different?
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2684.371,2686.681,That's right.
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2686.681,2694.621,"Simply the court's declaratory judgment in effect, that such districts do have an invidious affect and do dilute the vote --"
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2694.621,2699.087,"In other words, it's not the factual record, it’s the Banzhaf theory, is that it?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2699.087,2707.265,"No, this is the court's finding specially that, the multi-member districting of Marion County has an invidious effect which dilutes vote."
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2707.265,2709.24,"Did at that time, at the time of the trial?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2709.24,2710.262,"At the time of the trial, yes."
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2710.262,2716.381,Well who is to know that will be so under the new -- under the reapportionment based on the 1970 census?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2716.381,2724.406,"The likelihood of any -- they carried beyond, find their findings beyond the 1960 census in their decision."
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2731.376,2739.751,But isn't there a whole new ball game on reapportionment in Indiana and every other state based on the 1970 census?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2739.751,2744.877,On the matter of a minority group existing within a county where we have statistics as late as 1967 --
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2744.877,2745.797,You say not?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2745.797,2746.699,I would say not.
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2746.699,2747.163,I see.
1970.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2747.163,2760.792,"Well, would anybody be violating any court injunction if it -- if he enforced or he passed or enforced a multi-member districting system in Marion county under the new census?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2760.792,2763.902,It would not.
1970.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2763.902,2775.875,"So you are just saying that in the face of this judgment, in the face of this decision legislators just won't establish a multi-member district in Marion county?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2775.875,2789.438,"I said they would not be violating an injunction if they establish a multi-member district in Marion county, and under the Indiana constitution without a judgment against them, they will have to have a multi-member senate district in Marion County, Indiana."
1970.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2794.11,2795.689,Well how about in the House?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2795.689,2797.228,"Yes, they can."
1970.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2797.228,2805.611,Well will legislators or will they not feel bound by this decision not to establish a multi-member house district in Marion county?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2805.611,2816.382,"They will feel very much guided by this Court's decision and there is no decision and if the stay remains in effect and the lower court's opinion that's had no decision, they will take their chances on the multi-member district."
1970.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2816.382,2834.402,"Of course this Court's decision is that if this case has become moot, the consequence would be as I remember that we would vacate the judgment of the District Court, it would not be the end of it, isn't it?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2834.402,2835.412,That would be end of the case.
1970.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2835.412,2836.479,Then why isn't it moot?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2841.502,2880.86,"The District Court did render declaratory judgment to the effect that there is in Marion County, Indiana based on 1967 and a later statics a ghetto area with a minority group residing therein which has substantive interest which diverges significantly from those as a county as a whole and then in response to those interests engages in a vote in pattern, which diverges significantly from that as a county as a whole, and that the size of the county, the size of this multi-member district is so great that it dilutes and cancels out that significant vote by that there was a significant substantiative interest."
1970.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2894.753,2910.825,"Well, but it may that finding only in connection with the complaint that asked for relief by way of reapportionment at least of Marion County, looking toward elections that have now taken place."
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2910.825,2911.328,And hopefully toward --
1970.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2911.328,2912.747,So why isn't it moot?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2912.747,2913.977,-- and towards all future elections.
1970.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2913.977,2914.651,Well no.
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2928.041,2928.78,Yes and --
1970.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2928.78,2929.978,-- for all of your election.
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2929.978,2949.336,"And in Marion County, they are obligated either under the Indiana constitution to have a multi-member senate district in Marion County, Indiana or under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution and the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment to have smaller districts in both Houses in Marion County, Indiana."
1970.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2949.336,2954.185,I still don't understand your answer to my question?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2954.185,2964.535,"If this were a simple minor on reapportionment case, and the things that happened which have happened, the case would be totally moot."
1970.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2965.183,2971.813,And what distinguishes it from a minor on reapportionment case?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2971.813,2975.302,Because it is a redistricting case as opposed to a reapportionment case.
1970.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2990.997,2996.888,That configures that have now may become obsolete because of the 1970 census?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,2996.888,3000.052,They are based on figures as late as 1967.
1970.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3000.052,3004.056,"Well, that's not late, because we had 1970 census, is it?"
1970.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3004.056,3009.174,"Well, your point is without a federal decree back on the Indiana Constitution --"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3009.174,3009.757,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3009.757,3021.639,"Under the Indiana constitution, the evil would be difficult -- three-judge district court found to exist would be repeated."
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3021.639,3024.321,"It would have to be repeated, yes."
1970.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3024.321,3026.94,And only a federal decree can --
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3026.94,3027.685,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3027.685,3032.198,"Well, does that include the rest of the state?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3033.699,3047.93,"In the rest of the state, they would be allowed to break up no county for purposes of drawing senate seats under the Indiana constitution."
1970.92,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3047.93,3056.296,In other words what the federal decree does is to preserve the ground rules for the “one man-one vote” principle in this setting?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3056.296,3057.132,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3082.288,3090.295,"May I ask again Mr. Manahan, I gather under the Court's plan and say each of those sub-districts would have had, but one white senator."
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3090.295,3098.178,One representative and each of them was numbered 1 through 100 statewide and the odd numbers were paired with even numbers degree at senate seats.
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3098.178,3102.567,"And then in the senates case, there are what districts with multi with multi --"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3102.567,3104.423,"No, they are all one senator."
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3104.423,3104.853,All one senator.
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3104.853,3108.352,Consisting of two legislatives -- representative districts.
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3110.698,3112.806,"Well, forgive my confusion."
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3113.95,3114.862,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3114.862,3122.193,Now what under the court's plan is to be the representation in every instance a senatorial district has but one senator?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3122.193,3122.821,Right.
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3122.821,3126.213,"And every instance, what's your lower House called?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3126.213,3127.44,The House of Representatives.
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3127.44,3131.276,"And then the House of Representatives, every district has but one representative?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3131.276,3136.604,But one representative and every senatorial district is made up of two representatives.
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3136.604,3156.846,"Yes, but there is only one senator -- which means if we were to affirm what the district court did then is it your position that for the 1970 reapportionment, there could be no compliance whatever with the Indiana constitution provision for multi-member districts either in the House of Representatives or in the Senate?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3156.846,3161.462,"There are no requirements with respect to the House of Representatives, with respect to the Senate --"
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3161.462,3163.56,"Well, how about with the respect to the House of Representatives?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3170.206,3174.73,"There could be multi-member districts, but they would have to all be uniform throughout the states if you affirm."
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3174.73,3183.632,"By which you mean that -- it might be a number of multi-member districts if the multi-membership means two or three, they all have to be two or three in every district?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3183.632,3184.69,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3184.69,3186.612,"But, you can still have some single-member district?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3186.612,3187.509,No.
1970.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3187.509,3192.035,So you couldn't have any single-member district (Inaudible) multi-member districts?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3192.035,3193.901,"Yes, uniformly --"
1970.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3193.901,3205.915,The district court held that the only practical remedy for the unconstitutional deprivation that is found in Marion County was to create single-member districts in Marion County.
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3211.282,3212.656,"No, Your Honor."
1970.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3214.45,3215.84,I am just reading from the judgment.
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3215.84,3218.98,"Yes, but they were drawing up a plan."
1970.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3219.354,3221.654,"No, this was before he even drew a plan."
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3221.654,3225.047,I believe – on what page Your Honor?
1970.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3225.047,3228.395,On page 332.
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3258.054,3263.466,"Yes, but not necessarily replacing them with single membered districts."
1970.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3263.466,3266.373,Now what do you expect in the case?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3266.373,3272.509,"That this says that districts are two large, and they must be smaller."
1970.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3272.509,3276.869,And he goes on and says that there should be single-member districts.
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3276.869,3280.988,"No, in fact they even suggest three-man and two-man districts in this opinion."
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3280.988,3286.756,"And yet when they came to constructive plan of their own, it was all single-member."
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3286.756,3288.53,"There was a good reason for that, Your Honor."
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3291.473,3305.774,"It maybe a good reason, but the fact is you are suggesting that the holding was that if I get what you just said, the legislature is still free to construct multi-member districts so long as there are a smaller number of members in each district?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3305.774,3307.302,"Yes, and so long and the are uniform."
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3307.302,3308.914,Yes and throughout the state.
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3308.914,3309.604,Right.
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3309.604,3314.978,But when they came around however constructing their own plan and for Marion County?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3314.978,3317.559,"No, for the entire state, they did single-member districts."
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3317.559,3320.097,So single-member districts under the Court plan --
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3320.097,3320.873,"Is what they drew, yeah."
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3320.873,3323.149,And you say there is an explanation for that?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3323.149,3329.21,"Yes, they want to set up rules in advance so that different groups could participate for both plans."
1970.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3535.454,3543.92,Is there any claim in this -- either claim or finding in this case of racial discrimination as such?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3543.92,3544.173,No.
1970.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3568.832,3573.343,So there is not a claim or much let alone a finding of racial discrimination?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3573.343,3577.527,"We did the claim, but we did not present very substantial evidence and there was no finding."
1970.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3577.527,3581.226,"This isn't a Gomillion against Lightfoot kind of case, is it?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3581.226,3583.905,There was no Gomillion finding.
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3583.905,3589.129,"Now, I gather what you relied on was, I forgot, Forstson or Burns."
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3589.129,3590.542,"Yes, both cases of state --"
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3590.542,3592.498,Which said either decidedly or --
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3592.498,3593.111,Otherwise.
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3593.111,3595.088,"Or otherwise, having that effect, wasn't that it?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3595.088,3595.329,"Yes, Your Honor."
1970.92,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3595.329,3599.355,"And so you tried to prove decidedly but you didn't succeed, but it doesn't matter to you?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3599.355,3603.479,"No, we did prove the otherwise and we didn't try it very hard to prove --"
1970.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3603.479,3622.743,"It has been my impression that in the absence of rational discrimination as such, our cases have held that the sort of considerations that entered into the District Courts' decision were not only -- not required by the constitution, but that they were prohibited by the constitution."
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3648.692,3663.944,"No those cases say and Fortson v. Dorsey and Burns v. Richardson say what they say and we've brought this entire action based upon what those two majority opinions of this Court and almost anonymous opinion in one case said, and those are the two decisions we are specifically relying on."
1970.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3669.857,3676.465,If the poor blacks or the poor generally in Indianapolis was scattered evenly throughout the city you would have no case?
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3676.465,3678.057,That is correct.
1970.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3678.057,3683.786,Even though they would nevertheless have all the same interests that they now have.
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3685.768,3688.483,There would be no invidious effect because there would be no effect.
1970.92,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3690.512,3698.876,"Well, their other interest may not be affected, I mean, may not -- their interest wouldn't be any more effectively represented than they are now?"
1970.92,1,31643,james_manahan,,3698.876,3699.722,That is correct.
1970.92,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3709.638,3711.375,Your time is fully consumed.
1970.92,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3711.375,3721.321,"I would like to ask the state if I may Mr. Chief Justice his views on this question of mootness of this case, because I didn't find any such suggestion in your brief?"
1970.92,2,46431,william_f_thompson,,3721.321,3723.398,"Yes Your Honor, let me say this."
1970.92,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3750.531,3752.677,"There is going to another election under that act, is there?"
1970.92,2,46431,william_f_thompson,,3752.677,3754.316,I would not -- I wouldn't expect.
1970.92,2,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3754.316,3755.735,With or without this Court order?
1970.92,2,46431,william_f_thompson,,3755.735,3757.171,"I would not expect one, Your Honor."
