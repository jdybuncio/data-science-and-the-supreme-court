1966.254,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,14.949,"Number 254, Theodore Stovall, Petitioner, versus Wilfred Denno, Warden."
1966.254,0,34922,leon_b_polsky,,16.485,21.071,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,1492.424,1498.183,"Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court pleases."
1966.254,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1592.466,1596.655,"But one case, a lawyer -- his lawyer is present, the other case, he's not."
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,1598.242,1607.489,Mr. Justice Fortas I don't think the presence of the attorney whether in court or out of court gives rise to a constitutional question.
1966.254,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1607.489,1609.419,Well that's the problem.
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,1609.579,1609.805,And certain --
1966.254,1,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,1609.805,1613.347,"-- certain as you now sound, I'd be a happier man."
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,1613.347,1619.112,"And so would I, sir."
1966.254,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1910.928,1914.387,Don't you think that argument is a little strange (Voice Overlap)?
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,1914.387,1915.439,In what way Mr. Justice Black?
1966.254,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1915.439,1932.22,"To say that a lawyer, a man in jail, in custody unable to make bonds, but he's in custody of the officers of the law, that a lawyer could do him no good if he were present when they were interrogating him?"
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,1932.22,1941.135,"Sir, there is nowhere in the record that indicates that this defendant was interrogated in any way at this identification."
1966.254,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1941.135,1947.051,"Well, why do they take him out for any purpose whatever outside of this jail?"
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,1947.051,1948.062,May I respectfully say --
1966.254,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1948.062,1948.244,Do you --
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,1948.244,1948.382,-- I do not --
1966.254,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1948.382,1950.847,Do you think that a lawyer could do him no good?
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,1950.847,1956.478,"May I respectfully say that no legal assistance could be offered, yes sir."
1966.254,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1982.343,1982.657,The lawyer could've objected --
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,1982.657,1983.803,-- as to procedure.
1966.254,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1983.803,1986.375,The lawyer could've just knowing that.
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,1986.375,1987.623,"But, insofar as the case --"
1966.254,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,1987.623,2006.28,"Do you mean that when a man is put in jail, the officers of the law have a right which he has no chance to object to it, to take him anywhere they please, to have all investigations made in the absence of his attorney, and have him there alone."
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,2006.28,2029.523,"Where the defendant's health or safety is not put in jeopardy, where he is not interrogated to a point or to any point, where his presence is for the purpose of purely investigation, and his health and safety and body is fully protected, I can see no purpose for legal assistance of counsel insofar as the defendant --"
1966.254,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2029.523,2029.754,Why should you object --
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,2029.754,2030.652,-- is concerned.
1966.254,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2030.652,2035.099,-- to lawyers being there if they could do no good?
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,2035.099,2038.283,There is no objection to the lawyer being there Mr. Justice Black.
1966.254,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2038.283,2039.957,Did you notify his lawyer?
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,2039.957,2040.529,Pardon sir?
1966.254,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2040.529,2041.822,Did you notify his lawyer?
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,2041.822,2043.437,He had no lawyer sir.
1966.254,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2043.437,2044.709,He had no lawyer.
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,2044.709,2049.871,His arraignment was adjourned for the purposes of obtaining an attorney.
1966.254,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2060.577,2062.954,For the state had the power to do it.
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,2062.954,2063.688,Pardon sir?
1966.254,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2063.688,2067.291,The state had the power to do it because he was under arrest.
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,2069.303,2069.473,Yes sir.
1966.254,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2069.473,2072.583,-- could you have seized him on the street and taken him down for that purpose?
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,2072.583,2077.556,"No, I think he would have had to -- have been rearrested and as long as he was out on bond, I don't think we could have done that."
1966.254,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2077.556,2081.761,The only reason for being able to do it was that he was under arrest --
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,2081.761,2082.351,He was in custody--
1966.254,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2082.351,2085.327,-- awaiting a charge of murder.
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,2085.327,2100.816,"No more than -- if he -- if Mrs. Behrendt were able to come to the District Court where he was arraigned and make identification, I think this would have been proper or if he were out on the street and Mrs. Behrendt were physically able to do so, she could have made identification --"
1966.254,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2100.816,2100.84,(Inaudible)
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,2100.84,2102.365,"-- out on the street, if this however --"
1966.254,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2102.365,2104.817,"And he was -- he would, he wouldn't have helped with that."
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,2104.817,2106.048,Pardon sir?
1966.254,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2106.048,2111.885,He could not have been compelled to help if he just -- if she just happens to see him on the streets.
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,2111.885,2114.017,He could not have been compelled to help?
1966.254,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2114.017,2115.841,To help you do this.
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,2117.699,2119.25,That's correct sir.
1966.254,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2120.487,2125.53,"He helped you make out a case against himself, did he not?"
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,2125.53,2127.837,He helped us make a case against himself?
1966.254,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2136.432,2136.815,Although it gives the state --
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,2136.815,2137.92,-- of course it was a --
1966.254,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2137.92,2142.774,Although it gave the state much assistance what might have been vital to his conviction.
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,2142.774,2148.429,Yes and it also provided him an opportunity to be completely exonerated.
1966.254,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2170.378,2173.015,What point -- did they make him say anything?
1966.254,1,44256,william_cahn,,2173.015,2175.05,They made him say certain words.
1966.254,2,29992,justic_douglas,,2177.238,2183.513,Could he have been asked that at the trial to compel -- to speak at a trial?
1966.254,3,44256,william_cahn,,2183.513,2183.911,Yes sir.
1966.254,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2232.316,2238.107,I thought Schmerber made a distinction between the man's blood and the man's words.
1966.254,3,44256,william_cahn,,2238.107,2258.685,"As far as the words are concerned at no time where any of these words brought to the attention of the jury, it was clear and I think the record is clear and the counsel mentioned that these words were stated purely for the identification of the voice and in no way was the defendant interrogated."
1966.254,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2258.685,2274.41,"I know, but there's a difference in -- they can be words and words in -- with respect to identification where it stated that would suggest an identification in words stated that Ambrek could be neutral."
1966.254,3,44256,william_cahn,,2274.41,2292.469,"May I suggest Mr. Justice Fortas that it's the words he were forced to say were, I committed the crime and this method was brought before the attention of the jury, to what benefit or to what detriment would it have been to the defendant and those were not the words (Voice Overlap) --"
1966.254,3,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,2292.469,2309.691,"But I think, I think -- I think if a man were brought before Mrs. Behrendt handcuffed and he said to Mrs. Behrendt, I committed the crime that'd be a sort of a natural tendency on her part to say, ""Well, I guess you did""."
1966.254,3,44256,william_cahn,,2309.691,2312.432,"I can't argue with the -- Justice Fortas, on that."
1966.254,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2314.83,2315.053,"Well, Mr. Cahn --"
1966.254,3,44256,william_cahn,,2315.053,2316.32,-- tendency to so.
1966.254,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2316.373,2324.719,As to why you accept the suggestion my Brother Fortas as the Schmerber distinction is between taking blood and words.
1966.254,3,44256,william_cahn,,2329.718,2330.214,Well --
1966.254,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2330.214,2331.089,And difference is --
1966.254,3,44256,william_cahn,,2331.089,2334.257,"As I -- yes, I agree with you Mr. Justice Brennan."
1966.254,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2334.641,2338.515,I'm glad you do.
1966.254,3,44256,william_cahn,,2338.515,2342.789,The testimonial compulsion I believe that is set out in the Schmerber case relates to --
1966.254,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2342.789,2344.691,That's where the deal come -- communication --
1966.254,3,44256,william_cahn,,2344.691,2345.135,That's correct.
1966.254,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2345.135,2349.602,"-- which in some instance, I think Schmerber suggest it might not be in the form of words --"
1966.254,3,44256,william_cahn,,2349.602,2350.007,There are no questions --
1966.254,3,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2350.007,2353.548,"-- or in the form of a nod of the head or something else, isn't it?"
1966.254,3,44256,william_cahn,,2353.548,2363.873,"There is no question that if this defendant were interrogated rather than merely to ask to say words, there might have been a very definite violation."
1966.254,4,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2723.675,2726.266,Chief Justice may it please the Court.
1966.254,4,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2796.081,2799.077,Do you mean interrogate him in his office?
1966.254,4,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2799.077,2800.93,"In his office, in the police station --"
1966.254,4,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2800.93,2801.113,Yes.
1966.254,4,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2801.113,2802.931,-- in his own home.
1966.254,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2971.657,2988.305,"Mr. Uviller what -- with or without counsel at a lineup if the defendant says I -- just refuses to speak, somebody wants to get a voice identification and he says that he -- doesn't say a word, he just shakes his head."
1966.254,4,28282,h_richard_uviller,,2996.455,3002.193,"Yes, that is the unanswered question I believe Justice White in Schmerber."
1966.254,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3024.434,3025.826,It's the due process clauses --
1966.254,4,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3025.826,3028.177,"A due process question, a Rochin situation."
1966.254,4,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3028.177,3038.571,"But doesn't that tend to answer the question that you first put, and is it -- is there a role for counsel?"
1966.254,4,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3069.92,3072.17,That is really the nut of my point.
1966.254,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3086.913,3087.217,(Inaudible)
1966.254,4,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3087.217,3088.751,-- or statutory rights to do.
1966.254,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3088.751,3099.567,"But maybe with an -- proximate counsel to tell the defendant not to do something, that the police tell him to do, in which the defendant cannot be compelled to do."
1966.254,4,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3100.384,3102.596,But he has no right to refuse to do.
1966.254,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3103.752,3110.651,"Well, I did not understand that from your previous answer."
1966.254,4,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3110.651,3110.983,"Well, I --"
1966.254,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3110.983,3117.345,Why is the defendant compelled to give the police a voice test?
1966.254,4,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3127.556,3131.522,I think we have to be -- we have to -- the only way that this unanswerable question can possibly (Voice Overlap) --
1966.254,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3131.522,3133.669,I'm not sure it's unanswerable.
1966.254,4,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3133.669,3140.302,"Well, it was certainly unanswered in -- and was left to one side in Schmerber for all of these reasons which are different, very difficult question."
1966.254,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3172.161,3172.637,I see.
1966.254,4,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3172.637,3176.852,-- has the right to transform the question from one type into the other.
1966.254,4,15061,abe_fortas,scotus_justice,3176.852,3214.742,"I see the line that you are going, it is a very narrow line and perhaps there is a function for a counsel here, which is to tell the witness not to give the police a voice test or go beyond that and that the police say -- turned to Stovall here and had said to him, Stovall, to say Mrs. Behrendt or whatever the name is, I drop (Inaudible) on you, do you refuse to say it?"
1966.254,4,28282,h_richard_uviller,,3214.742,3217.816,Well my answer to that Justice Fortas would be this.
1966.254,5,34922,leon_b_polsky,,3522.093,3532.398,"Mr. Chief Justice, first I would like to answer a question asked by Mr. Justice Black concerning the powers of a sheriff in New York."
