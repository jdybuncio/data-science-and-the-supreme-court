2018.17-1011,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,8.48,"We'll hear argument next in Case 17-1011, Jam versus International Finance Corporation. Mr. Fisher."
2018.17-1011,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,8.48,55.76,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The IOIA gives international organizations ""the same immunity from suit as is enjoyed by foreign governments."" The plain text of this provision, coupled with the structure of the IOIA and the drafting history, make clear that the same immunity provision gives international organizations the same immunity that foreign governments are entitled to today under the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act. Starting with the text, my opponents do not dispute that, as a general rule, when a statutory provision refers to another body of law, especially, as here, in the present tense, that body of law is incorporated as of the moment of suit in any given case. And, indeed, they don't dispute --"
2018.17-1011,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,55.76,61.52,"So the -- the hornbooks that I looked up, I mean, going back forever, don't say quite that."
2018.17-1011,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,159.0,159.2,Okay.
2018.17-1011,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,159.2,160.24,-- or have I said it backwards?
2018.17-1011,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,160.24,160.48,"No, no, no."
2018.17-1011,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,160.48,161.44,Did I say it right?
2018.17-1011,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,161.44,164.8,"So I think you gave me two things and then one before it, which was the statutory text."
2018.17-1011,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,164.8,165.28,Yes.
2018.17-1011,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,165.6,168.0,"So let me start with the statutory text, Justice Breyer."
2018.17-1011,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,360.04,369.36,"What about -- the third was if we -- if we decide with you -- if we decide against you, see, that would mean there is sovereign immunity."
2018.17-1011,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,398.2,405.76,"Well, I'm going to turn back in a moment to the law and why that just can't fit within the law, but as to just the policy question you're asking me, even there --"
2018.17-1011,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,405.76,420.0,"Well, you can look -- the reason I ask policy questions is because the hornbook said, yes, apply it as of now as long as it's consistent with the purpose of the statute."
2018.17-1011,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,435.6,450.08,"So let me give you the practical answer and then the purpose answer. On the practical answer, organizations, especially if they want a headquarter here or are headquartered here, are fully able to -- to lobby Congress or the executive branch for special immunity."
2018.17-1011,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,539.2,573.64,"Can we go to that issue raised in part? The special immunity, I know, was even negotiated by the U.N., I think, in the 1990s, and OAS and others, but assume that we're in your regiment, and Justice Breyer made the assumption that if a lawsuit came to us now under your theory, and it was limited immunity, that the President or Congress could give immunity to the other side. I don't think so."
2018.17-1011,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,573.64,574.64,"No, it's the opposite."
2018.17-1011,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,574.64,575.16,The opposite.
2018.17-1011,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,580.36,580.72,Well --
2018.17-1011,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,580.72,580.96,Yeah.
2018.17-1011,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,580.96,586.4,"-- I think it -- it may or may not remain, Justice Sotomayor."
2018.17-1011,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,586.4,587.08,That's my --
2018.17-1011,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,587.08,597.0,"Certainly, we could -- we would say we can go forward on this suit because -- because there is no such law. If that law were passed, you'd have two questions."
2018.17-1011,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,738.64,741.2,"Mr. Fisher, if I can pick up on Justice Breyer's question."
2018.17-1011,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,764.4,764.88,Right.
2018.17-1011,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,764.88,781.04,"-- we wouldn't look at it the way it's been subsequently amended. We'd look at it as it was originally enacted in 1945. Why isn't that -- that idea pertinent here, you know, when we refer to a specific law, we don't take it to evolve over time?"
2018.17-1011,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,781.04,786.64,"So for two reasons, Justice Gorsuch, and one of them, if you'll forgive me, is going to be something you said in the Alan Contoe opinion."
2018.17-1011,0,62836,neil_gorsuch,scotus_justice,786.64,789.56,I was afraid of that. (Laughter.)
2018.17-1011,0,30283,jeffrey_l_fisher,,789.56,790.28,But for two reasons.
2018.17-1011,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,974.92,979.64,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Ellis."
2018.17-1011,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,979.64,985.12,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If I could, I'd just like to pick up right where my -- my friend left off."
2018.17-1011,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1051.08,1073.52,"Mr. Ellis, before you get to that, another part of the structure is this provision that deals with presidential authority, and that's essentially a roll-back authority of immunity. Doesn't that make a lot more sense, that provision, if you assume that Congress meant for there to be absolute immunity? In other words, the presidential authority is a one-way ratchet."
2018.17-1011,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1089.12,1089.44,Sure.
2018.17-1011,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1128.92,1130.04,But on that --
2018.17-1011,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1130.04,1131.32,-- than foreign governments receive.
2018.17-1011,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1131.32,1143.2,"But look, whatever other things it refers to, the provision allows the President to waive immunity, not to grant immunity."
2018.17-1011,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1154.56,1154.88,Sorry.
2018.17-1011,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1159.88,1161.76,It does allow them to be sued.
2018.17-1011,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1161.76,1162.24,Okay.
2018.17-1011,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1165.8,1166.48,All right.
2018.17-1011,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1169.84,1170.6,That's right.
2018.17-1011,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1170.6,1171.32,Okay.
2018.17-1011,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1174.84,1175.48,It does in a sense.
2018.17-1011,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1175.84,1188.96,"But the power to waive the immunity, at least in this section, amounts to nothing if they have no immunity because, for example, all they do is lend money."
2018.17-1011,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1188.96,1190.16,So -- so a couple --
2018.17-1011,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1190.16,1194.4,"That's -- that's -- and the other way, it seems to work itself out."
2018.17-1011,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1194.4,1194.88,Understood.
2018.17-1011,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1194.88,1194.96,Okay.
2018.17-1011,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1194.96,1195.96,"A couple responses to that, Your Honor."
2018.17-1011,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1195.96,1197.44,"That's the question, I think."
2018.17-1011,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1197.44,1198.64,Glad to be able to address that.
2018.17-1011,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1281.72,1289.12,Do you have -- do you have any idea about how many of these kinds of organizations are headquartered in the United States?
2018.17-1011,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1289.12,1291.96,I think the numbers are in the 20 to 30 range.
2018.17-1011,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1301.6,1303.04,That are commercial like this one?
2018.17-1011,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1303.04,1303.32,"No, no, no."
2018.17-1011,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1303.72,1305.2,We're -- everybody's assuming --
2018.17-1011,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1305.2,1305.44,Right.
2018.17-1011,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1305.44,1306.56,-- a floodgate.
2018.17-1011,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1306.56,1306.8,Sure.
2018.17-1011,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1307.24,1308.12,Including Justice Breyer.
2018.17-1011,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1308.12,1320.04,"-- there are a number of development banks, but even then, even -- even the development banks, even if you talk about the World Bank, it's not clear that those commercial activities are the sorts that the -- the FSIA captures with the commercial activity exception."
2018.17-1011,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1332.76,1346.92,"Well, I -- I have the IFC, the IMF, the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the African Development Bank, the International Development Association."
2018.17-1011,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1347.2,1347.24,Sure.
2018.17-1011,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1347.32,1348.96,-- I've got -- that's only half of them.
2018.17-1011,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1348.96,1351.6,That -- that's -- that -- I'm not sure what percentage that is.
2018.17-1011,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1353.56,1353.88,There are a lot.
2018.17-1011,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1353.88,1356.76,-- have their own immunity provision in the -- in their charter.
2018.17-1011,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1374.96,1375.4,But Mister --
2018.17-1011,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1375.4,1379.0,"We agreed to that and we said: But, hey, this is not our usual practice."
2018.17-1011,1,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,1381.88,1386.36,"Mr. Ellis, I -- I guess I'm not sure I -- I quite understood what you meant."
2018.17-1011,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1409.8,1410.16,No.
2018.17-1011,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1451.28,1451.96,But can you give me --
2018.17-1011,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1451.96,1452.84,Or a quasi-sovereign act.
2018.17-1011,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1452.84,1474.24,"-- anything to assure me? Because when I looked through this list, I thought that there were development banks like the World Bank, which is a pretty big deal, as well as in Asia, in Africa, we're trying to encourage development all over the world, and suddenly by removing the sovereign immunity because the plaintiff will claim this is a commercial activity."
2018.17-1011,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1474.24,1474.6,So -- so --
2018.17-1011,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1474.6,1475.72,And you're not denying it.
2018.17-1011,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1475.72,1476.52,And so --
2018.17-1011,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1476.52,1490.8,So what is the assurance that the government can give us that this isn't going to lead to a lot of lawsuits and this isn't going to interfere with perhaps activity that the United States traditionally has been very much in favor of?
2018.17-1011,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1490.8,1491.56,Absolutely.
2018.17-1011,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1523.28,1525.8,And they need to because?
2018.17-1011,1,62960,jonathan_ellis,,1525.8,1540.2,They need to because no one's going to enter into a financial transaction with them if they -- they know they can't sue if it -- if it goes south. The other thing -- I want to also focus the Court on the -- on the suits that we know are not going to go forward on the absolute immunity side.
2018.17-1011,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1567.04,1573.52,"Thank you, counsel. Mr. Verrilli."
2018.17-1011,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1573.52,1583.6,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The IOIA prescribes a standard of virtual absolute immunity that is fixed and not evolving."
2018.17-1011,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1621.76,1645.32,"So why didn't Congress say that the way it did in the other provisions of this Act? And if it intended that in no change, it could have said it and given the very exception it gave, which is that the President or the executive could reduce immunity, which was the standard at the time."
2018.17-1011,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1645.32,1648.4,So let me start with the basic question.
2018.17-1011,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1724.2,1749.72,"What about the argument that there wasn't an established meaning in -- what was it -- 1945, that it -- the -- the status of the immunity was in flux? It had been absolute, but then we were going over -- the State Department was advising the court whether immunity should be given in a particular case."
2018.17-1011,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,1749.72,1778.56,"There's a bit of a suggestion to that effect in the brief of the United States, Your Honor, but I would respectfully suggest that is not a fair characterization of where things stood in 1945 at all. It is true that some people within the State Department in 1945 thought that immunity should move to a more restrictive standard, but the Justice Department would not even advance that standard in this Court, at the request of the State Department, and this Court did not describe the immunity as being in flux."
2018.17-1011,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2007.52,2011.44,What commercial activities was the U.N. doing at that time?
2018.17-1011,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2011.44,2011.56,Well --
2018.17-1011,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,2011.56,2022.08,"I know today it's a very different organization, but it's not clear to me that there was much going on that was commercial at its initial stages."
2018.17-1011,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2022.08,2062.76,"I take that point, Your Honor, but what I would say in response is that there was a very great deal of sensitivity about the whole package of -- of immunities that were available to the U.N. and its diplomats and its -- and its workers. And there was concern all along from 1952 to 1970 that -- that -- where the executive was urging Congress to ratify the convention, but the only things ever mentioned were the diplomats -- immunities for diplomatic individuals. And then, when you get to 1970 and you actually look at the Senate report accompanying the ratification, this was not in our brief, but it's at page 31 of the brief of the -- of the scholars who filed the brief in support of us."
2018.17-1011,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2108.24,2118.2,"But even what you just said, Mr. Verrilli, it wasn't enacted to make sure that foreign organizations would get treated the same as foreign states. I mean, that's exactly what the language of the thing says."
2018.17-1011,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2118.2,2121.36,"Well, so I guess a couple of things about that."
2018.17-1011,2,15094,elena_kagan,scotus_justice,2155.08,2168.4,"Do you think it was -- you answered Justice Ginsburg's questions about how far we were from the Tate Letter in 1945, but do you think it was inconceivable to Congress that the common law of immunity would change?"
2018.17-1011,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2168.4,2199.52,"Well, I -- I -- I can't say that it would be inconceivable to anybody, but what I can say is if one looks at the debates surrounding the passage of the IOIA, is, once again, it's a dog that didn't bark. You can't find a single person anywhere saying anything remotely like the proposition that we need to adopt a standard that will evolve over time because we have a concern that foreign sovereign immunity law will evolve over time. That just was not any part of anybody's thinking at that time."
2018.17-1011,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2239.52,2251.56,"Is that -- is that -- the Russians at that time, '45 and so forth, were putting all these businesses into state entities."
2018.17-1011,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2281.92,2289.72,"So I don't -- respectfully, with respect to my friends on the other side, I don't think that's a fair characterization of the historical materials."
2018.17-1011,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2289.72,2295.08,That's the same -- the answer you gave to me is the answer you would give to Justice Breyer?
2018.17-1011,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2295.08,2295.44,Yes.
2018.17-1011,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2295.44,2296.24,Same question?
2018.17-1011,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2296.24,2296.44,Yes.
2018.17-1011,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2317.36,2317.68,"Okay, I got it."
2018.17-1011,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2317.68,2332.2,"-- my friends on the other side have made this argument that, well, our position would also require you to go back to the process of the State Department making an ad hoc case-by-case determination, but that's wrong too. And that's clear on the face of the statute that it's wrong."
2018.17-1011,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2463.44,2483.8,"How do you deal with the argument that we just heard, that we can compare 288a on the one hand, which -- which keeps the international organizations in tune with foreign sovereigns, and 288 -- was it b and d?"
2018.17-1011,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2483.8,2484.16,Yes.
2018.17-1011,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2638.88,2652.96,"If you don't mind, I'm afraid I'm about five minutes behind you here, but going -- going back to your point on 288f, you said it's there they're decoupling the international organizations and the foreign sovereigns."
2018.17-1011,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2673.88,2707.32,"Well, I -- well, the way I read it, Mr. Chief Justice, is what -- what they're doing there is saying even in a situation in which the United States concludes that it won't afford a foreign sovereign the full virtually absolute immunity because of reciprocity -- in other words, we're not getting it back from them -- even in that situation, an international organization of -- where those sovereigns are members will still receive the full level of immunity. And so I think what that tells us is that what Congress was trying to do in this statute overall was prescribe a fixed substantive standard, not a floating standard where the two things move in tandem."
2018.17-1011,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,2801.8,2812.68,"Well, what about the point that most of the concerns you have are going to be dealt with by the requirement of a nexus to activity in the United States as opposed to simply abroad, where the projects are funded?"
2018.17-1011,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2812.68,2812.88,Yes.
2018.17-1011,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2847.44,2849.04,-- I hope they're right.
2018.17-1011,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2852.04,2862.24,"Are the -- are the lending decisions, which may be fairly detailed and may include dozens of conditions, made within the United States?"
2018.17-1011,2,21656,donald_b_verrilli_jr,,2862.24,2864.6,"Well, yes, I think that's a big part of the problem and --"
2018.17-1011,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2864.6,2886.64,"Is -- is there -- are there lawsuits that could say that there was negligence in determining, in a different country, who the persons were or the conditions under which the money would be spent? Is that an American lawsuit, saying what you've done here is commit the act of negligence or failure to be a fiduciary here?"

And I appreciate the fact that it's, you know, to some extent dependent on the facts and particular allegations, but it would seem to me to require a lot more than simply the specific decisions."
