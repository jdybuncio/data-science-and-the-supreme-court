2009.08-645,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,6.746,"We'll hear argument next in Case 08-645, Abbott v. Abbott."
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,7.511,18.866,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Hague Convention exists to ensure that custody disputes are resolved by the courts of the country of habitual residence rather than through abduction."
2009.08-645,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,67.516,67.938,How many--
2009.08-645,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,67.938,79.605,"You would be on absolutely sound ground if this were a convention on the mutual recognition of jurisdiction and judgment, but it's not."
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,97.048,102.249,"Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and Mr. Abbott has a statutory ne exeat right as well."
2009.08-645,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,122.411,124.891,You're not relying on the order; you're just relying on the statute?
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,124.891,126.876,--We are relying just on the statute.
2009.08-645,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,126.876,134.871,"If that's so, imagine a well-educated American woman marries a man from a foreign country X."
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,194.642,200.81,"It would be a right of custody, Justice Breyer, that the convention doesn't look to the purpose."
2009.08-645,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,201.188,203.985,"Now -- now, of course, what I'm asking you with my example--"
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,203.985,204.531,--Yes.
2009.08-645,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,204.531,235.329,"--Is why interpret it that way, where all that you have is a rule of law that applies to everybody, even in the case I've tried to imagine, where to say it's a right of custody would ruin the life of the woman, would give the husband something which he should -- certainly shouldn't have in any moral term, it would seem, and she comes back to the United States and is forced to give her child back to whatever this country is."
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,244.244,244.997,Certainly.
2009.08-645,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,258.8,260.051,"Well, that's your conclusion."
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,272.561,272.904,--Certainly -- I mean--
2009.08-645,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,272.904,274.308,"There is an alternative, isn't there?"
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,274.308,275.088,--There is an alternative.
2009.08-645,0,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,275.603,276.913,For the woman to go to the Chilean court?
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,276.913,278.13,"--Exactly, Justice Sotomayor."
2009.08-645,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,292.079,292.297,"Well, suppose you -- suppose you have a--"
2009.08-645,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,292.297,292.937,That isn't my question.
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,292.937,293.42,Okay.
2009.08-645,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,293.42,303.758,"I'm trying to get at what the humane purpose would be, given your interpretation of the law in this kind of situation?"
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,303.758,317.94,"Well, the right to determine whether your child will remain in the country or go to another country is a very important right, and it's simply that that's the -- if that's the law that the -- that the country has decided to establish, the convention doesn't look to why that is."
2009.08-645,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,329.795,336.665,--But what if -- what if you'd have a country in which ne exeat orders are routinely imposed in every custody case?
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,341.915,344.676,"Well, that, again, simply reflects that country's judgment."
2009.08-645,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,344.676,346.754,"It seems -- excuse me,--"
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,346.754,347.41,Yes.
2009.08-645,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,347.41,348.1,--but I'll just finish my own question.
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,348.1,348.506,Yes.
2009.08-645,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,348.506,363.529,"It seems to me that what you are saying is that, in some countries, there -- there is a presumption that there is always custody in the party -- in both parties."
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,363.529,365.764,There may be a presumption.
2009.08-645,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,398.47,417.305,"What happens to the woman who, now she has abducted the child to Texas, and she says to the Texas court: If you send me back, I am going to be beaten by this man who has a history of being a batterer?"
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,417.305,422.32,"--Two things, please, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-645,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,434.642,459.241,"You are saying that the court -- the court that's asked to give effect to the convention is helpless, that it's automatic that if there is a custody right, the court in the state to which the child has been taken must order that the child be returned?"
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,459.241,461.88,"No -- no, Justice Ginsburg."
2009.08-645,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,477.28,487.308,"As long as you brought that up, I was just going to ask: Should -- if you prevail in this case, should there be a remand to see if that section applies?"
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,487.308,500.239,"Article 13(b) has not previously been raised in this case, but in any event, regardless, if this Court were to rule in our favor, then the appropriate course would be to remand for resolution of any remaining issues, yes, Justice Kennedy."
2009.08-645,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,500.239,505.66,"The answer you just gave about concern for the protection of the child, that applies only to the child?"
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,523.964,532.149,"The -- the statute does -- the text does apply to the grave risk of physical or psychological harm to the child, and certainly--"
2009.08-645,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,532.149,533.475,To only -- only to the child?
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,533.475,539.317,"--Only to the child, although arguably there would be some risk of psychological harm if what the woman's allegation--"
2009.08-645,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,539.317,540.081,Do you know--
2009.08-645,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,540.081,545.237,"So the woman would be subject to -- if she wanted to remain with the child, there would be no protection."
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,552.264,566.43,"--Well, the courts could also, of course, Chief Justice Roberts, try, you know, to solve the problem through undertakings and placing conditions on the child's return, if the -- if the article 13(b) were not fully able to address the court's concerns."
2009.08-645,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,566.914,574.503,"That would be consistent with the convention, for the returning state to say, we are returning the child, but only if -- you know, bang, bang, bang?"
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,574.503,578.347,"--Well, in other contexts, for example in the context of visas, yes."
2009.08-645,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,594.121,598.82,What's the law -- what is the law if a mother and a child -- sorry.
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,613.626,614.534,I'm sorry.
2009.08-645,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,615.033,621.437,"What's the normal law where you have a couple -- they're supposed to leave the child in the country, but it doesn't say that."
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,624.654,625.153,--Yes.
2009.08-645,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,625.153,634.571,"And in violation of those rights, the father, say, takes the child to another country in violation of the divorce decree of the first country."
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,634.571,639.149,"If the mother had rights of custody, then those rights of custody would be breached by the--"
2009.08-645,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,639.149,640.46,"No, you are not understanding my question."
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,640.46,640.85,--Okay.
2009.08-645,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,641.287,643.505,"My question is, outside this convention--"
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,643.505,643.926,Yes.
2009.08-645,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,643.926,646.862,--If -- forget the convention.
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,648.863,649.753,Yes.
2009.08-645,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,649.753,657.891,"And suppose a parent, violating the decree, takes the child to another country in violation of an ordinary divorce decree."
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,661.67,664.513,There's no international -- other international remedy.
2009.08-645,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,665.387,666.713,"I'm sure there isn't, but under the law--"
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,666.713,669.321,"--there could be, for example, the UCCJEA in the United States."
2009.08-645,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,678.757,685.363,--You would go and take the court's order to a court in the United States and try to enforce it?
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,685.363,685.847,Yes.
2009.08-645,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,685.847,689.86,"And the American court would be under obligation, I guess, to enforce it?"
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,689.86,691.514,"In theory, yes."
2009.08-645,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,691.969,692.89,"Well, all right."
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,697.137,699.508,"We should use this convention, Justice Breyer--"
2009.08-645,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,699.508,704.113,"I know you think that, but I'm still worried about my mother in the case that -- that you gave me."
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,704.113,714.83,"--One thing that -- that may give you some comfort, as far as the convention's drafters are concerned, is that this was a scenario that the convention's drafters had in mind from the very beginning of the drafting process."
2009.08-645,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,717.719,723.342,"I've read through that, and I'll tell you that, on the basis of my reading through all that stuff, my mind is in equipoise."
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,742.412,742.942,--Okay.
2009.08-645,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,754.984,763.885,"--Ms. Howe, wasn't the -- the problem that gave rise to this Abduction Convention just the situation that Justice Breyer brought up?"
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,807.447,808.149,--That's right.
2009.08-645,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,856.457,862.953,"Well, what is the -- what is the significance of their breaking down the two categories?"
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,908.546,909.217,--It's true.
2009.08-645,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,925.334,930.036,"Does your argument really boil down to the claim that this was, in effect, joint custody?"
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,932.832,937.375,We believe that the Chilean system is analogous to joint custody.
2009.08-645,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,937.858,938.155,"I'd say it's not, but--"
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,938.155,938.357,--But--
2009.08-645,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,938.357,943.493,--But -- but are you arguing that this -- that this case is -- is the equivalent of a joint custody case?
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,943.493,943.79,--No.
2009.08-645,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,950.364,958.686,"Well, you're saying -- I know the white light's on -- but you are saying that every case that involves the Chilean government, the convention here is applicable, requiring return?"
2009.08-645,0,16153,amy_howe,,958.686,960.561,"--If the parent has visitation rights, then yes."
2009.08-645,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,963.108,965.249,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-645,1,24885,ginger_anders,,975.507,985.923,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The ne exeat provision at issue in this case gave Petitioner the power to prevent exactly the harm that is the Hague Convention's central concern."
2009.08-645,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,985.923,994.323,"Do you -- do you agree that every case originating in Chile must come out this way, so that there is a return required?"
2009.08-645,1,24885,ginger_anders,,994.323,1002.785,I agree that Chile has by law decided that the ne exeat right should arise automatically in any parent who has visitation rights.
2009.08-645,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1002.785,1007.629,But that seems to me remote from the concept of custody that the convention has in mind.
2009.08-645,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1007.629,1009.22,"I don't think so, Justice Kennedy."
2009.08-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1040.583,1049.064,But is there a distinction between the -- what's before us in this case and the different case in which the order specifically said custody shall be joint?
2009.08-645,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1053.658,1060.373,"--It would not be a different case, because the convention protects rights of custody, and it specifies that those rights can be awarded jointly."
2009.08-645,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1060.373,1062.498,But the decree says that custody -- the mother is the one who has custody.
2009.08-645,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1062.498,1069.759,"The mother may have most of the custodial rights, what we would think of as physical custody, but the convention protects rights of custody."
2009.08-645,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1077.909,1082.503,What they seem to be thinking of -- this is -- maybe you can get at what is bothering me.
2009.08-645,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1154.707,1159.515,"Well, I think Chile could have made a determination as a matter of its domestic law, that it would be in the child's interest--"
2009.08-645,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1159.515,1176.412,"I know there are ways out, but why should we include custody to be a situation where the human being who looked at this couple thought that that individual, the husband, should have nothing but visit him occasionally on Christmas?"
2009.08-645,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1186.613,1200.904,"--Well, I think the convention's fundamental principles actually are in line with your concerns, because what the convention says is that anytime that the child has been abducted in violation of a decision-making right that the -- that one or the other parent has, then the child should be returned."
2009.08-645,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1216.581,1218.675,"Ms. Anders, that's the point, isn't it?"
2009.08-645,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1227.374,1228.607,That's exactly right.
2009.08-645,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1228.607,1245.383,"And to avoid, as I understood the convention structure, this flight from court to court and this long, drawn-out process from country to country over who's going to make that choice, correct?"
2009.08-645,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1245.383,1245.866,That's right.
2009.08-645,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1245.866,1257.236,"And so the idea is, whether it's one custody right -- correct me if I am wrong -- whether it's one custody right or many, which court is going to decide what's in the best interest of that child?"
2009.08-645,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1257.236,1259.155,"That's exactly right, and I think the ne exeat right is very--"
2009.08-645,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1259.155,1274.086,"So that if -- so that if you have the mother taking her daughter from, say, a country where she would be forced to be raised under sharia law and that -- that is up to that country to decide whether the child has to be returned?"
2009.08-645,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1288.205,1294.703,"--There are narrow defenses to return, and one of those is the grave risk defense in article 13(b)."
2009.08-645,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1305.263,1314.852,"So it's your position that, in that case, the mother should return her daughter to the country where she will be raised under a system that the mother finds quite offensive?"
2009.08-645,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1314.852,1316.724,"--Well, that would not necessarily be the case."
2009.08-645,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1321.614,1323.642,And what -- I know Ms. Howe cited it.
2009.08-645,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1325.736,1326.688,"--It says,"
2009.08-645,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1330.685,1340.321,"Does -- does the status of, in this case, women in the country, does that constitute grave risk, or is it an individualized determination?"
2009.08-645,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1340.321,1343.585,I think it would generally be an individualized determination.
2009.08-645,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1357.187,1361.375,And that country is going to make a determination in favor of their domestic law and their domestic system.
2009.08-645,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1365.901,1371.166,"--Well, it would be the -- it would be the courts in the country of residence that would be making that determination."
2009.08-645,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1379.226,1401.138,"Well, could we interpret the words ""great psychological harm"" to include, for example, a situation where an educated woman with an advanced degree is unable to get work in the country where her child lives and has to live under conditions that are -- that are really -- we would say are fairly primitive because of her inability to find an appropriate employment?"
2009.08-645,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1406.932,1412.337,"Well, I -- I presume that you could, in an individual case, offer evidence that might include things like--"
2009.08-645,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1412.337,1422.161,"Well, has there ever been -- would you advocate that kind of very broad standard of great psychological -- and what would be your position, or what's the government's position on that?"
2009.08-645,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1422.161,1424.036,--It's that the defense would be more narrow than that.
2009.08-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1445.104,1448.68,I thought it has to be psychological harm to the child; isn't that right?
2009.08-645,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1448.68,1450.037,That's correct.
2009.08-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1450.037,1454.553,So psychological harm to the woman who can't work in the country would be irrelevant.
2009.08-645,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1454.553,1455.801,"Well, it might be relevant evidence--"
2009.08-645,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1455.801,1457.786,--unless that would secondarily affect the child?
2009.08-645,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1457.786,1458.13,--Right.
2009.08-645,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1458.726,1464.548,"Counsel, you said in your brief that this position by the Solicitor General is long-standing."
2009.08-645,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1475.279,1478.232,"Well, it's certainly the position as memorialized in our brief here."
2009.08-645,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1488.416,1493.521,"But we have been a part of the Special Commission since 1989, correct?"
2009.08-645,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1493.521,1494.633,That's correct.
2009.08-645,1,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1508.172,1522.245,Is there anything in the history of the negotiation and passage of the -- of the treaty that -- that reflects what the U.S.'s position was on this particular issue?
2009.08-645,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1522.245,1530.103,"--Not on this particular issue specifically, but this has been our position as -- as expressed in the Special Commission meetings and the reports to--"
2009.08-645,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1530.103,1566.977,"You don't question what the representative of the mother has said in this case, that the emphasis -- when this Hague Convention was before Congress, the emphasis was on the custodial parent -- that is, the person in the situation of the mother here -- that what Congress was told was the urgent problem was the noncustodial parent taking the child away from the custodial parent."
2009.08-645,1,24885,ginger_anders,,1575.988,1590.073,"--I believe the State Department's legal analysis stated that the typical case might be one in which a parent with -- with primary physical custody had the child, but the visiting -- the parent with visitation rights took the child to another country."
2009.08-645,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1612.799,1617.28,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,1620.295,1630.652,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Rights of custody and rights of access are very different and distinct substantive rights."
2009.08-645,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1674.432,1684.16,"Well, you could say -- you can say that the mother did not have full custodial rights."
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,1696.545,1707.339,The mother did not have the right to take the child out of the country without either obtaining the permission of the father or obtaining permission of the court to do that.
2009.08-645,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1717.837,1726.564,"Well, you could say that the limitation on the custodial right is the right of the husband to visit once a month or 3 -- 3 weeks a month."
2009.08-645,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1735.419,1737.716,It's a provision--
2009.08-645,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1737.716,1760.614,Let's assume there's a law that says joint custody; mom can determine the place to live; mom can determine the education of the child; dad can visit when he wants; dad can review choices but not veto them.
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,1788.558,1800.382,"In -- in that situation, the -- the rights are created under the law of the jurisdiction, and that -- and that -- in that instance, it would be a joint custodial right."
2009.08-645,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1800.382,1800.522,Right.
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,1808.501,1808.72,Right.
2009.08-645,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1815.076,1818.983,"Well, except the -- the convention doesn't define custodial rights, correct?"
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,1825.167,1826.415,"--No, Your Honor."
2009.08-645,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1846.608,1850.685,"Now, that's a little tough, because parents provide care in so many different ways."
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,1856.979,1858.086,--They were.
2009.08-645,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,1867.161,1868.008,That's not the word they used.
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,1878.096,1882.218,--The -- the exact definition from article 5 is
2009.08-645,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1893.401,1913.876,"Well, suppose there's a court order that prohibits the -- one of the parents -- the parent with whom the child lives most of the time from moving more than an hour's drive from the prior place of residence, would that be -- would -- would the -- the other parent then have custody?"
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,1913.876,1915.249,No.
2009.08-645,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1924.589,1930.512,Suppose the court order says that the -- that the child may not move from the house where the child lives now.
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,1931.947,1939.898,"--Again, that is -- that is simply a restriction on that parent's right to exercise their -- their custodial authority."
2009.08-645,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1939.898,1942.675,"Well, what's the meaning of the phrase ""determine the place of residence""?"
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,1942.675,1952.563,"""Determine the place of residence"" was -- was placed into the convention because that ordinarily is a right of custody."
2009.08-645,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,1971.632,1972.369,"Well, okay."
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,1981.568,1995.902,"--In -- in that instance, there may be a -- a joint right regarding the -- the determination of the residence, which is not what we have in -- which is not what we have in this case."
2009.08-645,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2008.791,2009.368,Mr. Hays--
2009.08-645,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2009.368,2017.814,"--If he has the right to say no, don't take the child out of the country, then he has something more than a right of access."
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,2042.088,2049.24,It's important to understand here that -- that he does not have a -- a right under the Chilean statute.
2009.08-645,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2050.223,2056.516,I thought the statute says the consent of the -- of the other parent.
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,2056.516,2066.59,"--The -- the statute says, first of all, that if you -- you have the consent of the parent, but if you don't get the consent of the parent, you go -- you go to the court."
2009.08-645,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2066.995,2069.413,"Well, that's true of custody decrees generally."
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,2088.002,2101.901,"--It's actually not -- it -- and that's -- and that's the position that Mr. Abbott wants this Court to -- to take, is that, well, it's a right, and since it's not a right of access, it has to be a right of custody."
2009.08-645,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2133.962,2144.721,It just says that the right of access is the right to take a child for a limited period of time to a place other than the child's habitual residence.
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,2153.998,2161.836,"--Actually, Your Honor, what the -- what the convention does is not specifically define either term."
2009.08-645,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2177.064,2186.781,"But that -- that cuts both ways so far as you are concerned, because it includes -- might mean that custody includes the right to insist on living in a specific country."
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,2186.781,2191.402,"That was not the understanding of the -- of the drafters of the convention, because -- and--"
2009.08-645,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2191.402,2194.276,"But, textually, that's certainly plausible."
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,2194.276,2223.468,"--Textually, when -- when you examine article -- when you examine article 5 in conjunction with article 3 and article 13, that doesn't -- that doesn't follow, because article 3 and article 13 both provide that the rights had to be actually exercised."
2009.08-645,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2266.935,2270.745,"--May I ask this question about the term ""place"" -- ""place of residence""?"
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,2286.566,2287.381,Absolutely not.
2009.08-645,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2297.579,2305.825,"So, the only control that the -- the husband had was the right -- whatever right was given by the ne exeat provision, that you can't take the child out of the country?"
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,2305.825,2307.026,--That's correct.
2009.08-645,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2313.76,2321.116,"And even if there had been no fight of the kind that developed, she would have had a unrestricted right to pick the place of residence?"
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,2321.116,2322.457,Absolutely.
2009.08-645,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2327.675,2334.94,"Which is more important, determining the house in which the child is going to live or determining the country in which the child is going to live?"
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,2334.94,2364.724,"For purposes of the convention, determining the house where -- where the child lives, determining the issues relating to the care of the child, because that was what the convention was intended to protect, that relationship, because you were having situations where a parent who had a custodial relationship with the child would have that relationship severed by the other parent taking the child, going to another country, and then seeking a court order."
2009.08-645,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2389.93,2416.123,"Why would the signatories of this convention have wanted to regard a parent as having custodial rights if the parent has the right to veto a change of address within a country, but not when the parent has the authority to veto the future nationality and cultural background of the child?"
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,2416.123,2428.699,They very well may not have intended either of those instances to create a -- a joint right of -- of custody.
2009.08-645,2,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,2486.439,2501.9,"I don't want to belabor the point too much, but maybe you could just give me an example of a court order that you believe would give a parent the right to determine place of residence and, therefore, would constitute custody within the meaning of the convention."
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,2501.9,2514.41,"--Typically -- typically in -- in Texas, Texas adheres to a position of joint managing conservatorship."
2009.08-645,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2567.264,2578.028,"Not according to the -- what is it, the Chilean central authority, you know, the letter that was sent to the Second Circuit, I think in the Duran case."
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,2595.863,2602.344,"--Actually, Your Honor, that -- that statement in the briefs is a -- is a misstatement of what happened in the Beaumont case."
2009.08-645,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2657.464,2674.142,"I thought there was a sentence in there -- and you can correct me if I'm wrong -- that said that the statute, under Chilean law, amounted to a right of joint custody."
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,2674.142,2680.123,"--The wording -- the wording of -- of the sentence, it includes the statute."
2009.08-645,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2722.998,2746.365,"So if I -- if I think, as Justice Alito was starting out, that if the -- a court order in the divorce case says the father and mother will jointly decide what house to live in, that the father has a custody right, if it jointly says the father and the mother will decide what State to live in, that that's a custody right."
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,2793.814,2801.091,The purpose of the convention was -- was not focused on protecting the -- the jurisdiction of--
2009.08-645,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2801.091,2818.583,"I understand that, but what I'm wondering is if -- if -- I thought you would agree with me about that, and since I thought you would agree with me about that, you would explain to me how I could reach that result, consistent with the language of this convention, which talks about custody rights granted by operation of law."
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,2818.583,2835.277,"--Our position is that this does not give any sort of affirmative right to the father, and it is not a right to determine because, if you take the common usage of the right to determine, it is to make an affirmative decision, and--"
2009.08-645,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2835.277,2851.726,"Most courts in countries signatory of the treaty have come out the other way and agree that a ne exeat right is a right of custody, and those courts include the U.K., France, Germany -- I believe, Canada."
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,2858.144,2863.389,"--Actually, Your Honor, the United States and Canada do, and the analysis that we--"
2009.08-645,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2863.389,2870.748,"Well, wait, I mean--"
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,2872.417,2891.847,"--The -- the United States and Canada -- as we point out in our brief, and I believe that it's pointed out in other amicus briefs, the -- there have only been seven courts of last resort that have heard this issue."
2009.08-645,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2894.643,2898.891,"Yes, but, still, in all, I mean, they include some biggies, like the House of Lords, right?"
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,2918.057,2938.142,"If, in fact, there were a -- a consensus, but there -- there is not a consensus in this instance because we -- as we analyze in our brief and I believe the 11 law professors analyzed in their brief, you cannot get a clear consensus of what--"
2009.08-645,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2938.142,2938.751,Who's against it?
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,2943.045,2943.953,--Correct.
2009.08-645,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2943.953,2952.918,"Canada is on your side; that the House of Lords is -- has some dicta written by two judges, which is good, but it wasn't a holding in the case."
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,2952.918,2953.215,Correct.
2009.08-645,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2953.215,2956.104,"And -- and that's about it, and so maybe they--"

2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,3148.671,3152.466,--There -- there is a possibility of -- of that.
2009.08-645,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3205.21,3205.849,"Well, if these things were effective--"
2009.08-645,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3205.849,3206.504,"Well, but the ne exeat order--"
2009.08-645,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3206.504,3207.893,"--we wouldn't -- we wouldn't have a treaty, would we?"
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,3207.893,3210.639,If they--
2009.08-645,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3210.639,3214.764,"If these local remedies were effective, we wouldn't have a treaty."
2009.08-645,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3214.764,3217.483,--And I was--
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,3217.483,3217.763,--These--
2009.08-645,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3217.763,3222.072,"--I was going to say the ne exeat order, under your view, is the one order that can't be enforced anyplace."
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,3222.072,3239.862,"--Now, the -- the -- a violation of the ne exeat provision could be enforced, but the question before this Court is whether the means of enforcing the ne exeat provision falls under the auspices of the Hague Convention."
2009.08-645,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3239.862,3241.875,May I just ask this general question?
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,3247.013,3247.917,Absolutely.
2009.08-645,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3259.07,3263.005,"So no matter what we do, the child may actually provide the answer in this case?"
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,3263.005,3265.396,"--That, also, Your Honor."
2009.08-645,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3265.396,3271.082,"Wait, does that provision of Texas law override the -- the treaty that the United States has entered into?"
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,3271.082,3272.364,The -- one of--
2009.08-645,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3272.364,3275.909,"Texas can ignore the treaty, because the child is over 12 years old?"
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,3275.909,3278.393,"--That -- no, it's a specific provision of the treaty, Your Honor."
2009.08-645,2,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3293.089,3296.213,But that -- but that's a defense to a removal order.
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,3296.213,3298.6,"--It -- yes, it is a defense to a removal--"
2009.08-645,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3298.6,3298.916,How old is the child?
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,3298.916,3301.037,--The child is 14 and half right now.
2009.08-645,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3303.693,3307.519,"The convention article 13 starts at 14, right?"
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,3307.519,3311.547,--The -- the convention article does not specify the age.
2009.08-645,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3324.214,3326.198,Is Mr. Abbott still in Chile?
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,3326.198,3328.416,"--Mr. Abbott's still living in Chile, yes."
2009.08-645,2,15131,sonia_sotomayor,scotus_justice,3328.416,3335.927,"And at the time when the child was removed, there was ongoing custody motions before the court in Chile?"
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,3335.927,3337.428,"Actually, that's incorrect, Your Honor."
2009.08-645,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3371.786,3374.941,Why didn't your client just ask the judge there to leave Chile?
2009.08-645,2,33850,karl_e_hays,,3374.941,3378.782,"Your Honor, I don't know."
2009.08-645,2,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3385.685,3387.545,"Thank you, counsel."
2009.08-645,3,16153,amy_howe,,3390.356,3391.978,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
2009.08-645,3,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3540.854,3548.275,"Can we read that exception there to say -- ""grave injury"" and so forth -- can we read it as in essence saying, look, do what's best for the child?"
2009.08-645,3,16153,amy_howe,,3548.275,3555.083,That -- you could read that as a form of a best interests of the child standard.
2009.08-645,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3565.269,3576.499,"May I ask you, do you agree with your opponent, putting aside removing the child from the country, that within Chile itself the custodial parent had the full right to determine the place of residence?"
2009.08-645,3,16153,amy_howe,,3576.499,3577.638,"We do agree, yes."
2009.08-645,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3577.638,3581.026,"I'm sorry, I'm a little taken aback by your answer to Justice Breyer."
2009.08-645,3,16153,amy_howe,,3586.911,3589.816,"No, I believe it's a stricter standard than simply the best interests of the child."
2009.08-645,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3595.517,3604.263,"And you agree with what I understood to be the Solicitor General's position, that that's an individual-specific and not a culture-specific determination?"
2009.08-645,3,16153,amy_howe,,3604.263,3606.732,"--Yes, we do."
2009.08-645,3,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,3641.185,3642.841,"Thank you, counsel."
