1997.96-1370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,10.147,"We'll hear argument now in Number 96-11370, Fidelity Financial Services, Inc. v. Fink."
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,13.901,14.492,"Yes, Mr. Chief Justice--"
1997.96-1370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,14.492,15.972,Please proceed.
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,15.972,17.093,--and may it please the Court:
1997.96-1370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,127.614,135.3,"So it satisfied the requirement of Missouri law, as you said, but it did not do it within 20 days."
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,135.3,142.783,The physical act of perfecting the lien occurred outside of the 20-day grace period established in 547(c)(3).
1997.96-1370,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,166.549,177.407,"Well, it certainly is possible that Congress intended that its provision, the 20-day provision after receiving possession of the property is what governs."
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,177.407,199.421,"Of course, Congress also included the 547(e)(1)(B) section, which incorporates State law, in defining when a transfer is perfected, and for preference purposes, of course, when a transfer occurs is when it is perfected, when it's made, and that incorporates State law, so State law is implicit in that consideration."
1997.96-1370,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,199.421,216.651,"Then we have to accept the possibility that in place of the 30 days here it could be the 60 days in West Virginia, I think it is, it could be a year in some State, if some State wanted to take that position... in effect, there would be no guaranteed end point on your position."
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,216.651,219.605,I agree that in effect there would not necessarily be an end point.
1997.96-1370,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,227.58,232.032,"What happens in a State like Massachusetts, as I understand it, that has a shorter limit?"
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,238.226,240.339,Justice--
1997.96-1370,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,240.339,241.249,"The State, or the Federal?"
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,241.249,245.422,"--Justice Ginsburg, I'm sorry, but I'm not aware of that provision in the Massachusetts law."
1997.96-1370,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,245.422,249.174,"Well, let's just imagine a State... your State has a 30-day provision."
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,254.448,255.226,Correct.
1997.96-1370,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,255.226,258.447,So what happens under such a statute?
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,258.447,265.174,"Well, under the current interpretations of the code, if the lien is perfected within 20 days the Federal law controls."
1997.96-1370,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,265.174,269.797,"So it's the longer... it's whichever gives you more time, the State or the Feds."
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,271.639,272.631,That is the position that we take.
1997.96-1370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,272.631,273.268,Then I don't--
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,281.537,282.245,Well--
1997.96-1370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,282.245,289.791,"It has to be perfected within 20 days, but in Massachusetts on the hypothesis it cannot be perfected after the tenth day."
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,289.791,297.635,"--Of course, we're referring to the Missouri statute, which includes a provision that deems the perfection to relate back to day 1."
1997.96-1370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,297.635,297.946,"No, but--"
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,297.946,298.807,It back-dates the perfection.
1997.96-1370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,298.807,322.893,"--I understand that, but this is an important point, and it's a point that helps you, by the way, because if it is correct that the Massachusetts 10-day provision would supersede the 20-day, you have available the argument that this statute cannot possibly provide a uniform period anyway because it's conceded that State law can shorten it, and we're only arguing about whether State law can lengthen it."
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,322.893,324.594,True.
1997.96-1370,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,324.594,327.665,"Then that's right, isn't it?"
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,333.408,336.711,"Well, if Justice Scalia says it's right, it must be right."
1997.96-1370,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,337.67,338.441,No--
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,344.795,356.263,"Well, my understanding of the current court interpretations are that if the State's provision is less than 10 days, they still allow the 20-day grace period."
1997.96-1370,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,359.786,362.228,And is that because of the definition of perfected?
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,362.228,362.999,--That is correct.
1997.96-1370,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,362.999,371.293,"In other words, assuming Justice Ginsburg's State with 10 days, if it's 15 days, it simply can't be perfected under State law."
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,371.293,373.494,What the State statutes at issue--
1997.96-1370,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,373.494,375.186,"I mean, is that the argument?"
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,375.186,391.969,"--Well, the argument, Justice Kennedy, I believe is that under State law there is a period of time within which a creditor can perfect its lien, and if it performs the required, stated requirements, then the lien is deemed perfected as of day 1, the date that the loan was--"
1997.96-1370,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,391.969,395.412,"And if it doesn't do that, then it's not perfected within the meaning of the Federal statute."
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,395.412,396.401,--Correct.
1997.96-1370,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,396.401,397.963,But it could still be--
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,402.104,402.775,"Certainly, Justice Scalia--"
1997.96-1370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,402.775,403.777,--Under State law we're talking now.
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,403.777,404.766,"--Certainly, Justice Scalia--"
1997.96-1370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,404.766,405.036,I see.
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,405.036,407.659,--if we go beyond... if it could be perfected 3 months down the road--
1997.96-1370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,407.659,408.229,You're right.
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,408.229,409.561,--it's perfected 3 months down the road.
1997.96-1370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,409.561,409.701,Okay.
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,414.372,414.793,Yes.
1997.96-1370,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,414.793,421.398,"In Missouri, that deems the lien perfected as of the date of the initial transaction, is that typical of State laws?"
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,421.398,430.263,"Justice Stevens, to my knowledge, there are at least 20 States that have that provision in their State statutes."
1997.96-1370,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,430.263,433.886,"In all of those States, the 20-day Federal period has no meaning?"
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,433.886,438.609,"Well, in seven of those States the perfection-back period is more than 20 days."
1997.96-1370,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,442.852,446.403,Why would Congress need the 20-day provision at all under your reading?
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,446.403,452.328,"Well, of course, a vehicle loan is a different animal than a regular secured transaction."
1997.96-1370,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,493.196,497.798,"Oh, I don't understand your answer, because you're saying there's one category of transactions which typically are performed immediately."
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,497.798,498.298,--Correct.
1997.96-1370,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,498.298,498.799,So there's really no delay.
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,503.021,503.742,That's correct.
1997.96-1370,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,503.742,510.586,"It seems to me in that category, if the State law always controls, the 20-day Federal period doesn't serve any function at all."
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,510.586,518.881,"Well, the 20-day period, of course, establishes when the security interest must be perfected."
1997.96-1370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,529.489,532.121,So you say the 20-day requirement has no independent significance.
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,532.121,541.668,I would say that the 20-day requirement established by Congress simply requires that the security interest be perfected within 20 days.
1997.96-1370,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,550.416,556.532,"No, but nothing is gained that would not be gained by having the general 10-day period."
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,570.851,571.57,And I would concede that.
1997.96-1370,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,571.57,572.471,Why did Congress do it?
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,628.648,633.052,"Well, of course, the congressional statement I think was that it was amended to bring the--"
1997.96-1370,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,633.052,637.697,Do you have an additional argument in your... is what I said right?
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,637.697,638.188,--Correct.
1997.96-1370,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,638.188,639.177,It is correct.
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,639.177,639.647,Correct.
1997.96-1370,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,639.647,640.018,All right.
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,656.878,658.049,Correct.
1997.96-1370,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,658.049,670.568,"--that that State also says, by the way, you are to consider it as having been perfected much earlier, on day 1, then it is for purposes of the Federal statute perfected earlier, within the 20-day period."
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,670.568,670.909,Correct.
1997.96-1370,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,670.909,672.378,That's your argument.
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,672.378,673.039,Correct.
1997.96-1370,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,673.039,675.0,"All right, then... go ahead."
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,675.0,683.876,"And, of course, under the Missouri scheme, then, if the lien is perfected within the 30-day period, the lien relates back to day 1."
1997.96-1370,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,698.427,709.624,"May I ask you to amplify on your answer to Justice Breyer, because it was my understanding that Congress was responding to what the majority of the States were doing."
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,727.456,731.117,"Well, I think it all began under the old act."
1997.96-1370,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,740.073,745.118,"Well, let's just... is it true or not that some 20-odd States have no relation-back period?"
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,745.118,751.253,"The 20-odd States, it's true that they don't have a specific relation-back period that says it's back-dated to day 1."
1997.96-1370,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,756.765,764.829,Which means that the creditor would prevail over any intervening creditor who tried to levy on the property.
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,764.829,766.031,"--That is correct, Justice Ginsburg."
1997.96-1370,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,766.031,766.63,Well--
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,779.57,787.675,"It's a very minute difference, of course, because one simply says that there is a grace period within which if certain steps are taken the lien is perfected."
1997.96-1370,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,795.13,798.643,"There are no... in function, they're identical."
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,801.484,803.526,That is correct.
1997.96-1370,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,806.147,806.477,So--
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,827.131,837.439,"And I would agree, under section 60, I believe it was, of the old act a creditor had 21 days within which to perfect its lien unless the short... or the State period was shorter."
1997.96-1370,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,891.693,895.546,"--How long is the U.C.C. period, grace period?"
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,895.546,902.409,"Well, I believe that the Uniform Commercial Code model is still 10 days, although I understand that's being revised."
1997.96-1370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,911.278,926.004,"And if I think that what the U.C.C. does is indistinguishable from a relation-back provision, then the number of States that have such a relation-back provision is not just seven, but 49, I assume, is that right?"
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,926.004,936.883,"Correct, but the seven was the number of States that had a period of time beyond 20 days, greater than the 20-day period, so we have one with 21 days, I think there's four with 30--"
1997.96-1370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,936.883,938.114,"Oh, beyond... I see."
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,948.972,949.262,--That--
1997.96-1370,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,949.262,950.194,20 days or less.
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,950.194,951.205,--I would assume that is correct.
1997.96-1370,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,951.205,962.141,"No, no, no, they have... a lot of them, under the U.C.C. they have 10 days, all right, so there are a number of States apparently that give you 20 days, is that right, and a large number of States that give you 10 days."
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,967.113,969.615,I think certainly when the statute was reenacted in '78--
1997.96-1370,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,969.615,969.985,Yeah.
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,969.985,970.716,--it was 10 days.
1997.96-1370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,974.589,985.095,"Well, in States, when a State comes to adopt a Uniform Commercial Code, at least this was the experience in Arizona, it isn't adopted just verbatim from the U.C.C. draft."
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,994.642,1006.779,"That is true, but of course, back when the code was reenacted in '78, States all utilized the '72 model, which was 10 days, so it's certainly arguable that Congress intended to make the 10-day period harmonious with State law."
1997.96-1370,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1007.939,1017.737,"May I ask you one other, just informative question... before we granted cert, you pointed out there was a conflict, with two courts that joined your view of the reading."
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,1021.59,1021.97,That's correct.
1997.96-1370,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1021.97,1022.579,Hesser and the other case.
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,1026.673,1031.415,"The amendment, of course... the '94 amendment, is that what you're referring to?"
1997.96-1370,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1031.415,1031.775,Yeah.
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,1031.775,1034.337,"There have been none that I'm aware of, Your Honor."
1997.96-1370,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1034.337,1035.749,Thank you.
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,1035.749,1037.81,In--
1997.96-1370,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1037.81,1052.248,"So if the language is somewhat ambiguous, allows it, and everything seems fairly mixed up State after State, why shouldn't we just say, well, a uniform rule is probably what they intended in order to avoid the kind of confusion that our questions suggest might arise?"
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,1052.248,1067.99,"--Well, the two courts of appeals that we relied on and are cited in our briefs, the Eleventh and Tenth Circuit opinions, note that in '78 the code was overhauled and the intention with respect to the preference provisions was to bring them more into conformity with commercial law and commercial practices."
1997.96-1370,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1091.335,1106.665,"Well then, why... why would Congress have made that expansion from 10 to 20 if Congress didn't think that they needed to do that in order to have the States that had the 20-day period, to have that effected?"
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,1112.028,1115.751,"Justice Ginsburg, I would concede that."
1997.96-1370,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1288.383,1290.786,May I ask you one other question I don't--
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,1290.786,1291.885,"Yes, Justice Breyer."
1997.96-1370,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1291.885,1295.167,--Let me do it with an example.
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,1312.441,1312.832,Right.
1997.96-1370,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1312.832,1319.867,"State 2 says the same thing, but adds the words, and perfection relates back to day 1."
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,1348.275,1349.414,That is correct.
1997.96-1370,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1349.414,1350.125,All right.
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,1358.981,1361.562,It accomplishes the same objective.
1997.96-1370,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1362.083,1388.74,"Well, if it does nothing, well then our question becomes one of whether Congress intended, by using the words 20 days, suddenly to permit any State, irrespective of whether it says relates back or not, that has 30 days or 60 days to perfect, to fall within the meaning of the 20 days."
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,1391.962,1393.743,I would agree with that.
1997.96-1370,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1393.743,1396.916,But that's your... that's what we have to... for you to win we have to agree with that.
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,1397.316,1403.621,"Well, absolutely, but under State law, of course, whether it's 20 days or 30 days--"
1997.96-1370,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1403.621,1415.728,"--And even if it doesn't say, since we have a definition of what perfection means, even if a State says 60 days and says nothing about relating back, on your argument that State rule would still prevail."
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,1415.728,1418.159,--Vis-a-vis an inter-liening--
1997.96-1370,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1418.159,1418.53,Yes.
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,1418.53,1419.391,--A lien creditor on a--
1997.96-1370,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1419.391,1420.581,"Yes, or the trustee in bankruptcy."
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,1420.581,1421.202,--Correct.
1997.96-1370,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1422.574,1437.624,"Well then, I don't want to hammer the point too hard, but I take it you are conceding that nothing of any practical significance was accomplished when Congress amended the law to add the 20-day period."
1997.96-1370,0,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,1437.624,1442.87,"Well, that's true."
1997.96-1370,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1475.131,1476.57,"Very well, Mr. Gaughan."
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,1478.183,1488.652,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1997.96-1370,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1511.896,1513.616,"What's your authority for that, Gertrude Stein?"
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,1521.633,1543.676,"--Well, I would agree that the definition is what... what the court or the Congress was looking at in section 547 was the act of perfection, not the status of being perfected, and in order to have the... to be perfected under the statute, you must take that last step within 20 days of the transaction."
1997.96-1370,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1566.313,1572.417,"--Before you leave the language, what you do with the language of the definition of when it's perfected?"
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,1621.679,1627.842,"Justice Breyer, that's an excellent point, but the statute doesn't say could not prevail, it says cannot prevail."
1997.96-1370,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1645.684,1647.154,Could not have prevailed.
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,1647.154,1648.296,"Could not have prevailed, yes, sir."
1997.96-1370,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1648.646,1668.09,"As I understand it, you... your position is that that section, 547(e)(1)(B), means simply, has... have all the steps been taken to perfect the lien, so it tells us, yes, the lien has been perfected, but is uninformative on relation-back."
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,1673.002,1690.193,"My position is that that defines the steps necessary, and you can look at State law to see what those steps would be to perfect, but as to whether you were actually perfected within the time frame that Congress envisioned, which was a uniform 20 days, you would look to Federal law, not the State."
1997.96-1370,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1690.193,1715.631,"And so in a State like Massachusetts, that has a shorter period, as long as all the necessary steps to perfect were taken within 20 days under your reading of the code, the security interest would be permissible."
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,1715.631,1721.264,"Justice Ginsburg, it's my interpretation of the code and it's the congressional intent that there be a uniform 20-day period."
1997.96-1370,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1768.456,1783.225,"So under your theory the Massachusetts hypothesis, where the period is shorter than 20 days, that person would have the... be able to take advantage of the Federal 20-day period, so you have... you'd have a uniform period throughout."
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,1783.225,1783.726,"--Yes, sir."
1997.96-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1890.015,1896.52,"May I ask, Mr. Fink, has this issue arisen in any case in the Ninth or Tenth Circuit since the amendment?"
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,1896.52,1899.122,At the circuit level?
1997.96-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1899.122,1900.474,"Well, just in the circuit."
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,1907.769,1908.73,"I don't know, Justice Stevens."
1997.96-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1908.73,1910.18,--You don't know... no cases you know of?
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,1910.18,1910.991,I don't know if there are any.
1997.96-1370,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1912.802,1919.146,But the circuit hasn't had a chance to reconsider since the enlargement of the period from 10 days to 20 days.
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,1919.146,1925.561,"I'm not familiar with any circuit court opinions in the Ninth and Tenth that have reconsidered that issue, Justice Ginsburg."
1997.96-1370,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1939.13,1940.672,What about the--
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,1940.672,1942.022,I might have those twisted around.
1997.96-1370,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1943.884,1946.595,--What about the colloquy in the legislative history?
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,1980.206,1982.8,I may... Justice Breyer--
1997.96-1370,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1982.8,1983.138,How did that come about?
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,1983.138,1990.573,"--That was an act that wasn't even... that didn't even get passed, although the language is similar to the act that eventually--"
1997.96-1370,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1990.573,1991.004,Yeah... right.
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,1991.004,1991.675,--It was amended in '94.
1997.96-1370,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1997.508,1998.879,"No, no, there would be somebody who would have written that."
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2011.988,2012.239,Just--
1997.96-1370,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2012.239,2013.058,It's done intentionally.
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2015.281,2031.629,"--The history of that I can't speak to, but I know that the committee report would have more bearing than their colloquy, and the hist... and the committee report on the 1994 amendment states that they were going for a uniform 20 days."
1997.96-1370,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2031.629,2042.196,"Well, the colloquy may be a weak read to go on, but it didn't seem to me to be ambiguous."
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2061.27,2065.583,"Can't speak to that, Your Honor."
1997.96-1370,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2065.583,2067.705,Why don't you answer Justice Ginsburg's question?
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2085.074,2090.679,"Oh, I don't think that that's what Mr. Heflin said, Senator Heflin."
1997.96-1370,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2142.164,2148.787,"Wasn't there a statement... maybe I'm wrong about this, but I remembered a statement in which--"
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2182.158,2185.381,"Well, that's the only explanation I can ascribe to that, Justice Scalia."
1997.96-1370,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2187.014,2188.573,All right.
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2188.573,2193.165,Congress certainly knows how to incorporate State law when it wants to do so.
1997.96-1370,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2246.409,2252.154,Would you go through that again?
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2252.154,2252.644,--Sure.
1997.96-1370,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2252.644,2253.205,How could they have adopted it?
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2254.166,2267.745,"The simplest way to adopt applicable State law, in section 546(b)(1) there's a statement that says, general applicable law applies in these statutes, 544, 545, and 549."
1997.96-1370,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2286.947,2288.107,--Res ipsa loquitur.
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2288.427,2289.629,That wasn't it.
1997.96-1370,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2319.149,2323.911,A quick question about perfection.
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2323.911,2324.272,"Yes, sir."
1997.96-1370,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2324.272,2328.005,"Imagine in a State that has a 60-day period, or a 30-day period--"
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2328.005,2328.305,"Yes, sir."
1997.96-1370,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2328.305,2331.117,"--you take out a loan, but you don't perfect for a year."
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2331.117,2331.636,"Yes, sir."
1997.96-1370,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2331.636,2342.414,"Am I correct in thinking the person who didn't perfect for a year, the secured creditor, still has perfected his interest, but only in respect to the future, not in respect to the past?"
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2342.414,2343.704,"That's correct, sir."
1997.96-1370,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2343.704,2344.124,Thank you.
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2344.124,2345.597,Which brings up--
1997.96-1370,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2345.597,2354.983,"If we adopt your position, are there going to be problems in some States where the motor vehicles registration period is just slow because of the way the State officials work?"
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2358.112,2358.542,--I don't know.
1997.96-1370,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2372.862,2379.888,"No, but if you do everything right, are there not some States where they take longer than 20 days to validate the lien?"
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2379.888,2384.172,"--Yes, sir, and under State law that certainly could happen."
1997.96-1370,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2384.172,2398.299,"And the creditor, generally the seller in these cases, what remedy does he have, simply not to transfer possession of the property until the paperwork is completed?"
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2398.299,2404.214,I don't believe that that would be the appropriate manner of transferring title to a vehicle.
1997.96-1370,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2408.205,2411.317,"So they don't have any protection, then."
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2411.317,2418.003,"--I think they're just going to be out of luck, and I think Congress looked at that and was trying to balance the State interests versus the Federal interest."
1997.96-1370,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2418.003,2428.802,"If they're out of luck, it's because of State law and not Federal law, isn't it... because if you send in the papers the day after you transfer possession, you've complied with the Federal law--"
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2428.802,2429.179,"Yes, sir."
1997.96-1370,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2429.179,2429.74,--have you not?
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2429.74,2430.12,"Yes, sir."
1997.96-1370,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2430.12,2437.824,"And so if the State can't process it within 30 days, the problem is with the State law."
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2437.824,2440.718,I misunderstood the... I wasn't thinking clearly on the question.
1997.96-1370,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2454.467,2460.29,"So as long as the date stamp at the office that you send it to, that's what's going to prevail, whether it gets indexed properly or not."
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2460.29,2462.781,I'm not familiar with all the motor vehicle statutes--
1997.96-1370,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2462.781,2463.131,But isn't--
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2463.131,2464.581,"--in the 50 States, but in Missouri--"
1997.96-1370,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2464.581,2465.622,--That... that's what you--
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2465.622,2465.953,--that would be the critical date.
1997.96-1370,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2465.953,2467.674,"--Well, it depends on State law."
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2474.829,2488.237,"I believe in this case the bankruptcy judge ruled that the date that it was received was the effective date of transfer, and at worst... that was 21 days out."
1997.96-1370,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2492.931,2503.107,--I thought most State laws would make the date of perfection at least the date when there's some public ability to know of the existence of the lien.
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2531.247,2531.648,--I don't know.
1997.96-1370,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2531.648,2545.785,"I think, isn't it... that's what I've looked up on this, that these were amendments attached to a crime bill, and Senator Heflin was the floor manager of the crime bill, and then therefore he had to answer whatever question came up."
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2567.99,2568.3,"No, sir."
1997.96-1370,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2663.973,2665.202,But practically isn't that unlikely?
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2675.981,2676.722,"Yes, ma'am."
1997.96-1370,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2676.722,2677.681,--in setting the 20-day period.
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2677.681,2678.222,"Yes, ma'am."
1997.96-1370,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2678.222,2699.938,"So why couldn't one look at that as Congress trying to stay in line with the States and say, in case of a State that doesn't say anything, we'll pick the State that most States... the time that most States allow, 20 days, but we're not ruling out States that have a longer period."
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2703.727,2711.574,"Oh, I don't think that's what they said, and they don't need to harmonize with the State law, because it's Federal bankruptcy law that's at issue."
1997.96-1370,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2711.574,2736.131,"They don't need to, but why can't one read these... the statute putting the relation-back provision together with the provision about the lienholder's interest being perfected and come up with, well, Congress meant at least 20 days but more if a State allowed it?"
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2736.131,2737.902,"Well, Congress certainly could have done that."
1997.96-1370,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2831.292,2835.325,What's... is an enabling loan... is... that can mean the same thing as a purchase money mortgage?
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2835.325,2838.948,"That's similar, and in a motor vehicles... in a non-U."
1997.96-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2845.101,2862.363,Mr. Fink--
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2862.363,2862.734,Yes.
1997.96-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2862.734,2863.875,--may I just ask one question?
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2868.127,2868.558,"Yes, sir."
1997.96-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2868.558,2869.687,And the lien was--
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2869.687,2870.017,Well--
1997.96-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2870.017,2871.279,"--about [dollars] 3,000?"
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2871.279,2876.693,"--Well, actually the vehicle I think was worth around 10,000, the debt was around 14."
1997.96-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2876.693,2879.087,"I see, and that's what's at issue."
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2884.41,2886.24,"Yes, sir, because the lien didn't go away."
1997.96-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2896.858,2899.028,May I ask... it's really not relevant.
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2900.649,2908.745,"--It's a... since it's a Chapter 13, you basically have two tests that have to be met for the general unsecured creditors."
1997.96-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2949.152,2953.496,"I see, and that's the estate that's financing this litigation, of course."
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2953.496,2958.608,"Well, actually, all the Chapter 13 debtors in the Western District of Missouri are financing this--"
1997.96-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2959.839,2962.16,"I'm a little worried about your posture here, frankly."
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2963.272,2964.554,--But a chapter--
1997.96-1370,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2964.554,2965.663,"Kind of a test case, in other words."
1997.96-1370,1,39277,richard_v_fink,,2965.663,2966.414,"--A... yes, sir."
1997.96-1370,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3011.054,3012.413,"Thank you, Mr. Fink."
1997.96-1370,2,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,3014.666,3016.267,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1997.96-1370,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3061.058,3064.38,"We don't ordinarily sit to review facts, Mr. Gaughan."
1997.96-1370,2,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,3064.38,3064.75,--I understand.
1997.96-1370,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3064.75,3071.072,We've been presented with a set of facts that said that it was either 21 days or 26 days afterwards.
1997.96-1370,2,35872,michael_p_gaughan,,3072.364,3076.976,I was just trying to point out that there is an inherent delay built into vehicle perfections.
1997.96-1370,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3102.238,3103.577,"Thank you, Mr Gaughan."
