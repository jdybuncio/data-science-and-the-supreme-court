1978.77-1810,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,10.088,We'll hear arguments first this morning in Arizona Public Service Company against Snead.
1978.77-1810,0,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,14.794,17.315,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1810,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,33.174,35.888,We will leave that entirely in your hands counsel.
1978.77-1810,0,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,35.888,39.733,I believe that they are adequately set forth in the briefs.
1978.77-1810,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,190.883,195.823,Within the state or out or can it be either?
1978.77-1810,0,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,195.823,201.032,The credit is assigned for; it’s only with respect to electricity that will be consumed in New Mexico.
1978.77-1810,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,201.032,209.904,"The party who generates the electricity may sell it to wholesaler within the state or without, is that so and --"
1978.77-1810,0,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,209.904,212.172,"That is correct Mr. Chief Justice, he may."
1978.77-1810,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,215.891,216.841,To just the one --
1978.77-1810,0,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,216.841,221.548,"To just the one, where the electricity is eventually consumed in New Mexico."
1978.77-1810,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,267.348,284.763,"But if you look at the overall effect of the tax, the tax structure of New Mexico, New Mexico consumers of electricity may well pay just as much as consumers in other states, isn't that true?"
1978.77-1810,0,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,284.763,300.256,"At the consumer level, I am not sure that that's true Mr. Justice Rehnquist, because then you are talking into account whatever tax maybe applied at the consumption level and the state of consumption."
1978.77-1810,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,329.365,338.67,"When you say the wholesale level, you mean sales by the generator to others who in turn sell at retail?"
1978.77-1810,0,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,338.67,341.729,"Sell for retail, that's correct Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1978.77-1810,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,424.721,435.714,Well doesn't the legislative history show that Federal law was enacted –- was this statute a direct target?
1978.77-1810,0,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,435.714,436.913,Yes it does Mr. Justice Stewart.
1978.77-1810,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,436.913,449.192,Then of course it was amended and your brother on the other side claims that it was during the course it was being amended it was whittled down to being almost meaningless and not to cover the statute.
1978.77-1810,0,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,449.192,453.631,"Well, it was not really amended the -- let me explain the course of the legislative history."
1978.77-1810,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,474.8,479.356,[Inaudible] couple of the other states West Virginia and Washington got disturbed.
1978.77-1810,0,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,479.356,488.316,We have no legislative record of that Mr. Justice Stewart and I don't believe the state's briefs cites anything in the legislative record to support that contention.
1978.77-1810,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,525.748,527.141,Anyway it was not enacted.
1978.77-1810,0,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,527.141,529.711,It was not enacted; let me get to the Tax Reform Act.
1978.77-1810,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,627.131,635.672,"Just before you leave the statute, it's of course you rely primarily on the second sentence of the statute I guess rather than the first?"
1978.77-1810,0,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,635.672,641.825,"I don't know, but we say we rely anymore on one sentence than the other because the first sentence --"
1978.77-1810,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,641.825,649.281,"I guess the discrimination against the out-of-state manufacturers and there's no out-of-state manufacturer that is being discriminated against here, isn't it?"
1978.77-1810,0,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,649.281,652.031,"According to the state of residence, they're out-of-state, but the statute --"
1978.77-1810,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,652.031,653.933,But that is not what it means.
1978.77-1810,0,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,653.933,658.366,We would rely on the second -- the second sentence contains the test of discrimination --
1978.77-1810,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,658.366,663.431,And in fact you read that as broadening the first sentence basically.
1978.77-1810,0,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,667.536,672.161,"Well, the first sentence says that no state shall discriminate which is in a --"
1978.77-1810,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,672.161,679.413,"Against out-of-state manufacturers, producer's etcetera, but you're not an out-of-state producer within the meeting of this, are you?"
1978.77-1810,0,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,679.413,683.247,"I don't know, the statute doesn't define what an out-of-state producer is."
1978.77-1810,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,689.913,690.928,"No, but that is not what it says."
1978.77-1810,0,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,691.768,692.962,There are out-of-state manufacturers --
1978.77-1810,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,692.962,695.925,It doesn't talk about productions for sale out-of-state.
1978.77-1810,0,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,712.629,714.446,I will review it Mr. Justice Stevens.
1978.77-1810,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,811.632,819.258,"Do the opinions below indicate how substantial a portion of the total business, the wholesaling of electricity is?"
1978.77-1810,0,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,819.258,820.559,They do not Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
1978.77-1810,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1042.678,1050.319,Are you saying that a state cannot make the generation of electricity a taxable event?
1978.77-1810,0,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,1050.319,1051.447,"No, I'm not Mr. Justice Rehnquist."
1978.77-1810,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1118.821,1137.761,"Mr. McAuliffe you may have covered this, I might have missed it, but does the state give a credit on the gross receipts tax to an out-of-state generator who might sell electricity within the state, for similar tax imposed by the others?"
1978.77-1810,0,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,1137.761,1139.619,"Yes, it does that's Section 9(a)."
1978.77-1810,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1139.619,1140.853,9(a) does that.
1978.77-1810,0,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,1140.853,1162.853,"And that -- all that provides is that if there is a tax, a generation tax imposed by another state and the energy is transmitted to New Mexico and consumed there, then you're entitled to take a -- if it's retailed in New Mexico you owe gross receipts tax and you're entitled to take a credit against gross receipts tax."
1978.77-1810,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1162.853,1165.551,What is the amount of the credit?
1978.77-1810,0,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,1165.551,1169.289,It's whatever tax is imposed by the other state.
1978.77-1810,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1169.289,1175.004,Even it was a full 4% then it conceivably they pay no gross receipts tax?
1978.77-1810,0,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,1175.004,1178.846,I would assume so Mr. Justice Stevens our position is that obviously cannot cure the problem.
1978.77-1810,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1230.602,1239.202,Very well.
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1250.183,1255.973,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1978.77-1810,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1287.31,1292.304,"Are you going to talk about the Constitution, you would agree we would have to decide the statutory problem?"
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1292.304,1297.379,Yes and I think the statue is the more important issue really.
1978.77-1810,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1387.201,1388.57,Mr. Unna can I interrupt once more?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1388.57,1388.893,Yes.
1978.77-1810,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1388.893,1391.152,You say no tax burden whatsoever.
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1395.95,1399.877,"Yes, Mr. Justice, but the burden on electricity per se was zero."
1978.77-1810,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1399.877,1401.367,I see.
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1401.367,1403.266,And for purposes at least --
1978.77-1810,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1403.266,1406.873,"Well, you want us to look at the total picture or we just look at those on electricity per se."
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1406.873,1412.516,"Yes, the commodity of electricity as it's referred to in the case law."
1978.77-1810,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1492.47,1501.339,Does the record indicate whether Arizona Public Service sells it retail any of its electricity in New Mexico?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1501.339,1516.073,A minor portion is sold to the companies that mines coal at the Four Corners Power Plant and it's a minuscule amount and basically I think that's all they sell in New Mexico.
1978.77-1810,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1634.686,1641.376,Mr. Unna you omit the possibility that the electricity sold elsewhere maybe subject to a tax elsewhere?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1641.376,1649.317,"Under the Constitutional Case Law that's not relevant, on my reading of it anyway."
1978.77-1810,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1654.935,1657.376,But it is true nevertheless?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1657.376,1658.737,What?
1978.77-1810,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1658.737,1662.227,That electricity maybe subject to a tax at the retail level?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1662.227,1665.699,Of course a light burden of such.
1978.77-1810,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1665.699,1695.655,"And isn't it also true that so far as New Mexico generators of electricity go, those who generate or that part of the electricity that they generate that is sole inside of New Mexico is not subject to any generation tax and not part of the electricity that the New Mexico generators sell that is sold outside of the state is."
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1695.655,1697.912,"No, Your Honor it's not true."
1978.77-1810,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1701.603,1707.347,But those who generate electricity that is sold in New Mexico get to get it back.
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1707.347,1709.071,They get the credit against their gross receipts.
1978.77-1810,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1709.071,1710.743,"They get it all back, don't they?"
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1710.743,1712.201,"Yes, but they pay a higher tax."
1978.77-1810,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1712.201,1719.119,And those who sell electricity that is in turn sold at retail outside of New Mexico don't get it back?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1719.119,1721.483,Not from New Mexico there is no way we could give it back.
1978.77-1810,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1721.483,1723.677,Or from anybody?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1723.677,1726.057,"Well, they may get it from Arizona I don't know."
1978.77-1810,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1726.057,1745.011,"But as far as New Mexico goes, the net effect is that the sellers of electricity, the wholesale sellers of electricity that in turn is sold instate are not taxed and those who sell electricity that is sold at retail out of state are taxed, isn't that correct or have I missed something?"
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1745.011,1745.833,"No, you haven't."
1978.77-1810,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1753.528,1757.225,Isn't the net effect the test?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1757.225,1761.96,Then the total tax burden under Constitutional Case Law is --
1978.77-1810,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1761.96,1764.568,Not on all the tax payers in the state.
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1766.246,1769.777,"No, on the commodity of electricity."
1978.77-1810,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1769.777,1772.761,That's by a tax payer.
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1783.006,1793.554,I'm not sure that the case law says that you couldn't add up the total tax burden on different tax payers so long as it's on the commodity of electricity.
1978.77-1810,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1855.86,1863.109,And we need to look that -- the gas that sold in New Mexico?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1863.109,1864.505,Of the electricity?
1978.77-1810,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1864.505,1866.781,Yes.
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1866.781,1870.758,"Yes, I think that the way we have a tax structure that we have is –-"
1978.77-1810,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1870.758,1874.282,How would you tax it?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1874.282,1875.315,The way we have Your Honor.
1978.77-1810,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1875.315,1878.36,You say you give it back.
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1878.36,1878.637,Well--
1978.77-1810,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1878.637,1882.364,"Well, you can't get the money back from Arizona?"
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1882.364,1883.31,"No, we have no control --"
1978.77-1810,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1883.31,1886.593,Because you never give the money to Arizona?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1886.593,1887.664,No.
1978.77-1810,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1887.664,1891.835,"So you couldn't give it, Arizona couldn't give it back?"
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1891.835,1895.287,"Well, Arizona is free to do whatever it wants to but --"
1978.77-1810,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1895.287,1902.738,But here I just don't understand I think probably state free in saying that there is no difference?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1902.738,1903.642,"Well, under the Constitution --"
1978.77-1810,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1903.642,1908.842,"I mean when you end up, at the end of the year there is a difference?"
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1908.842,1913.046,"The total tax burden on electricity is 4% interstate, the total tax --"
1978.77-1810,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1913.046,1915.42,The difference at the end of the year?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1915.42,1916.052,I am sorry.
1978.77-1810,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1916.052,1922.627,Is there a difference at the end of the year between the electricity sold to Arizona and electricity sold in New Mexico?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1922.627,1922.735,Yes.
1978.77-1810,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1922.735,1925.044,Is there a difference in the tax paid?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1925.044,1934.949,"Yes, the tax burden on instate electricity that's sold in New Mexico is twice the burden on electricity that is generated and sold in Arizona."
1978.77-1810,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1934.949,1938.894,But if you add by two different tax payers.
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1938.894,1941.805,"Yes, I see what was your question --"
1978.77-1810,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1941.805,1952.671,"I'm talking about generator as I am talking to, doesn't he pay less if he sells his electricity in New Mexico?"
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1952.671,1954.832,"No, he pays more Your Honor."
1978.77-1810,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1963.178,1970.68,"The generator pays a 2% generation tax that he gets back if the electricity is ultimately sold inside the state, isn't right?"
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1970.68,1979.782,"Yes Your Honor but he gets it back against his sales tax reverse receipts tax which he also pays, that's a 4% tax rate."
1978.77-1810,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1979.782,1984.773,I don't think the generator for sale in wholesale is subject to gross receipt tax?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1984.773,1986.979,"Well, there is no factual record Your Honor."
1978.77-1810,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1986.979,1987.986,But isn't that correct?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1987.986,1988.533,I'm taking --
1978.77-1810,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1988.533,1994.4,Isn't that correct as a matter of Arizona Law or I misunderstood that too?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,1994.4,1996.171,What Your Honor?
1978.77-1810,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1996.171,2001.579,That a sale by the generator at wholesale is not subject to the gross receipts tax?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2001.579,2005.315,A sale by a New Mexico generator is not subject to the gross receipts tax.
1978.77-1810,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2005.315,2007.432,"Yes, is that correct?"
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2007.432,2011.652,Yes.
1978.77-1810,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2011.652,2033.426,"The net result of the transaction is that the electricity each kilowatt hour, it goes outside of the state pays a higher tax after the refund is when adjusted, then that consumed within the stages, is that not correct?"
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2033.426,2041.429,"It's not correct, I think the net result of, for purposes of the constitutional case law is that a higher tax is paid on instant electricity."
1978.77-1810,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2041.429,2046.014,"No because we get what it's for, let's just talk about the mathematics of it."
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2046.014,2047.691,Alright.
1978.77-1810,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2047.691,2064.117,"Does each kilowatt hour which goes across the borders of the state and into another place, ultimately pay a higher tax than that consumed within the state?"
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2064.117,2066.293,"No, Your Honor, it's doesn't."
1978.77-1810,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2117.61,2124.323,Isn't that correct that before the generation tax was paid there was 4% gross receipts tax.
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2146.04,2147.17,That's true.
1978.77-1810,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2156.431,2162.276,So if the two power plants I described just one of them would really bear the entire burden of the new tax.
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2164.918,2165.471,That's right.
1978.77-1810,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2165.471,2165.696,Yeah.
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2165.696,2174.577,"There is additional tax burden that's not shared by instate electricity, but the relevant -- that is not the test under the Constitutional Case Law."
1978.77-1810,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2189.414,2203.774,Or is your position basically that New Mexico's tax is not all that different from the used tax that states devised in the 1930's to make up for a lost revenue in the situation if they couldn't get by sales tax?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2203.774,2211.107,"That's basically it, yes."
1978.77-1810,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2234.652,2245.633,"Perhaps I am wrong, but isn't the distinction really on what one looks at if it one looks at the energy tax in isolation and it's discriminatory."
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2253.646,2256.595,Your Honor the case law is very clear.
1978.77-1810,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2265.417,2270.298,How about just looking at wholesalers now?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2274.366,2282.961,"Well, if you look solely at the tax burden on a generator and a wholesaler."
1978.77-1810,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2290.397,2296.629,"Well, I know but he doesn't, he pays it but he hasn't given back."
1978.77-1810,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2298.248,2298.93,That's true.
1978.77-1810,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2298.93,2301.13,So in net affect --
1978.77-1810,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2301.13,2302.413,He doesn't pay --
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2302.413,2305.543,-- he doesn't pay it.
1978.77-1810,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2322.598,2324.577,The wholesaler does?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2324.577,2324.986,Yes.
1978.77-1810,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2324.986,2328.0,That higher tax is imposed on the ultimate consumer.
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2328.0,2329.897,"No, not in our state Your Honor."
1978.77-1810,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2338.459,2339.656,On a retail seller?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2339.656,2340.372,Yes.
1978.77-1810,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2340.372,2343.631,But not there for on the wholesaler or on the generator?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2343.631,2345.63,"Of the gross receipts, no, that's true."
1978.77-1810,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2345.63,2352.352,"Well, so are there any wholesalers of electricity in New Mexico?"
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2352.352,2357.37,The record is silent as to whether there is any wholesale selling of electricities.
1978.77-1810,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2365.082,2368.082,The people who retail or generate?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2368.082,2371.739,"Mostly electricity where I come from is sold by public service company, New Mexico."
1978.77-1810,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2371.739,2388.516,"Well, I know, but – what if there were a generator of electricity in New Mexico who was a wholesaler and sold to retailers in New Mexico of electricity."
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2394.196,2395.327,"Yes, what about it?"
1978.77-1810,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2395.327,2404.935,"Well, what about it, I mean he would, he would get forgiven his energy tax."
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2404.935,2411.572,"Well, the only purpose of the mandatory credit in the forgiveness of paying back of the generation --"
1978.77-1810,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2411.572,2415.605,"No, but he wouldn't never pay any gross receipts tax."
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2415.605,2417.407,He paid the generation tax.
1978.77-1810,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2417.407,2419.868,"Alright, he'd get it back."
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2419.868,2420.942,He would get it back against --
1978.77-1810,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2420.942,2425.392,"Well, so he wouldn't pay, and he wouldn't pay any gross receipts tax."
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2427.772,2430.708,"Yes, that's, that's speculative."
1978.77-1810,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2433.714,2439.347,"Well, isn't it because, it is natural do assume that there isn't?"
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2439.347,2444.696,"No, but the record is silent, it wasn't a point that was developed by the utilities in this case."
1978.77-1810,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2495.183,2502.321,"[Inaudible] one point, but that 2% he can't get back from anybody."
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2502.321,2503.041,The out-of-state?
1978.77-1810,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2503.041,2503.978,"Yeah, they are --"
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2503.978,2505.64,He can't get back from New Mexico.
1978.77-1810,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,2505.64,2507.841,That's right.
1978.77-1810,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2507.841,2512.327,"Mr. Unna, could I focus on Section 391 a minute?"
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2512.327,2514.024,"Yes, Your Honor."
1978.77-1810,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2514.024,2529.615,"When that came out of the Senate, is there any question that it concededly was aimed to invalidate New Mexico's tax?"
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2529.615,2537.364,There is no question that it is aimed at invalidating New Mexico's tax and --
1978.77-1810,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2537.364,2558.444,"Well, then what's legislative history is there in connection with statute to suggest that the Congress adoption of the phrase “greater tax burden” signaled to design to shift the focus of the discrimination inquiry into state tax system as a whole?"
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2558.444,2575.449,"I don't know that the Senate Finance -- the Senate Finance Committee version, there was a great difference I think in, well not a great difference, there was difference between the Senate Finance Committee version and the greater tax burden version."
1978.77-1810,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2585.637,2587.574,This was the barrier when West Virginia was --
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2587.574,2595.638,"Yes, and they would have lost their whole test of discrimination to invalidate New Mexico's tax."
1978.77-1810,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2598.416,2607.972,"And you think because of the West Virginia barrier, you had a completely different result then, as to New Mexico then when it left the senate?"
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2607.972,2621.403,"No, I think they had to water down the tests so substantially however, that it resulted in a restatement of the case law and the test of discrimination in the second part of Section 391, I think makes that very clear."
1978.77-1810,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2621.638,2624.804,Then New Mexico's benefits accordingly?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2624.804,2639.604,Of course if it's a restatement then our tax is constitutional and if it's a restatement under the constitutional case law there is no question that New Mexico's tax structure would survive in time.
1978.77-1810,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2639.604,2661.538,"Does it make some difference in this case whether the business of generating and selling electrical energy is setup like the grocery business where you have three levels, manufacture at least -- manufacture, wholesale and retail or whether there is some difference between the two?"
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2661.538,2663.213,"No, I don't think it makes any difference."
1978.77-1810,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2664.292,2678.888,"Well, my thought is that our cases have said that the practicalities influence a great deal whether a tax is discriminatory or not and who bears the burden and that's sort of a thing."
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2703.965,2710.44,"Well, I think that wholesaling doesn't play a large part in the distribution of electricity."
1978.77-1810,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2748.696,2751.195,Do you have REA in your state?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2751.195,2755.104,"No, we don't in my knowledge."
1978.77-1810,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2762.062,2813.465,"I have the impression that in your brief you had argued somewhere and I can't put my finger on it now that the producing states has to suffer all the environmental disadvantages of presumably coal or oil whatever is used, produce it or that's atomic to all those risks necessary whatever they are and did that justify a different treatment for the electrical energy which was exported where the consumers would not have to suffer and be subject to these environmental disadvantages, am I right that you've argued that?"
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2813.465,2820.542,"No, I have not argued a constitutional, a case law discrimination been --"
1978.77-1810,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2820.542,2822.435,Is there something like that in your brief?
1978.77-1810,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2822.435,2824.848,On page 35 in your brief.
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2824.848,2840.117,"We have argued that consistently the utilities raised below at the trail level that their rights, Fourteenth Amendment due process rights were being violated by this tax which raised a question."
1978.77-1810,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2840.117,2842.925,Let's stay on my question if you don't mind counsel.
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2842.925,2843.475,Sure.
1978.77-1810,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2843.475,2858.672,Do you argue that the State in which the generator is located puts up with a lot of burdens that the consuming State or the Republic of Mexico doesn't have to suffer?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2858.672,2860.085,"Oh, yes."
1978.77-1810,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2860.085,2874.145,"And if so, why that would appear to me that you are undertaking to justify a differential treatment between instate and outstate consumption?"
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2874.145,2877.847,I'm not saying we can discriminate because there is so much pollution there.
1978.77-1810,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2877.847,2879.985,Then what's the argument for?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2879.985,2895.597,"Well, to show annexes with the taxing state that there were a tremendous amount of costs and benefits to the utilities as a result of having their plants in the North West corner of New Mexico, just to set the case in context."
1978.77-1810,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2907.071,2914.16,"Mr. Unna, may I ask you question about the legislative history of the statute with specific reference to West Virginia?"
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2925.164,2927.301,"No, your are correct."
1978.77-1810,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2931.801,2932.333,I see.
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2932.333,2942.181,Which and there was fear that the Senate Finance Committee version of higher gross in that tax would sweep up West Virginia's tax and incur the wrath senate burden and so on.
1978.77-1810,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2943.592,2951.877,"The theory was based on the fact that the total tax burden -- you taken into accrued taxes imposed by neighboring states on the retail sale, at least of the idea."
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2954.571,2958.362,"Well, now I think the fear was simply using the word gross."
1978.77-1810,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2958.362,2958.752,I see.
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2958.752,2962.946,"Gross, it would have up swept up gross proceeds tax."
1978.77-1810,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2978.566,2983.786,The significant difference between West Virginia and New Mexico is the absence in that State of the credit against --
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,2983.786,3005.423,"Yes, yes, but the higher gross or net tax language seem to focus on a credit situation such as New Mexico's and look at a generation tax in isolation and then when that language has abandoned, higher gross or net tax, you go, we move to straight to the greater tax burden test which is precisely the constitutional test and that's why I say it's a restatement."
1978.77-1810,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3005.423,3014.278,"Taking the analogies there further, go back to my hypothetical of two power plants in the Four Corners area, one selling out of state, one selling instate."
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,3024.144,3046.884,"Yes, I think west Virginia had a tax on the different level of distribution but under the total tax burden test that wouldn't make any difference and so I think I'm not sure also I'm not familiar with West Virginia's tax situation exactly but I think the rate of taxes for the two different plants were slightly different Your Honor."
1978.77-1810,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3061.546,3063.351,Was that because there's another tax in additional to generating --
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,3063.351,3073.367,Yeah there were -- I think there were two tax statutes there involved but that's also our case in that sense.
1978.77-1810,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3130.273,3138.943,In your argument this statute is meaningless and unnecessary is that correct or if it doesn't add or subtract anything from the Constitution?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,3138.943,3178.579,"It's still a legislation Your Honor, but that's all politically the utilities were able to accomplish them and that's set forth clearly I think in pages 85 through 88 of the appendix where Arizona Public Services Council writes directly to Senator Fannin proposing the greater tax burden test to get around West Virginia and the strategy is made very clear at the end of page 88 and he says, finally its imperative that a clear legislative history be made, without it we could dream up another dozen arguments."
1978.77-1810,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3187.335,3192.95,"Of course isn't that all the legislative history you have, those two letters?"
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,3192.95,3198.349,No there is legislative history about the discriminatory nature of New Mexico's tax.
1978.77-1810,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3198.349,3206.711,Yes but beyond the senate aren't those two letters all the legislative history you have?
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,3212.398,3214.393,I think basically that's all we have and I think that's --
1978.77-1810,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3214.393,3226.091,"Isn't that pretty thin legislative history to support your view, when it was so clear in the Senate side that the bill was aimed at the New Mexico tax?"
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,3226.091,3233.854,"Well it was so clear but it related to a different test of discrimination Your Honor, it related to higher gross or net tax that's a substantially different."
1978.77-1810,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3233.854,3235.225,Exactly.
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,3235.225,3235.895,The Senate Finance Committee --
1978.77-1810,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3235.895,3240.647,"Then how did it over come, how was it overcome, by those two letters?"
1978.77-1810,1,33328,jan_e_unna,,3240.647,3250.21,"The test was changed and none of the official legislative history relates to the second test, the greater tax burden test and that's the crucial test that we have here."
1978.77-1810,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3258.723,3259.151,Very well.
1978.77-1810,2,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,3264.818,3268.167,"Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, a few very brief points."
1978.77-1810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3368.909,3377.983,Let me ask you just the matter of fact take the public service company is that the name of the one the companies in New Mexico --
1978.77-1810,2,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,3377.983,3379.169,"Public Service Company of New Mexico, that's correct."
1978.77-1810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3379.169,3381.905,It generates and it sells at retail.
1978.77-1810,2,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,3381.905,3383.177,"Yes, that's correct Mr. Justice."
1978.77-1810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3383.177,3398.176,"Now, when it gets all through with paying its gross receipts tax and its generating tax, whatever you call it, it is paying how much?"
1978.77-1810,2,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,3398.176,3399.706,4%.
1978.77-1810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3399.706,3401.751,It pays 4%?
1978.77-1810,2,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,3401.751,3406.963,I'm assuming that it pays the gross receipts tax I'm not sure whether it pays it or whether it just collects it from the consumer.
1978.77-1810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3406.963,3411.079,"Well whatever it is, it going to, it comes at 4%."
1978.77-1810,2,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,3411.079,3411.687,That's correct.
1978.77-1810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3411.687,3414.698,"They are paying a 4%, that particular company is paying 4%."
1978.77-1810,2,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,3414.698,3417.654,"So the fully, we are both generating retails, that's correct."
1978.77-1810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3417.654,3418.672,Exactly.
1978.77-1810,2,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,3422.412,3424.107,That's correct 2% energy tax.
1978.77-1810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3424.107,3429.984,Now why do you say -- now why is it that there is a discrimination -- is there is a discrimination there against you?
1978.77-1810,2,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,3429.984,3434.653,"Not at that level, but we are not comparable at that level because we don't retail in New Mexico."
1978.77-1810,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3456.188,3457.788,Who do they sell wholesale to?
1978.77-1810,2,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,3457.788,3461.189,"Well, I believe it sells to Points Electric, GNT."
1978.77-1810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3474.471,3476.708,You mean that the co-op is a generator?
1978.77-1810,2,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,3476.708,3478.902,I believe that's correct.
1978.77-1810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3480.646,3484.422,"Well, now you say that Public Service Company also sells at wholesale?"
1978.77-1810,2,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,3484.422,3484.897,That's correct.
1978.77-1810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3484.897,3486.877,"And, to whom does it sell?"
1978.77-1810,2,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,3486.877,3488.22,I don't believe the record reflects that.
1978.77-1810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3490.22,3494.763,"Well how do you know, does the record reflected it sells at wholesale?"
1978.77-1810,2,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,3494.763,3502.747,In the legislative history before the New Mexico legislature there are references to the fact that there are New Mexico intrastate wholesalers I --
1978.77-1810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3502.747,3506.476,Merely putting the record before us doesn't reflect that?
1978.77-1810,2,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,3506.476,3513.178,"Yes, the transcript on this appeal will include the legislative history before the New Mexico legislature."
1978.77-1810,2,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3533.373,3539.578,They save them from the tax but and they don't pay gross receipts tax?
1978.77-1810,2,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,3539.578,3541.918,"Not on a wholesale transaction, that is correct."
1978.77-1810,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3545.346,3550.352,Was this wholesaler argument that you are making now made to the New Mexico's Supreme Court?
1978.77-1810,2,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,3550.352,3558.885,Yes it was Mr. Justice Rehnquist and it was just not out within in the court below.
1978.77-1810,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3587.545,3588.629,May I ask another question?
1978.77-1810,2,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,3588.629,3589.102,"Yes, Mr. Justice."
1978.77-1810,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3589.102,3608.886,"Could the state have come our about the same and would you agree that it would have been constitutional to do it this way, to impose the 2% generation tax on both the instate and out of state sellers and to reduce the gross receipts tax across the board to 2%, that would have been constitutional."
1978.77-1810,2,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,3608.886,3617.888,"I suppose, I have never focused specifically on that question, I think it would remove the credit provision in the discriminatory treatment of which we complaint at the present time."
1978.77-1810,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3617.888,3621.598,"Dollars would probably come out about the same to, isn't?"
1978.77-1810,2,21181,daniel_j_mcauliffe,,3621.598,3627.541,"Again I'm not sure that I've never tried to cross that, I believe my time has expired Mr. Chief Justice."
1978.77-1810,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3627.541,3628.196,"Thank you, gentlemen."
