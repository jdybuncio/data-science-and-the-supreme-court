1982.81-420,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,9.939,"Now we are on Marshall against Lonberger, and Mr. Drake, you may proceed whenever you're ready."
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,9.939,13.574,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-420,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,275.195,293.907,"Counsel, is it possible that the Ohio court believed that the respondent didn't receive an explanation of the charges but that his lawyer understood them and simply enforced the lawyer's understanding?"
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,293.907,300.143,"No, Your Honor, there's never been any allegation that the Ohio trial court applied the wrong constitutional standard or review."
1982.81-420,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,300.143,307.13,"Well, it's not crystal clear, is it, what the Ohio court was deciding?"
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,307.13,311.201,The issue before the Ohio court in the evidentiary hearing was in fact crystal clear.
1982.81-420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,365.519,373.875,"But it is true that the Ohio court did not say in so many words that the defendant knew he was charged with attempt, did it?"
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,373.875,387.283,"Your Honor, I would... in response to your question I would refer the Court to this Court's decision in LaVallee v. Delle Rose wherein this Court indicated that given a straightforward factual consideration--"
1982.81-420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,387.283,389.968,"Well, it seems to me you can answer my question without referring to another case."
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,389.968,390.901,"--I'm sorry, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,390.901,397.221,The trial court did not in so many words find that he had been aware of the fact that he was charged with attempt.
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,397.221,399.24,"Not expressly, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,402.358,406.429,You infer that from the finding that he intelligently and voluntarily entered his plea.
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,406.429,409.548,"I believe it would be logically inconsistent not to infer that, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,409.548,413.333,Is the indictment in the papers before us?
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,413.333,414.216,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,420.004,420.937,Two?
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,420.937,422.789,"The Illinois indictment is at page 2, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,422.789,427.926,"Well, I was thinking about... yes, Illinois indictment, that's right."
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,427.926,428.526,Yes.
1982.81-420,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,428.976,440.15,"And counsel stipulated, as you've just said, that that was sufficient in law and fact and sustained a finding of guilty."
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,440.15,442.769,"On the charges, plural, yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,0,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,442.769,443.152,Yes.
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,448.006,451.458,He conceded that he was at the Ohio evidentiary hearing.
1982.81-420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,552.074,557.144,"General Drake, may I ask you a question about Ohio nomenclature?"
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,562.512,563.548,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,592.299,599.304,"Well, and the Ohio Court of Appeals reversed or set aside the death sentence, did it not?"
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,599.304,601.939,"Yes, Your Honor, on a ground wholly unrelated to this case."
1982.81-420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,601.939,606.125,"Well, why doesn't the whole question of specifications wash out at that point?"
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,617.866,619.301,"Your Honor, that was our argument."
1982.81-420,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,814.561,821.482,"Mr. Drake, did the court look at anything other than the bare transcript from Illinois that we have in the record?"
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,821.482,837.76,The only tangential allusion by the Court of Appeals to any other facet of the Illinois guilty plea is that the Ohio trial court did not make an express finding regarding the credibility of the respondent.
1982.81-420,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,840.01,849.651,Was there a record from Illinois before the court with all of the documents in it and any written plea agreement or anything of that--
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,849.651,856.472,"--The three documents before the court were the Illinois indictment, the Illinois judgment entry, and the--"
1982.81-420,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,856.472,857.605,--And the transcript?
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,857.605,858.305,--Transcript.
1982.81-420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,864.76,878.235,"Of course, it isn't entirely accurate to say that the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit didn't pay attention to anything except the transcript of the guilty plea in Illinois."
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,885.757,891.811,"Your Honor, it mentioned insofar as it stated them in some manner."
1982.81-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1003.965,1006.834,"Mr. Drake, one thing worries me."
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1028.349,1030.765,"You're referring to the Ohio trial judge, Your Honor?"
1982.81-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1030.765,1031.467,"Yes, sir."
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1031.467,1035.769,"He did, in fact, listen to the respondent's testimony."
1982.81-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1037.103,1042.907,"Well, what are you complaining about on that point about him relying on the Illinois record?"
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1042.907,1045.525,"--Your Honor, we're not complaining."
1982.81-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1050.929,1052.048,And you make no complaint about that.
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1052.048,1053.031,No.
1982.81-420,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1066.891,1070.942,I'm at a loss as to why you keep mentioning it.
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1074.478,1086.686,"The reason I mention it, Your Honor, is because the court below refused to consider the very factors upon which the Ohio trial court predicated its determination that that Illinois guilty plea was intelligently entered."
1982.81-420,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1137.904,1146.843,"Mr. Drake, twice you've referred to the Sixth Circuit as doing this sua sponte."
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1155.263,1163.435,"Well, Your Honor, I, as an attorney, would have liked to briefed and argued the case in light of this Court's decision in Sumner v. Mata."
1982.81-420,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1181.247,1189.753,I suspect on many remands from here for reconsideration in light of another case the courts of appeal would do precisely this.
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1189.753,1192.954,"I did not mean to be overly critical of the court below, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1264.966,1280.643,"Mr. Drake, incidentally, is there any indication in the Ohio record why the judge and the prosecutor refused to accept Lonberger's offer to stipulate to the prior conviction?"
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1280.643,1281.393,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1284.128,1289.082,Is there any state interest involved in that refusal that you can identify?
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1289.082,1290.618,"--No, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1376.804,1382.275,"Well, I gather in Spencer the prior convictions were concededly all valid, weren't they?"
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1382.275,1384.144,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1384.144,1390.713,Whereas here at least we have a holding that the guilty plea in Illinois was invalid.
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1390.713,1392.63,In--
1982.81-420,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1392.63,1393.782,We do.
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1393.782,1394.315,--Yes.
1982.81-420,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1394.315,1400.486,"And in Burgett, I gather, we had all invalid prior convictions, didn't we?"
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1400.486,1402.188,"Of a very specific nature, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1402.188,1402.655,Yes.
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1402.655,1405.223,It is my opinion in my reading of--
1982.81-420,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1405.223,1406.873,But you don't think there's a distinction between--
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1406.873,1408.259,--No.
1982.81-420,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1408.259,1416.781,--Valid and invalid prior convictions for the purposes of this case?
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1416.781,1419.4,I believe there's clearly a distinction between this case and that in Burgett.
1982.81-420,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1436.942,1449.836,"In other words, you're saying that that... if it had any bearing, the status of the Illinois conviction would bear only on the death penalty aspect of the case and not on anything that occurred after the death penalty was set aside."
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1449.836,1450.386,Yes.
1982.81-420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1528.086,1537.66,"Mr. Drake, wouldn't that have required Burdette, or Burgett, rather, to be decided the other way, because wasn't there a limiting instruction there and wasn't it offered just for enhancement purposes?"
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1537.66,1545.881,"--But Burgett, Loper v. Betto, all the decisions stemming from Burgett have been limited to Gideon v. Wainwright type contexts."
1982.81-420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1548.333,1558.14,"Well, I understand it's a different constitutional thing, but if you... insofar as your harmless error argument is made, wouldn't that also have been valid in the Burgett situation?"
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1558.14,1573.067,--This Court apparently found that the use of uncounseled convictions was so inherently prejudicial that the actual... in point of fact in Burgett the uncounseled convictions were never even presented to the jury.
1982.81-420,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1604.419,1619.112,Are you suggesting that the Burgett opinion said anything to the effect that only uncounseled convictions were invalid for the purposes of the Burgett rule?
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1619.112,1622.314,"Your Honor, I'm reading Burgett narrowly, yes."
1982.81-420,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1622.314,1623.25,You certainly are.
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1623.25,1623.783,Yes.
1982.81-420,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1623.783,1628.285,"No other invalid convictions would have the benefit of the Burgett rule, is that it?"
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1628.285,1630.57,"This Court has never so held, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1642.394,1647.281,"Yes, but can you show me anything in the Burgett opinion which suggests what you're arguing?"
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1647.281,1648.015,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1652.685,1669.029,"Counsel, what difficulties would the state face in bifurcating the evidence for purposes of sentencing as opposed to putting it on initially at the guilt or innocence phase?"
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1669.029,1684.621,"In this particular context... and I'm dealing with Ohio laws that existed... there's the unfortunate specter that jeopardy might have attached when the jury returned a verdict of guilty into aggravated murder, because the death penalty specification, we're talking about a unitary proceeding."
1982.81-420,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1695.379,1703.218,Even if the charges were filed initially in a way to indicate that that would be the procedure?
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1703.218,1708.606,--That is a very limited answer to your question as far as the entire ramifications across the nation.
1982.81-420,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1722.079,1736.006,"Well, in the face of the stipulation that was offered, I still... it's still unclear to me what interest the state would have in introducing the evidence of prior convictions in the guilt/innocent phase."
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1736.006,1738.073,--You're talking about this particular case?
1982.81-420,0,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1738.073,1738.458,Yes.
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1738.458,1739.858,"Again, I did not try the case."
1982.81-420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1762.573,1763.44,Can I just ask one other question?
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1789.724,1795.294,"As Burgett is being read by the court below, it wouldn't alter our presence before this Court."
1982.81-420,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1801.465,1806.519,Except that it wouldn't have affected any of the... it only could have affected the death penalty then.
1982.81-420,0,39112,richard_david_drake,,1810.304,1813.339,"Your Honor, I honestly fail to see the difference."
1982.81-420,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1826.23,1831.532,Mr. Czarnecki.
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,1831.532,1834.417,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1982.81-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1918.822,1920.657,"Well, does that really bear on the case here?"
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,1929.964,1930.48,No.
1982.81-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1999.375,2001.143,Constitutionally invalid?
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2001.143,2006.445,--It was certainly invalid to show a conviction for attempted murder.
1982.81-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2006.445,2009.147,"Yes, but do you say it was constitutionally invalid?"
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2009.147,2011.766,"The conviction statement itself, Your Honor, was facially invalid."
1982.81-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2011.766,2014.884,Was this procedural invalidity?
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2016.986,2022.557,"Well, simply stated, it did not say that Robert Lonberger had been convicted of attempted murder, period."
1982.81-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2039.186,2045.505,I'm still asking is this a constitutional invalidity to admit it then?
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2048.707,2056.795,"--I would think that it doesn't rise to the level of constitutional invalidity, no, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2056.795,2061.599,"So in that sense it's not like the prior convictions in Burgett, is it?"
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2061.599,2063.967,"Well, I'm sorry."
1982.81-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2155.894,2165.332,"Well, counsel, why do you think the Sixth Circuit said in its opinion that no explicit findings were made concerning Lonberger's credibility as a witness?"
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2172.022,2177.057,I'm not sure that I'd like to read that into the Sixth Circuit's opinion.
1982.81-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2177.057,2179.009,Why do you think they said it?
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2179.009,2189.198,As an observation that the facts that they were finding need not be given the deference that 2254(D) normally requires.
1982.81-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2189.198,2196.352,"Well, but doesn't that suggest to you that they were giving some credibility to Lonberger's testimony, the Sixth Circuit?"
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2196.352,2197.221,The Sixth Circuit?
1982.81-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2199.604,2204.375,"If so, how can you reconcile that with LaVallee v. Delle Rose in 410 U.S.?"
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2204.375,2220.336,"Well, I would distinguish that case, Your Honor, in that that was a case remanded with specific instructions; that was a case remanded with a specific legal standard to be applied; and that the question to be answered by the state court was fairly clear on the issue of voluntariness."
1982.81-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2336.041,2348.366,"Would you think that a federal habeas court... if an Ohio court in this case had said we do not believe Lonberger when he testified, do you think a federal habeas court would entitled to say well, we think he should have been believed?"
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2348.366,2352.17,"I would find that very difficult to support, Your Honor."

1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2426.483,2432.72,"--Your Honor, Mr. Lonberger's explanation is not the explanation of 11 lawyers."
1982.81-420,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2438.022,2442.926,"When he answered... the judge then repeated, ""Do you understand that""?"
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2456.335,2465.608,"--At the risk of appearing to be engaging levity, Your Honor, we have to also ignore the fact that the trial judge could not have taken this plea."
1982.81-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2609.752,2613.204,Does that really have anything at all to do with our review here?
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2613.204,2614.87,"--I think it does, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2616.406,2617.606,Because of the harmless error?
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2617.606,2619.941,"--Yes, of the harmless error made by the state is important."
1982.81-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2662.887,2668.355,"Mr. Czarnecki, do you think that Spencer and Burgett are completely reconcilable?"
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2668.355,2670.474,"Yes, sir, I absolutely do."
1982.81-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2670.474,2677.278,"They were both... one was six-three and the other was five to four, and they certainly point in two completely opposite directions."
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2677.278,2678.48,"I don't believe so, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2680.599,2683.032,Even as to the limiting instructions?
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2683.032,2683.332,Yes.
1982.81-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2683.332,2688.168,How would you reconcile Spencer's treatment of limiting instructions with Burgett's?
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2688.168,2698.56,"Spencer, as I began to say, first noted that limiting instructions... I think one has to back up a moment and analyze Spencer in its entirety."
1982.81-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2767.037,2769.489,"That was an element of the offense, in Burgett, wasn't it?"
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2769.489,2770.189,"--In both cases, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2770.189,2770.889,In both cases.
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2773.574,2774.708,"Yes, it was, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2774.708,2781.814,"The specification washed out of the case when the Ohio Court of Appeals reversed the death sentence, I would have thought."
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2781.814,2785.499,The Ohio courts have held prior convictions to be elements.
1982.81-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2785.499,2787.118,To be what?
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2787.118,2793.855,"Prior convictions in recidivism cases, Ohio has a number of statutes which, for instance, the--"
1982.81-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2793.855,2795.724,I am talking about this particular case.
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2795.724,2797.907,--The trial court had held that it was an element.
1982.81-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2797.907,2806.829,"Yes, but did it play... was it one of the elements upon which the conviction which was actually sustained against him was based?"
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2806.829,2808.781,"No, it was not."
1982.81-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2808.781,2811.733,"So really, it's different from Burgett in that sense."
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2811.733,2812.849,"No, it isn't."
1982.81-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2812.849,2830.195,"Well, I think that in Burgett the invalid conviction was an element of the substantive offense, and here it's simply... was a question of some evidence coming before the jury that proved to be quite irrelevant in the light of the Ohio Court of Appeals ruling."
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2830.195,2837.984,"Your Honor, in Burgett, just as in this case, the validity of the prior conviction was raised apparently mid-trial."
1982.81-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2881.211,2895.22,"Well, it would have to do no more than take some of our later cases such as Parker against Randolph which said that juries are usually presumed to follow the instructions that courts give them to say that Burgett may have been too categorical on that point."
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2901.557,2907.028,"--Your Honor, I don't think that the opinion supports the state's position on that issue."
1982.81-420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2966.548,2969.618,Could I ask you another point.
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2991.115,2995.084,"--I'm not sure that it did, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2996.602,2997.236,And why is that?
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,2998.219,3001.238,"--Because it was a mixed finding, certainly a mixed finding of fact and law."
1982.81-420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3001.238,3004.256,And what if it was?
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3007.042,3010.094,It exempted from the application of 2254--
1982.81-420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3010.094,3010.594,Under what case?
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3010.594,3018.265,"--Under the second decision of this Court in Sumner versus Matta last term, the memo opinion remanding the case to the Ninth Circuit."
1982.81-420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3027.371,3037.763,And the court is free to independently look at the same record and come out with a different conclusion?
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3037.763,3043.417,"The federal courts have regularly, Your Honor, assigned constitutional significance to given facts."
1982.81-420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3045.017,3048.135,So what's the answer to my question?
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3063.561,3065.18,"--I think that argument could be made, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3066.863,3067.932,Why not?
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3067.932,3075.036,--Because the Sixth Circuit expressly said that it disagrees with the factual finding of the Ohio court.
1982.81-420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3095.932,3103.371,So you say the court of appeals said that the Ohio court really didn't do its Job in making the kind of findings that it should have.
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3103.371,3107.507,"--I think that's correct, Your Honor, and I think that that is the heart of 2254--"
1982.81-420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3107.507,3119.481,That's only on the basis of the... why do you say you can't tell that the Ohio court made the necessary findings?
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3119.481,3128.571,"--Because, Your Honor, it would have been... I'm bemused by the fact that the court made certain factual findings which are, in my view, irrelevant to the central question."
1982.81-420,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3159.125,3170.6,Do you make these observations concerning the Sixth Circuit's view of the credibility aspect of Longberger's credibility?
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3170.6,3198.1,"I'm not sure, Your Honor, that the state... even assuming arguendo that the trial judge did not believe Robert Longberger... I am not willing to suggest that a state court could, without any other evidence, on an issue as crucial as this, hold that the state has borne a heavy burden, a burden that some of the circuits have characterized as requiring clear and convincing evidence,--"
1982.81-420,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3198.1,3214.978,"Well, what would a factfinder sitting as a juror believe about the credibility of Longberger against the background that's in the record here of his criminal activities all his life?"
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3217.561,3218.763,"--I don't think so, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3218.763,3219.73,You don't think so?
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3219.73,3220.213,"No, I do not."
1982.81-420,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3248.883,3251.668,May I ask one question about his testimony?
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3253.118,3254.019,"We did, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3254.019,3269.129,"So your position is that if you just disregard his testimony, your opponent had the burden of proof and still hadn't met it, because the record of the Illinois trial shows a facially defective... does not show a plea of guilty to attempted murder."
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3269.129,3270.163,That's precisely right.
1982.81-420,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3270.163,3278.819,"So they had the burden of going outside the record and proving attempted murder, and they didn't... you could take his testimony outside the record, and you would still argue that they didn't sustain their burden."
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3278.819,3280.254,"That's absolutely correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3280.254,3282.204,So we don't really have to care much about credibility.
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3282.204,3283.206,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3328.985,3330.104,But what's the burden on the state?
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3330.104,3339.725,"--In our position, Your Honor, this Court has repeatedly held that the burden is always on the state to show a waiver of important constitutional rights."
1982.81-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3353.969,3363.175,What about an official record of a plea taken in a court of competent jurisdiction that on its face shows no constitutional defect?
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3363.175,3381.469,"Your Honor, this Court made a decision in a case precisely like that in Blackledge versus Allison, and it suggested that even in a record that is absolutely proper and regular on its face, the defendant, by coming forward with some evidence to cast doubt upon the validity of that conviction should be entitled to a hearing to rebut those charges."
1982.81-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3383.738,3385.788,What evidence did this defendant come forward with?
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3385.788,3390.742,I think the Court must understand that this defendant started from a different place.
1982.81-420,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3406.937,3412.306,"Why do you allege, then... why do you say it was insufficient on its face?"
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3412.306,3429.867,"Your Honor, in the criminal practice in my experience, the fact of a prior conviction is proved by the state's introduction of a judgment entry or what is often called, and was called in this case, a conviction statement."
1982.81-420,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3429.867,3436.456,"Yes, a conviction statement reflected the aggravated battery and the attempted murder, didn't it?"
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3436.456,3436.956,"No, it did not, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3447.245,3451.733,"And the state then introduced the transcript to supplement what the ""et cetera"" was."
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3451.733,3453.083,"--That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3453.083,3459.386,And the transcript reflected the attempted murder as well as the aggravated battery.
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3459.386,3461.071,"I do not believe that it did, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,3466.725,3474.146,"Well, whether the defendant understood it is another question, but the transcript reflected that the judge understood it, anyway, right?"
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3474.146,3485.187,"--The judge understood that he was taking a plea for attempt, which, incidentally, is something of an unusual charge in that it generally encompasses some other offense."
1982.81-420,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3491.441,3497.412,"Is it correct that the transcript doesn't ever include the words ""attempted murder""?"
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3497.412,3499.196,"That's correct, Your Honor, absolutely."
1982.81-420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3499.196,3500.946,It says attempt with a knife.
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3500.946,3502.231,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3509.485,3510.671,But not an attempted battery.
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3510.671,3512.304,"No, an aggravated battery, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3512.304,3515.623,But what other than murder would you attempt with a knife?
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3515.623,3536.053,"Your Honor, if one, as my client puts it, attempted on a victim, attempted to cut a victim with a knife, under my reading... and I think I would be free to suggest that the state would agree... of Illinois law, that act without more would constitute an aggravated battery; an attempt to injure with a deadly weapon."
1982.81-420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3589.754,3593.491,"Well, let's suppose two or three situations."
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3613.989,3614.922,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3614.922,3623.177,"Now, suppose the judge says I find it to be a voluntary and intelligent plea and valid."
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3626.046,3630.498,I think that's too much of a legal conclusion given the fact that--
1982.81-420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3630.498,3640.722,"Well, we have cases and plenty of them that would say that even if all the judge said was I find the plea to be valid."
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3652.364,3654.464,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3679.514,3685.085,"Well, the record maybe, but that was the finding of the state court."
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3685.085,3689.637,"That's correct, Your Honor, but that finding must be supported in the record."
1982.81-420,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3689.637,3694.524,I'm going back to your statement just before Justice White's question to you.
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3727.162,3727.778,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3727.778,3732.816,"And attempt, one to 20."
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3741.854,3748.658,The Court's question would force me into the defendant's mind some 11 years in the past.
1982.81-420,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3750.777,3752.562,What would you understand about it?
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3753.695,3755.447,--The standard is not what I would understand--
1982.81-420,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3755.447,3758.031,"That there were two crimes, and one was much more serious than the other."
1982.81-420,1,29546,john_czarnecki,,3761.418,3768.572,"--But I don't believe the standard, Your Honor, is what an ordinary person would understand as the state presents, or what any other person would understand."
1982.81-420,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3776.095,3777.078,I see.
1982.81-420,2,39112,richard_david_drake,,3780.696,3782.046,"Yes, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,2,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3833.665,3835.265,Let me ask you about that.
1982.81-420,3,29546,john_czarnecki,,3852.726,3853.559,The respondent.
1982.81-420,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3853.559,3855.094,"The respondent, but--"
1982.81-420,3,29546,john_czarnecki,,3855.094,3856.128,It was respondent's motion.
1982.81-420,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3857.696,3861.648,"--Was it a motion to prevent the state from using it, rather than a motion for permission?"
1982.81-420,3,29546,john_czarnecki,,3861.648,3867.969,"--It was essentially a motion in limiting... it was a motion to dismiss the death penalty specification, but it was essentially a collateral attack on that Illinois guilty plea."
1982.81-420,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3871.956,3882.661,"Well, would you be content to take the position that we can simply look at the Illinois guilty plea proceeding, and that's all the evidence you need?"
1982.81-420,3,29546,john_czarnecki,,3887.482,3889.251,"That is the presumption, but evidence--"
1982.81-420,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3889.251,3890.951,We don't have to get involved in credibility at all.
1982.81-420,3,29546,john_czarnecki,,3890.951,3892.117,"--You don't have to, but--"
1982.81-420,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3892.117,3911.581,"It was an indictment that charged attempted murder, and even though the judge was a little imprecise in saying... just mentioning the aggravated battery and the word ""attempt"" without ever using the word ""murder"", the fact that the indictment mentioned attempted murder and the fact that we can presume counsel normally tell their clients what the charge is, that's enough for your position?"
1982.81-420,3,29546,john_czarnecki,,3911.581,3915.7,"--Absent some evidence, credible evidence, by the accused, yes."
1982.81-420,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3915.7,3916.119,No.
1982.81-420,3,29546,john_czarnecki,,3919.02,3920.92,"In this particular record, yes."
1982.81-420,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3925.44,3927.709,"Then our task is limited to two questions, as I see it."
1982.81-420,3,29546,john_czarnecki,,3932.611,3935.53,"And, of course, whether or not he was arraigned and otherwise notified."
1982.81-420,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3950.306,3953.825,"But in Henderson, didn't they read the indictment to him?"
1982.81-420,3,29546,john_czarnecki,,3953.825,3954.777,"No, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3955.66,3956.877,That didn't appear in the record?
1982.81-420,3,29546,john_czarnecki,,3956.877,3960.098,--That was the very pivotal in... there were two issues.
1982.81-420,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3968.953,3969.603,That's right.
1982.81-420,3,29546,john_czarnecki,,3969.603,3970.786,"Therefore, he was never arraigned on it."
1982.81-420,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3984.546,3985.979,That's in Henderson.
1982.81-420,3,29546,john_czarnecki,,3985.979,3990.383,That coupled with his intellectual deficiency made it quasi-credible.
1982.81-420,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3990.383,3993.902,Is it clear that the indictment was read to the defendant in this case?
1982.81-420,3,29546,john_czarnecki,,3993.902,3999.056,"He said he was arraigned, despite Mr. Czarnecki's contrary--"
1982.81-420,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,3999.056,4001.356,He pled guilty to the indictment.
1982.81-420,3,29546,john_czarnecki,,4001.356,4002.874,--He pled guilty to the original charge--
1982.81-420,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4002.874,4003.807,Not guilty to the indictment.
1982.81-420,3,29546,john_czarnecki,,4003.807,4011.13,--He pled guilty while represented by competent counsel to the original charges on which he said he was indicted... I'm sorry... arraigned twice.
1982.81-420,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4011.13,4013.398,Was he present when he pled not guilty?
1982.81-420,3,29546,john_czarnecki,,4013.398,4018.267,"He said, they took me before a court and arraigned me."
1982.81-420,3,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4019.802,4026.29,What I'm trying to find out is does the record show whether or not the defendant was present when the indictment was read?
1982.81-420,3,29546,john_czarnecki,,4026.29,4032.21,"--Yes, Mr. Lonberger indicated that he was present; that he was arraigned."
1982.81-420,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4037.264,4039.448,I thought he said he went three or four times.
1982.81-420,3,29546,john_czarnecki,,4044.401,4048.655,He indicated he was arraigned twice and that he had a hearing with the--
1982.81-420,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,4048.655,4052.607,Then my answer is which one of these was the indictment read to him?
1982.81-420,3,29546,john_czarnecki,,4054.642,4057.292,"--He did not indicate that it was ever read to him, is the answer."
1982.81-420,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4057.292,4059.094,"In fact, isn't it a little stronger than that?"
1982.81-420,3,29546,john_czarnecki,,4067.833,4071.735,"The transcript you have is only of the guilty plea, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,3,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,4071.735,4075.223,"Yes, whatever we have from Illinois; we do have some transcript from Illinois."
1982.81-420,3,29546,john_czarnecki,,4079.341,4080.475,"That's correct, Your Honor."
1982.81-420,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4080.475,4084.578,"Thank you, gentlemen, the case is submitted."
