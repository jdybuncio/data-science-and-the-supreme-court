1977.76-709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,51.344,"We will hear arguments next in Butz against Economou, No. 709."
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,55.508,58.987,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,79.655,87.89,Mr. Friedman excuse me for interrupting you so soon but you say it is a damage suit growing out of an administrative proceeding.
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,93.903,103.096,No Mr. Justice because the fact of this case is that complaint which filed and there was a motion to dismiss on the grounds of immunity.
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,114.425,125.147,Does not that put us in something of an awkward position and that we are asked to rule on defense on the merits where in fact there might be no federal jurisdiction?
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,125.147,150.88,"Well, the problem Mr. Justice is the District Court dismissed this suit and the Court of Appeals reversed the dismissal saying that the immunity in this case was not what the District Court held and therefore as the case now stands it goes back to the District Court to consider these other issues and we have brought the case here because we think the threshold ruling on immunity was erroneous."
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,150.88,153.317,What if I asked you what the jurisdiction was?
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,153.317,159.461,Well the jurisdiction was asserted under a large number of different sections in the complaint.
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,159.461,163.95,Would you think any of them is sustainable?
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,163.95,164.997,I am not certain of that.
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,181.898,188.63,"In terms of this jurisdiction, not whether they stated the cause of action or some of those -- is any of them sustainable?"
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,188.63,190.826,I suspect probably.
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,190.826,192.14,You suspect probably?
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,192.14,205.607,"Yes, because it is in sense similar to many of these cases which have brought suits against government officials for damages based upon their actions taken in performance of their duty."
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,205.607,208.466,Sort of the Bivens type of suit?
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,208.466,214.69,We suggest this is not the Bivens type of suit because that in fact involved a constitutional claim.
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,230.489,235.251,That was diversity jurisdiction.
1977.76-709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,235.251,238.21,Now you said Mr. Friedman you thought you suspect that.
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,255.743,265.859,"Well, the only one that I could see that they rely on that conceivably might be with Section 1331 which is the federal question jurisdiction."
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,285.481,287.985,That is a federal question type of suit too is it not?
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,287.985,288.941,"It is, yes."
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,300.818,303.798,Well what is the federal question in a case like that?
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,303.798,313.389,I suppose the federal question would be whether these individuals that exceeded their authority in conducting the administrative proceeding which may be enough to bring it in.
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,336.51,342.619,"You mean in the motion to dismiss, no one ever moved to dismiss for want of jurisdiction?"
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,342.619,355.468,The only motion that was filed for want of jurisdiction was in respect to the suit against the Department of Agriculture in the commodity credit authority and that was on the ground that was barred by sovereign immunity.
1977.76-709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,366.293,375.679,I suspect Mr. Friedman that the dialog continues that may well develop to be the case but we will affirm that up to the end of the argument?
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,375.679,381.198,We will be if the court wishes we would of course submit a memorandum on this topic.
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,570.397,572.697,That was in the separate proceeding from this one?
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,572.697,574.885,That was a separate proceeding.
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,610.231,618.001,This complaint was filed then while review was either pending or open on Administrative Review in the Second Circuit.
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,618.001,620.802,This was filed before that Mr. Justice.
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,799.835,804.549,Where is that in the appendix if you have it right at hand Mr. Friedman?
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,804.549,806.079,The complaint you mean?
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,806.079,807.358,"No, the press release."
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,807.358,820.749,"Oh, the press release itself is not set forth in the appendix but the cover sheet to the press release is set forth at page 150."
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1059.127,1076.349,"Mr. Friedman, in Barr, did the court indicate that the absolute immunity came up with there would apply to actions outside the scope of authority?"
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1076.349,1079.609,"It has to be what they say, that was --"
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1079.609,1081.05,How do you interpret that?
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1081.05,1082.895,The outer perimeter of this authority?
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1082.895,1085.414,Yes.
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1091.159,1092.102,I would suppose so.
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1095.215,1101.617,"What if it turns out later that the court decides that he had no authority whatsoever to do it, he just made a mistake?"
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1101.617,1104.194,"Well, I think that is what the immunity was intended to protect, Mr. Justice."
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1104.194,1106.54,"Yes, so it does not have to be within the scope?"
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1106.54,1110.677,It was within the general scope of his authority.
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1110.677,1112.276,I mean the kind of thing --
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1112.276,1113.212,That is right.
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1120.724,1133.571,"What would you say if it had been decided in the case that an official had no authority to a certain act under a statute and in the next time, he did it anyway, knowing that he had no such authority?"
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1133.571,1136.778,Then I would think he was clearly acting beyond his authority.
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1136.778,1140.848,"Well, then no absolute immunity and no immunity at all?"
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1140.848,1152.273,"I would think not, I would think that because if he is acting beyond his authority, he does not have any immunity at all or if he is acting patently beyond his authority."
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1152.273,1160.669,What if a complaint alleges that he entered this person knowing that he had no authority into the statute to act as he did?
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1160.669,1170.005,"I think it is not the allegation that he said knowingly, I think the question is whether in fact what he was doing was within his assigned duty--"
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1170.005,1176.263,"No, but the allegation is he did it maliciously in the sense he knew he was acting beyond the scope of his authority."
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1176.263,1178.706,I do not think that is enough Mr. Justice.
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1178.706,1188.221,"Well, in my case then where he alleges, it was held last year that he had no such authority and yet he did it anyway knowing that he did not."
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1190.645,1201.646,"I think that is a different case where it has been held, where it has been held that he does not have that authority but where the allegation is only that there was no authority --"
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1201.646,1204.721,"No, but the allegation is that he knew he did not have the authority."
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1204.721,1209.225,"Well, that is the allegation that is always made in these cases Mr. Justice."
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1213.02,1226.373,I was just trying to find out what the content was of Barr’s rather careful indication that the officer must be acting within the scope of his authority and that it was a very close question in the Barr Case.
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1226.373,1232.017,Yes and it was a close question whether this particular official had the authority to issue press releases.
1977.76-709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1232.017,1242.956,If you apply Learned Hand’s test though do you not come up with a somewhat different answer to my brother Mr. White’s question because you say it is alleged in all of these cases that he knew he did not have the authority?
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1251.746,1260.4,I would say except for the one case that Justice White poses where it had been previously held that he does not have the authority.
1977.76-709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1260.4,1261.295,By whom?
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1262.777,1266.504,I assume from Justice White’s question that was held by the courts.
1977.76-709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1266.504,1267.67,This court?
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1267.67,1273.517,Presumably by a court whose ruling the official would feel obliged to observe.
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1390.161,1393.106,Mr. Friedman may I ask the question here.
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1418.511,1442.333,"We think that the auditors in this case were really performing factors which involved considerable discretion because in conducting an audit, you have to decide what you are going to look at, how intensively you are going to go into it, how much you are going to question these people and once again, it seems to us the threat of possible suit with these enormous damages being sought here."
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1466.327,1484.676,"Would you apply the same rule to an agent who is an accountant by training who is investigating a business crime or an auditor for internal revenue investigating the financial background of the possible tax prosecution, would those auditors be like FBI Agents and police or like the auditor here?"
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1484.676,1490.168,I think it might vary form case to case but I think there would be more like the auditors in this case.
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1539.388,1567.042,"Mr. Friedman, does it make any difference in your argument that here there was an administrative review proceeding open to the respondent after these government officials had performed their tasks in which he could challenge their conclusions as opposed to Barr against Matteo and Howard against Lyons or if they did not get their relief in the independent judicial suit there, apparently they would not get it at all?"
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1567.042,1579.872,"This is one of the factors, the point that you do not have to subject government officials to personal liability in order to correct, if any errors that may have been created here."
1977.76-709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1588.399,1591.584,"His damages, his injuries have not been --"
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1591.584,1594.31,His in juries of course have not been recompensed.
1977.76-709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1629.91,1634.556,"Mr. Friedman, now that I have interrupted you, may I ask a couple other questions?"
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1649.681,1653.243,That is correct with one or two possible exceptions.
1977.76-709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1684.241,1685.03,The pay?
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1685.03,1686.47,We pay for the outside council.
1977.76-709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1686.47,1692.943,"So, this is done at government’s expense, by the government or government’s expense?"
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1708.106,1712.068,"Ordinarily, the official would have to pay it out of his own pocket."
1977.76-709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1755.576,1758.706,"Generally, then as a general rule, there will be no indemnification?"
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1758.706,1759.702,"Normally, there would not."
1977.76-709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1759.702,1761.044,By the government employer?
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1761.044,1773.157,I might add that the Attorney General who has just recently proposed legislation under which these suits would be channeled away from the individual defendant to the United States.
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1801.268,1809.222,I take it you think that would meet the problems that Judge Learned Hand was raising in the Biddle Case?
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1809.222,1816.709,"I would think so and we are hopeful that this legislation will be enacted but when and how, it is difficult to predict."
1977.76-709,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1886.537,1893.632,"Mr. Friedman, let me ask you just one question here at the end, it sounds very specific."
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1926.812,1927.836,"Well, I am not sure."
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1958.679,1978.581,"Mr. Friedman, how about the investigator, I mean, the government agencies acting within the scope of his authority as you understand it to for example make arrest without warrants or in unusual circumstances making searches without warrants, he just happens to make a mistake?"
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1978.581,1983.043,"Well, that it seems to me that the investigator brings up a different problem."
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1983.043,1986.716,Well these are Government officials; he has a great deal of discretion?
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1986.716,1992.081,This court has recognized in Pierson against Ray that police officers --
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1992.081,1993.125,1983 is it not?
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1993.125,1994.442,1983.
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1994.442,1999.449,"I know that has nothing to do with it with the federal investigation, I thought you indicated."
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,1999.449,2010.026,"Yes, but also at common law traditionally, police officers have had in effect a qualified immunity that has been tradition --."
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2010.026,2017.128,"So, there is some line somewhere in the federal hierarchy that there is no absolute immunity at this?"
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2017.128,2025.735,"At some lower level, if the discretion that a police officer exercises in deciding whether or not to arrest someone or whether to break down the door --"
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2025.735,2027.203,Pretty broad discretion?
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2027.203,2035.626,It involves discretion but probably not the kind of policy discretion that the immunity principle is designed further.
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2059.937,2061.493,And they all have savings?
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2061.493,2062.088,What?
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2062.088,2064.543,And they may all have savings?
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2064.543,2069.887,"They may, but this I think is a special case."
1977.76-709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2096.788,2100.776,Mr. Friedman you have relied on this specifically on Barr against Matteo.
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2111.209,2112.985,Yes.
1977.76-709,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2112.985,2119.694,Do you think there is a sufficient analogy between at least some of these defendants and prosecutors to bring them under the umbrella of that doctrine?
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2119.694,2121.814,We have suggested that Mr. Justice.
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2154.962,2158.501,The witnesses maybe absolutely immune for their testimony?
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2158.501,2159.501,Yes.
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2159.501,2167.476,"But the auditors might have been witnesses that are absolutely immune for that but they also were investigators, were they not?"
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2167.476,2171.368,They were investigating and that we think --
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2171.368,2177.529,In that role are they more like Federal Bureau of Investigation or a police or what?
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2177.529,2180.538,"It is hard to say, they are somewhere in between I think."
1977.76-709,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2187.984,2199.841,"The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit discussed briefly casually but did not take it much further, this analogy between at least some of these defendants and prosecutors."
1977.76-709,0,20837,daniel_m_friedman,,2204.153,2218.098,"The Court of Appeals suggested some distinctions which we do not think stand up, we think the basic purpose of the immunity is the same whether they are prosecuting a criminal case or bringing this kind of an enforcer."
