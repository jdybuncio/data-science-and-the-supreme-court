2005.05-7053,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,0.0,5.126,We'll hear argument first this morning in Dixon v. United States.
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,6.095,9.658,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-7053,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,71.906,88.472,"Mr. Jett, do I take it, from what you've just said, that you are recognizing this is a question of Federal common law and not due process, so that if Congress placed the burden on the defendant, there would be no constitutional infirmity?"
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,92.098,104.85,"Our... our first issue and our first contention is that Federal common law will govern the decision in this particular case, but we also have a due process point that we also believe is germane."
2005.05-7053,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,105.241,113.773,You... you... then you think that Congress could not say that the defendant has the burden on the question of duress.
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,113.773,125.12,"--We think that Congress could not under the... the precedents of this Court and under the... the basic common law construction that's fundamental, I think, to the... to the criminal law in this... in this country."
2005.05-7053,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,125.12,127.87,What do you do with Martin against Ohio?
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,127.87,137.904,"Well, we understand about Martin v. Ohio, Your Honor, and we think that... that based on recent precedents, Martin v. Ohio should be reconsidered."
2005.05-7053,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,173.192,181.147,"Well, there may be... there may be crimes where duress would vitiate an intent element, but there may be other crimes where it wouldn't."
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,190.556,208.856,"--Well, we think that in... that in every criminal case, with possibly the exception of... of public welfare cases, that... that there is an underlying background construction for our criminal law, which requires the Government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt criminal intent."
2005.05-7053,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,208.856,216.686,Which is the easier of the two cases for the defendant?
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,231.675,233.393,Which is easier for the state?
2005.05-7053,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,233.393,234.94,"Well, either way."
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,234.94,241.613,"Well, we... we contend that in a... a... duress is... is different."
2005.05-7053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,258.351,283.825,"I would think that it's easier in... you know, we had... we had a... this term another case in which the argument is that you cannot have a separate insanity defense essentially and... and exclude from the mens rea element of a crime the... the lack of... of mental capacity to... to have that mens rea."
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,302.314,308.66,"Well, we... we agree that... I agree... we agree that an insane person cannot form that particular intent."
2005.05-7053,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,320.1,332.524,"But... but we've held, at least under the McNaughton version of the defense, that the state... that the burden can be put on the defendant to show that he was not insane under the McNaughton--"
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,332.524,335.227,"--Well, we... and we understand that, and again, our--"
2005.05-7053,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,335.227,355.029,"--And as Justice Scalia said and as I was considering in asking my question, in your case we know that there was a conscious, knowing and intentional, in some sense, act when... when the person bought... bought the weapons."
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,364.703,382.05,"--Well, our... our... we think that they're... that they're similar because both deal with... with the mental state, and... and then historically, at least since... since 1895 in this Court, this Court has said that you've got to have the vicious will in order to constitute a crime."
2005.05-7053,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,389.63,394.381,"Well, but doesn't vicious will mean simply the will to commit the crime?"
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,394.381,396.788,"Actually, no."
2005.05-7053,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,405.509,406.759,"Well, what do you mean by vicious?"
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,414.355,414.621,--No.
2005.05-7053,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,414.621,416.621,I don't know what the added element is.
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,416.621,439.22,"The... this... this Court has... has frequently equated the vicious will with moral blameworthiness, that is, the desire to do wrong, that is, the desire to do something... to... the free desire based on the... the choice of having... being able to do the right thing or do the wrong thing and freely choosing to do the wrong thing, that is, moral blameworthiness."
2005.05-7053,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,439.22,441.204,The phrase Justice Harlan used in the Davis case.
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,441.204,442.392,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.05-7053,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,442.392,454.52,"But when you... when you say freely choosing, what you mean, I take it, is choosing with... without consideration of pressure from a third party."
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,455.614,455.88,That's correct.
2005.05-7053,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,455.88,456.099,Okay.
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,456.099,456.599,"Yes, Your Honor."
2005.05-7053,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,456.599,473.493,"But if the... the third... the third party may, indeed, exert pressure, but I take it you would agree that it is still the decision of the defendant whether to cave in to that pressure or not, whether to commit the crime or not to commit the crime."
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,473.493,477.603,We believe that would not be a voluntary act.
2005.05-7053,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,479.369,484.089,"Well, I... I don't want to get lost in... in rhetoric here."
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,508.079,508.985,"Yes, it is true."
2005.05-7053,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,508.985,509.344,Okay.
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,509.344,517.424,"But the difference is, as you pointed out, Justice Souter, that the defendant is not acting of her own free will."
2005.05-7053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,523.628,526.677,It was her will to yield to the will of someone else.
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,531.553,533.819,"Well, we... we would respectfully disagree, Judge."
2005.05-7053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,544.117,551.634,That may be a very intelligent choice on your part to do what the person with the gun at the head of your children tells you to do.
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,577.499,577.937,Well--
2005.05-7053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,577.937,585.422,But... but you're telling us that you don't have the intent to... to yield and... and to do whatever criminal act that person tells you.
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,588.282,596.597,--What... what we're saying and what I think that this Court... the precedents of this Court have said is that you have to have criminal intent.
2005.05-7053,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,602.786,607.991,"Well, what is the statutory... what is the mens rea under the statute for the offenses that the defendant was charged with?"
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,609.303,613.773,"Well, on... on seven or eight of the counts, it's knowingly."
2005.05-7053,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,666.894,671.707,"Well, counsel, under your view, how... how is the Government supposed to prove a negative in every case?"
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,674.427,678.865,"It's really no different than any other case, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.05-7053,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,691.023,698.401,But that's something that... but self defense is something that's often a... a factual element that you can discern from the circumstances of the crime.
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,719.436,722.312,"Well, we... we would respectfully disagree with that."
2005.05-7053,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,778.73,793.125,"But I thought the gist of her duress defense was not that she was under duress when she was purchasing the guns, but that she had reason to believe that her children were being threatened by accomplices or associates of... of this... this individual."
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,798.595,808.549,"--Well, what... what she was in duress about is she was told at the time that there was somebody at home with a gun who was just a cell phone call away."
2005.05-7053,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,850.667,858.497,What... what is the threshold test that the defendant has to cross before the judge will give the instruction to the jury?
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,871.282,884.769,"Well, the... the first thing the judge would have to determine is that has... has there been evidence of each of the elements of duress, and the trial judge found that we... we produced evidence of each of the elements of the duress."
2005.05-7053,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,908.43,918.056,What is the... the methodology that you think we should follow in determining where the burden should be allocated under any particular criminal statute?
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,935.247,937.545,"Well, I think you've got to look at two points in time."
2005.05-7053,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,959.488,962.082,So the burden would be different under different statutes?
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,962.082,962.504,Well--
2005.05-7053,0,15068,samuel_a_alito_jr,scotus_justice,962.504,966.942,"If we were dealing with a... with a much older criminal statute, the burden might be allocated differently?"
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,966.942,970.193,"--No, because I think the... I think you have to consider that."
2005.05-7053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,997.965,1000.731,And you have 21 States and how many circuits--
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,1000.731,1003.466,"Six circuits and 29 States, Justice Scalia."
2005.05-7053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1003.466,1003.669,--No.
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,1004.904,1010.186,"On the other side of the circuits, we count three; on the States, we count 14."
2005.05-7053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1012.42,1013.89,"Well, that's... that's sort of a horse race."
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,1034.77,1036.332,We would agree--
2005.05-7053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1036.332,1036.582,Right?
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,1040.473,1041.537,--Well--
2005.05-7053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1041.537,1051.68,"But even... even if I agreed with that, I'm not sure that, you know, 21 versus 14 is... is an overwhelming demonstration of... of the new common law."
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,1051.68,1054.352,"--But, Justice Scalia, it's 29 versus 14."
2005.05-7053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1055.415,1056.619,29 versus 14.
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,1056.619,1062.041,--But it's clearly a 2 to 1 majority in favor of placing the burden of persuasion on the Government.
2005.05-7053,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1062.041,1062.275,Okay.
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,1084.765,1096.268,We're... we're basing our argument primarily on... on the common law that has been developed in... in this country since really Davis v. United States through the present and has... has--
2005.05-7053,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1096.268,1106.456,"Mr. Jett, there's one piece of this picture that's different... that distinguishes duress from, say, self defense."
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,1150.888,1164.157,"--In my mind it would be... if it's a close question, I don't think the burden of proof in that particular circumstance would make a difference because it still is... because he would then be taking it away from the jury."
2005.05-7053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1211.948,1232.375,"Mr. Jett, a thought occurred to me, by reason of your agreement, that... that it's a one way ratchet, that when the common law changes in the... in the direction of favoring the defendant, it becomes the duty of the courts to allow that."
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,1290.965,1292.388,"Well, two reasons."
2005.05-7053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1305.077,1305.828,No.
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,1323.489,1331.709,"I think... I think that if it... if it does become part of the Due Process, then obviously Congress cannot overrule it."
2005.05-7053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1331.709,1331.974,Right.
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,1331.974,1341.836,"If it simply becomes the common law... the rule of... of the Federal courts that this Court has... has established based on its supervisory powers, then the Congress would be able to do that."
2005.05-7053,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1341.836,1344.837,"Well, it makes me suspect that Davis was wrong."
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,1344.837,1354.948,"Well, the thing about Davis that even though the... the insanity holding about Davis was overruled, the core holdings of Davis was not overruled."
2005.05-7053,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1407.131,1416.258,"May I ask, if... if you know, whether Congress has ever been asked to address this precise issue that we're debating today?"
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,1416.258,1422.087,Congress has... has never ruled on the duress defense.
2005.05-7053,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1478.349,1486.804,What about a defense that I was on drugs and... and didn't know what I was doing because of that and couldn't form the requisite intent?
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,1491.572,1501.277,"If that is a defense that is recognized by... by the common law or... or by statute, then the Government would have to do that if that particular defense--"
2005.05-7053,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1501.277,1502.589,How is the Government... how would the Government do that?
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,1502.589,1503.512,--Well--
2005.05-7053,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1503.512,1509.95,"A person just says, I was... I was on, you know, PCP or whatever and... and I couldn't form the requisite intent."
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,1509.95,1513.857,"--Well, the Government could do that much the way they do like in an entrapment defense."
2005.05-7053,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1526.109,1529.173,But that's based on the defendant's... the prosecution's conduct.
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,1534.081,1544.973,"--Justice Ginsburg, it does but it still... that case still deals with somebody overriding the will of the defendant, the Government imposing its own will on the defendant."
2005.05-7053,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1545.613,1552.302,"But if the Government is out there trying to achieve that result, it's quite different from the Government having nothing to do--"
2005.05-7053,0,31108,j_craig_jett,,1552.302,1561.695,"--Well, we... we contend that it's still the same because it's a third party, whether it's the Government or somebody else, who's overbearing the will of the accused."
2005.05-7053,0,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1564.884,1565.759,"Thank you, counsel."
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1573.417,1578.653,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court--"
2005.05-7053,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1623.724,1631.195,So there may be cases where the nature of the mens rea required would require the Government to disprove duress.
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1631.195,1634.868,"There could conceivably be such cases, Mr. Chief Justice."
2005.05-7053,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1634.868,1638.587,The sort of crimes where... where your culpability depends on your motive.
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1639.525,1648.589,"Well, if you had a crime, for example, that said someone who does something while not under... acting under duress, that would be an obvious example."
2005.05-7053,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1650.34,1651.23,It would be an easy example.
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1651.23,1652.215,--It would be an easy example.
2005.05-7053,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1655.403,1655.918,Good catch.
2005.05-7053,1,15086,john_g_roberts_jr,scotus_justice,1655.918,1663.279,"What about a... you know, a hate crime, a bias crime, you know, an act of violence done with a particular motive or intent?"
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1669.234,1670.516,--Right.
2005.05-7053,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1695.208,1698.302,The Government wouldn't... wouldn't have to disprove duress in the hate case.
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1700.084,1701.147,--Correct.
2005.05-7053,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1701.147,1707.649,"And to the extent that duress undermines that, it would be a defense considered by the jury on the hate question."
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1707.649,1710.165,"That's correct, Justice Scalia."
2005.05-7053,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1711.181,1713.776,How does self defense fit into this equation?
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1713.776,1730.169,"--The Government's position is that on self defense, the burden of proof is on the defendant, but it recognizes that there are important distinctions between self defense and duress that could allow the court to reach different conclusions about the two defenses."
2005.05-7053,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1793.011,1800.029,Why is the number of decisions... number of States have gone one way or... or the other on the issue relevant?
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1801.811,1802.264,No.
2005.05-7053,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1820.362,1839.912,"What... what if you're a judge like me who... who thinks that any significant element of... of the criminal law, when the Due Process Clause was... was adopted, remains in effect and it doesn't change with the times as you seem... as your last comment seems to have said?"
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1852.353,1854.104,"No, I don't think Davis was taking the position--"
2005.05-7053,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1854.104,1854.76,No?
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1854.76,1857.292,--that this was the common law when the Due Process Clause was adopted.
2005.05-7053,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1876.592,1878.921,"Oh, I know it was not a constitutional holding, but--"
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1878.921,1880.609,And it wasn't a holding about what--
2005.05-7053,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1880.609,1881.562,--I'll have to go back and look at it.
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1881.562,1882.124,--the early common law was--
2005.05-7053,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1882.124,1882.609,Okay.
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1882.609,1889.688,"--because it's clear that under... at the time of the Constitution, the burden of proof on all of these defenses was on the defendant."
2005.05-7053,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1969.409,1971.769,Is... is... I didn't mean to cut you off.
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,1971.769,1972.004,--No.
2005.05-7053,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,1972.004,2003.573,"I was... you have a tougher argument, don't you, when you... when you face the comparison between duress here and entrapment because it's... it's quite true in... in entrapment you're talking about the actions of a... of a third party which is causing something, but the... the ultimate determination that has to be made is a determination about the... in effect, the... the inclination, the willingness, the readiness of the defendant to have committed the act."
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2026.219,2028.204,"No, and here's the reason."
2005.05-7053,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2033.83,2036.251,"Well, the burden of going forward with evidence."
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2036.251,2036.44,No.
2005.05-7053,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,2042.238,2043.238,You mean the burden of persuasion.
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2043.238,2048.473,Burden of persuasion on the element of inducement is on the defendant.
2005.05-7053,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2100.423,2102.344,You could almost argue that the other way.
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2107.736,2119.316,"That... that's true, but again, if it was just a matter of who has access to the relevant evidence, then that would... the burden should have been on the defendant, that it wasn't just a matter of that."
2005.05-7053,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2134.711,2139.102,I'm not sure what the criteria are that I have to follow... that we have to follow in deciding the case.
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2140.353,2142.493,"No, I don't think that the Court--"
2005.05-7053,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,2142.493,2143.494,--Let me ask... let me ask you this.
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2157.45,2167.343,--It... there is nothing that I can point you to that shows there is an empirically evidence that the Government is not going to be able to deal with this burden.
2005.05-7053,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2180.096,2182.487,"Well, why is this worse in that respect?"
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2242.078,2243.484,Justice Breyer--
2005.05-7053,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2243.484,2245.516,And that's going back to Justice Kennedy's question.
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2267.928,2279.915,"--Let... let me start with... I go back to The Diana case because I think the way the Court approached the question in The Diana case is the way this Court should approach it because it dealt with the same kind of defense, necessity."
2005.05-7053,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2323.847,2326.957,"But if we're thinking of things logically, logically you're right."
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2364.23,2364.59,But--
2005.05-7053,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2364.59,2372.544,"So when you get into the practicalities of it, I see things both ways, and I'd like to find some evidence of what's actually happened."
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2372.544,2388.798,"--Well, take a recent case in which a defendant transported drugs from Mexico into the United States, and he claimed that he did that because someone threatened his family members in Mexico."
2005.05-7053,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2414.037,2415.6,If... if does that--
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2415.6,2415.913,--If he does that--
2005.05-7053,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2415.913,2417.476,"--He has a few other things, the prosecutor."
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2423.695,2424.227,--If--
2005.05-7053,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2424.227,2426.009,Where you on the night of such and such?
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2426.009,2426.446,--There are... there are other--
2005.05-7053,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2426.446,2427.696,And that's an advantage for the prosecutor.
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2427.696,2437.776,"--That's true, Justice Breyer, but what I'm saying is, that it's one thing to be able to persuade the jury through cross examination, that that is more... not more likely than not."
2005.05-7053,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2445.154,2451.139,"Of course, in the vast majority of criminal cases, there's no doubt that the person did the crime."
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2477.207,2478.191,In the ordinary case.
2005.05-7053,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2478.191,2493.523,"And I... I guess the only way we could really tell what the consequences are, as Justice Breyer would... would like us to be able to tell, is to know how many people who have gotten off on the basis of this defense have gone on to continue a life of crime."
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2495.586,2496.914,We do not have any statistics.
2005.05-7053,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2502.978,2506.433,"--We never know the consequences of our decisions, by and large, do we?"
2005.05-7053,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2507.574,2510.824,"Well, that's why this is problematic."
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2510.824,2512.355,I'm not sure I'll answer that.
2005.05-7053,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2512.355,2517.872,"I mean, I don't have the experience as a criminal lawyer that allows me to say whether it would be one way or the other."
2005.05-7053,1,28554,irving_l_gornstein,,2530.89,2537.36,"The... the Model Penal Code takes the position that every defense, affirmative defense, goes on the Government, and that's just a policy judgment--"
