1986.85-6461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,9.622,We will hear arguments next in Earline Martin against Ohio.
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,46.211,52.715,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1986.85-6461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,140.023,150.363,That assumes... that assumes that the self-defense... the defense of self-defense implicates some element of the crime.
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,150.363,153.398,"--Yes, in one aspect it does."
1986.85-6461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,153.398,154.766,What is it?
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,154.766,162.253,"Well, certainly self-defense is directed against the element of purposefulness, unlawfulness, in the context of the Ohio statute."
1986.85-6461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,162.253,172.728,"Well, now the State has to prove by a... beyond a reasonable doubt that this murder was purposeful, doesn't it?"
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,172.728,174.461,"Yes, it has to do that."
1986.85-6461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,174.461,178.215,And that burden always stays with it?
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,178.215,179.315,Absolutely.
1986.85-6461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,179.315,207.984,"And it's like... it's like a lot of... the defendant may want to come in and say, I didn't shot them... shoot this person at all, or I didn't have any purpose to do... but if the State convinces the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that he did have that purpose, what's left of this self-defense argument?"
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,223.161,224.477,That's exactly what it's saying.
1986.85-6461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,224.477,224.794,Yes.
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,224.794,228.898,"But it's saying that the defendant has to prove, by the same token, that he's not guilty."
1986.85-6461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,242.455,248.459,"Well, do you think the instruction reduces the State's burden in proving purposefulness?"
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,248.459,254.03,"It certainly does, in the context where you have a case that has a self-defense component."
1986.85-6461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,261.619,268.273,"Well, the instructions did say that the State had to prove purposefulness beyond a reasonable doubt."
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,268.273,269.475,"--Yes, it did."
1986.85-6461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,269.475,275.728,And then you say... then the instruction on self-defense lowered that burden?
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,275.728,276.478,It absolutely did.
1986.85-6461,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,364.369,374.709,"Mr. Willis, doesn't that all hinge on... on the implicit assumption that a State could not make it a crime to kill somebody in self-defense?"
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,376.661,377.744,--That is the premise of my argument.
1986.85-6461,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,377.744,386.767,"Well, why couldn't a State... bear in mind that in order to be convicted, the defendant here had to be shown to have intentionally, wilfully killed."
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,388.385,389.485,Deliberate and premeditated malice.
1986.85-6461,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,389.485,390.504,Right; so he intended to kill.
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,402.126,412.834,Because self-defense is one of those fundamental or inalienable rights that were part of the rights that the people had when this Union was formed.
1986.85-6461,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,447.173,449.975,I'm persuaded that you have the right to act in self-defense.
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,454.994,455.779,"Well, I think you have the right--"
1986.85-6461,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,455.779,458.196,Must that be a right that the State gives?
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,458.196,458.565,--I think--
1986.85-6461,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,458.565,463.117,"In order to prove the defense of self-defense, what has to be shown in Ohio?"
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,463.117,470.639,"--In Ohio, they would have to show that you didn't precipitate the controversy that gave rise to the need, to the necessity of self-defense."
1986.85-6461,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,476.027,477.81,No more than was reasonably necessary.
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,477.81,479.061,Under the circumstances.
1986.85-6461,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,494.654,502.475,"Mr. Willis, what you're saying, I think, in another way, is that there are limits to what a State may make a crime."
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,502.475,503.294,Absolutely.
1986.85-6461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,641.417,643.2,"Well, certainly, that's not unreasonable, is it?"
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,647.488,649.688,I accept that proposition.
1986.85-6461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,694.1,703.658,"Well, if you prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was purposeful, you've gone a long ways to prove that it wasn't done in self-defense."
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,703.658,707.027,"Well, it depends on the circumstances under which the killing took place."
1986.85-6461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,750.922,756.543,"Well, I know, but the State... the State has to prove the mens re beyond a reasonable doubt."
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,756.543,757.56,--Absolutely.
1986.85-6461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,760.078,763.78,"If there wasn't, they shouldn't be convicted."
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,763.78,769.35,"Because he was acting... he did so... she did so, if it please the Court, while she was acting in self-defense."
1986.85-6461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,772.135,774.671,"Well, go ahead."
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,774.671,783.36,--that we concern ourselves with the propriety of the instruction that control the ultimate verdict that was rendered by the court... rendered by the jury.
1986.85-6461,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,788.312,790.364,Let's talk about the 48 states that have it.
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,793.966,794.649,Yes.
1986.85-6461,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,794.649,814.712,"But I find it difficult to see how you can... if you're being genuine about proving it beyond a reasonable doubt, how can you ever prove beyond a reasonable doubt, in a private struggle between two individuals, with no witnesses, as occurred here, how can you prove beyond a reasonable doubt which one was the aggressor and which one wasn't?"
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,814.712,824.168,"Well, in that context, you would simply have to look at the circumstantial evidence to the same extent the State would have to look at... rely on circumstantial evidence to prove the contrary."
1986.85-6461,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,824.168,827.889,And you really think you can prove beyond a reasonable doubt which one was the aggressor?
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,827.889,828.839,I've seen it done.
1986.85-6461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,831.091,834.209,And so what if the State succeeds in proving it.
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,842.63,847.6,"And they also find that it was not done in self-defense, then that's a valid verdict, as I perceive it."
1986.85-6461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,974.449,987.924,"Well, Mr. Willis, is it your position that the State of Ohio does not allow a defendant to plead self-defense unless the defendant pleads guilty to the substantive elements of the crime?"
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,987.924,989.709,"No, you don't have to say, I plead guilty."
1986.85-6461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1052.383,1054.568,But your client did not plead guilty?
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,1054.568,1056.085,"--She plead, not guilty."
1986.85-6461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1058.537,1064.191,"And the trial court required the State to prove the elements of murder against her, I take it."
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,1064.191,1066.209,That's exactly what the trial court did.
1986.85-6461,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1081.153,1087.872,"Mr. Willis, can I come back briefly to what a State can do by way of eliminating the defense entirely?"
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,1124.346,1126.997,"--I think it is, and that's precisely my point."
1986.85-6461,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1135.853,1142.507,"Including intentional killing, even though... even though there may be something short of that that would--"
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,1142.507,1146.209,--I think the answer is provided with an historical perspective.
1986.85-6461,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1224.677,1235.683,"--Mr. Willis, can I ask you this question about the basic point as to whether there is an inherent, inalienable right of self-defense, when you recite to the Declaration of Independence and the like."
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,1257.215,1262.017,"--They had the Ninth Amendment, which said that there are certain rights reserved to the people."
1986.85-6461,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1262.017,1270.356,"Right, but what is the first time that you can tell us about that somebody identified self-defense as one of those rights."
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,1270.356,1277.629,"Well, I certainly am not privvy to what the Court has read in this area."
1986.85-6461,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1291.936,1293.721,There's probably a lot of it in Rudyard Kipling.
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,1296.34,1298.542,I didn't understand the question.
1986.85-6461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1298.542,1301.244,What if you're wrong on this?
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,1308.915,1310.267,I can still win the case.
1986.85-6461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1310.267,1311.383,On what theory?
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,1311.383,1317.254,I can still win the case on the theory that self-defense is different.
1986.85-6461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1335.632,1337.417,What are you saying was self-defense?
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,1338.134,1338.5,I'm not guilty.
1986.85-6461,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1339.234,1341.369,"--I committed murder, but I didn't commit a crime."
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,1341.369,1343.654,"--No, no, I didn't commit a crime."
1986.85-6461,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1346.106,1349.142,"It's the difference between mitigation and justification, is what you're talking about?"
1986.85-6461,0,33647,james_r_willis,,1349.142,1350.742,--Absolutely.
1986.85-6461,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1356.379,1357.248,"Thank you, Mr. Willis."
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,1363.568,1367.437,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Courts:"
1986.85-6461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1421.82,1424.356,Had Ohio law been different before that?
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,1424.356,1425.006,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear you."
1986.85-6461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1425.006,1432.462,"Had Ohio law regarding the issue of self-defense and who had the burden, had it been different before the statute that you're using?"
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,1432.462,1448.055,"No, since its inception into statehood, Ohio has followed the common law view approach that the proponderance of... the defendant must prove the affirmative defense by a preponderance of evidence with an exception of a two-year period from 1976 to 1978."
1986.85-6461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1448.055,1455.141,"And all the 48 states that we've heard about, they've all done it by statutory amendment to their common law rules?"
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,1455.141,1461.612,I think most of those states perhaps changed their viewpoint when this Court came down with its decision in Mullaney back in the nineteen-seventies.
1986.85-6461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1477.824,1481.543,How many states do not require the state to prove the absence of self-defense?
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,1481.543,1483.561,"--I really don't know, Justice White."
1986.85-6461,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1556.609,1565.382,"But as far as you know, there's only one other state that requires what Ohio does now with regard to proof of self-defense?"
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,1565.382,1572.369,"According not to the petitioner, Justice O'Connor, but according to the brief of the amicus filed in this case, that South Carolina is the only other state."
1986.85-6461,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1579.539,1580.391,"Yes, right."
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,1580.391,1592.366,"I think Ohio's burden by placing it by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, affords a defendant even greater protection than other states; and that it gives you a measurable standard upon which your conduct is to be evaluated, and nothing more than that."
1986.85-6461,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1592.366,1596.834,"Mr. Sadd, at the time that this Court had that Engle v. Isaac case--"
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,1596.834,1597.301,Correct.
1986.85-6461,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1597.301,1621.968,"--in 1983, there is language in that opinion referring to some Ohio courts in which we said that it appeared to us, at least, in Ohio that one who kills in self-defense under Ohio case law at that time does so without the mens re that otherwise would render him culpable of homicide."
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,1621.968,1628.122,"I think that language was correct at that time, and I think the qualifying words, Justice O'Connor, was, at that time."
1986.85-6461,1,15092,sandra_day_oconnor,scotus_justice,1633.124,1635.959,"Which was only a couple years ago, three years ago."
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,1639.763,1649.869,"--Correct, and I'll get into that in the argument as I show what the elements of Ohio law is with respect to the analysis, which I think the major analysis under Patterson and this Court's decision in Patterson."
1986.85-6461,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,1836.407,1833.772,Which court of appeals was that?
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,1838.126,1841.928,I think it was the Federal Sixth Circuit... Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.
1986.85-6461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1848.065,1854.319,"Your opponent, Mr. Willis, contends, of course, that self-defense isn't like insanity."
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,1854.319,1857.171,"Well, I know what he's contending, Justice... Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-6461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1868.995,1876.684,"But, you know, how much do you say, or how much ground do you really cover, when you say it's a separate matter?"
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,1876.684,1879.536,"Your Honor, they're both affirmative defenses."
1986.85-6461,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1893.678,1899.366,"Well, of course, in Mullaney, the state had structured the statute correctly, as I recall it."
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,1918.344,1921.03,"There's no question that Mullaney was a proper decision, Mr. Chief Justice."
1986.85-6461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1954.634,1973.497,"Now, wait, you say it's one thing if the element that you're putting the burden on the defendant for knocks it down from murder to manslaughter, but it's different if that element knocks it down from murder to nothing at all?"
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,1973.497,1975.097,"No, Justice Scalia, I'm not saying that at all."
1986.85-6461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2016.074,2022.93,"Supposes Ohio passes a law saying that anyone who kills anybody is guilty of murder, period."
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2030.667,2034.553,"I don't think a statute like that would, perhaps, pass Constitutional muster."
1986.85-6461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2034.553,2035.671,--Why not?
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2035.671,2037.071,"Well, it could and it could not."
1986.85-6461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2049.996,2051.597,No relationship at all.
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2056.568,2057.4,That's fine.
1986.85-6461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2057.4,2058.15,That's fine?
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2058.15,2060.07,It would be fine.
1986.85-6461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2060.07,2072.61,"Counsel, this jury's instructed to acquit unless the state proves beyond a reasonable doubt that there was this intentional, purposeful killing."
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2072.61,2073.446,Correct.
1986.85-6461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2073.446,2086.853,But then the jury's told that this self-defense defense must be proved beyond... by a preponderance of the evidence.
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2131.449,2136.103,"You're inviting me, Justice, to speculate as to why the Ohio legislature drafted its law."
1986.85-6461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2136.103,2140.572,"Well, I know, but I'm just asking you about what the effect of the instruction is."
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2148.244,2148.911,Acquittal.
1986.85-6461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2148.911,2166.289,"But nevertheless, if the doubt about... if the defendant is claiming it's not purposeful because of self-defense, don't acquit unless it's proved beyond... by a preponderance of the evidence."
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2166.289,2166.856,Yes.
1986.85-6461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2169.491,2170.526,"Well, it may not be very heavy."
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2181.615,2182.334,That's correct.
1986.85-6461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2182.334,2187.703,"Now, why isn't that contrary to Mullaney... I mean, to Winship?"
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2187.703,2194.975,Winship involved the reasonable doubt standard as to every fact necessary for which the State had to prove.
1986.85-6461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2194.975,2195.558,"Well, all right."
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2195.558,2197.091,The defense is different.
1986.85-6461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2202.695,2213.52,"Well, let me... let's assume the defendant's... the defendant simply puts in other evidence about purposefulness."
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2225.327,2226.06,--Correct.
1986.85-6461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2226.06,2233.516,"But with the self-defense defense, that won't do him that much... he has to do more than that."
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2233.516,2234.95,"Yes, yes."
1986.85-6461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2237.302,2238.885,"Well, isn't that rather strange?"
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2238.885,2240.004,--Not really.
1986.85-6461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2240.004,2244.389,"I guess if it isn't strange, it couldn't be unconstitutional."
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2244.389,2247.674,Not really a strained interpretation.
1986.85-6461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2442.937,2446.989,"Self-defense reads on those elements, or at least some of them?"
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2446.989,2448.924,"No, you can have situations where--"
1986.85-6461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2448.924,2451.793,I didn't say... do you think it ever does?
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2451.793,2452.426,--No.
1986.85-6461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2452.426,2459.029,You don't think self-defense goes to purposefulness at all?
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2459.029,2459.397,Yes.
1986.85-6461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2469.402,2473.122,"Well, but he says, I had no prior purpose at all to kill this person."
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2473.122,2474.656,I think you have to look to the facts--
1986.85-6461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2474.656,2476.174,I didn't want to kill them at all.
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2476.174,2478.693,--I think you have to look to the facts in this particular situation.
1986.85-6461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2480.093,2483.662,"Well, my question is, does it go to purposefulness or doesn't it?"
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2483.662,2488.966,--It goes to purposefulness in the sense that a person who admits that he acted in self-defense admits that he did an act.
1986.85-6461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2488.966,2500.356,"Well, why shouldn't his burden in establishing his so-called defense be no more than evidence enough to raise a reasonable doubt about purposefulness?"
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2500.356,2503.825,"Well, it's a legislative statute--"
1986.85-6461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2503.825,2507.693,"Well, I know, but there's a challenge, a Constitutional challenge, to that statute."
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2507.693,2511.247,"--I understand that, Justice White, but I don't see that there is a direct relationship."
1986.85-6461,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2511.247,2526.19,"Mr. Sadd, on this general subject, with respect to aggravated, murder, prior to the amendment of your statute, was it necessary in Ohio to prove that the same three elements of the crime--"
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2526.19,2528.523,At what time?
1986.85-6461,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2528.523,2534.077,--Prior to the enactment of the statute that placed affirmatively the burden of proof of self-defense--
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2534.077,2542.366,"No, I think prior to the enactment of this statute, Ohio recognized a murder in the first degree statute similar to the one statute that was placed in Oregon."
1986.85-6461,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2546.92,2552.205,--But the statute that was applied in this case was enacted subsequently to--
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2552.205,2554.74,"It was changed, I believe, in 1974."
1986.85-6461,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2554.74,2556.359,--1974?
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2556.359,2557.592,1974.
1986.85-6461,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2557.592,2560.811,Was that the statute that included the three elements that you mentioned just now?
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2560.811,2561.596,Yes.
1986.85-6461,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2563.763,2580.992,"Well, now, prior to the statute that relates to the proof of self-defense, what would a defendant have to prove if the state carried the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the crime was committed purposely and with specific intent?"
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2583.276,2584.659,--What... I didn't get your question?
1986.85-6461,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2584.659,2587.128,"What did the defendant have to prove then, if the state carried its--"
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2587.128,2608.475,"He would, again, have to prove the elements of self-defense, which are three factors: that he was not the aggressor; number two, that he had an imminent danger of death or great bodily harm, an honest belief that it would happen, and that the only method of escaping from that danger was the use of force; and lastly, that he had not violate any duty to retreat or escape the danger."
1986.85-6461,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2608.475,2611.527,--And when did Ohio adopt the statute that--
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2611.527,2613.713,In 1974.
1986.85-6461,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2613.713,2617.315,--I'm thinking at the moment about the statute with respect to self-defense.
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2617.315,2619.9,I'm sorry.
1986.85-6461,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2619.9,2621.635,You have a statute that--
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2621.635,2627.722,"Oh, the current statute now has been enacted in 1978, a year and a half after this Court's decision in Patterson."
1986.85-6461,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,2627.722,2629.49,--And did that change the law in Ohio?
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2629.49,2631.89,"Yes, it did."
1986.85-6461,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2646.417,2648.219,"Mr. Sadd, can I go back--"
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2648.219,2648.636,Yes.
1986.85-6461,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2648.636,2650.321,--to Justice White's question a moment ago?
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2670.365,2672.784,"Yes, yes, there would be."
1986.85-6461,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2684.725,2685.292,"Well, I understand."
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2691.981,2692.531,Yes.
1986.85-6461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2692.531,2704.539,And part of that showing could be the fact that he had been the aggressor and she was acting in self-defense trying to protect her life?
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2711.442,2712.811,"You probably could, Justice Scalia."
1986.85-6461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2717.882,2718.732,"No, I understand that."
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2740.629,2741.296,--Sure.
1986.85-6461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2741.296,2747.817,--in rebuttal of the state's burden which it has to demonstrate clearly an convincingly that you intended to kill.
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2747.817,2749.234,Absolutely.
1986.85-6461,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2749.234,2758.107,"But only after the state shows that you intended to kill, then you have the affirmative defense to say, I did intend to kill, but I intended to kill--"
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2758.107,2760.375,That's a correct interpretation.
1986.85-6461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2760.375,2762.161,--it's the only way to stop.
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2767.796,2768.315,Yes.
1986.85-6461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2781.956,2789.21,"Well, of course, the state has to get by... get by a motion to acquit on its side of the case."
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2803.952,2804.769,"No, no."
1986.85-6461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2806.404,2818.629,"And Ohio says that once the state has made out its case and survived the motion for acquittal, it has proved purpose--"
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2818.629,2819.679,Purposefulness.
1986.85-6461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2819.679,2828.485,"--it has proved purposefulness enough that unless the defendant, by a preponderance of evidence proves, didn't have a purpose--"
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2828.485,2831.103,You're not negating purpose with this.
1986.85-6461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2832.972,2847.362,"--Well, I know, but to the extent that self-defense goes to purposefulness or prior design, you have to... the defendant has a substantial burden of proof, not just raising a reasonable doubt."
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2847.362,2850.431,"Let me give you the following hypothetical, which may clarify matters."
1986.85-6461,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,2891.491,2899.347,"But the jury is told how to measure the evidence, what consequence to attach to the defendant's evidence."
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,2899.347,2910.138,"Yes, I would submit that the elements of self-defense, in this particular case, do not conflict with the elements of aggravated murder in this particular case under Ohio law."
1986.85-6461,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3000.496,3016.241,"Excuse me, may I just add one point to say, the facts are peculiarly in the knowledge of the defendant... aren't all the facts peculiarly in his... why not make him prove the whole crime?"
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,3016.241,3017.974,"I'm sorry, Justice--"
1986.85-6461,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3017.974,3020.959,You say that the burden is place on the defendant--
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,3020.959,3021.609,--Correct.
1986.85-6461,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3021.609,3027.347,--to show self-defense because he has the best knowledge of the crime.
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,3027.347,3028.382,Correct.
1986.85-6461,1,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,3028.382,3035.452,"He also has the best knowledge of whether it's murder or not, ehy not require to prove that too?"
1986.85-6461,1,26079,george_j_sadd,,3035.452,3043.142,"Well, I think, the state has not proved anybody... the defendant in the State of Ohio's scheme is not to prove themselves innocent."
