1996.96-270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,0.0,8.568,"We'll hear argument next in Number 96-270, Amchem Products, Inc. v. George Windsor."
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,39.577,42.459,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,92.071,95.974,"Well, how about the limitations that are imposed by the Rules Enabling Act?"
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,95.974,99.537,That no substantive changes should be made in the law.
1996.96-270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,99.537,104.649,"Yes, and that basically the rules have to be rules of procedure in a contemplated lawsuit."
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,104.649,113.165,"Your Honor, this, of course, was a lawsuit, but there is no requirement in Rule 23 that the lawsuit has to be determined to be triable."
1996.96-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,133.898,149.749,"Mr. Shapiro, has there been anything like this... I'm not aware that there has been, and particularly this case comes up because of an antisuit injunction that stops every court in the country, State and Federal, I take it, from dealing with any of these claims."
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,158.635,162.597,"--These people, of course, have the opportunity to opt out of the class."
1996.96-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,162.597,163.728,"Well, that's a question."
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,164.219,165.798,"Yes, we believe they did."
1996.96-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,187.774,217.443,"Now that, what you're describing, may fit a common fraud where each person is affected to a small degree, but here you have a personal injury suit where the normal rule is, I can go it alone, and when a restriction is made on that and says no, you have to travel with all these other people, I really don't understand how that doesn't involve substantive rights."
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,217.443,231.251,"--Well, Your Honor, there have been many cases, class action settlements, where injunctions have been entered after the case was settled to prevent splintering off, challenges to the class action settlement, provided that due process is satisfied in giving notification."
1996.96-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,231.251,244.241,Can you give me an example of a personal injury lawsuit where 20 defendants are saved from every court in the country continuing litigation?
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,247.794,257.079,"The Agent Orange case is an example like that, from the Second Circuit, where the manufacturers settled with a nationwide class of veterans from the Vietnam War, all of whom had been exposed."
1996.96-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,265.425,270.868,"--It enjoined every court in the country, as this antisuit injunction did?"
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,270.868,275.83,"Well, it entered ancillary injunctions against those that attempted to splinter off and relitigate."
1996.96-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,285.218,285.889,"Well, that's a big question."
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,309.103,325.253,"--Well, this, Your Honor, was what the witnesses described as the most massive notification campaign ever undertaken until this time, and it specifically identified the people who were in the class... occupational exposure to asbestos... and it was carried on for 3 months."
1996.96-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,325.253,330.138,--Does the class include people who do not now know that they were exposed?
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,330.138,333.56,It includes everybody who has occupational exposure.
1996.96-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,333.56,335.31,Whether they know about it now or not.
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,335.31,335.911,That's correct.
1996.96-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,336.93,339.033,"Now, how could any notice be adequate to those people?"
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,350.971,358.806,"--The district court found that substantially everybody who has had occupational exposure knows it, because since 1972 OSHA's been requiring--"
1996.96-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,358.806,360.235,"Substantially is what, 80 percent?"
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,360.235,362.148,--We think it's virtually everybody who's--
1996.96-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,362.148,364.709,Virtually everybody who's had occupational exposure knows it?
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,364.709,366.45,"--There are, of course, exceptions, and--"
1996.96-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,366.45,367.581,And what about those exceptions?
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,368.653,374.406,"--Those persons do have due process, because the rule requires the best notice practicable."
1996.96-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,377.138,389.165,"That's assuming... that's assuming that you can... maybe the problem of notice reflects on the impropriety of proceeding in this case at all, as this massive class action."
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,406.547,414.432,"--Your Honor, we submit that the exceptional case shouldn't determine whether the notification for the class itself meets constitutional standards."
1996.96-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,426.24,427.111,"Well, let's start from the very--"
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,427.111,428.073,--there could be an exception for such a person.
1996.96-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,428.073,452.589,"--Let's start from the very basic premise, and you tell me if I'm wrong about this, but it was my understanding that there is a right for one to litigate one's own claim, and that's the basic rule, and if that's going to be displaced, there has to be a good reason for it, and that good reason, I assume, is not for the courts to make up in the guise of procedure."
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,452.589,456.069,"Well, there is a superiority requirement which supplies the good reason."
1996.96-270,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,469.89,474.102,"I am... counsel, I am willing to accept that that is true, that it's superior."
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,536.363,543.848,"--Well, Justice Kennedy, this body of litigation is unique in the sense that this is the most mature body of mass tort litigation in the country."
1996.96-270,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,557.917,560.439,I think slip-and-fall is much more well-established.
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,574.109,584.224,"--There would be real difficulties in doing that, because in slip-and-fall accidents the variety of injuries and the variety of claims for harm are not just three or four, as there are in this--"
1996.96-270,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,584.224,585.105,Suppose it was comparable?
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,603.288,609.292,"--Well, I think if you're talking about people who haven't had their exposures, haven't had any slip and fall--"
1996.96-270,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,609.292,610.522,They've all fallen.
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,610.522,611.172,--They've all--
1996.96-270,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,611.172,615.246,"Some people are going to... 3 years from now are going to develop whip lashes, and others won't--"
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,616.795,631.765,"--If there was an attempt to settle in one proceeding all the past injury cases and you could really find typical and adequate class representatives for that huge array of injuries, it's not inconceivable, but not many cases really are manageable in the sense that this one is."
1996.96-270,0,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,662.668,678.426,"But isn't the fairness of the settlement swallowing... isn't this sort of the point of what the Third Circuit was saying, and that is that the fairness inquiry in effect is swallowing all the preceding steps that are normally assumed when the moment comes to look at fairness?"
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,717.892,718.583,--That's--
1996.96-270,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,718.583,733.052,"And yet it seems to me the reality is that there is, in a way, a kind of limited fund unless you assume that the defendants in these cases are simply standing in court saying, we'll pay anything they want."
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,771.638,778.732,"--That's the critical issue, and Professor Tribe has caricatured our position as amounting to that, but it certainly is not our submission."
1996.96-270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,795.262,795.681,--But the predominance--
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,795.681,796.031,--as well as the--
1996.96-270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,796.031,796.682,--The predominance--
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,796.682,797.433,--of the parties.
1996.96-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,797.433,813.643,"--The predominance inquiry, which is central, I think, in (b)(3), certainly changes, and if you look at this going in you'd say, my goodness, these are people who are suffering from any number of diseases accrued at different times involving different manufacturers."
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,872.872,882.449,I was struck by the comment of the Rules Committee current draft of the change in Rule 23 that said that our position is law everywhere in the United States except in the Third Circuit.
1996.96-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,889.464,889.975,Well--
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,915.209,926.547,"--We completely agree with that, Justice Ginsburg, and when you look to these other factors and you consider the settlement, it makes them so much more meaningful and... as opposed to speculating in the abstract, as this Court said--"
1996.96-270,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,926.547,934.742,"Well, but let me suggest one change in Judge Becker's opinion that I think would leave us right where we are, but perhaps I'm wrong."
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,967.416,974.139,"--I don't think the Third Circuit could have modified the opinion that way, because Judge Reed looked at a host of other things in addition to the settlement."
1996.96-270,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,995.733,1014.524,"But you would in fact have a very different inquiry, as you yourself argue, if there were not already a settlement on the table and, in fact, there is a good argument, as Justice Ginsburg just suggested, for coming out quite differently depending on whether you were looking at it before the settlement and after the settlement."
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1014.524,1015.115,"Oh, absolutely--"
1996.96-270,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1015.115,1040.343,"And the question is one of degree, and it seems to me the suggestion in her question and the suggestion in mine is that the degree is so great that the only way to make sense, I think, of the certification which the district court made was by saying, the district court was treating the settlement as sufficient as opposed merely to one source of information."
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1040.343,1058.943,"--I think that would be a mischaracterization of what Judge Reed did, because he looked at a host of factors pertaining to the alignment and the incentives and the vigor of the negotiation, the changes that were made in this deal, whether or not the AFL-CIO endorsed it... he was looking to an entire array of relevant facts."
1996.96-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1058.943,1060.445,"Well, I'll take that on, Mr. Shapiro."
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1095.959,1096.65,There--
1996.96-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1096.65,1106.544,"Doesn't it place him in a real conflict with regard to his clients in the class that could get in without a settlement, in the class that would be a certifiable class without the settlement?"
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1106.544,1123.605,"--Well, there are conflicts in cases that have been certified for settlement and in cases that are certified for trial, and the district courts have to use the tools that are given them to examine, to see if what was achieved was a vigorous, adversarial attempt to maximize the amount of money from--"
1996.96-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1123.605,1136.765,"This is a massive incentive to bring in other people who really wouldn't be in there if you didn't have a settlement, but then you strike a settlement that gives everybody less than they might get had he just gone in without a settlement."
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1136.765,1144.699,"--We have lots of indications here, factual indications that that isn't true, and I suggest this is a factual question where deferential review is appropriate."
1996.96-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1153.485,1154.817,"They have some self-interest, too."
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1154.817,1155.798,"Well, and the--"
1996.96-270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1158.33,1158.961,Mr. Shapiro--
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1158.961,1159.508,--picked to do this--
1996.96-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1159.508,1164.413,"--Mr. Shapiro... Mr. Shapiro... Mr. Shapiro, you mentioned the MDL, and so I'd like you to straighten me out on one thing."
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1183.174,1191.382,"--Your Honor, the transcript from Mr. Fitzpatrick demonstrates that Judge Weiner asked for a global resolution, wanted the parties to attend to that."
1996.96-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1191.382,1192.56,Judge Weiner.
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1208.812,1218.997,"They asked specifically that after the transfer that the prospects for global negotiation be considered, and that's just what the Federal Judicial Center had said in two major conferences."
1996.96-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1224.951,1230.695,Do you have a reference to where the multidistrict panel said settle other cases than these that were consolidated?
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1230.695,1243.484,"--The 1991 opinion itself does refer to that as one of the possible outcomes of the transfers, that perhaps a global settlement could be achieved in this litigation, which is what the other judges had been suggesting, too."
1996.96-270,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1254.391,1285.542,"We have many cases, and it's sometimes a question of the degree of the difference between substance and procedure, but it seems to me that by using the term fairness the district court here imported and made choices between substantive chances of recovery, of liability, of measure of damages, and it seems to me that that's not the intent of the rule, and that it exceeds the authority of the courts under the rule."
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1285.542,1286.393,"Well, if this--"
1996.96-270,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1286.393,1295.001,"Fairness becomes... fairness, which is an infinitely acceptable concept, is the basis for legislation."
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1295.001,1316.244,"--If this were a litigated matter I would agree with that, that you couldn't override State law differences, but the parties can settle, and often do settle in a way that varies from a particular body of State law, and here the settlement does incorporate reference to State law, but the amount of money is geared in part to State law standards, but it's the settlement that's critical."
1996.96-270,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1326.661,1333.105,"The parties are then conferring a new regime, a new substantive regime of law upon the court that the court adopts."
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1335.307,1337.277,--Many settlements have such features.
1996.96-270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1337.277,1338.178,It's like--
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1338.178,1343.902,"Many settlements have such features, where the parties will resolve an array of disputes under an ADR system, and there's nothing wrong with that."
1996.96-270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1343.902,1356.37,"--I can understand what you're saying, Mr. Shapiro, with respect to one plaintiff and one defendant settling contrary to some principle of State law, but here I get the impression it's the tail wagging the dog, almost."
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1363.444,1369.318,"Well, I think Judge Reed found that there was a very important safeguard here from the AFL-CIO's participation."
1996.96-270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1375.262,1378.634,How did the AFL-CIO... was it a party to this?
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1378.634,1383.83,"Well, the named plaintiff, Mr. Carlo, and then Mr. Georgine, were both officers in the AFL-CIO."
1996.96-270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1388.74,1393.473,"Well, what if the Benevolent Protective Order of Elks had participated--"
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1395.894,1401.848,"--Well, when we talk about adequate representation, this is a group that, of course, has members in every disease category."
1996.96-270,0,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1412.827,1416.02,This seems to me even more of a legislative cast to what the court does.
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1433.2,1441.545,"--Well, many settlements, of course, differ from what would happen if the matter were litigated under State law principles, and the settlement here, of course, did that."
1996.96-270,0,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,1453.494,1456.616,Is the Agent Orange the closest one that you can imagine--
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1456.616,1461.559,"--The Second Circuit's Agent Orange, the Ivy case, and then the Agent Orange case that preceded that, and obviously--"
1996.96-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1461.559,1475.906,"--Mr. Shapiro, turning... I have some problem with the prospect of two parties who are not in disagreement as to what one should pay and what the other should accept coming to a court and saying that there is a case or controversy between them."
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1492.74,1494.42,"--Well, this is--"
1996.96-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1494.42,1496.921,"I mean, I'm simplifying it, but that... isn't that what you have here?"
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1496.921,1501.455,"--The 14 class representatives all allege personal injury, and they demanded valuable relief--"
1996.96-270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1501.455,1502.135,Yes.
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1502.135,1504.996,--and they included in their class people who were in the same situation.
1996.96-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1504.996,1511.59,"And the defendants say, you're right, you deserve relief, and I'm willing to pay $2 million, and the plaintiffs say, I'm willing to take $2 million."
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1512.662,1516.415,It's a case or controversy because the court has to approve the settlement and issue an injunction.
1996.96-270,0,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1520.396,1523.358,"Well, the court has to approve the settlement if it's a justiciable controversy."
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1525.121,1540.061,"--Well, this case is indistinguishable from the SEC and antitrust division cases where the parties come before the court with a complaint, and an answer, and a settlement, and the answer has always been in these cases that because a judicial act is needed and an injunction is needed there still is a live case or controversy."
1996.96-270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1541.12,1543.652,Has that body of cases been here?
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1544.673,1544.944,"Oh, yes."
1996.96-270,0,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,1548.006,1550.437,"They all involve Federal agencies though, don't they?"
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1550.437,1552.848,"Well, there are private cases where the same concept has been raised."
1996.96-270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1556.16,1557.001,"Not here, though."
1996.96-270,0,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,1557.001,1558.401,--Not here.
1996.96-270,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1560.394,1561.793,"Very well, Mr. Shapiro."
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1563.396,1572.121,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:"
1996.96-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1648.762,1649.102,Mr.... how--
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1649.102,1650.391,--on anyone who might sue the CCR defendants.
1996.96-270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1650.391,1657.196,"--How does it... I mean, we used to have in Boston very complicated settlements in civil rights cases."
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1657.196,1657.396,Mm-hmm.
1996.96-270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1657.396,1660.859,"Running... the whole fire-fighters, I mean, all kinds of things--"
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1660.859,1661.05,Sure.
1996.96-270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1661.05,1666.423,"--Enormously complicated provisions, entered through settlement of thousands of people, and those decrees would be there."
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1670.584,1670.795,Mm-hmm.
1996.96-270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1670.795,1678.731,"And the way this differs from that, you're saying, is that the parties here who are members of the class don't really have a fight with the defendants?"
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1678.731,1684.284,"Well, the named representatives here have all testified beyond dispute that--"
1996.96-270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1684.284,1686.235,"Right, but I mean, is... I know the testimony."
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1686.235,1686.445,--Yes.
1996.96-270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1686.445,1690.198,"Is that the distinction, or are there other distinctions?"
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1713.033,1715.664,"Well, there are, Justice Breyer, many different problems."
1996.96-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1715.664,1715.974,Yes.
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1715.974,1730.344,"Under the Rules Enabling Act the problem is that there are substantive changes being made in State law in a way that, of course, two private parties agreeing together could do, but that this makes binding on millions of people."
1996.96-270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1730.344,1731.075,What is one such change?
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1731.075,1741.41,"Oh, in California, for example, an asbestos company cannot make any reference to whether or not the plaintiff smoked."
1996.96-270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1743.483,1754.1,I know that they are giving up... each member of the class is giving up a legal right to sue that he might have under the laws of many different States.
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1756.44,1756.75,"--Yes, but--"
1996.96-270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1756.75,1759.071,So what's different about this one?
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1759.071,1776.804,"--What's different, Justice Breyer, just for example, is that in many States people are not allowed to give up in advance of the illness occurring through a general release the right to sue, like the woman in this morning's decision who didn't know until her husband died various of the relevant facts."
1996.96-270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1776.804,1779.896,But I thought they were bringing Metro-North kinds of actions.
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1783.389,1784.45,"No, but what's being extinguished--"
1996.96-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1784.45,1784.741,--and can win... yes.
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1784.741,1788.662,--What's being extinguished is not just the Metro North actions.
1996.96-270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1811.368,1826.789,"I've seen many such actions in civil rights cases again where a person says, I will give up and compromise my present claim for $50,000 and, in addition, I promise never to bring another action growing out of the same incident."
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1826.789,1827.567,Yes.
1996.96-270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,1827.808,1829.13,That is fairly common.
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1829.13,1838.116,"--First, some States do not allow people who have not yet experienced something to bind themselves that far into the future."
1996.96-270,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1855.757,1861.611,How do those factors help answer the question put by Justice Breyer as to why this is different from the fire-fighters?
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1865.713,1865.923,Right.
1996.96-270,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1865.923,1872.959,"--but is the difference that in the fire-fighters case, civil rights case, there was an imminent litigable dispute--"
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1872.959,1874.408,No question--
1996.96-270,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1874.408,1876.291,"--and here there is not, or does that--"
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1876.291,1876.712,--Well--
1996.96-270,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,1876.712,1878.191,--Is that sufficient?
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1878.191,1882.185,--There was an argument about future alleged misconduct.
1996.96-270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1903.768,1906.079,"Yes, but there would have been suits on behalf of some of them."
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1906.079,1907.451,"--Well, there had never been--"
1996.96-270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1907.451,1909.994,"There's a case or controversy as to some people, wouldn't you agree?"
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1909.994,1912.885,"--Oh, in some States, as to some of them there might have been a case, but--"
1996.96-270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1912.885,1913.994,Might have been a case?
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1915.837,1916.057,--Yes.
1996.96-270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1916.057,1916.768,--if there weren't this settlement?
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1916.768,1917.528,"Well, I do know--"
1996.96-270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1917.528,1918.669,I think probably hundreds would.
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1918.669,1925.033,"--Well, I do know that class counsel had never brought, and this is undisputed, a claim on behalf of someone merely exposed."
1996.96-270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1925.873,1928.367,You're talking about the fringes of the class.
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1929.806,1930.477,--It's not--
1996.96-270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1930.477,1937.44,"--but you're saying there's no case or controversy here, not even as to those who have cancer and wanted to sue for millions of dollars, if I understand--"
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1937.44,1937.68,"--Justice Stevens, I'm sorry."
1996.96-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1944.235,1944.565,--Okay.
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1944.565,1955.993,"But this Court's jurisprudence requires in a class action that there be an injury in fact by everyone, and the absence of a case or controversy here arises from the fact that the entire--"
1996.96-270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1955.993,1958.614,It's the absence of a case or controversy as to some members of the class.
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1958.614,1958.835,--Well--
1996.96-270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1958.835,1959.926,Is that what you're claiming--
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1959.926,1960.166,--No.
1996.96-270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1960.166,1962.237,--or entirely no case or controversy?
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1962.237,1975.756,"I'm saying no injury in fact as to some members, but (b), more important, no case or controversy as to the entire phony complaint which was filed, admittedly, solely for the purpose of getting the court to put in place this--"
1996.96-270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1975.756,1977.268,"Well, you're saying the class is too big, yes."
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1977.719,1978.59,--Could I--
1996.96-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1978.59,1979.54,--Go ahead.
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1980.531,1980.962,--I just want to answer--
1996.96-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1980.962,1981.212,--Sure.
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,1981.212,1994.56,"--The fact that it's too big, too diverse can't possibly be certified without, as Justice Souter suggested, making the mere settlement somehow the sufficient answer to all of the questions under Rule 23 is a different matter."
1996.96-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2020.508,2038.737,"How do you distinguish, then, the cases that Mr. Shapiro cites which we read about in the papers, and probably some are participating, where it is announced that the Justice Department is bringing an action and that X pleads nolo contendere, and that a consent decree has been entered?"
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2038.737,2043.111,"--Well, the rights of third parties are not sacrificed in those cases, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.96-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2057.65,2063.835,"But the plaintiffs in the class action are saying if you disagree we'll take you to court just as much, aren't they?"
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2063.835,2064.456,--There is this difference.
1996.96-270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2137.734,2157.417,"I didn't want to interrupt you, but maybe I'll... the... what's obviously... what's actually motivating my question partly is the analogy to what I've seen is a lot of settled cases in the civil rights area where it seems to me the power to accept settlement is fairly broad, and to extinguish State law claims, and I grant you you're right that this is in the far... pushing that."
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2193.52,2196.101,"With subclasses, Justice Breyer, perhaps."
1996.96-270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2196.101,2197.711,"And how does that work, subclasses?"
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2197.711,2215.583,"Well, the way... under the rule, one can identify a subgroup that is more homo... relatively homogeneous, so that one could get a set of typical representatives who could adequately advance the interests of those, for example, with advanced mesothelioma, or those with pleural thickening."
1996.96-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2263.175,2269.359,"Mr. Tribe, this discussion has been certainly quite wide-ranging, and I certainly have contributed."
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2287.58,2289.0,"--Yes, it is, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.96-270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2353.375,2356.197,"Let me ask you, Mr.--"
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2356.197,2356.875,It doesn't matter whether the settlement looks reasonable.
1996.96-270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2356.875,2361.329,"--Mr. Tribe, may I just ask you, do you agree with this sentence out of Judge Becker's opinion:"
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2373.166,2395.971,"Well, Justice Stevens, I think when he says, as if it were going to be litigated, if I interpreted that to mean what Mr. Shapiro does, namely, we must be blind to the settlement in figuring out whether the criteria of Rule 23 are met, I think it would be wrong, because things like management of a complex case might shed a lot of light on that by looking at the settlement, but you don't have to read it that way."
1996.96-270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2412.721,2414.584,"Well, does that mean that--"
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2414.584,2415.914,And I think in that respect he's right.
1996.96-270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2415.914,2429.064,"--Is it conceivable that there are class actions that have come to the court in a settlement posture which the trial court could say, well, if this were going to be tried, I really couldn't prove the class certification but, given the settlement, I think I will approve it?"
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2430.664,2442.712,"Well, Justice Stevens, I wanted to be able to say yes to that because I thought I could come up with managerial examples in which that would be possible, but I think there are three reasons why the answer really ought to be no, and they're very fundamental."
1996.96-270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2596.424,2628.275,"Well, what about... are you then... is the implication of what you're saying that imagine a big company, or several of them, that have a history of employment discrimination, and they work out a settlement that is going to cover millions of people into the future, or toxic torts of all kinds... you know, there are thousands of them, and now it would be impermissible to put anybody in the settlement class, anybody... anybody who might work for this company in the future, unless in the absence of that settlement his position is similar enough to the others in the class that he'd be in it anyway."
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2639.721,2647.268,"Justice Breyer, I don't think it's an implication of my position that one apple of the wrong flavor spoils the barrel."
1996.96-270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2647.709,2648.988,"Well, no, but that apple would be out of it."
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2648.988,2649.699,"--Well, maybe--"
1996.96-270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2649.699,2657.093,"You see, that apple would be out of the class, and that apple being out of the class would mean that the company wouldn't know what was going to happen, and therefore, who knows?"
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2665.1,2665.391,--Well--
1996.96-270,1,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,2665.391,2666.24,You see... do you see the problem?
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2672.204,2679.65,"--Well, I guess I don't see anything in the rule that makes it possible for a nonlitigable case to give rise to a binding decree."
1996.96-270,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2698.711,2699.682,"Mr. Tribe, are you saying--"
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2699.682,2701.713,--and under Rule 82 you wouldn't read the rules that way.
1996.96-270,1,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,2701.713,2707.77,"--Are you saying, then, that even a back end opt-out would not save this class?"
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2709.099,2714.663,"I think because a back end opt-out, Justice Ginsburg, would have to have preconditions that the court would set."
1996.96-270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2841.787,2843.368,We've got district court findings that they were.
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2843.368,2844.647,"Well, the findings--"
1996.96-270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2844.647,2846.37,"You think... you don't agree with them, of course."
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2846.37,2848.1,"--No, that's... not quite, Justice Stevens."
1996.96-270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2862.629,2865.961,"Well then, do we take the case as though the representation was adequate or inadequate?"
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2865.961,2868.533,--There are two different concepts of representation.
1996.96-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2875.989,2876.33,I understand.
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2876.33,2880.411,"And he... as to that, what did he find as to their ability?"
1996.96-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2886.265,2887.377,This was Judge Weiner?
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2887.377,2888.118,--Yes.
1996.96-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2890.258,2890.558,Judge Reed.
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2890.558,2906.327,"Judge Reed said, and it's at pages 229a to 230a of the certiorari appendix, that so long as all class members are united in asserting a common right, such as achieving the maximum possible recovery, there's adequate representation."
1996.96-270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2914.204,2916.535,He was quoting from a Third Circuit case there... yes.
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2916.535,2920.088,--Well--
1996.96-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,2920.509,2923.53,"Which would be right if we had said that, right?"
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,2923.78,2927.031,If you'd said it recently enough.
1996.96-270,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3028.357,3037.303,But you do not go so far as to say that a requisite premise is that the case must be capable of being litigated.
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3038.435,3039.426,Well--
1996.96-270,1,15113,anthony_m_kennedy,scotus_justice,3039.426,3045.63,"Because the Chief Justice... we talked about the question that was presented, and--"
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3045.63,3054.897,"--I think whichever way the question that was presented is answered, the judgment here would be, I think, affirmed because the basis--"
1996.96-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3054.897,3055.858,--What is your position?
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3055.858,3067.515,"--My position is that it would be wrong... that under Rule 23, the existence of a settlement should not be ignored when it is relevant to answering the questions put in Rule 23."
1996.96-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3067.515,3067.776,And--
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3067.776,3068.727,And it often is.
1996.96-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3068.727,3075.17,--Can a district court certify a case that clearly could not be certified for litigation for--
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3075.17,3075.38,I think not.
1996.96-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3075.38,3076.391,--Oh?
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3076.391,3078.462,"Mr. Chief Justice, I think the answer to that ought to be no, but that's not--"
1996.96-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3078.462,3080.863,"Don't ignore it, but it doesn't make any difference, right?"
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3081.114,3081.805,"--No, no--"
1996.96-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3082.105,3084.076,I think that's what you're saying.
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3085.027,3085.257,No.
1996.96-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3085.798,3086.289,--but don't ignore it.
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3086.289,3088.63,--It can inform you of a lot of things.
1996.96-270,1,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3089.401,3091.943,But if were smart enough you'd figure them out anyway.
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3091.943,3092.183,"--No, because--"
1996.96-270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3128.384,3143.814,"Can I give you a little different... supposing the trial judge made a finding that really there ought to be 18 subclasses because there's heterogeneity, but if I look at this settlement I think that each one of those 18 subclasses got the best deal it could have gotten if they had 18 separate representatives."
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3147.538,3153.011,--If other... if the other requirements of the rule were met or were not met?
1996.96-270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3153.011,3165.791,"If they would be met as to each 18 subclass, clearly, but the problem is you've got 18 subclasses, but yet you look through it all and you say, well, I think each of those 18 subclasses got at least as good if not a better deal in the total settlement as if they'd had 18 subclasses."
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3165.791,3171.214,"I think if they were all separately represented in putting the deal together, I think that sounds like a perfectly reasonable--"
1996.96-270,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,3171.214,3182.45,"And if he finds that they got the same benefit that they would have gotten that way... because the main difficulty that he foresaw was there wasn't enough money to go around, and that's what creates the major controversy, but here he found there was enough money to go around."
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3182.45,3186.954,"--Well, enough money to go around suggests that there's some pie in the sky whose size--"
1996.96-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3186.954,3187.155,Right.
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3187.155,3187.565,--we know.
1996.96-270,1,15042,david_h_souter,scotus_justice,3230.782,3239.608,"So you're really saying you can't make an intelligent fairness determination after the fact without knowing the process by which the determination was made, and that's... I mean, that's your--"
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3239.608,3240.64,"That's exactly right, Justice Souter--"
1996.96-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3240.64,3241.08,--Yes.
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3241.08,3244.061,--and that no determination about the result will quite do.
1996.96-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3257.249,3258.601,I think your time has expired--
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3258.601,3258.801,"--Oh, I'm sorry."
1996.96-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3258.801,3259.252,--Mr. Tribe.
1996.96-270,1,35187,laurence_h_tribe,,3259.252,3260.162,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.96-270,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3260.162,3261.854,"Mr. Shapiro, you have 3 minutes remaining."
1996.96-270,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3261.854,3263.394,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
1996.96-270,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3285.589,3294.924,"I thought he was talking not about adequacy of representation, but rather about the question whether the settlement achieved gave each class the maximum that it could have gotten."
1996.96-270,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3294.924,3298.236,--And I think his point was you can't just look at the end result.
1996.96-270,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3298.236,3298.467,Right.
1996.96-270,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3298.467,3299.318,You have to look at other things.
1996.96-270,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3312.117,3324.562,"Do you think there would be any difference if we were to hold hypothetically that there had to be four lawyers, one for the people who brought suit before, one for the people who have the disease already, one for the people who have the thickening, and one for the people who have nothing?"
1996.96-270,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3324.562,3325.073,There--
1996.96-270,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3325.073,3326.815,Would that lead to a practical difference in this case?
1996.96-270,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3326.815,3327.234,--There's be no difference.
1996.96-270,2,15139,stephen_g_breyer,scotus_justice,3331.698,3340.624,"So in other words, if this Court were to say the thing that was wrong with this is that there wasn't those four separate lawyers, and it went back, it would reach the same result, in your view?"
1996.96-270,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3340.624,3347.359,"Well, the same result would be reached at greater expense, because the district court found here that there were no conflicts among these subclasses."
1996.96-270,2,15049,antonin_scalia,scotus_justice,3347.359,3359.866,"You're willing to leave it to one district judge to decide nationwide what is fairness as to all of these different plaintiffs, some who haven't gotten the disease, some who know that they have it, some... I mean, I can understand how a legislature might feel--"
1996.96-270,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3359.866,3365.81,"This is merely an option, Justice Scalia, for people who want the option, and it is found to be a preferable option."
1996.96-270,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3366.911,3367.873,"--Yes, but so many of them--"
1996.96-270,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3367.873,3368.083,--can opt out.
1996.96-270,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3368.083,3371.383,--So many of them will never see this notice.
1996.96-270,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3402.436,3403.097,Well--
1996.96-270,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3403.097,3408.448,"If they have no claim, then doesn't... isn't that another reason why this has to fall apart?"
1996.96-270,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3408.448,3409.429,--They do have a claim.
1996.96-270,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3414.092,3418.704,But if they have no 12(b)... they couldn't survive a 12(b)(6).
1996.96-270,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3422.497,3427.973,"--Under the legal certainty test, Your Honor, there are 15 States that recognize this cause of action."
1996.96-270,2,15084,ruth_bader_ginsburg,scotus_justice,3436.857,3445.192,"But then in most States, since we're dealing with a global thing, most of these people wouldn't have any claim if Ms. Birnbaum is right, and if... you said the number's only 15."
1996.96-270,2,42002,stephen_m_shapiro,,3445.192,3448.634,"--Well, there's no State that has rejected this cause of action."
1996.96-270,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3456.979,3458.411,"Thank you, Mr. Shapiro."
1996.96-270,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3459.612,3464.89,The Honorable Court is now adjourned until tomorrow at ten o'clock.
