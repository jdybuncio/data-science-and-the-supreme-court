1972.71-1417,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,22.599,"-- This morning in 71-1471, Booster Lodge, No. 405 and others against the National Labor Relations Board consolidated with 71-1607, National Labor Relations Board against the Boeing Co."
1972.71-1417,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,27.396,31.091,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1417,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,374.354,375.117,Mr. Dunau?
1972.71-1417,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,375.117,375.352,Yes sir.
1972.71-1417,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,375.352,391.39,"Does the Union has the right to discharge/dismiss from the membership of the Union an employee who doesn’t pay his fine or is their only remedy, the power to go into the State Courts to collect it?"
1972.71-1417,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,391.39,397.433,"With respect to a person who did not resign, the Union can do a number of things."
1972.71-1417,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,507.234,507.73,Mr. Dunau?
1972.71-1417,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,507.73,508.238,Yes sir.
1972.71-1417,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,508.238,513.702,"It may not be important, but I'm a little fuzzy on one or two facts here."
1972.71-1417,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,520.828,533.183,"No sir, we do not know and we can never know because under the Machinist constitution the decision whether or not the go on to a strike is taken by secret ballot."
1972.71-1417,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,546.038,553.468,"Does the record show whether each person fined here, initially participated in the strike?"
1972.71-1417,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,553.468,555.914,I believe the record will show that Your Honor.
1972.71-1417,0,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,579.074,584.325,"One last question, I take it does show that that dates of the respective resignation?"
1972.71-1417,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,584.325,590.053,"Yes sir, it will show when the letter of resignation was sent."
1972.71-1417,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,704.904,708.035,"Mr. Dunau, what is the nature of our review here?"
1972.71-1417,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,725.596,752.233,I suppose since the Board tells us that what it is doing is interpreting a contract and the conventional formulation as I understand it is that the interpretation of a contract is supposed to be a question of law open to unrestricted judicial review that we are free here to decide whether the Union’s constitution is fairly and reasonably interpreted to bar strikebreaking.
1972.71-1417,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,913.393,916.865,"But it’s also almost a definition of the word member, isn’t it?"
1972.71-1417,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,921.685,943.246,"Which presents the problem, whether you are -- if you are a former member or put it rather this way, if during the period of membership, if the condition of acquiring and retaining membership is that on resignation, a particular obligation will -- and you’re beyond your resignation, can that be --"
1972.71-1417,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,943.246,944.549,Beyond your membership?
1972.71-1417,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,944.549,944.979,That --
1972.71-1417,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,944.979,945.5,Beyond your membership.
1972.71-1417,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,945.5,950.961,"Beyond your membership, can a particular Union obligation subsist beyond your membership."
1972.71-1417,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1020.822,1023.514,Regardless of how long strike goes on?
1972.71-1417,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1023.514,1052.257,"Yes sir, regardless of how long the strike goes on because the whole notion it seems to us of strike solidarity, is that the majority decides when to strike and the majority decides when to stop striking and that the whole point of strike solidarity and concerted activity for mutual aid and protection is that the unit as a unit determines its destining for good or ill, not any individual."
1972.71-1417,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,1052.257,1059.372,"That was the rationale of the, what was it, the First Circuit in Granite State that was rejected by this Court last December, wasn’t it?"
1972.71-1417,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1059.372,1070.107,"On a basis of decision as we understand it which said, “we reject that where there is no limiting Union rule.”"
1972.71-1417,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1118.972,1133.614,Would you make any distinction Mr. Dunau between members of Unions who are members as a matter of compulsion and those who are members as a matter of choice?
1972.71-1417,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1133.614,1135.742,"We make no such distinction, Your Honor."
1972.71-1417,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,1192.348,1199.519,"Well, can he be a member, but reject this provision with reference to strikebreaking?"
1972.71-1417,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1199.519,1209.889,If the Union is willing to enforce against him the obligation of the contract to pay his dues and fees that is the limit of it.
1972.71-1417,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1233.098,1238.753,"These men that resigned, are they, to use your phrase, men in the street?"
1972.71-1417,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1238.753,1240.633,I don’t know what the usual phrase means Your honor?
1972.71-1417,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1240.633,1243.651,You said that he is just like another man in the street?
1972.71-1417,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1248.999,1260.089,"So far as the Union is concerned once they resign, subsequent to the termination of that strike they are like any other member in the street indeed in this case."
1972.71-1417,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1260.089,1262.409,Except that they can’t work.
1972.71-1417,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1262.409,1266.079,They cannot work for that employer for the duration of the strike.
1972.71-1417,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1266.079,1267.527,But the man in the street can?
1972.71-1417,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1267.527,1268.501,That was correct and that is the --
1972.71-1417,0,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,1268.501,1270.124,The other man in the street can?
1972.71-1417,0,17581,bernard_dunau,,1270.124,1279.174,That is the precise difference Your Honor between being a Union member subject to the obligations of the Union membership and not being a Union member.
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,1867.309,1873.207,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1417,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2119.649,2121.152,The Board I gather hasn't dealt with it?
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2121.152,2127.211,The Board has not passed on that question and we do not think that it is presented in this case.
1972.71-1417,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2133.611,2135.929,And it may come up under the --
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2135.929,2155.49,New constitutional provision of the Machinist contract which being enacted in 1972 obviously could not have served notice on the employees here in 1965 that this was the obligation that they were assuming when they joined the Machinist in 1965.
1972.71-1417,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2155.49,2162.034,"Of course the Court in Granite State just spoke generally of a constitutional provision, did it not, generally?"
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2162.034,2163.859,That is correct Your Honor.
1972.71-1417,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2603.478,2626.283,Do you have any idea of what percentage of these situations are dealt within the suit in the state court as compared with making a reinstatement in the union conditioned upon payment of the fine?
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2642.135,2657.139,"Well, I think that Court collectible fines are not the major form of union discipline."
1972.71-1417,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2657.139,2679.108,"Well, as a practical matter why would a union go through the trouble of bringing an action in the state court when they have such a simple remedy for collection, namely to say, we won’t reinstate you till you pay the fine -- no lawyer’s fees, no delay, no problems?"
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2679.108,2679.357,"Well, --"
1972.71-1417,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2679.357,2681.361,"That’s really a hypothetical route, isn’t it?"
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2681.361,2720.101,"Well, -- no, it’s not a hypothetical route because there are enough of the cases so that you cannot say that it is an academic matter and as this Court pointed out in Allis-Chalmers with respect to some unions where membership rights don’t mean very much, expulsion is not a very effective remedy for breach of a union rule."
1972.71-1417,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,2729.027,2743.721,"What if the -- what if the union rules required a fine of five times the amount of the wages earned, would you think the Board should not concern itself with that?"
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2750.924,2757.191,"Well, I think the Board’s position is that Congress did not give it that power."
1972.71-1417,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,2768.043,2777.792,"Mr. Come, didn’t we at the time Allis-Chalmers was argued, am I not right there was an amicus who argued in connection with a fine of $20,000?"
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2777.792,2780.487,"Now, that is correct."
1972.71-1417,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2807.911,2813.168,"Mr. Come, it's your position then that it is a matter of power and not of expertise in the Board?"
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2813.168,2814.947,"That is correct, I think --"
1972.71-1417,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,2814.947,2819.546,The Labor Board could handle this if it had the power so to do?
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2819.546,2830.066,"Well, I think that the Courts are more experts in this matter than the Board because they have been handling it for years."
1972.71-1417,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2879.835,2892.901,"Now, Mr. Come, the only reason as I understand that these fines are alleged to be unreasonably high is that they violate 8 (b) (1) (A) of the Act, isn’t that right?"
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2892.901,2893.513,That is correct.
1972.71-1417,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2893.513,2903.073,"Now, what criteria would you suppose that a State Court would apply engaging the reasonableness build on these fines?"
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2903.073,2903.337,Well --
1972.71-1417,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2903.337,2919.579,"The criterion is, whether or not the whole claim is that they were so unreasonable that they violated 8 (b) 1 (A) of the National Labor Relations Act as amended and doesn’t the Labor Board know a good deal more about that Act and the -- your -- the mind run of state trial courts?"
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2919.579,2924.087,"That is correct, if the question were, whether it was a violation of 8 (b) (1) (A)."
1972.71-1417,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2924.087,2925.236,"That is the only question, isn’t it?"
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2925.236,2948.332,"But if I am correct in my submission that Congress did not intend the reasonableness of the amount of a court collectible fine to be a relevant consideration in determining whether the fine is violative of 8 (b) (1) (A), then the fact that it is unreasonable in amount doesn’t make it violate 8 (b) (1) (A))?"
1972.71-1417,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2949.576,2949.783,What?
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2949.783,2951.332,State common law --
1972.71-1417,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2951.332,2966.557,"What -- what possibly could violate in the law if the -- if after due process or the union procedures, a fine of X dollars was levied and under Allis-Chalmers that could be collected in a state court."
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,2985.082,2994.404,"But if we are sustained in our view that this does not violate 8 (b) (1) (A), it will then have to go to the state court in --"
1972.71-1417,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2994.404,2995.402,What criterion?
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3005.162,3027.545,"Well, but the defense that the employees are -- will be asserting in the state court cases or suits that have been brought to collect the fine, will raise the issue that it -- that the fine is inequitable or usurious or unreasonable while under state --"
1972.71-1417,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3027.545,3031.318,That has nothing to do with usury?
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3031.318,3046.491,All I know Your Honor is that there are a number of state court cases in which the question of the reasonable -- unreasonableness of the fine has been raised as a defense to suits to collect fines --
1972.71-1417,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3046.491,3062.854,"What measure -- what measure is the Court and we are assuming by hypothesis, by assumption, this was a due process union, internal union procedure that resulted in the imposition of a fine of X dollars."
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3081.935,3086.199,"Your Honor, I hate to be repeating myself, but --"
1972.71-1417,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3086.199,3088.909,"Well, I'm repeating myself too."
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3088.909,3095.608,I submit that the state court would not be deciding this question under the Act.
1972.71-1417,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3095.608,3097.393,"Well, what would it be deciding it under that?"
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3097.393,3109.235,"It would be deciding whether or not to fine a man, to use the Chief Justice’s example, were five times his --"
1972.71-1417,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3109.235,3109.87,His what?
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3109.87,3114.02,Strike earnings violates --
1972.71-1417,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3114.02,3114.326,"What, violates what?"
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3114.326,3116.201,State law --
1972.71-1417,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3116.201,3120.037,"(Inaudible) consideration, its own notions of labor policy in making that determination?"
1972.71-1417,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3120.037,3124.035,Yes.
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3124.035,3133.445,"With respect to this issue, it would if it is not a matter that is for the Board to consider under section 8 (b) (1) (A) of the statute --"
1972.71-1417,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3133.445,3155.034,I find it's hard to square with prior arguments the Board has made on preemption in this Court when we have state court's undertaking to restrain a union on even grounds that it’s necessary to control violence and damage to property.
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3167.321,3171.907,"Not with respect to violence Your Honor, it depends upon whether or not --"
1972.71-1417,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3171.907,3177.681,We are confronted with the arguments frequently even in claims of violence?
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3177.681,3196.079,"Well, let me see if I can just outline very briefly the considerations that we think leads to the conclusion that we do not have power to get into the reasonableness of the amount of the fine."
1972.71-1417,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3223.547,3243.978,"That's so Mr. Come, but didn’t we also cited, looking at 195 of the Allis-Chalmers opinion, whether 8 (b) (1) (A) proscribes arbitrary imposition of fines or punishment for disobedience of a fiat of a union leader are matters not presented by this case on which you express no view."
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3249.511,3259.913,"I thought I indicated that the Court did not decide that question, I'm just trying to show you and explain why --"
1972.71-1417,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3259.913,3265.966,Perhaps I misunderstand -- I thought the Board was relying primarily on Allis-Chalmers -- the Court its position.
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3265.966,3272.048,We’re relying on the reasoning of Allis-Chalmers.
1972.71-1417,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3277.825,3286.62,"Well, that suggests that the use of the word reasonable perhaps suggested that if we are unreasonable we might have had a different case, didn't we, under 8 (b) (1) (A)?"
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3286.62,3289.272,You left it open as we read it.
1972.71-1417,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3438.805,3454.135,"Well, what you’re saying I gather Mr. Come is that Congress wanted the Board to stay out of the internal affairs of unions and to get into the question of the reasonableness of a fine is to get your neck into the question of union -- internal union affairs not violates the Congressional policy?"
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3454.135,3456.428,"That is correct, Your Honor."
1972.71-1417,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3456.428,3461.705,But it’s alright for a state court to get its arm into that?
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3461.705,3496.416,"Because Congress and this Court too in both Allis-Chalmers and Scofield pointed out that the extent that Congress has not gotten into this area and it was a very limited intrusion, the matter of union discipline is a matter for the state courts where it was traditionally and has been traditionally handled."
1972.71-1417,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3497.603,3507.347,"State courts often when they thought union membership discipline was too harsh, they’ve taken steps to set it aside, is that it?"
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3507.347,3527.015,"That is correct Your Honor and I submit that if you get in on the reasonableness of the fine, there is no way that you can rationally stop getting, having the Board inquire into the fairness of the procedure followed in imposing the fine."
1972.71-1417,1,15045,harry_a_blackmun,scotus_justice,3546.0,3558.351,"Mr. Come in this case as I recall, the trial examiner did determine what he felt were factors entering into the reasonableness of these fines, did he not?"
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3558.351,3579.76,The trial examiner did and he came up with the conclusion that a fine that was more than 35% of straight-time earnings and more than 80% of overtime earnings would be unreasonable.
1972.71-1417,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3699.315,3730.572,"Mr. Come, if it appeared and apparently we haven’t anything in this record and perhaps none of us have any means of knowing, at this time, but if it appeared that 80% to 90% of all the fines were collected by a restriction that there would be no reinstatement of the union member to membership until he paid his fines leaving only 10% or so to collection in the state courts."
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3747.714,3783.442,"Oh I don't -- I wouldn’t agree with that Your Honor, because I think that even where the only penalty is expulsion from the union or suspension from union membership for failure to pay the fine, you will find suits where the individual would contest the reasonableness of the fine or the fairness of the --"
1972.71-1417,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,3783.442,3786.159,Where would he contest it?
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3786.159,3819.267,"In the state court because if he is being deprived of his membership in the union, that is a valuable right, and in many cases may affect his job and I didn’t mean to suggest that the only court suits attacking the fairness of union discipline are those where the union seeks to enforce a fine, that bring suits to contest the other forms of discipline as well."
1972.71-1417,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3819.267,3825.578,"Mr. Come, you said a moment ago that you thought this matter should be left in the first instance to the state court."
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3829.934,3832.982,"If I did Your Honor, I misspoke myself."
1972.71-1417,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,3861.327,3864.784,"But the question of exhaustion, I think, would be a matter of state law?"
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3868.058,3869.812,"That is correct, that is correct."
1972.71-1417,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3869.812,3891.613,"Mr. Come, is it then basically your position that an extremely high fine, an unreasonably high fine, however, one might define, let’s begin with the assumption that it’s an unreasonably high fine, would simply not be a violation of 8 (b) (1) (A), is that it?"
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3891.613,3894.924,"Yes, Your Honor."
1972.71-1417,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3896.196,3904.402,"A hundred thousand dollar fine on somebody who worked for two days would not be a violation of anything in the National Labor Relations Act, is that right?"
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3904.402,3904.84,Yes Your Honor.
1972.71-1417,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3904.84,3905.652,Is that your position?
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3905.652,3933.11,"Yes it is Your Honor and I would like to if I might -- you know I'm going over for a moment, point out that everyone seems to agree that if that $10,000 fine is merely enforced by suspension or expulsion from union membership the proviso, the Section 8 (b) (1) (A) would clearly take it outside of the --"
1972.71-1417,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3933.11,3934.91,On acquisition or retention?
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3934.91,3936.257,That is correct.
1972.71-1417,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3953.413,3956.77,But I still would not --
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3956.77,3960.125,Not as a violation of 8 (b) (1) (A).
1972.71-1417,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3960.125,3962.258,But that was the only claim in this case?
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3962.258,3972.475,"That is right, but all that means is that if we win here, they will not be able to charge it’s a violation of 8 (b) (1) (A)."
1972.71-1417,1,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3976.856,3977.78,Oh yeah.
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,3977.78,3982.376,It might violate the Landrum-Griffin I don’t --
1972.71-1417,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,3982.376,4002.129,"And it’s your -- well, it’s -- I’ve understood you just say that it’s your position that an extremely, grossly, unreasonably high fine by assumption violates nothing in the National Labor Relations Act as amended."
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,4003.197,4007.225,"Nothing in, it does not violate Section 8 (b) (1) (A), yes."
1972.71-1417,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4007.225,4009.248,"Well, you say the Board has no jurisdiction?"
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,4009.248,4010.114,That is correct.
1972.71-1417,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4010.24,4015.247,So it must mean that doesn’t violate anything in the act that Board is charged with enforcing?
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,4015.247,4023.045,"I just wanted to point out that when I talked about the Landrum-Griffin Act, I'm talking about Title I which gives you remedies --"
1972.71-1417,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4023.045,4023.563,In court.
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,4023.563,4024.259,In court --
1972.71-1417,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,4024.259,4024.446,Right.
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,4024.446,4027.44,-- the Board has no connection.
1972.71-1417,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4027.44,4038.662,"A suit by the union against a member or the former member, in state court as a member, raising to the defense."
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,4056.013,4059.628,"Well, if the Board is sustained here in our position here --"
1972.71-1417,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4059.628,4068.016,What then is power to rule on that?
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,4068.016,4071.761,"As to whether or not the matter would be preempted or not, yeah."
1972.71-1417,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4071.761,4076.737,Does it have power to rule?
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,4079.93,4082.027,Yes.
1972.71-1417,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4082.027,4086.042,So it's supposed to rule that this does not violate the 8 (b) (1) (A).
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,4086.042,4097.381,"That’s right, but, of course, it would be applying a decision why this Court which would define what the rules are that govern the application of 8 (b) (1) (A)."
1972.71-1417,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4097.381,4098.897,Very comfortably --
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,4098.897,4100.947,"Well, if we don’t --"
1972.71-1417,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4100.947,4101.984,You don't (Inaudible)
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,4101.984,4102.899,If we have access --
1972.71-1417,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4102.899,4112.439,-- the rule that -- if the Board decides this case in so many words that doesn’t make any difference under the (Inaudible) it ever violated 8 (b) (1) (A).
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,4112.439,4114.318,"Yes, though, what the Board did was --"
1972.71-1417,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4114.318,4116.589,You say it didn't have any power?
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,4116.589,4125.386,"Well, it said that it had no power to determine and a fine was violative of 8 (b) (1) (A) merely because of --"
1972.71-1417,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4125.386,4130.786,"What if we disagree with that and that the state we do think has the power, couldn't we send it back and ask it to decide?"
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,4130.786,4138.319,"Oh, yes, I think -- well, what the Court of Appeals --"
1972.71-1417,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4138.319,4142.955,(Inaudible)
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,4142.955,4151.008,"Well, I don’t know that we are talking about the same thing here."
1972.71-1417,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4186.267,4189.273,Is that a piece of statutory instructional to the Board of what is that --
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,4189.273,4189.622,Yes.
1972.71-1417,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4189.622,4194.455,"The Board's instruction of the act or you would say, is it something, the ultimate power?"
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,4194.455,4215.109,It’s the Board's construction of the Act reached for the reasons that Mr. Justice Brennan summarized a moment ago that in order to effectuate Congress’ intention to keep the Board out of the area of internal union affairs.
1972.71-1417,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4215.787,4218.641,How about the Board?
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,4222.471,4223.676,Yes --
1972.71-1417,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,4223.676,4230.748,If you’re supposed to stay out and not decide what would violate 8 (b) (1) (A)?
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,4230.748,4246.852,"The Court can stay in it as it was before 8 (b) (1) (A) was enacted, not determining whether it violates 8 (b) (1) (A), but whether it violates state law, that would be the question."
1972.71-1417,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4246.852,4247.689,Mr. Come.
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,4247.689,4248.339,Yes Your Honor.
1972.71-1417,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4248.339,4252.968,As the Board consistently adhere to the position you take the today?
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,4252.968,4253.937,"Yes, Your Honor --"
1972.71-1417,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4253.937,4256.235,Would it get in its administrative adaptation of the Act?
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,4256.235,4257.337,"Yes, it has Your Honor."
1972.71-1417,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4264.562,4276.371,"Could you give any rough estimate of how many opportunities that it had to take that position, can you tell me in terms of two, three or four or dozens?"
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,4276.371,4280.584,"Well, there have been dozen of cases."
1972.71-1417,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4280.584,4283.417,"And the Board has simply said, we have no jurisdiction?"
1972.71-1417,1,37058,norton_j_come,,4283.417,4284.379,No power.
1972.71-1417,1,15119,lewis_f_powell_jr,scotus_justice,4284.379,4297.685,No power.
1972.71-1417,1,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4297.685,4298.933,Mr. Lang.
1972.71-1417,2,41689,samuel_lang,,4298.933,4306.646,Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
1972.71-1417,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,4469.762,4479.316,"What evidence Mr. Lang, do you point to in the record other than the fact that a 119 more or less employees went back to work?"
1972.71-1417,2,41689,samuel_lang,,4483.86,4491.668,"There is none in this record here sir, but the jurisdiction attaches with the allegation."
1972.71-1417,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5308.035,5321.778,"Mr. Lang, under your theory supposing a court were to agree with you and after we decide the case, a Union brings an action to collective fine in the state court, can the state court entertained that action?"
1972.71-1417,2,41689,samuel_lang,,5321.778,5356.583,"I think that as in -- I'm not sure of the answer, but I would say that at the very least once the Board decides that the fine is reasonable, it could be enforced in the same manner in which a -- well, that decision would be binding upon the state court for collections since the Board itself has no collection powers, it can’t, it can’t tell an employee to pay the fine, I don’t know maybe it has very broad remedial powers."
1972.71-1417,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5398.019,5407.339,"So, Union would almost be forced to first bring an action before the Board to get a kind of a declaratory judgment that the fine was reasonable before it could go into state --"
1972.71-1417,2,41689,samuel_lang,,5407.339,5415.895,"It wouldn’t be the Union that would bring the action, it would be the individual who is fined, who could go counsel free without the heavy expense of having to go into court."
1972.71-1417,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5421.741,5430.061,"But supposing he doesn’t do that, supposing the Union simply brings the action in state court without any prior proceedings on the point before the Board --"
1972.71-1417,2,41689,samuel_lang,,5430.061,5434.558,"Then I think that the Court would have to say, we don’t have jurisdiction it must go to the Board."
1972.71-1417,2,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,5434.558,5440.873,"Well, so then as a practical matter if the Union wants to collect its fine, it’s got to first go to the Board and then to the state court?"
1972.71-1417,2,41689,samuel_lang,,5440.873,5448.056,"In one way or another, yes sir."
1972.71-1417,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5448.056,5457.175,The Court of Appeals of course dealing with the discriminatory situation you have mentioned with all who has have review power.
1972.71-1417,2,41689,samuel_lang,,5457.175,5458.393,Yes sir.
1972.71-1417,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5458.393,5492.469,"And I suppose when you refer to a discriminatory situation that if out of the 119 people involved here, they had admittedly reasonable fines as to 110 of them, but picked out nine and had much larger fines, then Board should review a claim that they were being subject to a discriminatory fine because they were the leaders of the Return To Work movement or something of that kind."
1972.71-1417,2,41689,samuel_lang,,5494.562,5495.763,Yes sir.
1972.71-1417,2,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5547.293,5548.279,Thank you Mr. Lang.
1972.71-1417,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,5559.766,5562.062,I will be delighted Your Honor.
1972.71-1417,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5562.062,5576.553,"I suppose there are somewhere between 1000 and 2500 courts of general jurisdictions in the systems of the 50 States, but in any event it’s a very large number."
1972.71-1417,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,5595.629,5597.315,It doesn’t open the area Your Honor.
1972.71-1417,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5627.356,5639.913,"How many of your particular Union here, your clients in the past year or in any year, how many cases got into the state courts on strikebreaking fine?"
1972.71-1417,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,5639.913,5642.864,"I can’t say Your Honor, I have no idea how many got in."
1972.71-1417,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5840.136,5846.735,What body of law will the court apply to do what you say it inevitably will do?
1972.71-1417,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,5848.948,5864.512,"That in the interpretation of the constitution between a Union and his member part of that constitution says, that a Union will not arbitrarily impose discipline and unreasonably large fine is the arbitrarily imposition of discipline."
1972.71-1417,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5868.477,5869.883,Equity or --
1972.71-1417,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,5869.883,5873.343,"Certainly, Your Honor, equity."
1972.71-1417,3,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,5873.343,5878.128,"Would this going to be suit for money damages, it is not inequity (Voice Overlap) --"
1972.71-1417,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,5878.128,5884.94,"I suppose that most courts have combined equity in lower courts, but I don’t care about that."
1972.71-1417,3,15104,thurgood_marshall,scotus_justice,5884.94,5891.423,But isn’t the answer as exact saying common law that that state applied before the enactment of the federal law?
1972.71-1417,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,5891.423,5906.336,"Exactly, Your Honor and the whole purpose aside from saying, you can’t have any restraint or coercion out of an unreasonable fine that you don’t have out of reasonable fine because the whole purpose of a reasonable fine is to say, you will not engage in strikebreaking."
1972.71-1417,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,5939.83,5957.962,Do you think then it’s better -- it’s more cohesive and consistent with the whole history of the Labor Act to have the courts of 50 different states doing this instead of one policy by the Board itself?
1972.71-1417,3,17581,bernard_dunau,,5957.962,5970.844,"Let me answer that question Your Honor by telling the Court precisely what happened in David O'Reilly which is the case in which the Board said, it had no power and that has no power because it’s not a violation of Section 8 (b) 1 (A)."
1972.71-1417,3,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,6161.982,6162.729,Thank you gentlemen.
