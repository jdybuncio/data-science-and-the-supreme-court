1980.79-855,0,15073,warren_e_burger,scotus_justice,0.0,7.717,We will hear arguments next in Diamond v. Bradley.
1980.79-855,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,82.093,91.947,Mr. Justice Brennan and may it please the Court:
1980.79-855,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,252.054,255.866,Do you think that the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals declined to follow Flook?
1980.79-855,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,255.866,265.113,I think it has differed with the interpretation of Section 101 that this Court adopted in Flook.
1980.79-855,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,265.113,267.736,"Well, it didn't... at least it didn't purport to depart from Flook."
1980.79-855,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,267.736,275.122,"It has a different explanation for the result in Flook, which brings about--"
1980.79-855,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,275.122,276.45,Different from yours; different from yours.
1980.79-855,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,276.45,277.591,"--Different from ours, and different--"
1980.79-855,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,277.591,279.247,Not necessarily different from ours.
1980.79-855,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,279.247,283.12,"--Well, this is fairly debatable."
1980.79-855,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,283.12,284.978,"Well, that's what this case is about, isn't it?"
1980.79-855,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,284.978,296.583,But the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals has written at some length about why it thought that the Court's reading of Section 101 in Flook was erroneous.
1980.79-855,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,340.753,341.55,Yes.
1980.79-855,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,346.703,348.062,"Of course, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-855,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,367.71,371.224,"Mr. Wallace, I didn't understand the Respondent to ask us to reexamine Flook."
1980.79-855,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,371.224,375.723,I don't believe that has been put to the Court.
1980.79-855,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,498.907,501.921,"Isn't ""novelty"" covered by another section of the Act?"
1980.79-855,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,501.921,507.747,That was precisely the position of the dissenting opinion in Flook.
1980.79-855,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,510.324,512.199,"Well, it's true."
1980.79-855,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,512.199,514.245,--by Section 102 of the Patent Code.
1980.79-855,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,514.855,519.65,"Dissenting opinions, as I was taught in law school, are subversive literature; nothing more or less."
1980.79-855,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,525.46,525.929,It certainly is.
1980.79-855,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,529.864,540.093,"Mr. Wallace, is it that the remainder of the application is to be examined to determine whether there is novelty or to determine whether anything else novel is claimed?"
1980.79-855,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,540.093,545.685,"The latter formulation is the more accurate one, Mr. Justice."
1980.79-855,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,545.685,548.606,"And that's why the dissent... that's a point the dissent missed in Flook, isn't it?"
1980.79-855,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,558.243,560.07,That is true.
1980.79-855,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1039.97,1044.516,"Well, is that the same, Mr. Wallace... is this patent only on the firmware module?"
1980.79-855,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1050.171,1054.699,"The claim is on the whole machine, using the firmware, but--"
1980.79-855,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1054.699,1058.667,--switching operation from main memory to switchback registers?
1980.79-855,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1058.667,1062.744,"--Through this method, through the described method, and the contribution--"
1980.79-855,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1062.744,1063.805,Is that what the patent covers?
1980.79-855,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1063.805,1065.352,--That's what the claim is.
1980.79-855,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1065.352,1067.101,Not merely the firmware module?
1980.79-855,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1067.101,1082.689,Not merely the firmware but the claim is on the whole machine and as fixed up with this firmware to transfer the information within the existing computer.
1980.79-855,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1082.689,1100.463,"Mr. Wallace, under your previous argument which you had just left at the time Justice Brennan asked you that question, would an electric typewriter not be patentable because of the existence of a typewriter that you punch by keys under 101?"
1980.79-855,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1100.463,1115.644,"I don't think the previous patent would necessarily preclude a patent there, because you're dealing with a different machine."
1980.79-855,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1134.777,1136.917,"But then, that would be under another section."
1980.79-855,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1136.917,1138.182,--Probably under another section.
1980.79-855,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1159.064,1170.045,"Mr. Wallace, you do then concede that the patent claims the words ""data structure"" describe a machine?"
1980.79-855,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1170.045,1178.979,"Well, this is the argument being made by the respondents."
1980.79-855,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1213.122,1218.416,"Do the words ""data structure"" have any recognized meaning?"
1980.79-855,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1225.883,1230.115,I don't know of any accepted meaning for it.
1980.79-855,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1486.872,1489.651,"We'll resume there at 1 o'clock, Mr. Wallace."
1980.79-855,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1505.177,1507.019,"--Thank you, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1980.79-855,0,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,1639.264,1641.825,"Mr. Wallace, can I ask one question before you sit down?"
1980.79-855,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1688.369,1717.403,"Well, in our presentation in this Court we're not going back to the claims ab initio, but we're relying on the findings of the Board of Appeals that while the claims are cast as a claim on a machine, the only thing new in the claims in light of the prior art is the microprogramming to be inserted into the control unit."
1980.79-855,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1751.438,1755.155,"Well, Mr. Wallace, this gets back, I guess, to the question I asked you, wasn't it, earlier?"
1980.79-855,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1761.888,1768.791,"The claims are put more broadly, but that is where the novelty inheres in the claims."
1980.79-855,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1774.335,1778.068,"But that's never been passed on, I thought?"
1980.79-855,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1778.068,1784.846,"Well, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals didn't differ with it, it didn't uphold that either."
1980.79-855,0,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,1789.814,1795.047,But didn't it say that the issues of novelty and obviousness remain to be considered?
1980.79-855,0,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,1795.047,1796.998,"Yes, yes."
1980.79-855,0,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,1801.794,1814.273,Mr. Prasinos.
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,1814.273,1816.929,"Mr. Justice Brennan, may it please the Court:"
1980.79-855,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2012.695,2025.593,"Before you get to your analysis, Mr. Prasinos, because I have trouble getting into analogies, Judge Rich described the two advantages of your... your machine relates to, what do you call it, reinitializing the--"
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2025.593,2027.827,--That's a portion of the computer machine.
1980.79-855,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2027.827,2035.356,"--The two difficulties before, as I understand it, were that sometimes you have to pull an awful lot of switches and it's time-consuming when you void it--"
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2035.356,2036.324,Right.
1980.79-855,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2036.324,2039.776,"--Or secondly, you have to use software that is what they say, model-dependent."
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2039.776,2040.651,"Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-855,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2040.651,2046.664,"As I understood it, that meant that the problem was you could only use that software for one kind of model."
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2046.664,2047.696,Yes.
1980.79-855,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2047.696,2055.473,"Now, as I understand it, your description of this invention, it describes hardware that only fits in one model."
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2058.863,2082.619,"What it does, that language in the beginning, in the summary, was amended in the very first portion, and it's on the record in here, where ""model-dependent"" was stricken out and additional language was written in which in effect made it clear that what it did is provided different independent models to the computer."
1980.79-855,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2094.864,2099.299,Is the invention claimed in this patent model-dependent?
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2106.453,2108.123,"No, it is not."
1980.79-855,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2109.842,2113.574,"Well, then, it's not a permanent part of any given model of the machine?"
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2113.574,2118.26,"--It is a permanent part of this computer, the Level 64 computer machine, Your Honor."
1980.79-855,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2186.187,2195.852,"But that's for a given machine, and as I understand the prior art, if you had the right software for a particular machine, you could have done that before this invention."
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2195.852,2197.931,"The problem is that this is not software, Your Honor."
1980.79-855,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2200.773,2204.693,"But how is it an advance over the software, is what I don't understand?"
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2204.693,2207.647,"It is hardware, Your Honor."
1980.79-855,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2287.535,2294.001,Was there software available before your invention for reinitializing particular models of machines?
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2294.001,2297.374,"--Yes, it was; yes, it was, Your Honor."
1980.79-855,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2297.374,2301.421,"Well, that's the kind of software that would be analogous to your invention, I guess?"
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2301.421,2301.702,What's that?
1980.79-855,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2304.857,2320.46,Is there some particular rule applicable to patents that pertain to the computer industry that is different from the rules that pertain to every other kind of industry?
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2320.46,2323.583,"No, Your Honor, it is not."
1980.79-855,1,15141,william_h_rehnquist,scotus_justice,2339.061,2348.386,What is it in 101 that the examiner can kind of turn away at the door?
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2365.784,2366.925,No.
1980.79-855,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2370.174,2377.421,"Well, if the inventor came in, or the applicant came in and said, I've invented vacuum, what happens when there's a vacuum?"
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2377.421,2378.327,"--Yes, Your Honor."
1980.79-855,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2378.327,2383.434,"That would not be patentable, any more than an applicant who came in and said, I've invented the law of gravity."
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2386.746,2388.994,"I didn't hear the first part, Your Honor."
1980.79-855,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2388.994,2391.369,"Well, it was a question."
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2405.785,2411.033,"Your Honors, it's combination of elements that are patentable."
1980.79-855,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2411.033,2411.47,Right; correct.
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2411.47,2415.78,The scientific principle itself is not patentable.
1980.79-855,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2415.78,2416.686,Exactly.
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2416.686,2430.602,"It is a discovery, it has always existed, and in that form a person that comes in and says, I have discovered a basic, fundamental principle cannot get a patent on that."
1980.79-855,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2440.207,2456.873,"When a machine is a combination of elements, the mere fact that one element is the law of gravity or the operation of the law of gravity does not make the machine unpatentable per se, does not make a machine ineligible under 101."
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2457.373,2457.966,--That's right.
1980.79-855,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2473.289,2473.664,Right.
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2484.627,2490.687,"Your Honor, there is not novelty involved in 35 U.S.C. 101."
1980.79-855,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2490.687,2491.609,I didn't say that.
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2510.477,2511.789,"No, Your Honor."
1980.79-855,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2553.037,2561.379,"Well, then you should have... why didn't you answer my question and say, yes, the novelty must exist in something besides the unpatentable element?"
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2562.924,2563.392,"It exists in the combination, Your Honor."
1980.79-855,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2563.392,2564.251,"Well, all right."
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2564.251,2566.439,"It exists in the combination, not any one element."
1980.79-855,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2566.439,2572.358,"But the novelty cannot be, cannot solely exist in the unpatentable element."
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2572.358,2575.778,"But novelty is not an issue under 35 U.S.C. 1O1, Your Honor."
1980.79-855,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2575.778,2576.59,I understand that.
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2582.994,2583.291,Yes.
1980.79-855,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2583.291,2589.367,"Supposing a patent application said in substance as follows, we have a new machine."
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2606.109,2613.966,"I can't visualize that particular situation, but I would like to say--"
1980.79-855,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2613.966,2628.663,"Say that had not been a process claim but they'd said, we have a computer programmed to solve this equation, updating our alarm limits and all that, and the only thing new about it is it has this particular program on the machine, and we're asking for a patent on the machine as opposed to the process."
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2628.663,2632.428,--I think the decisions of this Court applied.
1980.79-855,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2645.265,2657.51,"You'd say that if the precise invention described in the Parker v. Flook case had been described in terms of a machine which will do these things instead of a process, then it would have been patentable subject matter?"
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2657.51,2658.214,"No; no, Your Honor."
1980.79-855,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2659.838,2662.633,So then the distinction between a machine and a process can't be critical?
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2662.633,2676.067,"The distinction is that a process, Your Honor, changes something to a different state of thing."
1980.79-855,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2676.067,2677.643,"Well, a machine can do that too."
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2677.643,2688.747,"Yes, but, for example, a process, you take steel, you take iron, you heat it to a given temperature, you put it in cold water, that changes it to a different state of thing."
1980.79-855,1,15060,john_paul_stevens,scotus_justice,2697.057,2699.837,"Well, process can be a combination of elements."
1980.79-855,1,37258,nicholas_prasinos,,2699.837,2708.911,"It's a series of steps, Your Honor, a process is, for performing a... changing something to a different state of thing."
1980.79-855,2,35240,lawrence_g_wallace,,2960.983,2962.015,"Just briefly, Mr. Justice Brennan."
1980.79-855,2,15140,william_j_brennan_jr,scotus_justice,3120.746,3122.137,"Thank you, Mr. Wallace."
