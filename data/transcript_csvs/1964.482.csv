1964.482,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,0.0,39.891,"Number 482, Federal Communications Commission, Petitioner, versus Taft B. Schreiber, et al."
1964.482,0,29903,john_w_douglas,,46.136,51.526,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.482,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,195.251,200.756,"MCA had been the defendant in an antitrust action earlier, had it?"
1964.482,0,29903,john_w_douglas,,207.081,207.792,That's right.
1964.482,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,219.256,219.268,Right.
1964.482,0,29903,john_w_douglas,,219.268,225.171,-- decree in which the MCA decided to get out of the talent agency business.
1964.482,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,225.171,227.511,"But at this time, they were in both?"
1964.482,0,29903,john_w_douglas,,227.511,228.843,"This time, they were in both."
1964.482,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,228.843,232.541,But I suppose that's not very relevant to this.
1964.482,0,29903,john_w_douglas,,232.541,239.451,"Well think it is, in the sense that -- the anti-trust suit is not particularly relevant."
1964.482,0,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,242.751,246.655,That was one of the things that the investigation was about?
1964.482,0,29903,john_w_douglas,,246.655,262.737,"It was one the things the investigation was about, the extent to which the production of television programs and the authentication of them tied in with the talent agency business."
1964.482,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,513.001,533.251,"Mr. Douglas, before you move into (Inaudible) at this point, I've read this (Inaudible), how does the regulations and the provision under the investigatory procedure (Inaudible) the person involved in (Inaudible) is entitled to counsel."
1964.482,0,29903,john_w_douglas,,533.251,535.252,"Yes, he is entitled to counsel."
1964.482,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,535.252,542.428,But what would be the (Inaudible) entitled to counsel (Inaudible)--
1964.482,0,29903,john_w_douglas,,542.428,544.073,It's our view --
1964.482,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,544.073,571.046,"I gather the record is (Inaudible) investigatory procedures, (Inaudible) and you said that the counsel could make (Inaudible) result with this counsel that, he happen to have the permission (Inaudible)."
1964.482,0,29903,john_w_douglas,,612.699,613.614,Your Honor --
1964.482,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,613.614,618.467,(Inaudible)
1964.482,0,29903,john_w_douglas,,618.467,630.082,That is not the procedure which the Commission follows now and it's not the procedure which could be followed under the relief which we're requesting here insofar as future testimony is concerned.
1964.482,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,648.773,655.414,You are not challenging therefore the order which implied the procedure of this (Inaudible)?
1964.482,0,29903,john_w_douglas,,655.414,658.325,"No, we're not challenging that part of the order."
1964.482,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,658.325,671.285,"And in this case if we have to assume your reflection and whatever further proceedings that began in this case, I take it what it says in other cases as well?"
1964.482,0,29903,john_w_douglas,,675.509,679.375,That's correct in accepting your view of what the counsel should do –-
1964.482,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,679.375,681.354,(Inaudible)
1964.482,0,29903,john_w_douglas,,681.354,681.922,Now --
1964.482,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,681.922,686.731,(Inaudible)
1964.482,0,29903,john_w_douglas,,686.731,696.789,"In all candor, I'd like to make this one caveat and that is with respect to Annex A."
1964.482,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,923.524,937.455,"Mr. Douglas, this -- is there any review under your theory, a judicial review of the Commission's determination under its own regulations about keeping things confidential?"
1964.482,0,29903,john_w_douglas,,937.455,938.289,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.482,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,938.289,939.204,And how would that be?
1964.482,0,29903,john_w_douglas,,961.595,965.381,"Well, he can decline to answer, Your Honor, as he did here."
1964.482,0,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,973.821,987.64,"That relates back within to the question I asked you earlier, if this counsel never had a chance and the layman or himself was required and willing to argue his reasons for confidentiality."
1964.482,0,29903,john_w_douglas,,1001.246,1005.271,"I think after five years Your Honor, it's very ripe."
1964.482,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1086.886,1095.985,"At this point, I take it that as far as the Annex is concerned, Mr. Douglas, the case is over as far as that's concerned."
1964.482,0,29903,john_w_douglas,,1106.958,1108.978,That's correct.
1964.482,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1112.069,1115.259,"The testimony is otherwise, as far as testimony --"
1964.482,0,29903,john_w_douglas,,1115.259,1115.639,That's right.
1964.482,0,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,1545.231,1547.977,We'll recess now.
1964.482,0,29903,john_w_douglas,,1552.196,1562.91,"Before the luncheon recess, I may have confused the Court with respect to the difference between Annex A and Annex B."
1964.482,0,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,1679.006,1697.843,(Inaudible) no showing about the confidential (Inaudible) Annex B?
1964.482,0,29903,john_w_douglas,,1697.843,1699.704,"Annex A was turned over, Your Honor."
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,1941.81,1945.561,"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court."
1964.482,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2114.793,2126.564,"It would be -- it would be though under Judge Yankwich's honor, the burden of showing that this should be made public would be upon the Commission, would it not?"
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,2126.564,2127.356,"No, You Honor."
1964.482,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2141.481,2143.979,"Now, the Commission would be the moving party?"
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,2143.979,2144.267,Correct.
1964.482,1,15043,potter_stewart,scotus_justice,2144.267,2147.876,It would be up to them to show good cause and isn't that the burden of proof?
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,2147.876,2155.583,"Well, as I say, it's susceptible perhaps to that interpretation, but that, I don't think was what he had in mind."
1964.482,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2418.573,2426.119,Wasn't that the purpose of the -- of the investigation to -- to see if there was anything wrong?
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,2439.611,2441.259,"No, Your Honor."
1964.482,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2444.22,2444.5,What was the purpose?
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,2444.5,2447.233,"At least, that wasn't the announced purpose."
1964.482,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2486.455,2491.519,"Well, they weren't -- they weren't interested in looking for shortcomings."
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,2504.82,2509.468,"I think it was -- again, it may have been one of the purposes."
1964.482,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2509.468,2510.177,I beg your pardon?
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,2510.177,2516.062,"I say, it may have been one of the purposes to try to develop some indication of wrongdoing on somebody --"
1964.482,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2516.062,2522.007,Not to develop a wrongdoing but to determine whether there was any wrongdoing or not.
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,2522.007,2523.78,"Well, perhaps as I say --"
1964.482,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,2523.78,2528.195,"If that was their purpose, why couldn't they ask questions about it?"
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,2528.195,2544.868,"Well, first of all, Your Honor please, I feel that the -- that the enabling orders were basically designed to bring out on an informational basis how it worked rather than to establish any wrongdoing on anybody's part."
1964.482,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2615.051,2646.431,"Mr. Susman, in the record at page 11, there's a recital by the Commission that their hearings encompass are the testimony and other evidence concerning the activities, policies, and practices of a number of Hollywood-centered television production companies, talent agencies, talent representatives, program packagers, and/or representatives, West Coast representatives, the National Association of Broadcasters, etcetera."
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,2670.013,2673.544,"Justice Goldberg, maybe I didn't make myself clear."
1964.482,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2696.734,2705.526,You mean that (Inaudible) by not cooperating in the investigation arouse a certain amount of understandable suspicion?
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,2705.526,2711.171,"Well, I don't know what the reason was."
1964.482,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,2727.988,2729.983,Could you -- could you enlighten us?
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,2753.491,2754.297,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.482,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2882.464,2884.315,Go on and finish that then I want to ask you a question.
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,2884.315,2885.061,That's alright.
1964.482,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2886.422,2896.786,Do you draw any distinction or would you draw any distinction between the powers here in connection with an investigation of an adversary nature?
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,2927.164,2931.056,"If a subject were at large, Your Honor, I would not, I think."
1964.482,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2955.192,2967.934,"Well, are they different in an investigatory proceeding by an agent who is selected by Congress on whether they would be in a legislative committee investigating the same thing for precisely the same purpose?"
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,2967.934,2968.47,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.482,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,2999.673,2999.815,Are you talking --
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,2999.815,3000.67,-- you can equate–
1964.482,1,15089,hugo_l_black,scotus_justice,3000.67,3005.111,Are talking from the standpoint of legislation?
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,3014.636,3019.317,"I think I'm speaking in both areas, Your Honor."
1964.482,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,3148.003,3157.517,"Well then, have the other witnesses done anything to provoke a threat such as this?"
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,3157.517,3172.105,"The only -- there were several other witnesses Your Honor, who took the same approach I think based on the lead of MCA in this particular matter, legal approach."
1964.482,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3582.285,3586.546,"Well, Mr. Susman, isn't there a fundamental difference though?"
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,3687.557,3690.414,That's the position expressed by Mr. Douglas.
1964.482,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3691.598,3693.29,But how does it differ?
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,3719.149,3719.65,I might point --
1964.482,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3719.65,3721.429,Am I wrong about that?
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,3721.429,3726.663,"You're correct, Mr. Justice Goldberg in the way you view it."
1964.482,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,3742.746,3752.137,"Not necessarily, the court -- the District Court might say putting as an alternate procedure which is what I take that the Commission is contending."
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,3779.824,3781.082,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.482,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3858.527,3862.735,"Mr. Susman, how about applying that to Annex B though."
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,3862.735,3863.128,"Yes, sir."
1964.482,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3863.128,3867.872,"That was asked for, it was refused and now it's important."
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,3874.504,3875.447,"Well, the difference --"
1964.482,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3875.447,3877.565,-- until the termination of the hearing?
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,3877.565,3878.049,"Yes, Your Honor."
1964.482,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3889.395,3893.717,"Wait, my question is whether the issue shouldn't be decided now."
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,3897.918,3898.688,"No, Your Honor –-"
1964.482,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3898.688,3908.804,"Now, and the Annex either admitted publicly, or subject to some sort of a confidential rule?"
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,3908.804,3909.381,"No, Your Honor."
1964.482,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3914.504,3915.852,Why -- why not?
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,3915.852,3926.851,Because the questioning hasn't gone to the point where we really know how deeply the Commission intends to delve into it.
1964.482,1,15071,byron_r_white,scotus_justice,3930.444,3931.911,That's a matter of the questioning.
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,3971.373,3971.818,"No, Your Honor."
1964.482,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4006.265,4018.23,"But I don't find Judge Yankwich referring to any discriminatory treatment that you have, and all the things you're talking about being singled out and so on, Judge Yankwich made no findings about it."
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,4040.681,4046.655,"I think he did, Your Honor, but the words that he used was the well-grounded fears --"
1964.482,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4046.655,4048.22,"Well, that's on trade secrets."
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,4060.311,4063.359,I think that's implicit in the finding to which Your Honor just referred --
1964.482,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4063.359,4064.338,(Inaudible)
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,4064.338,4066.241,That one you just read.
1964.482,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4066.825,4079.766,"I read this merely to believe that he thought that you convinced him that if you had a public hearing, that the matters on Schedule B would reveal some trade secret."
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,4090.741,4090.881,Well --
1964.482,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4090.881,4093.082,And that's in inquiry.
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,4093.082,4113.158,"His opinion came before the findings, obviously, and when it came time to the findings, he emphasized the point that he had made in his opinion, which he had put on a suggestion basis rather than an -- in an adjudicatory basis as presented by the later order."
1964.482,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4131.127,4141.442,"Mr. Susman, what did you disclose to Judge Yankwich that made these apparent trade secrets that you did not disclose to the Commission?"
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,4141.442,4148.429,"Well, for one thing, we disclosed Annex B to Judge Yankwich although I don't think that reference appears in the record itself."
1964.482,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4213.2,4225.453,"I'm looking again at your petition for review before Judge Yankwich and I don't find that you've raised this point in the petition, the answer that you filed in the Commission's enforcement procedure."
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,4225.453,4229.549,"Well, let me try to answer the question in another way."
1964.482,1,15044,arthur_j_goldberg,scotus_justice,4277.584,4285.12,"But, isn't the rule of the legal rule is applicable whether the Commission acted arbitrarily in the use of this administrative subpoena?"
1964.482,1,17067,allen_e_susman,,4285.12,4287.193,I don't think the rule is limited to that extent.
1964.482,1,15099,earl_warren,scotus_justice,4345.531,4350.726,Mr. Douglas.
1964.482,2,29903,john_w_douglas,,4350.726,4369.19,"If the Court please, the District Court specifically held that the alleged failure of the Commission to promulgate adequate ground rules to cover the proceeding did not prejudice the respondents, that's conclusion ten on page 128 of the record."
